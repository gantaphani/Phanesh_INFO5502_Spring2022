backgrounda.
a multiemployer pension plan is created when various employers agree to make contributions to a common pension fund on behalf of their respective employees.congress has recognized that the reliability of pension funds is of extreme importance to the workers who rely upon them and of vital importance to the economic and social of the nation.to achieve and maintain the requisite level of financial security,multiemployer pension plans must maintain adequate funding levels to ensure their capacity to fund the benefits of workers who have a legitimate expectation that those funds will be available to meet their needs.the multiemployer pension plan amendments act mppaa or the act,an amendment to erisa,therefore requires that an employer pay withdrawal liability if it withdraws from a multiemployer pension fund.the act provides a mechanism for calculating the amount of withdrawal liability and the schedule according to which it should be paid.see,c.the mechanism calculates the amount of liability to equal the employer proportionate share of the plan unfunded vested benefits the amount of each annual payment is roughly equal to the withdrawing employer typical past contributions.milwaukee brewery workers pension plan schlitz brewing.congress conceived of withdrawal liability as a substitute for the annual payments that an employer would have made had it not withdrawn.cent.states,se.sw.areas pension fund basic am,cir citing milwaukee brewery,at.the statutory mechanism seeks to maintain level funding for the plan,despite the employer withdrawal.milwaukee brewery,at.

to further ensure the financial stability of the plan,the statute specifically provides that,in the event of a default,the pension plan may demand immediate payment of the outstanding amount of withdrawal liability.id.c.the statute provides two definitions of default 
a the failure of an employer to make,when due,any payment under this section,if the failure is not cured within days after the employer receives written notification from the plan sponsor of such failure,and

id.the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc has promulgated a regulation that provides,among other things,that a default as a result of failure to make any payments shall not occur until the day after the issuance of the arbitrator decision.c.
with this description of the underlying statutory scheme in mind,we now shall turn to the facts of the case.
central states administers a multiemployer pension fund.was,until early,one of the employers who contributed to the fund.at that time,however,ceased operations and informed central states that the company was preparing for its termination and liquidation,attach.at.central states deemed this notification a withdrawal furthermore,because was liquidating,central states,acting under the terms of the plan,deemed to be in default and required immediate payment of the entire amount of the withdrawal liability.see c b.
on may,central states sent a letter demanding immediate payment of the entire amount due,attach.at on august,central states sent a second letter that revised upward the amount of withdrawal liability to this increase was due to a revision in the total amount of unfunded vested benefits.
on september,central states filed its original complaint in the district court.it sought an interim payment of the entire amount of the withdrawal liability owed by.then moved for a dismissal or a stay of proceedings pending the outcome of mandatory arbitration.
pretrial proceedings before the district court took several twists and turns.the district court first ordered the complaint amended in order to clarify that central states was,in fact,seeking only interim payment.consequently,did not file an answer until april.one month later,central states moved for summary judgment.
in october,the district court denied summary judgment without prejudice the court stated that the record does not reflect whether company is able to make payments in the form of a payment schedule as opposed to a lump sum payment.at.it ordered central states to offer a feasible payment schedule if central states had not already done so.id.at.in response to this order,on december,central states calculated and submitted a payment schedule,as required by c.under that schedule,the first payment was due on september.
in february,the district court ordered central states to submit another schedule comprised of future due dates central states complied and submitted what was essentially the same schedule,except that payments did not begin until april,one month after the filing was submitted.then filed a response in which it contended that this schedule violated the statute because it called for payments to begin less than days after the schedule was provided.it asked that the schedule be stricken.
on april,the district court granted summary judgment for central states.the court took the view that in effect,ha d rejected the proposed payment schedule,at,and that liquidation presented an immediate and compelling need for company to provide a lump sum payment to plaintiffs at this juncture to protect such funds,id.at.
the parties then filed to alter the judgment.on may,the court granted central states motion,adding interest and liquidated damages to the judgment,bringing the total to.the court denied motion.it rejected the argument that it had entered summary judgment sua sponte because central states original motion had been fully briefed.the court also clarified that central states had provided with a proper demand for payment in compliance with erisa prior to bringing this action,id.at,and that never had notified the court that it accepted the revised payment schedule.
discussiona.
now submits that it had no obligation to pay the entire amount due during the pendency of arbitration.interim payments,contends,are necessarily installment payments,and,even in case of a default,there can be no acceleration until arbitration is complete 
central states,for its part,makes little attempt to defend the district court reasoning.rather,it submits that summary judgment should have been granted when its motion was first filed,before the briefing about a feasible payment schedule.it contends that the default provisions of the statute are separate from the interim payment provisions,and it is the default provisions that operate to allow immediate acceleration.for a default under c b,the kind of default at issue here,acceleration may occur even while arbitration is pending.therefore,central states contends,it is entitled to payment of the entire amount due on an interim basis.
because this case involves important issues in the administration of the erisa statute,we invited the pbgc to file a brief as amicus curiae 
in construing a statute,we must,of course,start with the words of the statute itself.in the opening section of this opinion,we set forth,in broad strokes,the statutory scheme that constitutes the decisional framework for the case before us.now,as we begin our discussion of the parties precise contentions,a more explicit statutory analysis is required.therefore,we return to the statute and focus on the text.
the mppaa ordinarily provides for an employer to pay its withdrawal liability according to a schedule,calculated by the pension fund in accordance with the statutory formula.c.a default,however,has special consequences.as noted earlier,the mppaa provides for two kinds of default and states the consequences of either kind.specifically,c provides 
in the event of a default,a plan sponsor may require immediate payment of the outstanding amount of an employer withdrawal liability,plus accrued interest on the total outstanding liability from the due date of the first payment which was not timely made.for purposes of this section,the term default means 
a the failure of an employer to make,when due,any payment under this section,if the failure is not cured within days after the employer receives written notification from the plan sponsor of such failure,and 
b any other event defined in rules adopted by the plan which indicates a substantial likelihood that an employer will be unable to pay its withdrawal liability.
this case concerns the second kind of default,commonly referred to as an insecurity default.notably,the first kind of default,commonly referred to as a default,is not at issue in this case.
subsection b,set forth immediately above,allows pension plans to adopt rules specifying examples of events that indicate a substantial likelihood of inability to pay.when these events occur,the plans may accelerate the entire amount of withdrawal liability.id.c see also b defining default in nearly identical language.
here,the plan appendix e,entitled rules and regulations pertaining to employer withdrawal liability,section e,provides that a default occurs if 
the trustees,in their discretion,deem the fund insecure as a result of any of the following events with respect to the employer 
a the employer insolvency,or any assignment by the employer for the benefit of creditors,or the employer calling of a meeting of creditors for the purpose of offering a composition or extension to such creditors,or the employer appointment of a committee of creditors or liquidating agent,or the employer offer of a composition or extension to creditors,or 
c the commencement of any proceedings by or against the employer pursuant to any bankruptcy or insolvency laws or any laws relating to the relief of debtors,or the readjustment,composition or extension of indebtedness,or to the liquidation,receivership,dissolution or reorganization of debtors 
e any other event or circumstance which in the judgment of the trustees materially impairs the employer credit worthiness or the employer ability to pay its withdrawal liability when due.
through counsel,informed central states by that was preparing for its termination and liquidation,attach.at.in response to this news,central states,acting pursuant to this provision,determined that the fund was insecure,placing in default pursuant to the plan rules.the plan determined that in ceasing operations,had shown a substantial likelihood that it would be unable to pay its withdrawal liability.
the mppaa provides that a ny dispute between an employer and the plan sponsor concerning a determination made under sections through of this title shall be resolved through arbitration.a.therefore concedes that the propriety of the plan default determination is beyond the scope of our review at this juncture.see reply br.whether central states is correct in its determination regarding its withdrawal liability assessment and the existence of a default making said assessed amount immediately due and owing are questions relating to the merits of the underlying dispute which must be resolved by an arbitrator.
subsection c states that a plan sponsor may require immediate payment in the event of default central states made such a demand.we therefore must resolve whether the default provisions of c apply during the pendency of the arbitration proceeding.
at the outset,it is important to note that,even in the absence of a declaration of default,withdrawal liability is ordinarily payable during the pendency of the arbitration.the statutory language requires that the employer pay even while challenging the plan determination if the employer prevails on its challenge,it will get its money back.two statutory provisions speak to this procedure,sometimes referred to as pay now,dispute later.subsection c,the provision of the statute that discusses payment,states that 
withdrawal liability shall be payable in accordance with the schedule set forth notwithstanding any request for review or appeal of determinations of the amount of such liability or of the schedule.
c.similarly,d,which relates specifically to arbitration,states that 
payments shall be made by an employer in accordance with the determinations made under this part until the arbitrator issues a final decision 
these provisions are not redundant.subsection b provides that the employer may request a review by the plan sponsor section provides for arbitration.the two processes are different.nevertheless,the provisions are analogous,and,notably,both make clear that payment must begin immediately and is not suspended during challenge.
having concluded that c and d place no restrictions on a plan ability to declare a default during the pendency of arbitration,we turn to the default provision itself.we set forth c for ease of reference 
in the event of a default,a plan sponsor may require immediate payment of the outstanding amount of an employer withdrawal liability,plus accrued interest on the total outstanding liability from the due date of the first payment which was not timely made.for purposes of this section,the term default means 
a the failure of an employer to make,when due,any payment under this section,if the failure is not cured within days after the employer receives written notification from the plan sponsor of such failure,and 
b any other event defined in rules adopted by the plan which indicates a substantial likelihood that an employer will be unable to pay its withdrawal liability.
we pause,first of all,to note the structure of the provisions.they consist of a general paragraph,which we shall refer to as the main body of the section,and two alternative definitions of default.there is nothing in the text of the main body of the provision,or in subsection b,suggesting any kind of limitation on when acceleration can occur.in these parts of the text,there is no indication that default payments should be treated differently from any other withdrawal liability payments,which must be made before the decision on liability is made.these provisions,then,echo the general rule of pay now,dispute later,and in no way indicate that acceleration due to default is an exception to this general rule.
the pbgc has given a different interpretation to subsection a,which deals with default due to.addressing directly the matter in c,the pbgc regulation provides that a default as a result of failure to make any payments shall not occur until days after the arbitrator rules.id.emphasis supplied.this regulation,then,interprets the statutory command of section c a as requiring a method of proceeding different from the pay now,dispute later approach of the remainder of the statute.the pbgc reaches this conclusion by focusing on the distinctive wording of subsection a,the statute definition of a default.more precisely,it focuses on the words when due.it then points out that section b provides that i f no arbitration proceeding has been initiated pursuant to subsection a of this section,the amounts demanded by the plan sponsor shall be due and owing on the schedule set forth by the plan sponsor.b emphasis supplied.in its view,due is a technical term employed by the act.payments become due when they become final,either because arbitration has not been initiated or has concluded.payments not due are interim payments.rather,interim payments shall be made as specified by section d,but can not serve as the basis for a default.by definition,a default can not occur until payments become due.
notably,the pbgc
