pat lukes appeals an order granting a motion for entry of judgment pursuant to a settlement code civ,the settlement was intended to resolve a dispute between two neighbors concerning the scope of an easement.lukes contends the trial court refused to consider her arguments in opposition to the motion because it erroneously concluded that it had no jurisdiction to consider those arguments,that noel hines waived the right to enforce the settlement,and that he prevented her performance.
we conclude that the trial court properly considered the merits of the motion and opposition and that lukes has shown no basis to relieve her of her settlement obligations.we conclude further,however,that the order erroneously fails to set forth all of the material settlement terms.we therefore reverse the judgment with directions to the trial court to enter a formal judgment setting forth all of the material terms that have yet to be fully performed or,if the court finds that the parties failed to agree to all material terms,enter an order denying the motion.
factual and procedural background 
complaint,petition for an injunction,and 
hines and lukes own and reside on contiguous lots in the city of los angeles.lukes owns an easement over a triangular portion of the hines property.the parties dispute the scope of the easement.
hines filed a complaint against lukes in december,alleging that the easement is solely for ingress,egress and drainage,as stated in an easement recorded on may,attached to the complaint.hines alleges that lukes has exceeded the scope of permissible uses of the easement by permanently parking vehicles in the easement area,and by placing trash bins,a dumpster,and waste in the easement area.hines alleges counts for trespass,interference with easement capitalization omitted,and declaratory relief.
lukes filed a petition for an injunction against hines in january,no,alleging civil harassment.the trial court determined that the petition was related to the present action.lukes voluntarily dismissed the petition in april.
lukes filed a against hines and filed a first amended in july.lukes alleges that the easement is not only for ingress,egress,and drainage,but also for general driveway purposes,as stated in a recorded easement dated february,attached to the first amended.lukes alleges counts to quiet title to the easement and to enjoin any interference with the permitted uses.
settlement agreement 
the parties participated in a mandatory settlement conference on october.at the conclusion of the conference,the parties orally before the court agreed to a settlement on stated terms.the settlement provided that lukes would resurface the portion of the driveway in front of her garage,including the easement area hines would resurface the portion of the driveway on his property,excluding the easement area lukes insurance carriers would pay of the cost of the resurfacing to be done by hines,not to exceed both parties would use concrete materials for the resurfacing and would resurface the driveway in a neutral color the work would be done at the same time,but not necessarily by the same contractor the work would be completed within one year after the date of the oral settlement lukes would keep her garbage cans on her own property and not in the easement area and lukes would park no more than two vehicles in the driveway in front of her garage,including one of her own and one of a visitor,and neither she nor her visitors would park on the hines property outside the easement area.
the settlement also provided for mutual dismissals with prejudice,and a mutual release.the parties agreed that the court would retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement and that the parties would participate in a mediation before applying to the court to enforce the settlement.
after the parties had agreed to these terms,the court stated,i understand that these terms will be put into writing.however,the settlement is enforceable as of now.the court scheduled an order to show cause hearing for november,and stated that no appearance would be necessary if the dismissals were filed by that date.
the court later continued the order to show cause hearing on four occasions,at the request of counsel.at the hearing on february,the court dismissed the action for failure to prosecute and nonappearance of counsel.the court filed a signed order of dismissal on that date.
second petition for an injunction 
lukes filed a second petition for an injunction against hines in may,no,alleging civil harassment.hines filed a notice of related cases,stating that the petition was related to both the present action and the prior injunction petition no.the court determined that the second petition was related to the present action.the court issued a restraining order in june,prohibiting hines from parking within a certain distance of lukes house.
motion for entry of judgment pursuant to the settlement 
hines filed a motion for entry of judgment pursuant to the settlement in october.he argued that lukes had failed to resurface her portion of the driveway in concrete within one year after the settlement,as required by the settlement,and that she had threatened to resurface her portion of the driveway in black asphalt.hines argued that he had resurfaced his portion of the driveway,and that lukes had refused to participate in mediation.the only evidence filed in support of the motion was a declaration by hines attorney stating that lukes had failed to resurface her portion of the driveway.the declaration also attached a copy of the reporter transcript of the oral settlement and two photographs of a portion of the driveway,and stated that the photographs showed the current condition of the driveway.he requested the entry of judgment pursuant to the settlement under code of civil procedure section.
lukes argued in opposition that the motion was premature because no mediation had taken place,as required by the terms of the settlement.she also argued that she needed hines written consent to obtain a building permit to resurface the easement area,that his failure to provide consent had prevented her performance,and that her nonperformance therefore was excused and did not constitute a breach.she argued further that hines failure to complete the resurfacing of his portion of the driveway within one year,as required under the settlement,constituted unclean hands and should preclude any relief.she filed her own declaration stating that she had not refused to participate in mediation,that the city of los angeles required her to obtain the owner written consent to do the work and that hines had refused her request for written consent,and that hines had not completed resurfacing his portion of the driveway.
hines argued in reply that the two photographs filed with his moving papers showed that he had completed resurfacing his portion of the driveway a second declaration by his attorney stated that counsel for lukes had failed to respond to his request for mediation.hines also objected to the lukes declaration on various grounds.
after a hearing in december,the court ordered the parties to mediation,requested supplemental briefs,and continued the hearing on the motion to february.the parties filed supplemental briefs in january,but presented no additional evidence.hines argued in his supplemental brief that he had completed his resurfacing and that lukes had failed to show that she needed his consent to do the work or that he had failed to provide his consent.lukes argued in her supplemental brief that the mediation was scheduled for later that month and that any further briefing should be delayed until after the mediation.
the court granted a motion by lukes counsel to be relieved as counsel in february.the motion for entry of judgment pursuant to the settlement was continued further to march.
the motion came on for hearing in march.the judge who had presided over the settlement had retired,so the hearing was before a different judge.lukes appeared in propria persona.the court tentative ruling was to order the parties to mediation,as required by the terms of the settlement.counsel for hines stated that the parties had already participated in a mediation.lukes responded that the mediation was unsuccessful because hines had walked out of the mediation.the court asked whether there was a viable settlement if the parties could not resolve their differences in mediation.counsel for hines stated that there was an enforceable settlement.lukes stated that many statements in the complaint were false.the court stated that the court retained jurisdiction only to enforce the terms of the settlement,and that the allegations in the complaint did not control.the court continued the hearing to april,and encouraged the parties to resolve their differences.
at the hearing in april,the court tentative ruling once again was to order the parties to mediation,as required by the terms of the settlement.counsel for hines stated once again that the parties had already participated in a mediation and had attempted to resolve the dispute after the prior hearing.lukes stated that the mediation was unsuccessful because hines had walked out of the mediation.lukes stated that the resurfacing of hines portion of the driveway was incomplete and that hines had failed to present any evidence that the work was complete.counsel for hines stated that the issues in dispute included the timing of the resurfacing and the materials to be used.lukes stated that other statements in the moving papers were false.the court confirmed that lukes had filed an opposition,stated that the court jurisdiction was limited to enforcing the terms of the settlement,and stated,i ca get into the substance of the driveway.
the court stated further in a way,i wish i could this,but i ca.i do have the jurisdiction to do it,and i not a mediator.i ca go into the substance of the dispute.i ca go into the timing issue.i ca go into the type of material to be used.all i can do is look at the transcript.that all i can do at this point look at your moving papers,look at your opposition papers,and go from there.the court continued the hearing to may.
order granting the motion 
the court granted the motion on may.the court stated at the beginning of the hearing,the only jurisdiction that i have is to enforce the terms and conditions of the settlement,and again,i was saying that the only jurisdiction that i have is to enforce the terms and conditions.the court referred the parties to its written tentative ruling.
the tentative ruling began by stating that the motion was granted and that lukes must com p ly with the settlement agreement within court days.capitalization omitted.the ruling quoted some,but not all,of the settlement terms from the reporter transcript of the mandatory settlement conference.it then stated that lukes had failed to comply with the conditions set forth in the settlement.it stated that code of civil procedure section authorized the court to enter a judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement,and that t he judgment must reflect and enforce those terms.skulnick roberts express,th,d.the ruling concluded,accordingly,as defendant orally agreed to the noted conditions while appearing before judge stephen peterson on october,the court enforces the terms of the settlement per ccp.the ruling did not state that a judgment would be entered.
after the parties had reviewed the tentative ruling,the court stated there nothing more i can say or do.this matter was settled.it was dismissed.the court retained jurisdiction only to enforce the terms and conditions of the settlement.my jurisdiction does not extend beyond that.that it.i ca do any more.under the code,under section,once the case is dismissed,the only jurisdiction that i have is to enforce the terms and conditions of the settlement.those terms and conditions were set forth in exhibit a the reporter transcript.i have recited some but not all of the conversation that went on before my colleague,judge petersen.i ca revisit it.that will be the order.the court stated further in response to counsel question,i do know whether or not a judgment is needed.i would think so because the case was settled.
the court adopted the tentative ruling as its final order,but changed the date for lukes to comply with the settlement to june.a minute order granting the motion attached the tentative ruling,as so modified.the court entered no formal judgment.
hines filed and served a notice of entry of judgment.lukes filed a notice of appeal from the order granting the motion.lukes also petitioned this court for a writ of supersedeas,seeking to stay enforcement of the appealed order pending our resolution of the appeal.we granted the petition and stayed the trial court proceedings.
quiet title action 
lukes filed a complaint against hines in november,no,alleging that hines had interfered with her use of the easement and that the parties disputed the meaning of the settlement agreement in this action she alleged that her position was that the reference in the settlement to concrete materials included asphaltic concrete,while hines maintained that the term included only portland cement.she alleged counts for quiet title,interference with easement,and declaratory relief.the action is currently pending.
contentions 
lukes contends the court refused to consider her arguments in opposition to the motion because the court erroneously concluded that it had no jurisdiction to consider those arguments hines waived the right to enforce the settlement by failing to perform his settlement obligations and by failing to invoke code of civil procedure section sooner and the nonperformance of her settlement obligations was excused by hines prevention of her performance.
discussion 
code of civil procedure section 
code of civil procedure section provides a summary procedure to enforce a settlement agreement by entering judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.weddington productions,flick th,d.section states that if the parties to pending litigation enter into a settlement either in a writing signed by the parties or orally before the court,the court,upon a motion,may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement the court retains jurisdiction to enforce a settlement under the statute even after a dismissal,but only if the parties requested such a retention of jurisdiction before the dismissal.ibid.such a request must be made either in a writing signed by the parties or orally before the court.wackeen malis th,d.

the order,as amended,is appealable as a judgment 
the court here granted the motion under code of civil procedure section,but failed to enter a formal judgment.absent a formal entry of judgment,an appellate court may amend an order to include a judgment if the effect of the order is to finally determine the rights of the parties in the action.griset fair political practices com.cal th,d.we conclude that the effect of the order here was to finally determine the rights of the parties in this action by enforcing the settlement agreement.accordingly,we will amend the order to include an appealable judgment so as to expedite appellate review.
