sometime in,verizon began to assign its corporate voice mail group employees voice mail clerks additional duties.for a time,verizon paid the voice mail clerks extra for performing the new duties but stopped doing so at some point between and.on december,the cwa filed a grievance on behalf of the voice mail clerks,asserting that they were being unfairly treated in that they were performing the duties associated with a higher position rcmac clerk but were classified at,and paid the salary of,a lower position general clerk on march,verizon denied the grievance and the cwa appealed.during the grievance process,verizon conducted a job evaluation of the voice mail clerks and eventually,on june,determined that the voice mail clerk position was appropriately classified as a general clerk position.on july,the cwa submitted its grievance to arbitration pursuant to article of the collective bargaining agreement between verizon and the cwa.see general agreement between cwa and verizon,at,cba.
the dispute centers on article of the cba,which sets forth the procedure verizon and the cwa must follow w henever the company determines it appropriate to create a new job title or job classification in the bargaining unit,or to restructure or redefine an existing one.cba at.the procedure is the exclusive means by which the cwa may contest the schedule of wage rates which verizon sets for any new,restructured,or redefined job title or classification.id.at.section e of article allows the cwa to demand,if the parties are unable to reach agreement within sixty days following receipt of notice from verizon,that the issue of an appropriate schedule of wage rates be submitted for resolution to a neutral third party,that is,an arbitrator.id.significantly,if the arbitrator devises a different schedule of wage rates,the new schedule shall be placed in effect retroactive to the date the change or new job was implemented,except that in no event shall the retroactive effect exceed days.id.the parties are bound by the arbitrator decision.
after arbitration hearings were held on april,july,and october,an arbitrator issued an award on february,concluding that verizon violate d article.b by failing to give notice to the cwa and afford an opportunity to negotiate over its assignment of duties to voice mail clerks outside of the scope of their general clerk job description,constituting a redefinition or restructure of the existing job title for purposes of article.opinion and award of arbitrator susan mackenzie,commc ns workers of,local verizon washington,cwa case,at,mackenzie award.accordingly,the arbitrator directed verizon to comply with article notification and negotiations requirements within days of the issuance of her award.id.at.
pursuant to the award,verizon and the cwa began negotiations but soon reached an impasse.the cwa,invoking its right to demand that the issue of an appropriate schedule of wage rates be submitted for resolution to a neutral third party,cba at,then requested arbitration at some point before august.another arbitrator heard the matter on september,and issued his award eight months later,on may,the arbitrator summarized the three issues as follows 
the threshold issue before the arbitrator is to determine what discretion the agreement affords him in fashioning an award in this matter.that is,is the arbitrator constrained to choose between the positions of the parties as in last offer arbitration,or is he free to identify and award some other outcome in the matter 
the principal issue before the arbitrator is,of course,to determine an award with respect to the appropriate wage schedule for the voice mail clerks.
finally,the arbitrator must determine a remedy.this will require the arbitrator to interpret the language of article f which states that in no event shall the retroactive effect exceed days.did the drafters of the agreement intend,as the company contends,that the new wage rate for the voice mail clerks must be effective no more than days prior to the date of the instant arbitrator award,or,pursuant to the union interpretation,that the revised wage rate must have effect days prior to sic the union initial grievance,december,
opinion and award of arbitrator paul gerhart,verizon washington,commc ns workers of,local,parties case,at may,emphasis added gerhart award.the arbitrator determined that after two years of service,a voice mail clerk should be allowed to apply for and immediately be promoted to the senior voice mail clerk job title.id.at.he also held that a ll current voice mail clerks with two or more years of actual service in that title shall immediately be offered the opportunity to upgrade to the senior voice mail clerk job and that any voice mail clerk with two or more years of actual service as of december,shall receive a pay adjustment reflecting the difference between what she or he actually earned and what she would have earned had she been properly classified as of that date.id.at emphasis omitted.in setting the retroactivity award,the arbitrator reasoned as follows 
inasmuch as the upgrade of experienced voice mail clerks should have taken place in,the effective date of the creation of the senior voice mail job title shall be december,the date of the union grievance in this matter 
the arbitrator is mindful of the admonition in article f which asserts that in no event shall the retroactive effect exceed days.had verizon not violated the agreement as found by arbitrator mackenzie,and had it properly notified the cwa of the changes in the voice mail clerk job in response to the cwa december grievance,and had the matter been processed and ultimately referred to a neutral third party as required by article.e and f,a decision by the neutral third party would have been rendered on or about may,which is days after december.thus,in the absence of the contractual violation by verizon,this neutral third party award would have been effective on december,fully within the boundaries of retroactivity prescribed by the cba.it would shock the sensibilities of any reasonable person if verizon were allowed to benefit from its own bre a ch of the cba,as found by arbitrator mackenzie,particularly since it violated the very article of the cba that it now seeks to use to limit the contractually remedy in this matter.
on august,verizon filed suit in district court under section a of the relations act of lmra,a,seeking partial vacatur of the award to the extent the retroactive pay award exceeded days the cwa counterclaimed seeking enforcement.on august,the district court granted summary judgment to verizon,holding that arbitrator gerhart exceeded his arbitral authority under the parties agreement in that he chose to disregard the unambiguous limitations of article f a limitation that he characterized as a mere admonition because he concluded that it would be unfair to observe that limitation in this case.verizon washington,d at.indeed,highlighting the arbitrator shock the sensibilities language,the court concluded that the arbitrator retroactivity determination was based on his own brand of industrial justice.id.at quoting united steelworkers of am.enter.wheel car,d.the cwa then filed a timely notice of appeal.
we have final order jurisdiction of this appeal under courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states.despite remanding the matter to an arbitrator of the parties choosing,the district court order is a final,appealable order given that the to modifying the retroactive effect of the award in a manner consistent with the court opinion,that is,retroactive to days before the date of the arbitrator ministerial in nature.see verizon washington,d at pueblo of sandia babb
