ljl street associates,llc ljl and pitcairn properties pitcairn,adversaries in two related litigations in the united states district court for the southern district of new york rakoff,each appeal from district court rulings.the controversy between ljl and pitcairn arises out of ljl exercise of its contractual option to purchase pitcairn ownership stake in a jointly owned luxury residential building in new york city,after which the parties pursued an arbitration to determine the value of the property.the arbitrator determined that the stated value essentially the fair market value of the building was million,but refused to make a determination of the purchase price to be paid by ljl stated value minus certain specified deductions for liabilities.the district court vacated the arbitrator determination of the stated value,based on its conclusion that the arbitrator committed misconduct in violation of the federal arbitration act,a,in excluding certain hearsay evidence offered by pitcairn.the district court upheld the arbitrator refusal to determine the purchase price.ljl appeals from both rulings.
in a separate action,pitcairn appeals from the court dismissal of pitcairn claims that ljl breached its fiduciary duties and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in its exercise of the purchase option and in alleged subsequent interference with pitcairn efforts to ascertain the market value of pitcairn ownership stake in the building.
in ljl appeal,we agree with its contention that the arbitrator exclusion of pitcairn hearsay exhibits was within the arbitrator authorized discretion.we therefore vacate the district court order overturning the arbitrator determination of the stated value.we agree with the district court conclusion that the arbitrator acted in accordance with the terms of the arbitration agreement in refusing to determine the purchase price.we therefore remand with instructions to confirm the arbitration award in its entirety.in pitcairn appeal,we find no error in the district court dismissal of pitcairn claims for breach of fiduciary duties and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.we therefore affirm that judgment.
background 
a.the property and the operating agreement 
ljl and pitcairn are the sole equity owners of a limited liability company known as west street associates,llc the company,whose sole asset is a luxury apartment complex at west street in manhattan the property.pitcairn is a wholly owned subsidiary of pitcairn properties holdings,pitcairn holdings and owns of the company.pitcairn is an owner,developer,and manager of real estate assets,and manages the property.ljl is a new jersey limited liability company,owned by les lustbader and his children,jared and lauren lustbader,that owns of the company.
ljl and pitcairn have an elaborate and specific operating agreement governing aspects of their shared ownership of the company the agreement provides an arbitration clause of limited scope.the sections of the operating agreement of particular pertinence to this appeal are sections,c,and.the agreement specifies two terms of significance stated value and purchase price,which are defined in section to mean grosso modo fair market value and fair market value minus liabilities.
section gives ljl the option,if salah mekkawy ceases to be employed by pitcairn,to purchase pitcairn interest pursuant to the terms,conditions and procedures set forth in section c.it goes on to add that the stated value shall be determined by agreement between pitcairn and ljl,but i f pitcairn and ljl are unable to agree upon the stated value,then either party may elect that such dispute be determined by expedited arbitration pursuant to section,whereupon the arbitrator shall select an independent,third party appraiser who shall determine the stated value.
section c explains how the purchase price the price to be paid by ljl for pitcairn interest is to be derived from stated value.the full text of sections and c,insofar as pertinent,are set out in the margin.
section.states that arbitrated disputes will be resolved by the expedited arbitration procedures of the american arbitration association with certain modifications,including that each party shall be entitled to present evidence and witnesses to support its position and to witnesses presented by the other.it specifies,
any provision of this agreement which specifically provides that a dispute will be resolved by the expedited arbitration provided in this section shall be resolved by the expedited arbitration procedures of the american arbitration association in rendering such decision and award,the arbitrators shall not add to,subtract from or otherwise modify the provisions of the agreement and may only determine the issue or question presented as their award.
b.the ouster of mekkawy and ljl exercise of the option 
in the summer of a preferred shareholder of pitcairn holdings sought to take over its board.the management,led by mekkawy,tried to block the takeover through an action in delaware chancery court,and also filed for bankruptcy.that litigation was settled in september.after the settlement,the preferred shareholder took over the board of pitcairn holdings and mekkawy received a new employment agreement involving a change of title and duties,and a diminished role.in early october,without the knowledge of pitcairn senior officers or board,mekkawy told ljl that he would be leaving pitcairn.
on october,pitcairn chief operating officer and two other employees met with jared lustbader one of ljl principals.at the time,pitcairn was considering whether it should terminate mekkawy.during this meeting,there was discussion of mekkawy potential termination.pitcairn alleges that 
pitcairn representatives met with lustbader and specifically discussed mekkawy potential separation from pitcairn.lustbader,having been tipped off by mekkawy,and knowing and intending that pitcairn would take action accordingly,told pitcairn representatives that ljl did not like mekkawy,did not want to deal with him and did not trust him.lustbader further acknowledged that mekkawy was not involved with management of the property and that ljl had no problem with mekkawy departure from pitcairn.lustbader also said that ljl was comfortable with pitcairn management of the property,which he complimented.lustbader did not tell pitcairn representatives that ljl would try to exercise the purchase option in of the operating agreement if pitcairn terminated mekkawy.
pitcairn did not ask ljl whether it would exercise its option if mekkawy were terminated.there was no mention of the option during the meeting.the board of pitcairn holdings voted on october,to terminate mekkawy employment.pitcairn asserts in its complaint that the decision was made relying in part on lustbader comments regarding mekkawy.ten days later,pitcairn informed ljl of mekkaway termination.pitcairn alleges that in this conversation,les and jared lustbader reiterated their dislike for mekkawy and their approval of his termination,and said nothing of their plan to exercise the purchase option.
on november,ljl formally exercised its purchase option under section of the operating agreement.ljl asserted that the value of the property was million,barely more than the million in debt on the property.pitcairn asserted that the property was worth million.pitcairn proposed selling the property to equity residential,which pitcairn asserts had offered million,or alternatively offering the property for sale so as to determine the true market price.ljl refused both proposals.ljl attorney also sent a letter to equity advising that it respectfully demands that you cease and desist from any further involvement in this matter and stating that ljl reserve s all of its rights and remedies at law or in equity concerning the company,or against you or pitcairn with respect to the matters embraced hereby.
c.the arbitration proceeding and the excluded evidence 
as the parties did not agree on the price,ljl filed an arbitration demand pursuant to its option agreement,asking for determination of both the stated value and purchase price.pitcairn objected to the demand for determination of the purchase price,arguing that the agreement provides for arbitration of only the stated value,and not the purchase price.
the parties selected jonathan cohen as their arbitrator,and he selected appraiser james levy to determine the property value.at the arbitration hearing,each party introduced testimony and reports of appraisers,and each party the other side witnesses.ljl appraiser testified that the property had a value of approximately million,while pitcairn appraiser testified to a value of approximately million.
ljl objected on hearsay and other grounds to four of pitcairn exhibits.these were an asset summary report of eastdil,a real estate banking firm,stating that the value of the property is between million and million,with a midpoint of million a valuation of the property made by cbre capital advisors,drawn from discussion materials presented by cbre to pitcairn board of directors on july,which values the property between and a june,letter of eric blum,the managing member of pph investments management,llc which was at the time of the letter the preferred shareholder of pitcairn holdings,and which later took over its board and ousted mekkawy stating that pphi valued the property in the low millions and equity residential letter of intent to purchase the property for million.pitcairn did not call witnesses to testify to or defend what was stated in the four exhibits.the arbitrator sustained ljl objections to these four exhibits,without explanation beyond the statement that they shall not be admitted into evidence and shall not be considered by the arbitrator or the neutral appraisal expert 
based on the appraiser appraisal,the arbitrator entered an award determining the stated value as million and declined to determine the purchase price.ljl moved to modify the award with respect to the decision not to determine the purchase price.the arbitrator denied the motion.subsequent to the arbitration,pitcairn initiated a procedure provided for in section of the operating agreement,under which one owner of the company may send the other an opinion on the value of the property,and the other owner may choose either to buy the interest of the first owner or to sell its own interest to the first owner based on that value.ljl declined to participate.
d.the proceedings in the district court 
ljl petitioned the supreme court of new york on september,to confirm the arbitrator determination of stated value,but to vacate the arbitrator refusal to also determine the purchase price.on the latter question,ljl argued,in part,that pitcairn had forfeited objection to arbitrating the purchase price by failing to move for a stay of arbitration of the purchase price within days of ljl demand as required by new york state arbitration law,cplr c.pitcairn removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship,and to vacate the award because the arbitrator had excluded evidence in violation of the faa,a.
on both issues,the district court ruled in favor of pitcairn.the court vacated the arbitrator determination of stated value by reason of the exclusion of the four pitcairn exhibits.the court sustained the arbitrator refusal to determine the purchase price,ruling that determination of the purchase price was not within the arbitration agreement and rejecting ljl contention that pitcairn had waived objection.ljl appeals those rulings.
pitcairn meanwhile sued in the district court,alleging that ljl conduct breached fiduciary duties as well as its implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and that ljl was equitably estopped from exercising its purchase option because it misled pitcairn to believe that it would not exercise the option if mekkawy were fired.ljl moved to compel arbitration,or in the alternative to dismiss the suit for failure to state a claim.the district court denied the motion to arbitrate,finding that these claims did not fall within the terms of the narrow arbitration clause,but granted the motion to dismiss.pitcairn appeals the dismissal of the claims for breach of fiduciary duty and implied covenants.

pitcairn did not waive its objection to arbitrating the purchase price 
ljl contends that pitcairn forfeited its right to object to arbitration of the purchase price by failing to move to stay the aspect of ljl arbitration demand which sought determination of the purchase price within twenty days of service of ljl notice of intention to arbitrate the purchase price in accordance with cplr c.see,in re fiveco,haber,holding that a party could not stay arbitration where it did not file an application within twenty days per c.
we reject ljl contention.in our view,c does not apply to these facts section c provides,
a party may serve upon another party a demand for arbitration or a notice of intention to arbitrate stating that unless the party served applies to stay the arbitration within twenty days after such service he shall thereafter be precluded from objecting that a valid agreement was not made or has not been complied with and from asserting in court the bar of a limitation of time an application to stay arbitration must be made by the party served within twenty days after service upon him of the notice or demand,or he shall be so precluded.
as we understand this provision,it applies to objections to arbitrate on the grounds that valid agreement was not made or has not been complied with and to objections based on time limitations.id.pitcairn objection is not based on one of these grounds.pitcairn argument is that the agreement to arbitrate is limited to specified issues,which do not include the purchase price.
b.the arbitrator properly refused to exercise jurisdiction to determine the purchase price 
ljl further contends that the arbitrator was required by the operating agreement to decide the purchase price of the property.we disagree.
section of the agreement expressly provides for arbitration to determine stated value,under the provisions of section.nowhere in the agreement is there a suggestion that the purchase price be determined by arbitration.furthermore,section,the clause that governs arbitration procedures,states that it applies to a ny provision of this agreement which specifically provides emphasis added for resolution by arbitration and adds,t he arbitrators shall not add to,subtract from,or otherwise modify the provisions of the agreement and may only determine the issue or question presented as their award.
in an effort to rebut this apparent prohibition of expansion of the scope of the arbitration,ljl relies on the close linkage between stated value and purchase price and seeks support from dialysis access center,llc rms lifeline,cir and mcallister,v.a s transportation,cir.neither opinion is helpful.
dialysis access involved a broad arbitration clause which provided for arbitration of any dispute that may arise under this agreement.dialysis access,at.it has no application where the parties have elected arbitration of narrow precisely specified issues and have instructed the arbitrators not to expand the scope of the arbitration to other issues.notwithstanding the general view expressed in that case favoring resolution of disputes by arbitration where the parties have agreed to that procedure,arbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf navigation.
ljl cites mcallister as authority for the proposition that an issue arising out of an arbitrated issue is itself arbitrable when it is inextricably tied up with the merits of the arbitrated matter.mcallister,at.our case differs materially from mcallister.mcallister involved the agreement of a transporter of sludge modern to employ mcal
