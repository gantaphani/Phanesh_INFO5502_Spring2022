procedural history 
on march,dino jaramillo and kim jaramillo the jaramillos filed a complaint against jh real estate partners,jh management,llc,and united dominion,later corrected to read united dominion realty.they alleged causes of action for general negligence,intentional tort,premises liability,breach of contract,breach of the implied warranty of habitability,and unfair business practices and false and deceptive advertising.
in regard to general negligence,the jaramillos alleged in their complaint that beginning on october,and continuing thereafter,the defendants negligently inspected,maintained or repaired the subject premises resulting in water incursion and dangerous and unhealthful levels of moisture in walls and ceilings,mold,mold mycotoxins,airborne mold spores,fungus,and bacteria in the rental unit occupied by plaintiffs.the jaramillos further alleged that this dangerous condition and its negligent cause was not discovered,and could not have been discovered in the exercise of reasonable diligence,until january.
in regard to intentional tort,the jaramillos alleged in their complaint that beginning on october,and continuing thereafter,defendants intentionally caused damage to them by failing and refusing to provide a clean,sanitary and habitable living space for plaintiffs despite defendants knowledge that defendants negligence as described herein above had caused plaintiff sic rental unit to be in an unsafe,unsanitary and dangerous condition due to the presence of mold,mold spores,mycotoxins,fungus,and bacteria.they further alleged that during about january,defendants improperly caused one or more notices to pay rent or quit to be served on plaintiffs in retaliation for plaintiffs filing a report with the monterey county health department concerning the unsanitary living conditions in their unit,intentionally causing plaintiffs severe emotional distress.
in regard to premises liability,the jaramillos stated in their complaint that they had suffered physical injury and severe emotional distress as a result of unhealthful and unsanitary conditions in their rental unit.they also averred that,about april,kim jaramillo slipped and fell on a concrete ramp located on the premises and she injured her knee,and the injury was proximately caused by the defendants failure to inspect and to repair or maintain the ramp.
in regard to the breach of the implied warranty of habitability,the jaramillos alleged that defendants failed to provide and maintain a clean,sanitary and habitable rental unit.
in regard to violation of business and professions code sections and et,the jaramillos alleged that defendants actions constituted unfair business practices.they further averred that defendants falsely advertised and represented that rental units at the subject premises were in a clean and sanitary condition,complied with all applicable health,safety and building laws and ordinances,and were safe and were fit for human habitation 
on may,defendants moved for an order compelling arbitration based on the arbitration provision contained in the jh management rental agreement between the jh management company,llc,the landlord agent,and the jaramillos.the arbitration clause provides for binding arbitration of personal injury disputes in a provision titled arbitration of personal injury disputes.section of the agreement states in small,boldface print any dispute between the parties relating to a claim for personal injury,directly or indirectly relating to,or arising from,the condition of the leased premises,or the apartment community,shall be resolved by arbitration conducted by the american arbitration association.although the arbitration provision states that the american arbitration association rules govern,it also imposes the restriction that any demand for arbitration be made in writing within days after the claim,dispute or other matter in questions sic has arisen.the section provides in small,print that the arbitration shall be conducted before three arbitrators and all administrative fees and costs shared equally by the landlord and resident and all such fees must be advanced prior to the arbitration the section also states in small,nonboldface print nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit the landlord rights in the event of resident breach or default under this agreement,including without limitation,landlord right to bring an action for unlawful detainer under the laws of the state of california.
in their memorandum of points and authorities in opposition to the motion,the jaramillos argued that the arbitration clause was unconscionable and should not be enforced.they contended that they were the parties with the weakest bargaining power and the requirement of arbitration before three arbitrators and payment of their half share of the costs in advance constituted an undue economic burden and put them at a gross economic disadvantage relative to the corporate landlord.they also asserted that the court had authority to deny the motion because there was a possibility of conflicting rulings since not all defendants were parties to the arbitration clause,citing code of civil procedure section,subdivision c.the jaramillos maintained that their claims for property damage,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and punitive damages were outside the scope of the arbitration clause.
in their reply memorandum,the defendants argued that all of the jarmillos claims arose from the condition of the leased premises and fell within the purview of the arbitration clause.the defendants maintained that the plaintiffs failed to show that the rental agreement was a contract of adhesion or that the arbitration clause was outside the reasonable expectations of the weaker party or unconscionable.they declared that the arbitration provision was prominent,conspicuous,simple and straightforward and its terms and burdens applied equally to plaintiffs and defendants.
the motion was heard on june.the jaramillos attorney first asserted that the arbitration clause was unconscionable because the terms of the lease were nonnegotiable,the clause was buried in the rental agreement,and it required three aaa arbitrators to hear a dispute.their attorney indicated that,in her experience,one aaa arbitrator cost to per day.the jaramillos attorney also argued t he causes of action alleged in the plaintiff sic complaint do include causes of action for breaches of warranties express and implied in the lease.some of those happen to have resulted in personal injuries.others happened to have resulted in property damage.so obviously there is strict mutuality of remedy here,your honor.
the court pointed out that the arbitration clause expressly stated that nothing in the section limited the landlord rights in the event of a resident breach or default under this agreement,including the landlord right to bring an action for unlawful detainer.the court denied the motion,stating that the arbitration clause did not provide mutuality to the tenants.
legal principles 
title of the code of civil procedure,as enacted and periodically amended by the legislature,represents a comprehensive statutory scheme regulating private arbitration in this state.code civ,et through this detailed statutory scheme,the legislature has expressed a strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution.citations.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.a n award reached by an arbitrator pursuant to a contractual agreement to arbitrate is not subject to judicial review except on the grounds set forth in code of civil procedure sections to vacate and for correction.further,the existence of an error of law apparent on the face of the award that causes substantial injustice does not provide grounds for judicial review.moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at,d.
california law,like federal law,favors enforcement of valid arbitration agreements.citation.u nder both federal and california law,arbitration agreements are valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation fn.omitted of any contract.see also,code civ.in other words,under california law,as under federal law,an arbitration agreement may only be invalidated for the same reasons as other contracts.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d.because unconscionability is a reason for refusing to enforce contracts generally,it is also a valid reason for refusing to enforce an arbitration agreement under code of civil procedure section armendariz foundation health psychcare services,supra,cal th at,d.
unconscionability analysis begins with an inquiry into whether the contract is one of adhesion.graham,cal d.the term contract of adhesion signifies a standardized contract,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.citation.if the contract is adhesive,the court must then determine whether other factors are present which,under established legal or to render it unenforceable,supra,at,fn.omitted.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,supra,cal th at,d.
generally speaking,there are two judicially imposed limitations on the enforcement of adhesion contracts or provisions thereof.the first is that such a contract or provision which does not fall within the reasonable expectations of the weaker or adhering party will not be enforced against him.citations.the principle of equity applicable to all contracts that a contract or provision,even if consistent with the reasonable expectations of the parties,will be denied enforcement if,considered in its context,it is unduly oppressive or unconscionable.ibid.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,supra,cal th at,d.
in,the legislature enacted civil code section,which codified the principle that a court can refuse to enforce an unconscionable provision in a contract.perdue crocker national bank cal d,as section,subdivision a states if the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract,or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause,or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,supra,cal th at,d.
u nconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element,the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,the latter on overly harsh or results.citation.the prevailing view is that procedural and substantive unconscionability must both be present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability.stirlen supercuts,supra,th at d stirlen.but they need not be present in the same degree.essentially a sliding scale is invoked which disregards the regularity of the procedural process of the contract formation,that creates the terms,in proportion to the greater harshness or unreasonableness of the substantive terms themselves.citations.in other words,the more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,supra,cal th at,d.
the procedural element of an unconscionable contract generally takes the form of a contract of adhesion,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.citation.little auto stiegler,cal th,d.substantively unconscionable terms may take various forms,but may generally be described as unfairly.one such form,as in armendariz,is the arbitration agreement lack of a modicum of bilaterality,wherein the employee claims against the employer,but not the employer claims against the employee,are subject to arbitration.armendariz,supra,cal th at d.id.at,d.
inherent in an arbitration agreement is a waiver of trial by waiver that is not precluded by the constitution or section of the code of civil procedure.see madden kaiser foundation hospitals cal d,construing cal,art.i,and code civ,subd.a.lagatree luce,forward,hamilton scripps th,fn,d.in madden,the supreme court observed when parties agree to submit their disputes to arbitration they select a forum that is alternative to,and independent of,the forum in which,as they well know,disputes are not resolved by juries.madden kaiser foundation hospitals,supra,cal d at.

an enrolled bill report from the department of housing and community development on senate bill,dated august,stated that the bill would declare void any modification or waiver of a tenant rights regarding procedural rights in litigation.it recommended that the governor sign the bill because it would help prevent the unknowing signing away of valuable rights by a tenant who may not fully understand a lease or rental agreement.
