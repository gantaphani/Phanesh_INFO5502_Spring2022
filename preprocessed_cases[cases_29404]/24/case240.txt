this is one of those rare cases in which a district court vacated an arbitration award because of the arbitrator manifest disregard of the law.the arbitrator,steven sherrill,issued a award in favor of petitioners richard hoeft,iii and carol hoeft.the hoefts filed a petition to confirm the award in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,and respondents mvl group,and discovery research group of utah,collectively,mvl moved to vacate the award.after limited discovery,including a deposition of the arbitrator,the district court kimba wood,judge denied the hoefts petition to confirm the award and granted mvl motion to vacate it,concluding that sherrill had manifestly disregarded the law.because we conclude that the district court should not have permitted mvl to depose the arbitrator regarding his reasoning and processes,and because we believe that the arbitrator neither manifestly disregarded the law nor exceeded his powers,we reverse the judgment of the district court.
background 
in the richard hoeft,iii founded two companies that specialize in the field service area of the market research industry,discovery research group,and discovery research group of utah.by february,hoeft individually and the hoeft charitable remainder unitrust,of which hoeft and his wife carol hoeft were,were the sole shareholders of both companies.in a february stock purchase agreement and amendment to stock purchase agreement,the hoefts sold their shares for million to mvl group,and discovery acquisition corporation 
the sale closed on february,but the parties agreed that mvl could defer paying a portion of the purchase price until the following year and that the hoefts would receive a purchase price adjustment if the value of the companies increased.the adjustment would be based on a calculation of ebitda,which was defined in the amendment as follows 
for purposes of this amendment,the term ebitda shall mean income from operations before interest expense,provisions for income taxes,interest and other investment income,other income,depreciation and amortization,which shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied 
amendment to stock purchase agreement b.the hoefts would receive the adjustment if,and only if,ebitda for the year following the closing the secondary year was equal to or greater than ebitda for the year preceding the closing the primary year.if secondary year ebitda was equal to or greater than primary year ebitda,the purchase price would be increased by the difference between times primary year ebitda,on the one hand,and,on the other.
the amendment provided that,in the event of a dispute as to the calculation of either primary or secondary year ebitda,the parties were to 
use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such dispute,and in the event that they are unable to do so such dispute shall be resolved by steven sherrill,whose decision in such matters shall be binding and conclusive upon each of the parties hereto and shall not be subject to any type of review or appeal whatsoever.
amendment to stock purchase agreement d.sherrill is a certified public accountant who represented the hoefts in this transaction and had also worked as a consultant to mvl.the parties ultimately disagreed over the calculation of primary year ebitda.the disagreement involved the proper treatment of certain payments to bonuses and stock option extinguishment in connection with the february stock sale.mvl believed that these payments should reduce income from operations,a component of ebitda under b of the amendment,while the hoefts believed that they should not.the parties were unable to resolve the dispute themselves,and the hoefts attorney wrote to sherrill requesting that he resolve it.
a general arbitration clause in the stock purchase agreement from which the more specific d of the amendment represented a referred most disputes arising under the agreement to the american arbitration association the aaa.invoking this clause,mvl initiated a proceeding with the aaa seeking to disqualify sherrill and to have the aaa appoint a new arbitrator.mvl argued,on the basis of a draft calculation of primary year ebitda that sherrill had circulated in november,that he had prejudged the matter and could not act impartially the aaa denied mvl motions as premature,noting that,if mvl felt that sherrill conducted the arbitration proceeding with evident partiality,it could seek to have the award vacated on that ground after the proceeding was concluded and sherrill rendered his award.see a.
sherrill proceeded to arbitrate the dispute over primary year ebitda.the parties submitted documentary evidence and expert reports supporting their conflicting calculations.in july,sherrill issued a draft award and circulated it to the parties.after receiving comments and additional evidence from the parties,sherrill issued his final award in august.relying on his perception of the parties intent,sherrill adopted the hoefts contention that the payments did not reduce primary year income from operations nor,therefore,primary year ebitda.sherrill rejected mvl argument that income from operations could be determined solely according to generally accepted accounting principles gaap,as gaap defined neither income from operations nor ebitda.pursuant to the formula prescribed in e of the amendment,sherrill determined that,if secondary year ebitda was equal to or greater than his calculation of primary year ebitda,mvl owed the hoefts.mvl conceded that secondary year ebitda was equal to or greater than primary year ebitda.
in september,the hoefts filed a petition in the district court to confirm the award pursuant to the federal arbitration act,the faa.mvl,in turn,filed a demand with the aaa to vacate the award,as well as a slew of motions in the district court.these motions sought to vacate the arbitration award stay the district court action pending the outcome of the aaa proceeding stay the district court consideration of the hoefts petition pending discovery and compel arbitration.the hoefts to stay the aaa proceeding.in a november order the district court denied mvl motion for a stay pending the outcome of the aaa proceeding,denied mvl motion to compel arbitration,granted the hoefts motion to stay the aaa proceeding,and denied mvl motion to stay consideration of the hoefts petition pending discovery.
following the district court resolution of these motions,mvl sought a broad range of discovery interrogatories,document production,and depositions,including the deposition of the arbitrator.at the time,mvl had asserted four grounds for vacating the arbitration award that sherrill had exceeded his powers,that the arbitrator had manifestly disregarded the law by failing to apply gaap,that the dispute resolution mechanism of d of the amendment had not been properly triggered,and that the arbitrator had prejudged the dispute.the hoefts argued that the district court should not permit any discovery but that,to the extent any discovery would be permitted,the only useful testimony would be the arbitrator.the district court ordered that mvl could depose the arbitrator for hour,under the court supervision.
on the day of the arbitrator deposition,the parties disputed its proper scope.mvl counsel indicated that he intended to question the arbitrator regarding whether he had manifestly disregarded the law,while the hoefts counsel argued that the deposition should be limited to whether the arbitrator had prejudged the dispute,to events that occurred before the amendment dispute resolution mechanism had been triggered.the court declined to limit the scope of the deposition,expressly permitting mvl counsel to examine the arbitrator regarding his alleged manifest disregard of the law.
the deposition of the arbitrator proceeded,with the court supervising.mvl counsel did not question the arbitrator regarding the allegations of bias or prejudgment.instead,mvl counsel questioned the arbitrator regarding his understanding of the calculation of ebitda under the amendment and the substance of his process in calculating primary year ebitda,including the role of gaap in his calculation.sherrill testified that he had disregard ed the phrase generally accepted accounting principles in calculating primary year ebitda and that the preponderance of evidence suggested that had gaap been applied,in my determination those two expense items,the bonuses and stock option extinguishment costs would have reduced ebitda under this calculation.in response to questioning by the hoefts counsel,sherrill testified that in his opinion gaap provided more than one way to present categories of expenses and was therefore not determinative of ebitda.
at the close of the deposition,mvl counsel indicated that he would no longer seek additional discovery.several days later,mvl counsel confirmed that mvl will not be pursuing its arguments of arbitral bias due to prejudgment and that the dispute prerequisite was unmet.letter from shearin to kimmelman of,at.
after receiving additional briefing regarding the substantive accounting issues underlying the arbitration award,the district court denied the hoefts petition to confirm the award and granted mvl motion to vacate it.the district court concluded that the arbitrator had not exceeded his powers under a,but that he had manifestly disregarded the law in failing to calculate primary year ebitda in accordance with gaap.following the entry of judgment,the hoefts appealed.
discussion 
on appeal,the hoefts have launched a attack on the decision of the district court.first,they argue that because the amendment insulated the arbitration award from judicial review,the district court erred in even considering whether the arbitrator had manifestly disregarded the law.second,and in the alternative,they argue that the district court abused its discretion in permitting the arbitrator to be deposed concerning his process.third,they argue that the arbitrator neither manifestly disregarded the law nor exceeded his powers.
enforceability of private agreements to preclude judicial review of arbitration awards 
under d of the amendment,disputes over the calculation of ebitda were to be resolved by steven sherrill,whose decision in such matters shall be binding and conclusive upon each of the parties hereto and shall not be subject to any type of review or appeal whatsoever.according to the hoefts,this provision deprived the district court of the authority to examine the substance of the arbitrator decision and,thus,to review it for manifest disregard of the law.while the hoefts did invoke the district court jurisdiction in order to obtain a judgment confirming the arbitration award,they contend that there is no contradiction between their petition and their claim that the substance of the arbitrator decision is unreviewable.the hoefts rely on the stock purchase agreement and its amendment as the source of their right to seek confirmation of the award in federal court.
the district court did not determine whether a private agreement could both authorize a federal court to enter a judgment confirming an arbitral award and divest that court of the authority to review the substance of the award for manifest disregard of the law.instead,the district court assumed arguendo that parties could agree to eliminate judicial review of an arbitration award,but concluded that d of the amendment was not sufficiently clear to indicate the parties intention to do so.
in urging us to enforce the parties apparent agreement to insulate the substance of the arbitration award from judicial review,the hoefts rely on the general principle of freedom of contract and the more specific canon of deference to private agreements to arbitrate.but the freedom to contract,like any freedom,has its limits,and the hoefts reliance on the federal policy favoring arbitration overlooks several key assumptions that undergird that policy.it is in part because arbitration awards are subject to minimal judicial review that federal courts voice such strong support for the arbitral process.see gilmer lane,d we have stated that although judicial scrutiny of arbitration awards necessarily is limited,such review is sufficient to ensure that arbitrators comply with the requirements of the statute at issue.quoting.express mcmahon,d.arbitration awards are not,a fact that the hoefts,who petitioned the district court to confirm the award,can not deny.thus,while we have spoken in broad terms of deference to private agreements to arbitrate,we have always done so with an awareness of the safety net that hangs below.the faa prescribes several grounds for vacating arbitration awards that although narrow are nevertheless important.specifically,a of the faa authorizes a district court to vacate an arbitration award 
where the award was procured by corruption,fraud,or undue means 
where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,or either of them 
where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing,upon sufficient cause shown,or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced or 
where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.
a.the supreme court has supplemented the faa with an additional ground not prescribed in the statute manifest disregard of the law.see wilko swan,overruled on other grounds,rodriguez de quijas.express,d see also,merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,bobker,cir.the manifest disregard standard together with a represent a floor for judicial review of arbitration awards below which parties can not require courts to go,no matter how clear the parties intentions.
while various courts have enforced private agreements to alter the judicial review to be applied to arbitral awards,as the hoefts acknowledge,m ost of these cases have involved attempts to raise the level of judicial review otherwise available under the faa.br.of at emphasis added.see,roadway package,kayser,cir lapine tech.kyocera,cir gateway,mci telecomm,cir.decisions enforcing agreements to decrease the otherwise applicable level of judicial review are far more scarce.see bowen amoco pipeline,cir noting in dicta that parties to an arbitration agreement may eliminate judicial review by contract.am.arbitration ass n,cir same.while taking no position on the enforceability of agreements to raise the level of judicial review,we note that there is a fundamental difference between an agreement to increase the scrutiny that courts apply when considering whether to confirm or vacate an arbitration award and an agreement to prevent courts from reviewing the substance of an arbitration award at all.
an agreement that contemplates confirmation but bars all judicial review presents serious concerns.arbitration agreements are private contracts,but at the end of the process the successful party may obtain a judgment affording resort to the potent public legal remedies available to judgment creditors.in enacting a,congress impressed limited,but critical,safeguards onto this process,ones that respected the importance and flexibility of private dispute resolution mechanisms,but at the same time barred federal courts from confirming awards tainted by partiality,a lack of elementary procedural fairness,corruption,or similar misconduct.this balance would be eviscerated,and the integrity of the arbitration process could be compromised,if parties could require that awards,flawed for any of these reasons,must nevertheless be blessed by federal courts.since federal courts are not rubber stamps,parties may not,by private agreement,relieve them of their obligation to review arbitration awards for compliance with a.stavborg metal converters,cir holding that parties invocation of district court power to appoint arbitrator demonstrated their intent to permit court to review arbitral award.
the hoefts contend there is a middle ground.they would draw a distinction between the bases for vacatur enumerated in a,on the one hand,and the judicially created manifest disregard of the law standard,on the other.thus,the argument goes,we may preclude parties from contracting around a,yet permit them to contract around the manifest disregard standard.accordingly,the hoefts urge us to interpret d of the amendment as divesting the district court of the authority to review the arbitration award for manifest disregard of the law,even if it does not divest the court of the authority to review it for corruption,partiality,or the other a grounds.
but we see no reason to treat manifest disregard of the law differently from the grounds enumerated in a.through the combination of legislation and common law,narrow standards of reviewing arbitration awards have developed in the courts of this and other circuits.see,greenberg bear,stearns,cir,cert.denied,d see also,wilson,cir prestige ford ford dealer computer,cir sheldon vermonty,cir,prof l planning,cir.as the tenth circuit held in refusing to enforce a private agreement to expand judicial review of arbitration awards,in the absence of clear authority to the contrary,parties may not interfere with the judicial process by dictating how the federal courts operate.bowen,at.similarly,in a different context the supreme court has held that the mere fact that a settlement agreement provides for vacatur of a judgment does not justify vacatur,bancorp mortgage bonner mall,d,stating that judicial precedents are not merely the property of private litigants,id.at.citation and quotation marks omitted.the fact that the manifest disregard standard is a product of common law,rather than statute,makes it no less essential to the judicial review of arbitration awards.just as the supreme court held in bonner mall that private parties may not dictate to a federal court when to vacate another court judgment,we hold today that private parties may not dictate to a federal court when to enter a judgment enforcing an arbitration award.judicial standards of review,like judicial precedents,are not the property of private litigants.
lastly,we note that katz feinberg,cir,upon which the hoefts place considerable reliance,does not alter this analysis.in that case,we enforced the parties agreement to preclude arbitral review of an arbitration award,holding that a panel had exceeded its authority in modifying the award that another arbitrator had rendered.id.at.katz obviously did not hold that parties may preclude judicial review of arbitration awards,as that decision itself affirmed a district court judgment vacating a portion of an arbitration award.there is no contradiction in our differing treatment of private agreements to preclude arbitral and judicial review of arbitration awards.as the district court noted in katz,because arbitration is a creature of contract,the arbitrability of an issue derives fundamentally from the parties agreement to arbitrate.katz feinberg,d,aff,cir.thus,just as a private agreement may vest authority in an arbitrator,so may it deprive an arbitrator of that authority.unlike arbitration,however,judicial review is not a creature of contract,and the authority of a federal court to review an arbitration any other not derive from a private agreement.see,ins.of ireland,compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d holding that no action of the parties can confer jurisdiction upon a federal court.
parties seeking to enforce arbitration awards through confirmation judgments may not divest the courts of their statutory and authority to review both the substance of the awards and the arbitral process for compliance with a and the manifest disregard standard.therefore,we must examine the merits of the district court conclusion that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law in rendering his award.
ii.deposition of arbitrator 
before reaching the ultimate question of the correctness of the district court vacatur of the arbitration award,we must consider whether the court erred in permitting mvl to depose the arbitrator regarding his process and in relying on his testimony in deciding to vacate the award.the district court decisions to permit the deposition of the arbitrator generally,and to permit questioning regarding his manifest disregard of the law in particular,are reviewed for abuse of discretion.see,goetz crosson,cir lyeth chrysler,cir the district court has discretion to deny discovery in a proceeding to confirm an arbitral award.a district court abuses its discretion when its decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or its not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual be located within the range of permissible decisions.zervos verizon new york,cir.
we begin our analysis with the rule that arbitrators may not be deposed absent clear evidence of impropriety.andros compania maritima,marc rich,cir see also lyeth,at.the impropriety relied on by mvl to support its application to depose sherrill was the arbitrator alleged prejudgment of the parties dispute evidenced by his draft ebitda calculation in november.
the hoefts appear to have conceded the permissibility of deposing the arbitrator regarding his alleged prejudgment of the dispute,sherrill,at.regardless,in light of the fact that sherrill had performed,at the hoefts request and prior to the commencement of his role as arbitrator,the very calculation that was the substance of the parties dispute,the district court acted within its discretion in permitting mvl counsel to depose him regarding the allegation of prejudgment.this does not mean,however,that mvl counsel also should have been permitted to question sherrill about the substance of his process.as it turned out,mvl counsel did not question sherrill regarding his alleged prejudgment of the ebitda calculation,and mvl soon withdrew its prejudgment argument.
thus,the crux of the parties dispute regarding the deposition of the arbitrator involves the district court permitting mvl to examine him regarding his alleged manifest disregard of the law.relying principally on our decision in andros,the hoefts argue,first,that manifest disregard of the law does not constitute the sort of impropriety about which an arbitrator could ever be deposed and,second,that even if manifest disregard were an impropriety,mvl did not present clear evidence that the arbitrator had manifestly disregarded the law.we agree with the hoefts on both points.
while arbitrators may be deposed regarding claims of bias or prejudice,cases are legion in which courts have refused to permit parties to depose other judicial or the thought processes underlying their decisions.for example,the supreme court long ago declared it wholly improper to submit the members of a state administrative board to an elaborate with regard to the operation of their minds.chicago,burlington,quincy ry.babcock.the court explained its decision by reference to the rules regarding the questioning of other 
jurymen can not be called,even on a motion for a new trial in the same case,to testify to the motives and influences that led to their verdict.so,as to arbitrators all the reasons for the rule as to jurymen apply with redoubled force to the attempt,by exhibiting on the confusion of the members minds,to attack in another proceeding the judgment of a lay tribunal,which is intended,so far as may be,to be final,notwithstanding mistakes of fact or law.
id.emphasis added.courts have consistently applied this rule to parties attempting to depose arbitrators regarding their processes.see,in re risk underwriters,wl,at cir,unpublished table decision granting writ of mandamus to prevent deposition of arbitrator sperry int l trade,gov t of israel,bliznik int l harvester,noting that it would be improper to depose an arbitrator in order to inquire into the reasoning that led to his award reichman creative real estate consultants,it is clear that reichman seeks the deposition for the forbidden purpose to probe the arbitrator decisionmaking process.northwest airlines,air line pilots ass n,int l,declaring it inappropriate to attempt to probe an arbitrator decisional processes,rev on other grounds,martin weiner fred freund,inquisition of an arbitrator for the purpose of determining the processes by which he arrives at an award,
