the city of visalia police department chief of police,jerry barker,terminated police officer bryan pinto for failing to report a sexual relationship between a minor and an adult,failing to report a sexual assault between an adult and a minor,lying during the course of a criminal investigation,and encouraging an involved party to lie during the course of a criminal investigation.pinto appealed to the city manager,steven salomon,and requested an administrative hearing pursuant to the city of visalia administrative hearing procedure.after an evidentiary hearing before an arbitrator,the arbitrator found the evidence sufficient to sustain the first three allegations of misconduct and that each act was sufficient to sustain pinto termination.the city ratified the arbitrator decision.
pinto filed a petition for writ of mandate,which challenged the city findings of misconduct with respect to the first two incidents and requested the superior court to either set aside the city decision and restore him to employment or remand the matter to the city with directions to set aside the decision to terminate him and impose a lesser penalty.the trial court granted the petition,finding the evidence insufficient to support the misconduct findings with respect to the first two allegations of failure to report sexual relationships between a minor and adult,and the city abused its discretion when it terminated pinto for his admission of lying.the trial court remanded the matter to the city to impose a penalty less than termination.the trial court subsequently denied the city motion to set aside and vacate its order,and awarded pinto his attorney fees and costs pursuant to government code section.
the city of visalia,its city manager steven salomon,and its chief of police jerry barker collectively the city appeal from the judgment,contending the trial court erred when it found the second incident of failure to report a sexual assault between an adult and a minor was not supported by substantial evidence determined the penalty of termination was excessive and an abuse of discretion denied its motion to set aside and vacate its order and failed to make findings of fact to support the attorney fees award.we will affirm.
factual and procedural background 
in march,the city of visalia police department vpd hired pinto as a police officer.on march,the vpd,through its assistant chief of police robert williams,gave pinto written notice that vpd intended to terminate his employment effective april.the notice specified four causes for the dismissal in december,he was informed about a sexual relationship between a minor and an adult and failed to report it in november,he was advised of a sexual assault between an adult suspect and minor victim and failed to report it in january,he lied during the course of a criminal investigation and in december,he encouraged an involved party to lie during the course of the investigation.the letter listed seven policies of the visalia police department manual vpdm and two sections of the visalia city personnel policy guidelines which were claimed to have been violated,and notified pinto of the opportunity to respond to the allegations.as pertinent here,one of these policies was vpdm section,which provides all employees of this department are responsible for the proper reporting of child abuse.any employee who encounters any child whom he or she reasonably suspects has been the victim of child abuse,shall immediately take appropriate action and prepare a crime report pursuant to penal code section.
pinto submitted a response to the notice of intent to terminate his employment,which addressed the charges and requested williams reconsider the termination decision or consider alternate forms of discipline.vpd chief of police jerry barker reviewed williams recommendation of termination,pinto response,and the documents from the internal affairs investigation,and concurred termination was appropriate.on april,barker sent pinto a notice of termination of employment,which informed pinto he was being terminated effective april,for the same four reasons set forth in williams letter.
a.the administrative hearing 
pinto requested an administrative hearing,which was held in january.documentary evidence was introduced consisting of the internal affairs investigation file,pinto employment records,and relevant sections of the vpdm,and testimony received from pinto,vpd detective steven shear,vpd lieutenant michelle figueroa,williams,and barker.
the evidence disclosed the following facts.in september,pinto was taking a break in a gourmet coffee shop while in uniform and.a woman approached him and identified herself as the stepmother of justin helt.the woman told pinto helt was having problems with an and needed some advice,and asked pinto if he could talk to helt.pinto gave her his business card,which had his work cell phone and office phone numbers on it.about an hour later,helt called pinto on his work cell phone.helt told pinto he had recently broken up with,who he had been dating,that he felt was stalking and harassing him,and asked what he could do.pinto told helt he could take a police report for stalking or harassment,and told him how to get a restraining order.helt declined to do anything,stating he would deal with it and call pinto back if the problem continued.
pinto relationships with helt and 
later that afternoon,helt called pinto again to ask a few more questions.during this conversation,helt and pinto agreed to meet socially at the coffee shop when pinto was off duty to hang out.while at the coffee shop that night around,pinto saw a male come up behind helt,put his hand over helt eyes,and say guess who.helt got up from the table and went around the corner to talk to this person.when their conversation ended,sat down a few tables away,then left the coffee shop.helt came back to pinto table and told pinto the person was his,pinto was not introduced to and did not speak to him.
a couple weeks later,pinto was on the internet in a gay chat room when a person who identified himself as an male from tulare started talking to him there.later in the conversation,the person sent pinto a picture of himself,which pinto recognized as pinto told he knew both his identity and that he was not.from their internet exchange,pinto believed was upset and depressed about his relationship with helt and life as a gay person.pinto tried to encourage by telling him that although he is gay,he has a career as a police officer.pinto agreed to pick up at his home in tulare and take him to the coffee shop for coffee,believing he might be able to help mentor him,as pinto was an explorer advisor for the vpd explorer post and,having been a gay teenager,may have shared some of experiences and feelings.
at the meeting with,pinto became very uncomfortable with behavior,as it became apparent to pinto that was not despondent and was openly making sexual advances towards him in an attempt to make helt jealous.wanted to hook up with pinto,which means he wanted to have sex with him.pinto ended the meeting and drove back to his home.pinto gave his personal cell phone number so could call him if he needed advice.over the next four to six weeks,pinto spoke on the phone with several times.in those calls,asked pinto about helt,but also told pinto about other people he was meeting over the internet.although asked pinto if he wanted to hang out again,pinto did not meet with again because wanted one thing that night,and pinto was not going to subject himself to that kind of behavior again.
calls pinto for advice 
in late october or early november,pinto had a sexual encounter with an adult man named aaron rodriguez.in mid to late november or early december,while he was at home and,pinto received a telephone call from on his personal cell phone,asking him for general advice.asked pinto if he knew a guy named aaron.pinto said he did think so.told pinto he had talked online to aaron,who was about years old,and they agreed to meet for sex.told aaron he was years old.said aaron picked him up at his house and took him to aaron house.by the time they got there,decided maybe he did want to have sex,but he never told aaron no.said aaron pressured him to finish and offered him drugs.after having sex,went home.a couple days later,learned from others on the internet that aaron was hiv positive,and told pinto he was worried about his health.pinto told that he needed to tell his mother he needed to get tested for hiv and he needed to report the incident to the tulare police department,and offered to drive him there so he could make a report.declined pinto offer and said he wanted to talk to his mother.this was the last conversation pinto had with 
at the time of this conversation,pinto had not made the connection that the aaron was referring to was the aaron rodriguez pinto had an encounter with,and pinto did not believe the alleged sex act had taken place within the jurisdiction of the city of visalia,as appeared to refer to the city of tulare.pinto did not report claims because he had no idea where the incident occurred,he received the information while off duty and was not engaged in any law enforcement activity at the time,and he believed he was not giving advice within the course and scope of his employment.pinto acknowledged he would have been obligated to file a report had he received the information while on duty.pinto believed contacted him as a civilian,not as an officer,because did directly ask him to make a report for him and instead asked him what he should do.
the police report and criminal investigation 
eventually filed a police report with the tulare police department on december.a few days later,pinto learned from his roommate,dan martin,of a scenario a tulare police department report writing instructor related to martin police academy class,which involved a gay male adult and gay male juvenile who met on an internet chat room and agreed to have sex.the adult believed the juvenile to be an adult,based on repeated assurances of his age,and fully believed the sexual encounter was consensual and between adults.pinto realized from the scenario that this was referring to the case of and aaron,and told martin that.
sometime in late december or early january,pinto spoke with helt on his personal cell phone while.helt told pinto he learned from that helt and pinto names were mentioned in the police report,in which was accusing aaron of a sexual act.pinto asked what he was worried about.helt admitted that he and not only dated,they were also involved in a sexual relationship.this was the first time pinto learned helt and were having sex and the first time he learned his own name was mentioned in the police report,although he did not know in what context.
the police report was eventually transferred to vpd as it was within vpd jurisdiction.on january,vpd detective steve shear interviewed pinto as part of the criminal investigation.shear advised pinto he was being interviewed because his name had been brought up both as a witness and suspect in a criminal investigation,but he did not tell pinto what the investigation was about.shear told pinto he was in custody and did have to speak to him,but pinto agreed to do so.pinto told shear he believed the investigation had something to do with hooking up with people on the internet.shear asked pinto why he thought that.pinto responded that is a troubled little boy and he was introduced to him through helt after and helt broke up.pinto admitted he had talked to online a couple times,was always asking pinto for advice,which he gave him,and called him in regards to his situation with aaron.
shear questioned pinto about how he met helt and,and what told him about aaron.pinto told shear he knew helt and had a sexual relationship when was.when asked if he knew aaron,pinto admitted he knew who he was,who he hung out with,and that he had met him,but said he never hung out with aaron socially or anything like that.pinto also admitted having talked to aaron in person.pinto told shear that one time he picked up and took him to the coffee shop,and that wanted to hook up with him,but he turned down.shear asked pinto,did you have a relationship with aaron at all ever pinto responded,no.shear said,never pinto again responded,no.shear then asked pinto about his meeting with at the coffee shop and whether had ever been inside pinto house pinto denied that he had.when shear asked if there was any reason should be able to describe his bedroom,pinto responded no,u nless he heard it from other people.
shear then explained was alleging he had consensual sex with pinto on two occasions and asked pinto if it happened.pinto stated absolutely not.pinto explained that he and knew the same people,so if this is just a big set up for me,there might be things that he might know about my house or my bedroom pinto agreed to allow shear to take pictures of the inside of his house,but denied doing anything with.shear asked pinto if he knew whether aaron used a drug named amal nitrate.pinto responded,i have no idea.not on a personal basis.i said hi to him,i met him,we never hung out,we never had a personal conversation.i do know.shear said claimed he told pinto about aaron before ever learned about the hiv issue,that pinto indicated to at that time that he knew aaron,and called pinto again for advice when found out aaron may be hiv positive.according to shear,said pinto told him during the second conversation he knew about aaron hiv status during the first conversation but did say anything,and the same night had hooked up with him,pinto had hooked up with him too.pinto told shear,did not hook up with him that night.i have hooked up with aaron once before way in the past.pinto denied telling that he hooked up with aaron.shear explained further the allegations was making against pinto and aaron.the interview ended with pinto agreeing to allow shear to come to his house to take pictures.
pinto admitted at the administrative hearing that he initially lied when he did not tell shear he had a sexual relationship with aaron.pinto explained he did not initially tell shear about his relationship with aaron because he believed it was a matter involving his personal life,it was none of shear business who pinto had sex with,as there was nothing criminal about his relationship with aaron,and learning aaron was hiv positive freaked him out,as he was concerned for his health and the stigma he would carry if his colleagues learned he had sex with an hiv positive person.pinto also did not see any connection between his sexual liaison with aaron and his being a suspect in this case.pinto testified he never had a personal conversation with aaron or hung out with him socially he described their relationship as an encounter.sometime between the time told pinto about encounter with aaron and pinto interview with shear,pinto had put two and two together and realized the aaron referred to was in fact aaron rodriguez shear testified he asked pinto about his relationship with aaron to help corroborate account.
the internal affairs investigation 
after the interview,pinto was placed on paid administrative leave.as a result of the criminal investigation,an internal affairs investigation was initiated in february and completed in march.vpd lieutenant michelle figueroa was in charge of the investigation and found several violations of vpd policy including pinto failed to report the sexual activity between aaron and,and helt and,which he was required to do because he learned the information in his capacity as a police officer and he knew he was a police officer hours per day,days per week he urged helt to lie during the course of the investigation he initially lied to shear when questioned about his relationship with aaron and he exercised bad judgment in continuing a relationship with figueroa forwarded her findings to her supervisor,lieutenant wheeler,for his review,who in turn forwarded them to assistant chief of police bob williams.
figueroa did not consult any legal opinions when determining whether pinto was required to report the sexual relationships between,aaron and helt.in her opinion,pinto was a police officer hours per day,days per week,even though no vpd policy states this neither does any vpd policy state that officers are required to report child abuse when they learn the information while.figueroa further explained that because pinto himself believed he was a police officer hours per day,days per week,he was on duty and therefore obligated to report the sexual relationships.in her report,figueroa stated that when she interviewed pinto,she asked him if he would submit to a voice stress analysis test to clear up some inconsistencies if would also do so.pinto said no.figueroa denied,however,that pinto refusal was a factor in her determinations.figueroa testified that although pinto was under criminal investigation during the internal affairs investigation,by the time of the administrative hearing,there were no criminal charges pending against him 
during figueroa investigation,chief barker issued a memorandum to all police personnel,which stated in pertinent part on february,the news that one of our own was being charged with a criminal act with a minor was made public.as with other situations and allegations involving the actions of one person,those actions,to a degree,affect,not only each of us in this department,but also members of our community.the universal questions being asked are how could this happen in our department and how could someone we know be in this situation we conduct extensive background investigations,grill the applicants with questions in interviews and assessment panels,conduct psychological exams,physical exams,and,i personally conduct interviews with each person prior to being hired.the percentage of applicants hired versus the total number of applicants that apply to this organization is miniscule.when evaluating applicants and trainees,we have always looked as deeply as possible into their minds and hearts.to answer the questions that we are all asking ourselves,i am reminded of a comment a very famous chief of police made who found his own department in a similar situation and stated,the only thing wrong with police officers is that we have to hire them from the human race.figueroa denied the memorandum indicated to her that pinto was guilty of anything.figueroa had no knowledge of pinto lying before this investigation.
assistant chief williams reviewed the internal affairs investigation and requested that lieutenant wheeler present the case to senior staff,which included those with the rank of lieutenant and above,as well as two civilians.the group unanimously recommended termination.williams also concluded termination was appropriate.accordingly,he sent out the march letter notifying pinto of vpd intent to terminate him.williams believed pinto conduct did not live up to vpd standards and was unbecoming to vpd because the conduct,if known by all,would lower vpd image and the community confidence in vpd.in williams opinion,the nature of a police officer job is hours per day,days per week,and a police officer is subject to the mandated reporting requirements regardless of whether the officer is on or off duty.williams believed pinto was acting as a police officer and was on duty when he gave advice to both and helt,as the advice drew from his training and experience.according to williams,a motto of vpd is you lie,your career dies,and if an officer lies,his credibility is gone and difficult trust issues develop between officers.in williams opinion,a police officer is on duty whenever he learns about something that must be reported,although he admitted this expectation is not spelled out in vpd policy.according to williams,pinto has not been known to lie in the past and has not been punished by vpd for failing to tell the truth.
chief barker testified he believed pinto conduct was unbecoming to vpd because he made a series of poor judgments and put vpd in a position of liability by his relationship with barker believed when a police officer takes an oath of office he an officer hours per day and is held to a higher standard.according to barker,an officer disciplined for lying would put cases in which he is involved in jeopardy.barker admitted his policy is you lie,you die.barker testified that even if the only allegation that came forward out of this case was that pinto lied during the course of the criminal investigation,he would still have terminated pinto.barker admitted,however,that if an officer lied once in an interview and then tried to rectify a situation by correcting the lie before the interview ended,and there was the allegation of criminal activity and the other things that surround this case,he did think he could have made the decision to terminate.
the parties stipulated that if called as witnesses,vpd sergeants scoffield and phipps,and agent brown pinto supervisor in the explorer unit,would testify that pinto worked for them,they directly supervised him,his work was above average,and they never had any problems with any of these allegations while he was working with them.
the decision to uphold the termination of pinto employment 
on march,the arbitrator issued a proposed decision in which he made findings of fact and concluded the evidence was sufficient to sustain pinto termination for the first three allegations,namely that pinto failed to report the sexual relationships between,helt,and aaron,and pinto lied during a criminal investigation.he found the evidence insufficient,however,to sustain pinto termination with regard to the allegation he encouraged another to lie during a criminal investigation.the arbitrator further found that the acts of misconduct which the evidence sustained violated the vpdm sections and visalia personnel policy guidelines enumerated in the notice of termination of employment.he made findings of fact in substance as follows vpdm section,which mandates all vpd employees to report instances of child abuse,does not limit the employee reporting responsibilities to only times when the employee obtains the information while on duty nevertheless,pinto was in performance of his duties when he obtained the information regarding the sexual relationships between,aaron and helt,as the people who contacted him viewed him as an officer,sought his advice based on his status as an officer,and pinto advice was based on his knowledge and training as an officer the fact that pinto learned helt and were in a dating relationship required him to file a police report pinto awareness of the sexual relationship between and aaron required him to file a police report shear question about pinto relationship with aaron was a legitimate question for police investigation business,there was no excuse for pinto untruth,and that pinto recanted was irrelevant to the fact that he clearly lied.on april,city manager steven salomon issued a final administrative decision upholding the arbitrator proposed decision,and terminated pinto from his employment effective april.
b.the petition for writ of mandate 
pinto filed a petition for writ of mandate in superior court,in which he asserted the city abused its discretion as follows pinto complied with vpdm section in that he acted pursuant to penal code section the city and vpd have no specific policies regarding mandated reporting requirements while off duty the city relied on unwritten or unknown policies,violating pinto due process rights and in terminating pinto.the petition requested a writ issue directing the city to set aside the decision and restore pinto to employment or,in the alternative,remand the matter to salomon with directions to set aside the decision and impose a penalty less than termination.the petition also sought attorney fees as allowed under government code section.
following oral argument on the petition,the trial court issued a written order granting the writ and remanding the matter to the city to impose a penalty less than termination.with respect to the arbitrator findings that pinto was required to report the relationships between,helt and aaron,the trial court found vpdm section required pinto to be either on duty or have received the information in his professional capacity before he was obligated to make a report there was no evidence that pinto knew the relationship between and helt was a sexual one and while pinto knew of the sexual relationship between and aaron,he was not or acting in his professional capacity when he obtained the information,as helt,and pinto were social friends.with respect to the allegation of lying,the trial court found that as there was no published you lie,you die policy,pinto due process rights would be violated if he was terminated for lying.the trial court also found barker letter and the reference to pinto refusal to take a voice stress analysis test were prejudicial to pinto.the court concluded pinto conduct in not being truthful to the investigating officer is not conduct that the city,or the court,would want repeated,but the court can not find that it justifies termination under these circumstances,and finds an abuse of discretion by the arbitrator and the city.therefore,making its own independent judgment,the court finds the preponderance of the evidence does not support the finding of the arbitrator or the city for the first two allegations.the court finds the penalty was excessive,and an abuse of discretion,for the admission of lying under these particular facts.the court awarded pinto his costs and attorney fees under government code section.
c.the motions to set aside the trial court order and for attorney fees 
the city filed a motion to set aside and vacate the trial court order,which asserted,in pertinent part,the court order was incorrect,erroneous and not consistent with the facts as the trial court conclusion that pinto did not obtain the information about the relationship between aaron and in his professional capacity was contrary to vpd stated policy,pinto due process rights were not violated,as there are published policies against dishonesty which pinto lying violated,and the court abused its authority in substituting its own judgment for that of the city in determining the propriety of the penalty imposed,as the court must find a manifest abuse of discretion occurred and the order failed to reflect any such findings.pinto opposed the motion.
following oral argument,the trial court denied the motion.in a written order,the trial court stated it did not construe the order granting the writ as a statement of decision because no statement of decision was requested.the trial court found the city failed to show the legal basis for the court decision was incorrect or erroneous.the court further stated it had found termination was a manifest abuse of discretion,the city imposition of the discipline of termination under these circumstances exceeded all bounds of reason,and termination was excessive when it was not shown that this momentary discretion in answering a question regarding his private sex life affected the officer ability to perform his duties presented future harm to the public.
pinto filed a motion for attorney fees,which sought in attorney fees,and a memorandum of costs.the city opposed only the request for attorney fees.the trial court granted the motion,noting that its order denying the city motion to set aside stated the discipline imposed was arbitrary,capricious and a patently abusive exercise of discretion because it exceeded all bounds of reason,and this finding authorized the award of fees under government code section.the court also awarded the entire amount claimed as costs.
discussion 
failure to report child abuse 
the city first challenges the trial court finding that pinto did not engage in misconduct when he failed to report the relationship between and aaron the city argues the trial court erroneously interpreted the city personnel policy regarding mandated reporting as requiring an employee to report suspected child abuse only if the employee receives the information while on duty or within the employee professional capacity,and even if the trial court construed the policy correctly,substantial evidence does not support the trial court decision that pinto was not acting in his professional capacity when he received the information.
standard of review 
code of civil procedure section provides the basic framework for judicial review of any final order or decision rendered by a state or local agency.bixby pierno cal d.where,as here,the administrative decision substantially affects a fundamental right,the trial court conducting such a review not only examines the administrative record for errors of law,but also exercises its independent judgment to determine whether the findings are supported by the evidence.id.at,skelly state personnel bd.cal d.the trial court resolves evidentiary conflicts and assesses witnesses credibility to arrive at its own independent findings of fact.deegan city of mountain view th,d deegan.if the trial court concludes the agency findings of misconduct are not supported by the weight of the evidence,it is required to find that the agency abused its discretion.kazensky city of merced th,d kazensky.
after the trial court has independently reviewed an administrative agency factual findings,however,a different standard of review applies to the appellate court.davis civil service com.th,d.an appellate court must sustain the trial court findings if substantial evidence supports them.kazensky,supra,th at,d.thus,the appellate court must resolve all evidentiary conflicts in favor of the party prevailing in the trial court and must give that party the benefit of every reasonable inference in support of the judgment.ibid.moreover,where more than one inference reasonably can be deduced from the facts,the appellate court can not substitute its deductions for those of the trial court.ibid.
while we review a trial court ruling on a petition for writ of mandate under the substantial evidence test,this standard does not apply to resolution of questions of law where the facts are undisputed.in such cases,we are not bound by the trial court decision but may make our own determination.lomeli department of corrections th,d alba los angeles unified school dist.d.when the facts do not conflict and the issues involve proper application of a statute or administrative regulation,a reviewing court is not bound by the trial court determination.accordingly,we must sustain the trial court factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence and reverse the trial court if it failed to make a necessary factual determination or made an erroneous legal determination.kazensky,supra,th at,d.
interpretation of vpdm section 
vpdm section provides all employees of this department are responsible for the proper reporting of child abuse.any employee who encounters any child whom he or she reasonably suspects has been the victim of child abuse,shall immediately take appropriate action and prepare a crime report pursuant to penal code.subdivision a of penal code section provides in pertinent part,a mandated reporter shall make a report to an agency specified in penal code section whenever the mandated reporter,in his or her professional capacity or within the scope of his or her employment,has knowledge of or observes a child whom the mandated reporter knows or reasonably suspects has been the victim of child abuse or neglect a mandated reporter includes a peace officer,subd.a.
the city argued below that vpdm section is broader than penal code section,in that it requires all employees to report all known and reasonably suspected incidents of child abuse,not just abuse an employee becomes aware of while in the scope of employment or acting within his or her professional capacity.the trial court,however,rejected that interpretation,finding instead that vpdm section incorporates the restrictions of penal code section,namely that a mandated reporter is only required to report suspected child abuse when the information is obtained in the employee professional capacity or within the scope of employment,and therefore pinto only could have violated section if he failed to report suspected abuse he learned about either while on duty or within his professional capacity.
the city contends the trial court interpretation is wrong,repeating the argument raised below that vpdm section requires reporting of child abuse whenever the employee acquires information of abuse.the city,however,does not cite any legal authority to support its argument or that shows the proper interpretation of the policy.accordingly,we may treat the argument as waived.see akins state of california th,d contention waived by failure to cite legal authority atchley city of fresno d.a point asserted by appellant without argument or authority need not be discussed by reviewing court see also cal.rules of court,rule.we do so here,and therefore find no basis to reject the trial court interpretation of vpdm section.
whether pinto violated the policy 
the trial court found that pinto did not violate vpdm section when he failed to report the relationship between and aaron because he did not obtain the information either while on duty or in his professional capacity.in so finding,the trial court rejected the arbitrator determination that because helt stepmother contacted pinto in his official capacity,later contact was also in pinto official capacity.instead,the trial court found that pinto did not obtain the information in his professional capacity because helt and pinto,both adults,had become social friends pinto met on the internet and recognized his photograph as being the person he met with helt and pinto took the call in which reported his relationship with aaron while on his private cell phone two to three months after helt stepmother contacted pinto.the trial court reasoned that this passage of time,coupled with the fact that and pinto had become social friends,showed that pinto did not obtain the information in his professional capacity.
the city argues these findings are not supported by substantial evidence.specifically,the city asserts that because pinto gave advice when called to discuss his relationship with aaron,pinto necessarily was acting in his professional capacity as a law enforcement officer because his responses were based on his police officer training,experience and knowledge.essentially,the city is contending that when a mandated reporter receives information of suspected child abuse in a personal capacity,but then gives advice based on his or her professional training,the reporter is now acting in his or her professional capacity and therefore is required to comply with penal code section.
we do not agree the mere giving of advice means that pinto received the information about and aaron within his professional capacity.to hold otherwise would mean a mandated reporter who gives advice on an informal basis would be exposed to liability for failure to report suspected child abuse regardless of the circumstances in which the information was obtained.we note that penal code section imposes the obligation to report suspected child abuse on a mandated reporter who is acting in either a professional capacity or within the scope of employment,subd.a.the apparent reason for including both limitations is that mandated reporters include occupations in which the individual is either an employee,such as teachers,instructional aides,administrators and peace officers,or a professional who renders professional services,such as a physician,psychiatrist,or psychologist,who is not necessarily an employee,subd.a.in situations where the mandated reporter renders professional services,the obligation to report is imposed when the mandated reporter obtains the information while rendering such services.see,krikorian barry d.in most cases,mandatory child abuse reporting will be preceded by the rendering of professional services by the party making the report.
here,substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that pinto did not receive the information from about his relationship with aaron either within the scope of employment or while rendering professional services.pinto was not working as a police officer when called him and he gave advice,as he was off duty and at home when he received phone call pinto did not assume the duties of a police officer during the conversation and and pinto had a social relationship.that pinto may have drawn on his training and experience as a police officer when giving advice does not mean he was rendering professional services,as pinto was not working as a police officer at the time.contrary to the city assertion,pinto did not receive the information in his capacity as a police officer,and therefore the fact he gave advice does not transform the conversation with into the rendering of professional services.
in sum,the trial court finding that pinto did not receive the information about suspected child abuse either in the scope of his employment or in a professional capacity is supported by substantial evidence.accordingly,the city claim that pinto committed misconduct in failing to report that information fails.
abuse of discretion in imposing termination as a penalty 
having found substantial evidence supported only one of the three allegations of misconduct,the trial court determined the city abused its discretion in terminating pinto for the one remaining incident of misconduct,finding the penalty excessive under the circumstances.the city challenges the trial court determination regarding the penalty,arguing it did not abuse its discretion in deciding to terminate pinto for his misconduct.
standard of review 
we review de novo an administrative agency exercise of discretion in imposing a penalty.talmo civil service com.d.we give no deference to the trial court determination with regard to penalty,but rather review the agency selection of penalty and,if reasonable minds could differ with regard to the propriety of the disciplinary action,find no abuse of discretion.deegan,supra,th at,d.it is only in the exceptional case,when it is shown that reasonable minds can not differ on the propriety of the penalty,that an abuse of discretion is shown.id.at,d.judicial interference with the agency assessment of a penalty will only be sanctioned when there is an arbitrary,capricious or patently abusive exercise of discretion by the administrative agency.kazensky,supra,th at,d.in reviewing the penalty imposed by an administrative body which is duly constituted to announce and enforce such penalties,neither a trial court nor an appellate court is free to substitute its own discretion as to the matter nor can the reviewing court interfere with the imposition of a penalty by an administrative tribunal because in the court own evaluation of the circumstances the penalty appears to be too harsh.citation.pegues civil service com.th,d.
as one appellate court explained,d iscretion is abused where the penalty imposed exceeds the bounds of reason the fact reasonable minds may differ as to the propriety of the penalty supports a finding the administrative decisionmaker acted within its discretion.citation.in determining whether the penalty of termination was excessive as a matter of law,the overriding considerations are the extent of harm to the public service resulting from the employee conduct or the likelihood such conduct,if repeated,would result in such harm other considerations are the circumstances surrounding the employee misconduct and the likelihood of its recurrence.citation.paulino civil service com.d.accord,deegan,supra,th at,d kazensky,supra,th at,d.
abuse of discretion 
consideration of these principles in this case leads us to conclude the discipline imposed clearly was excessive.when the city ratified and adopted the arbitrator decision,it concluded the termination of pinto employment was appropriate and warranted by the three acts of misconduct which the arbitrator concluded the evidence supported.as the trial court found,however,only one of those acts was supported by substantial evidence,namely pinto admission that he did not tell the truth when shear asked him during the criminal investigation whether he had a relationship with aaron.the issue then is whether termination was an excessive penalty given this one incident of misconduct.we believe it is.
we first note the arbitrator decision mischaracterized the incident.the arbitrator found that shear asked pinto if he had had sex with aaron,and pinto responded by denying knowing aaron rodriguez.the transcript of the interview,however,shows that pinto never denied knowing who aaron was,as pinto admitted before shear asked whether he had a relationship with aaron that he knew who aaron was,had met him,and had talked to him in person.after admitting he knew aaron,pinto answered no when shear asked whether pinto had a relationship with aaron at all ever although the question did not ask specifically whether he had sex with aaron,apparently pinto believed that was what shear was asking and therefore admitted he was not candid with shear when he denied having a relationship with aaron.shear then continued questioning pinto about his relationship with and whether had been inside his house,and explained allegations of consensual sex with pinto,which pinto denied.when shear explained that was claiming pinto had hooked up with aaron the same night he did,pinto immediately admitted he had hooked up with aaron in the past.
a review of the record reveals a lack of evidence directly showing how pinto lack of candor adversely affected the public service.the harm in pinto response to shear question was primarily to himself,as it lessened his credibility in the eyes of the investigating officers.it is apparent from figueroa testimony at the administrative hearing,however,that she did not believe pinto regardless of his response to this question,as she accepted as credible the statements helt,helt stepbrother,and made during interviews with shear without interviewing them herself,but believed pinto,who she did interview,was not credible because his statements conflicted with the other three.figueroa and shear also accepted as credible statements helt made in a second interview with shear despite the fact helt lied throughout his first interview with shear,because helt returned voluntarily to shear for the second interview the same day as the first one and admitted his culpability in a crime,namely his sexual relationship with minimal harm resulted from pinto lack of candor because by the time the interview ended,pinto had corrected his response and fully informed shear about his relationship with aaron,albeit after shear explained why the information was relevant.thus,the investigating officer had the facts before leaving the interview room.
the city primary concern appears to be that pinto will never be able to be an effective witness in court because once the defense bar learns of his misconduct,he will be impeached with it on.we note that,n otwithstanding the prosecutor duty to disclose material evidence to the defense,t here is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case citations.thus,the prosecution has no general duty to seek out,obtain,and disclose all evidence that might be beneficial to the defense.citation.people jordan th,d.while a criminal defendant does have a statutory right to discovery of an officer misconduct,a right commonly invoked through what is known as a motion,to obtain access to an officer personnel records the defendant must show,inter alia,the information sought is material to the particular subject matter involved in the pending litigation.even then,the statutory framework specifically excludes from disclosure evidence of misconduct that is more than five years old,the conclusions of investigating officers,and facts that are so remote as to make disclosure of little or no practical benefit,subd.b.
the incident at issue here is already over three years old.as time goes by,it is less and less likely a court will find it discoverable.see city of los angeles superior court cal th,d,even though incident in question related to police officer general veracity,it was not discoverable because it was over five years old and did not involve the same type of misconduct alleged in the case at hand california highway patrol superior court th,d discovery request for records reflecting officers dishonesty,including an investigation into a time card issue,failed to provide good cause for disclosure.
as for the prosecution general constitutional duty of disclosure,that duty is limited to evidence that is material in the sense its disclosure would be reasonably likely to affect the outcome of the case.brady maryland,d.this standard of materiality is narrower than the pitchess requirements city of los angeles superior court,supra,cal th at,d,so it stands to reason that a criminal defendant would have a hard time arguing a brady violation based on a prosecutor failure to disclose pinto conduct in a given case.
while we can not say with absolute certainty that pinto will never have to face questioning about his misconduct at some point during his career on the force,if that did occur,he would not be the first officer forced to confront a prior act of dishonesty.the human condition being what it is,few witnesses come to the stand with an unblemished record of telling the truth.our adversarial system recognizes that and allows an accused the opportunity to delve into issues of credibility if they are germane to the issues at hand.yet,the system also provides means for rehabilitation and the opportunity for explanation.in other words,it recognizes that there are usually two sides to every story and not every act of dishonesty will inevitably destroy a witness credibility in the jury eyes.experience teaches this is true even when the witness happens to be a police officer.
the city argues lying is a character trait that most likely will be repeated.no evidence was presented at the administrative hearing,however,that pinto had a history of lying or deception,or that his immediate supervisors or had any difficulty with him in this regard.thus,there is nothing in the record to indicate the incident was anything but an aberration we are mindful of the cases the city cites that have sanctioned the termination of police officers and other state employees for dishonesty.those cases are distinguishable,however,because they involved more serious misconduct than presented here.see kolender san diego county civil service commission th,d sheriff deputy was properly terminated for lying in an interview to cover up a fellow deputy physical abuse of an inmate,even though the deputy ultimately told the truth one week later after his lie was discovered and he was pressed for the truth nicolini county of tuolumne d.upholding deputy sheriff termination for dishonesty when he altered a prescription for a narcotic and filled the prescription while in uniform ackerman state personnel board d.upholding officer termination for misappropriating motorcycle parts by stating they were needed for his motorcycle and installing them on his privately owned motorcycle,and later denying he had done so to an investigating officer wilson state personnel board d.upholding termination of fish and game warden who misused state property his state vehicle for personal business and filed false reports for overtime and cash expense allowances.
in concluding termination is an excessive penalty,we also consider the unique circumstances surrounding the misconduct in this case,as well as vpd decision to recommend pinto termination.it is apparent the vpd prejudged pinto throughout its investigation,which clouded its judgment.this is shown by chief barker memorandum,issued before the conclusion of the internal affairs investigation,which implied pinto guilt of the criminal charges against him and figueroa reference in her internal affairs report to pinto refusal to take a voice stress analysis test in addition,both figueroa and shear accepted helt statements over pinto not only because they conflicted,but because,as shear explained,helt was honest enough to admit his own culpability in a crime,while pinto was trying to minimize his own culpability for a host of things.
vpd attitude toward pinto is probably summed up best in the following exchange between pinto attorney and chief barker okay.and if an officer was in an interview,such as the case with bryan pinto,and he was asked a,let say any officer was asked a question,did you have a sexual relationship with this person and that officer stated,no,and then clarified later on before the interview was over,before the tape went off,and said,let me rephrase that,let me correct myself,yeah,i did have that,you would consider that a mandatory termination you ki
