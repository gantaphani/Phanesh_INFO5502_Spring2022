respondents city of hope,city of hope national medical center and beckman research institute of city of hope collectively city of hope own and operate a research facility and a cancer treatment facility located in duarte,california.in the then chief executive officer of city of hope,sanford shapero,fired the then chief operating officer,doe shapero then promoted andrew leeka to replace doe.doe responded by accusing leeka and shapero of sexual harassment.after an investigation by outside counsel,city of hope settled the matter by paying money in exchange for a release and confidentiality agreement.
in march,doe former administrative assistants,doe and doe,were transferred out of city of hope administrative offices.they also retained doe attorney,who proceeded to file yet another accusation against city of hope.those matters were apparently resolved without extensive litigation.
during this time relations between city of hope board of directors the board and shapero and leeka hereafter sometimes former officers had deteriorated.in july,shapero arranged for leeka contract of employment to be renegotiated with a golden parachute for leeka.on january,city of hope and shapero executed a settlement agreement and mutual release and shapero formally resigned from city of hope.as part of the settlement and mutual release,shapero agreed not to disparage or disclose city of hope confidences.
on april,less than days after shapero departure,leeka informed city of hope he was resigning his position.leeka further informed city of hope that,since this was within days of shapero departure,he was entitled to his golden parachute a payment in excess of million within days.negotiations ensued and on september,new agreements were signed between shapero,leeka and city of hope.among other benefits to shapero were payments of over a period and a million life insurance policy to be paid by city of hope with shapero sister as the named beneficiary.leeka renegotiated agreement provided for him to receive in excess of.
the problems at city of hope did not end with the departure of shapero and leeka.in november,city of hope was sued by pat nichols,shapero former executive secretary,who alleged she had been wrongfully terminated because she had been friendly with shapero and leeka and had spoken truthfully about wrongful activities on the part of the new city of hope officers thereafter,at least four more complaints were filed against city of hope.additionally,allegations were made against city of hope by shapero and leeka.also,one of shapero friends spoke to the attorney general office,which commenced an inquiry about city of hope.
the wgm,fairfax group lawsuit 
on july,city of hope filed suit against the fairfax group,decision international,and michael hershman collectively fairfax and against wgm,alleging fraud,breach of contract,constructive fraud,and legal malpractice.two months later,on september,a first amended complaint was filed against the same entities.
a.the fairfax allegations fraud,constructive fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty,rescission and restitution 
city of hope alleged that,in july,fairfax had been hired to act as an independent confidential monitor to investigate compliance with applicable laws and to develop internal policies relating to compliance.unknown to the board,hershman had a prior relationship with shapero and soon joined the former officers in their attempt to discredit the board and also discredit city of hope.the former officers scheme to discredit included,among other things,using misleading facts to create distorted,incomplete stories about members of the board and disseminating those stories to the local and national media.additionally,the former officers intended to provoke an investigation by the california attorney general of groundless charges and instigate groundless lawsuits based upon those charges.hershman was aware of the scheme and failed to disclose to the board the prior relationship with shapero that the former officers had a conflict of interest with city of hope and that the true purpose of his agreeing to serve as a compliance monitor was to assist the former officers in their scheme to discredit city of hope.
when tensions between the former officers and the board intensified in late and the first part of,hershman and fairfax continued to align themselves with the former officers and obtained confidential information from city of hope that they passed on to shapero and leeka.because of the duplicitous conduct of fairfax,city of hope allowed the former officers to enter into generous settlement agreements,which included substantial excess compensation.had city of hope known the true facts,it would have terminated the former officers.
city of hope further alleged fairfax conduct continued even after the former officers departure in early.fairfax,in its position as an independent monitor,continued to receive confidential information for city of hope.this information was then passed on to the former officers.as part of the ongoing plan to discredit city of hope,fairfax prepared a report fairfax report concerning alleged wrongdoings of the board that was based on twisted,misleading and distorted facts.as part of the vindictive efforts towards the board,drafts of the fairfax report were distributed to the cbs television program minutes,the los angeles times and the california attorney general office.these actions had the effect of creating an expensive and public relations problem for city of hope.additionally,based in part upon information obtained from fairfax,the nichols action had been wrongfully and maliciously filed in order to exact vengeance against city of hope.
during the course of the fairfax contract,city of hope paid fairfax in excess of million in fees,even though fairfax conduct was,for the most part,aimed at harming its own client,city of hope.city of hope further alleged the plan to discredit city of hope had finally been foiled.there had been two arbitrations with different judges between the former officers and city of hope.in each arbitration,a respected former superior court judge of the los angeles superior court had found the two former officers engaged in a scheme of vengeance against city of hope.as a result,money judgments and injunctions had been entered against the former officers prohibiting the former officers from disparaging city of hope.
however,city of hope further alleged,it was still uncompensated for the more than million it had paid fairfax for services it incurred while fairfax was breaching its duties to city of hope.city of hope had also incurred substantial expenses defending against the baseless negative media campaign and groundless lawsuits.finally,city of hope had paid substantial excess compensation to the former officers because of,among other things,the fairfax defendants concealment of the scheme to disparage city of hope.in the prayer,city of hope requested rescission of the fairfax contract,damages and punitive damages.
b.the wgm allegations fraud,legal malpractice,breach of fiduciary duty,aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty and petition for writ of mandate 
in that portion of the complaint directed at wgm,city of hope alleged that it had hired wgm at the urging of hershman,fairfax principal.wgm was engaged to provide counsel in connection with the evaluation of the fairfax investigations that were to occur.city of hope further alleged that,from the very beginning,wgm conferred with hershman and the former officers about and assisted the former officers with their hidden agenda.in particular,a wgm partner,received,from one of the former officers,a document which described the board as the enemies and spoke of threatening litigation against city of hope as a way for the former officers to gain some leverage in negotiating for their own.
wgm was also privy to documents revealing that the fairfax defendants were not acting as independent neutral monitors of city of hope but were instead helping the former officers in their actions against city of hope.also reviewed documents from counsel for the former officers in connection with the former officers ongoing battles with the board.wgm had refused to,and is still refusing to give those documents to city of hope.wgm never disclosed to city of hope the apparent conflicts of interest between the former officers and city of hope,nor did wgm ever disclose any information about the activities and intentions of the former officers.instead,wgm advised and counseled the former officers in their war against city of hope,while billing city of hope for more than in attorneys fees.
city of hope further alleged wgm had violated its ethical obligations by representing city of hope while at the same time giving legal advice to the former officers failing to advise city of hope of the conflicts between the former officers and city of hope continuing to represent city of hope without having disclosed the legal conflicts to city of hope and failing to disclose to anyone at city of hope,other than the former officers,what it knew about the actions and intentions of the former officers,fairfax and others acting in concert with them.
against wgm,city of hope requested general damages,punitive damages,and a writ of mandate directing wgm to allow city of hope to copy all of its client files.
all defendants answered and wgm filed a seeking unpaid attorneys fees.
the bryan cave complaint 
two and months later,on november,city of hope filed a separate complaint against bryan cave.the complaint alleged that,since,bryan cave had been on a retainer to provide legal services to city of hope.in when the sexual misconduct charges were made against the former officers,the former officers made plans for leeka to get a new employment contract with city of hope as a reward for his loyalty to shapero.neither of the former officers advised the board or the outside counsel who usually drafted executive employment contracts of the new intended contract.
it was further alleged that in april or may of,before the completion of the investigation of the sexual misconduct charges,shapero approached thompson at bryan cave and asked her to draft leeka new employment contract.shapero stated he did not want to lose leeka and a new contract would secure leeka loyalty.the new contract was intended to provide leeka with,among other benefits,increased tenure and a golden parachute provision.neither thompson nor anyone else at bryan cave had previously been asked to draft an executive employment contract for a city of hope employee up until that time thompson primary duties for city of hope had been in dealing with union matters.
thompson was aware of the investigation on the sexual misconduct charges and that the jobs of the former officers might be in jeopardy.she was therefore aware,or should have been aware,that until the investigation was completed,it was not in the best interest of city of hope to give leeka a contract that would provide him extra tenure or a golden parachute.although thompson advised shapero to reevaluate the appropriateness of the request and recommended that shapero wait,she did not inform the board or city of hope counsel in charge of the former officers investigations.
about a month later,in june,thompson was again approached by shapero,who once again asked her to draft a new contract for leeka.at that time,leeka personal attorney expressed concern to thompson about proceeding with the new contract in light of the pending charges against the former officers.even though she knew the former officers futures with city of hope were uncertain,thompson agreed and drafted a new employment contract for leeka.bryan cave and thompson billed city of hope for their consultations with shapero and leeka,but once again thompson failed to inform the board or counsel that she had been asked to draft a new contract for leeka.
in secretly drafting leeka new contract,thompson added several provisions that were adverse to the best interests of city of hope and were also a conflict of interest on her part since she had been retained by and was being paid by city of hope.the provisions that were adverse to city of hope best interest included lengthening the term of the contract from two to five years eliminating a provision so that leeka could no longer be terminated for acts or omissions that damaged the reputation or standing of city of hope adding a change in control the golden parachute provision which allowed leeka to terminate his employment if shapero left city of hope and removing,as an entity to be notified should leeka resign,the law firm which was representing city of hope,but not the former officers,in the sexual misconduct action.the lengthening of leeka term from two to five years was unusual in that no executive other than shapero,the ceo,was allowed to have a contract term longer than two years.the golden parachute,in addition to allowing leeka to quit if shapero left city of hope,also allowed leeka to accelerate all of the amounts due under the terms of the contract and collect as much as million,even if shapero was terminated for cause.
on july,before leeka contract had been finalized,thompson met with the incoming chairman of the board of directors and counsel for city of hope on the sexual misconduct claims.the subject of the meeting was the status of the claims against the former officers.thompson was advised city of hope was planning to hire an independent investigator who was going to report directly to the board.when the chairman would not guarantee that the former officers would not suffer negative repercussions,thompson began to personally attack him.at that point,thompson had to be reminded that the city of hope was her client,not the former officers.at the july meeting,thompson did not inform either the chairman or counsel that she was in the process of redrafting leeka employment contract with its golden parachute provision.
within a day or two of the july meeting,thompson telephoned shapero and expressed her concerns about her role in drafting the leeka contract and stated she had to cover herself.shapero advised her to put her concerns in a letter to him.four days later,on july,thompson forwarded the final drafts of the leeka contract to shapero and leeka.she also wrote the letter suggested by shapero.she recommended disclosure to the board and stated she was concerned because i would consider the change in control provision to be important for sandy shapero to disclose to the board in the event there are any discussions about his departure before the expiration of his contract.otherwise,this provision could result in substantial economic consequences which are unforeseen by the institution at the time such decisions are made.
once again thompson did not inform the board or any counsel of the secret contract and specifically did not forward any copies of the agreement to any counsel or the board.on july,leeka signed his contract and shapero signed on behalf of city of hope.at the time of the signings,both former officers knew their jobs were in jeopardy and thompson knew or should have known that unless shapero obtained the board approval,shapero conduct was ultra vires.
later that year,around october,thompson drafted two other secret agreements for employees that shapero signed for city of hope without obtaining board approval.neither thompson nor shapero notified the board or its counsel about the additional contracts.had city of hope known about the secret agreements,it would have fired the former officers.instead,and because thompson had not informed the board or counsel,former officers assembled information and documents that they later used in their attempts to harm the city of hope.
in december,thomps
