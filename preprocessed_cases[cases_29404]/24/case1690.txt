in this original proceeding,the question is whether kellogg brown root,kbr,as a to a contract containing an arbitration clause,must arbitrate its claims against unidynamics,unidynamics and macgregor fin oy macgregor the signatories to the contract.the trial court denied macgregor motion,which sought to compel kbr to pursue its claims in an ongoing arbitration between macgregor and unidynamics.the court of appeals held that the trial court abused its discretion and conditionally granted mandamus relief,ordering the trial court to vacate its order denying macgregor motion and issue an order compelling kbr to arbitrate all claims.kbr sought mandamus relief in this court.
approximately two months after kbr filed its petition here,the arbitration between macgregor and unidynamics concluded.as a result,the relief macgregor requested in the lower kbr be compelled to pursue its claims in the arbitration between macgregor fin and unidynamics is no longer available.the case is not moot,however,because the parties continue to dispute whether kbr should be compelled to arbitrate all claims pursuant to the court of appeals order.id.at.because we conclude that kbr can not be so compelled,we conditionally grant mandamus relief and order the court of appeals to vacate its order.
factual background 
in october,macgregor usa,contracted with ingalls shipbuilding,ingalls to build elevator trunks for two cruise ships.macgregor usa assigned the contract to its sister company,macgregor fin oy macgregor.in august,macgregor subcontracted part of the job to unidynamics,which agreed to fabricate a set of the elevator trunks for one of the ships in june,unidynamics and kbr entered into a subcontract,under which kbr agreed to furnish labor,equipment,and facilities to fabricate the elevator trunks.in the fabrication subcontract between macgregor and unidynamics,the parties agreed that any disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this contract including any document pertaining thereto,shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with general conditions ece,appendix.the subcontract between unidynamics and kbr did not contain an arbitration provision.
after the ship buyer declared bankruptcy in november,ingalls directed macgregor to cease work and notify its subcontractors to do the same.macgregor directed unidynamics to comply with the same instructions that ingalls gave macgregor.unidynamics conveyed those instructions to kbr.on or around november,kbr ceased work,stored the elevator trunks and other equipment,and sent unidynamics invoices for unpaid fabrication services and storage costs.because kbr had not been paid in full,it asserted liens on the elevator trunk fabrications,parts,and other materials the collateral.
a dispute then arose between macgregor and unidynamics regarding who owned the collateral and who owed kbr for the fabrication services and storage costs.the dispute stemmed from macgregor and unidynamics agreement concerning passing of title the title agreement,executed on december,and fully incorporated into their fabrication subcontract.among other things,the title agreement provided that full title to the collateral would pass irrevocably to macgregor immediately after macgregor made two payments to unidynamics,which were to occur no later than december.the title agreement further required unidynamics to release the collateral to macgregor upon macgregor request.it is undisputed that macgregor timely paid unidynamics however,unidynamics asserted that the payments were ineffective to pass title to macgregor.when macgregor demanded that unidynamics release the elevator trunks,unidynamics refused.the collateral remained in kbr possession.
procedural background 
in may,pursuant to the arbitration provision in the fabrication subcontract,macgregor asked the international chamber of commerce icc to arbitrate its dispute with unidynamics.among other things,macgregor sought damages for breach of contract by unidynamics for failure to release the collateral,a determination as to which defendant owned the collateral,and a determination regarding macgregor proportionate responsibility for the storage costs kbr billed unidynamics.unidynamics filed an answer and asserted counterclaims.macgregor and unidynamics then commenced arbitration in paris,france.
while the arbitration was proceeding,both macgregor and unidynamics demanded that kbr release the collateral.kbr refused the demands and,on september,filed suit against both companies in harris county.kbr claimed that unidynamics breached its contract and,in the alternative,that it was entitled to recover quantum meruit damages against unidynamics and macgregor.kbr also sued for declaratory relief to determine which defendant owned the collateral.subject to the court ruling on ownership,kbr sought a judicial declaration that it possessed valid constitutional and statutory liens against the collateral in its possession macgregor answered and sought a temporary restraining order,temporary injunction,and permanent injunction directing kbr to release the collateral.unidynamics opposed macgregor application,arguing that the court action should be abated because the collateral ownership was the very issue being arbitrated before the icc.macgregor,unidynamics,and kbr then negotiated an agreement,which the trial court entered as an agreed order.pursuant to that order,macgregor agreed to post a bond and,upon presentation of the bond,kbr agreed to release the collateral to macgregor macgregor posted the bond on october.
meanwhile,on october,macgregor filed a motion to abate the state court proceedings pending its arbitration with unidynamics or,in the alternative,to compel kbr to pursue its claims in the ongoing arbitration between macgregor and unidynamics.the trial court denied macgregor motion.on december,macgregor filed an interlocutory appeal and a petition for writ of mandamus in the court of appeals,contending that the trial court abused its discretion.the court of appeals dismissed the interlocutory appeal as moot and conditionally granted mandamus relief,ordering the trial court to vacate its order denying macgregor plea in abatement and motion to compel arbitration,to issue an order compelling kbr to arbitrate all claims,and to stay all proceedings pending arbitration.at.
on december,kbr petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus.on february,while the petition was pending before us,the arbitration between macgregor and unidynamics concluded,and the icc issued a final arbitration award.kbr does not contest that award.
as a preliminary matter,we must decide whether the icc final arbitration award moots this mandamus proceeding.a case becomes moot if a controversy ceases to exist between the parties at any stage of the legal proceedings,including the appeal.allstate ins.hallman,bd.of adjustment of san antonio wende,williams lara.this case stems from the lower courts action on macgregor motion to compel kbr to pursue its claims in the arbitration between macgregor and unidynamics.because that arbitration is over,kbr can no longer be compelled to join the arbitration.see at concluding that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to compel kbr to join the ongoing arbitration.the question,then,is whether this proceeding is moot.
a case is not rendered moot simply because some of the issues become moot during the appellate process.see allstate,at holding that a dispute concerning attorney fees preserved a live controversy in an otherwise moot appeal camarena.employment comm n,same.in this case,the court of appeals ordered the trial court to issue an order compelling kbr to arbitrate all claims.at.although it is no longer possible for kbr to join the paris arbitration,the court of appeals ultimate directive has no temporal component.it requires kbr to arbitrate all claims.
the live controversy in this proceeding is whether kbr must arbitrate those claims that remain now that the arbitration between macgregor and unidynamics has concluded.kbr petition consisted of a claim against unidynamics in the alternative,a quantum meruit claim against unidynamics and macgregor and a declaratory judgment action to determine the collateral owner and to establish that kbr possessed valid liens.the arbitrator determined that,pursuant to the title agreement between macgregor and unidynamics,title to the collateral passed from unidynamics to macgregor on december.kbr is satisfied with this resolution of the ownership dispute,and thus,we need not address whether the ownership dispute must be arbitrated.additionally,we need not address whether kbr should be compelled to arbitrate its claims against unidynamics,because the parties now agree that those claims are not subject to arbitration.our inquiry is accordingly limited to determining whether kbr must arbitrate its quantum meruit and claims against macgregor.
discussion 
the parties do not dispute the court of appeals holding that the arbitration provision at issue is governed by the federal arbitration act faa.see at.in general,a party seeking to compel arbitration under the faa must establish that there is a valid arbitration agreement,and the claims raised fall within that agreement scope.in re firstmerit bank,in re oakwood mobile homes.doubts regarding an agreement scope are resolved in favor of arbitration because there is a presumption favoring agreements to arbitrate under the faa.in re firstmerit bank,at cantella goodwin.however,the presumption arises only after the party seeking to compel arbitration proves that a valid arbitration agreement exists,davidson,webster,because the purpose of the faa was to make arbitration agreements as enforceable as other contracts,not more so.bridas gov t of,cir citations omitted see also waffle house,d the faa directs courts to place arbitration agreements on equal footing with other contracts.
under the faa,ordinary principles of state contract law determine whether there is a valid agreement to arbitrate.first options of,kaplan,d.mut.fin.group,llc bailey,cir davidson,at in re halliburton.because arbitration is contractual in nature,the faa generally does not require parties to arbitrate when they have not agreed to do so.volt info,bd.of trs.of leland stanford junior,d arbitration under the faa is a matter of consent,not coercion,quoted in,at.see also bridas,at citing douglas uloth hamilton rial,iii,equitable estoppel as a basis for compelling nonsignatories to bridge too far,litig.federal and texas state courts have recognized,however,that i t does not follow that under the faa an obligation to arbitrate attaches only to one who has personally signed the written arbitration provision instead,under certain circumstances,principles of contract law and agency may bind a to an arbitration agreement.fisser int l bank,cir,quoted in int l paper schwabedissen maschinen anlagen,cir,and,am.arbitration ass n,cir see also bailey,at quoting,at in re firstmerit bank,at citing nationwide of bryan,dyer,no pet.pathology assocs.roosth,antonio,pet.dism.
although state law determines the validity of an arbitration agreement,courts have applied both federal and state law to determine the related,but distinct,issue of whether plaintiffs should be compelled to arbitrate their claims.see,bailey,at applying federal law bridas,at applying federal law fleetwood enters.gaskamp,cir applying state law roosth,at applying state law dyer,at applying state law lakeland anesthesia,united healthcare of,so d,applying federal and state law.the faa does not specify whether state or federal law governs,and the united states supreme court has not directly addressed the issue.
federal courts of appeals,however,have frequently applied federal substantive law when deciding whether a must arbitrate.see,bailey,at bridas,at intergen grina,cir dominium austin partners emerson,cir int l paper,at,at.the fourth and fifth circuits have reasoned that federal substantive law of arbitrability resolve s this question,because the determination of whether a is bound presents no state law question of contract formation or validity.griffin beach club ii homeowners ass n,cir quoting int l paper,at bailey,at same.we are not convinced that state law plays no role in making this determination.see roosth,at applying state law dyer,at applying state law.nevertheless,we are mindful of the extensive body of federal precedent that has explored the extent to which can be compelled to arbitrate.moreover,we recognize that it is important for federal and state law to be as consistent as possible in this area,because federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction to enforce the faa.see moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.our decision today rests on state law,but it is informed by persuasive and federal precedent.
federal courts have recognized six theories,arising out of common principles of contract and agency law,that may bind to arbitration agreements incorporation by reference assumption agency alter ego equitable estoppel,and beneficiary.see,bridas,at here,macgregor asserts that kbr is bound to arbitrate under the doctrine of direct benefits estoppel a type of equitable estoppel that federal courts apply in the arbitration context.see,bailey,at bridas,at dupont de nemours rhone poulenc fiber resin intermediates,cir int l paper,at 
under direct benefits estoppel,a plaintiff seeking the benefits of a contract is estopped from simultaneously attempting to avoid the contract burdens,such as the obligation to arbitrate disputes.griffin at bailey,at int l paper,at t he doctrine recognizes that a party may be estopped from asserting that the lack of his signature precludes enforcement of the contract arbitration clause when he has consistently maintained that other provisions of the same contract should be enforced to benefit him,at.thus,a plaintiff may be compelled to arbitrate if it seeks to enforce terms of a contract containing an arbitration provision.see griffin,at bailey,at bridas,at direct benefits estoppel applies when a nonsignatory knowingly exploits the agreement containing the arbitration clause.quoting dupont de nemours,at int l paper,at.for example,if a and claims are based on certain terms of a written contract,then the can not avoid an arbitration provision within that contract.see int l paper,at.if,however,a claims can stand independently of the underlying contract,then arbitration generally should not be compelled under this theory.see,griffin,at bridas,at.
consistent with the federal doctrine of direct benefits estoppel,this court has held that a plaintiff may be compelled to arbitrate if its claims are based on a contract containing an agreement to arbitrate.in re firstmerit bank,at a litigant who sues based on a contract subjects him or herself to the contract terms.in firstmerit bank,the plaintiffs sued the signatory defendant for,among other things,breach of contract,revocation of acceptance,and breach of warranty.id.at.by bringing the and claims,the plaintiffs sought benefits that stemmed directly from the contract terms.we concluded that,by seeking to enforce the contract,the plaintiffs subjected themselves to the contract terms,including the arbitration addendum.id.at see also roosth,at the nonsignatory can not enforce specific terms of the agreement while seeking to avoid the arbitration provision.
the issue here is whether kbr sought to enforce terms of the fabrication subcontract by bringing a quantum meruit claim against macgregor,or seeking a declaration that it possessed valid liens.we begin with quantum meruit.
quantum meruit is an equitable remedy that is based upon the promise implied by law to pay for beneficial services rendered and knowingly accepted.vortt exploration,chevron,quoting truly austin.a party generally can not recover under quantum meruit when there is a valid contract covering the services or materials furnished.murray crest,woodard states,recovery on an express contract and on quantum meruit are inconsistent.a party to a contract may,however,seek alternative relief under both contract and theories.pleading in the alternative does not defeat the effect of an arbitration clause that broadly covers all disputes between signatories that arise out of the underlying agreement.but in this case,kbr is not a signatory to the fabrication subcontract between macgregor and unidynamics therefore,the scope of that subcontract arbitration clause does not answer whether kbr must arbitrate.
to advance its estoppel theory,macgregor contends that kbr quantum meruit claim is based on the fabrication subcontract in the sense that kbr labor and services were linked inextricably to that subcontract.it is true,of course,that kbr was fabricating trunks that were at the contract core and that,in performing the work,kbr relied on the fabrication subcontract specifications.however,under direct benefits estoppel,a plaintiff can not be compelled to arbitrate on the sole ground that,but for the contract containing the arbitration provision,it would have no basis to sue.the work to be performed under a subcontract will inherently be related to and,to a certain extent,defined by contracts higher in the chain.see black law dictionary ed defining subcontractor as o ne who is awarded a portion of an existing contract by a contractor,esp.a general contractor.if this were a sufficient basis for binding a subcontractor,arbitration agreements would become easier to enforce than other contracts,counter to the faa purpose.see intergen,at noting that federal courts have been hesitant to estop a nonsignatory seeking to avoid arbitration.
we conclude that,under direct benefits estoppel,although a claim may relate to a contract containing an arbitration provision,that relationship does not,in itself,bind the to the arbitration provision.instead,a should be compelled to arbitrate a claim only if it seeks,through the claim,to derive a direct benefit from the contract containing the arbitration provision.see bailey,at mag portfolio,gmbh merlin biomed group llc,cir the benefits must be is to say,flowing directly from the agreement.int l paper,at,at in re firstmerit bank,at 
in its quantum meruit claim against macgregor,kbr seeks payment for services rendered.kbr provided services pursuant to its contract with unidynamics.kbr asserted right to payment therefore stems directly from the contract,not the fabrication subcontract.the fabrication subcontract includes no provision for paying kbr.in fact,kbr is effectively precluded from asserting rights under that contract,which expressly provides that approved use of any subcontractor creates no contractual relationship between the subcontractor and macgregor.thus,we conclude that the court of appeals abused its discretion to the extent it compelled kbr to arbitrate its quantum meruit claim against macgregor.
having determined that kbr quantum meruit claim is not subject to arbitration,we turn to kbr claims.kbr sought a judicial declaration that it possessed valid constitutional and warehouseman statutory liens.see.const.art.xvi.bus.a.the constitutional lien attaches to buildings and articles that are made or repaired by mechanics,material men,and artisans who have a direct contractual relationship with the owner of the property.see.const.art.xvi,cvn group,delgado,f or constitutional liens that are,there are no technical requirements first bank whirlpool,holding that the constitutional lien on manufactured chattels is available only upon articles made especially for a purchaser pursuant to a special order and in accordance with the purchaser plans or specifications hayek steel,strang pray.the warehouseman lien arises against the bailor on the goods covered by a warehouse receipt or on the proceeds thereof in his possession for charges for storage or transportation,insurance,labor,or charges present or future in relation to the goods,and for expenses necessary for preservation of the goods.bus.a see also flores didear van storage,christi,no writ discussing validity and enforceability of warehouseman lien.
in this court,macgregor sole argument for compelling arbitration of kbr claims is that the claims require a determination of ownership,and thus,they are based on the title agreement within the fabrication subcontract ownership was,of course,a central issue before and during the paris arbitration.when the arbitration award resolved the ownership dispute,it also eliminated the only rationale that macgregor has asserted thus far for arbitrating the liens validity.
we do not decide whether other arguments may exist to compel kbr to arbitrate the validity of its liens.to the extent a lien dispute still remains,the trial court is in the best position to determine,on principles we have declared today,whether it must be arbitrated.
conclusion 
we conditionally grant mandamus relief and order the court of appeals to vacate its order compelling kbr to arbitrate all claims.see at.the writ will issue only if the court of appeals fails to comply.

while not all federal courts use the phrase direct benefits estoppel,we adopt that terminology from bridas to describe this form of estoppel.see at.
federal courts have also applied direct benefits estoppel to bind who,during the life of the contract,have embraced the contract despite their status but then,during litigation,attempt to repudiate the arbitration clause in the agreement.dupont de nemours,at see also intergen,at holding equitable estoppel theory inapplicable to that did not seek to derive direct benefits from contracts during their currency am.bureau of shipping tencara shipyard,cir holding who received lower insurance rates and ability to sail under french flag due to contract was bound by arbitration clause within contract in re vms.sec,cir holding wife bound by arbitration clause that only her husband signed as she accepted benefits of investment services.we do not reach this application of direct benefits estoppel here.macgregor argument for arbitration rests not on kbr actions during the life of the fabrication subcontract,but on kbr attempt to benefit from that contract through litigation.
