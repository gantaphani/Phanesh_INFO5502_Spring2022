benihana of tokyo,llc benihana of tokyo appeals from a february,order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york paul engelmayer,granting the application of benihana,benihana america for a preliminary injunction in aid of arbitration of a dispute arising under the parties license agreement.the district court enjoined benihana of tokyo from selling unauthorized food items at the restaurant it operates pursuant to the license agreement using certain trademarks in connection with the restaurant in a manner not approved by the license agreement and arguing to the arbitral panel,if it rules that benihana of tokyo breached the license agreement,that benihana of tokyo should be given additional time to cure any defaults.
the district court did not abuse its discretion with respect to the menu offering or trademark use injunctions,because it reasonably concluded that each of the relevant factors favored benihana america.but it erred in enjoining benihana of tokyo from arguing to the arbitral panel for an extended cure period.when a dispute is properly before an arbitrator,a district court should not interfere with the arbitral process on the ground that,in its view of the merits,a particular remedy would not be warranted.benihana america may challenge an arbitrator decision in court only after it has been issued.it may not subvert its agreement to arbitrate by obtaining a determination from a district court in advance that there are no grounds for the arbitrator to grant a particular remedy.
we therefore affirm in part and reverse in part the order of the district court.
background 
i.the license agreement 
this case arises from a dispute between the parties resulting from the corporate division of the benihana restaurant chain.under the parties amended and restated agreement and plan of reorganization the ara,benihana america received the right to operate benihana restaurants and use benihana trademarks in the united states,latin america,and the caribbean,while benihana of tokyo received those rights for all other territories.the one exception to this clean split was hawaii the ara provided that benihana america would grant benihana of tokyo a license to continue operating an existing benihana restaurant in honolulu.
accordingly,on may,the parties entered into a license agreement the agreement,governed by new york state law,granting benihana of tokyo a license and franchise to operate benihana restaurants in hawaii,subject to the terms of the agreement.in the agreement,benihana of tokyo acknowledged the necessity of operating the restaurant in conformity with benihana america standards and specifications,joint app x at,many of which are spelled out in the agreement.most relevant here,the agreement restricts benihana of tokyo menu selection and use of benihana trademarks.article requires benihana of tokyo to sell or offer for sale only such products and services as have been expressly approved for sale in writing by benihana america,provided that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.id.at.similarly,under article c,benihana of tokyo agreed t o advertise,sell or offer for sale only those items which are sold by benihana america in its restaurants or such other products as are approved by benihana america in writing,which shall not be unreasonably withheld,prior to offering the same for sale.id.at.article provides that a ny and all advertising or other matter employing in any way whatsoever the words benihana,benihana of tokyo or the benihana flower symbol shall be submitted to benihana america for its approval prior to publication or use.benihana america shall not unreasonably withhold approval for any such publication or use.id.at.
the agreement also sets forth conditions and procedures governing termination.under article,benihana america has good cause to terminate the agreement in the event of either i a violation of any substantial term or condition of th e agreement that benihana of tokyo fails to cure within thirty days after written notice from benihana america or ii three notices by benihana america of any default hereunder and such defaults are thereafter cured,within any consecutive twelve month period.id.at.the agreement also provides that violation of certain articles including article restricting benihana of tokyo trademark use and article c restricting the items benihana of tokyo may advertise or sell would result in irreparable injury to benihana america for which no adequate remedy at law may be available and for which benihana america may obtain an injunction against such violation without the necessity of showing actual or threatened damage.id.at.
finally,article contains two arbitration provisions 
if this agreement shall be terminated by benihana america and benihana of tokyo shall dispute benihana america right of termination,or the reasonableness thereof,the dispute shall be settled by arbitration at the main office of the american arbitration association in the city of new york in accordance with the rules of said association and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.the arbitration panel shall consist of three members,one of whom shall be chosen by benihana america,and by benihana of tokyo and the other by the two so chosen.
in the event that any other dispute arises between the parties hereto in connection with the terms or provisions of this agreement,either party by written notice to the other party may elect to submit the dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with the foregoing procedure.such right shall not be exclusive of any other rights which a party may have to pursue a course of legal action in an appropriate forum.enforcement of any arbitration award,decision or order may be sought in any court having competent jurisdiction.
ii.the licensing disputes 
things proceeded amicably enough under the agreement for over fifteen years.but in benihana america was purchased by angelo gordon,which proved to be a more licensor.in may,benihana america wrote to benihana of tokyo that it had recently learned that benihana of tokyo was selling hamburgers called beniburgers at its honolulu location.benihana america reminded benihana of tokyo that the agreement required benihana america approval of new menu items,noted that hamburgers were not an authorized menu item,and demanded that the hamburgers be removed from the menu.when no remedial action was forthcoming,benihana america sent a second letter on july,notifying benihana of tokyo that it was in breach of the agreement and had thirty days to cure.
after receiving two extensions of the cure period from benihana america,benihana of tokyo brought suit on september,in the new york state supreme court seeking an injunction to stay the running of the cure period pending arbitration of whether selling hamburgers violated the agreement benihana america promptly removed the suit to federal court.at a hearing before the district court on october,benihana of tokyo did not dispute that the agreement prohibited selling hamburgers but argued that benihana america had waived its right to enforce that prohibition by failing to monitor the honolulu restaurant for many years.the district court rejected the waiver argument as precluded by the plain language of the agreement found that each of the relevant factors weighed against staying the cure period,and accordingly denied the motion.the court also rejected benihana of tokyo backup request at oral argument for a very short stub period for the cure,explaining that it had applied the standards and determined that they do justify extending the cure period.joint app x at.later that day,counsel for benihana of tokyo submitted to benihana america certain financial documents required by the agreement and represented that benihana of tokyo will not be selling hamburgers in hawaii.id.at.on december,benihana america sent another notice of breach based on asserted deficiencies in the submitted financial documentation and violations of the agreement advertising restrictions.
on january,the day on which the latest cure period expired,benihana of tokyo filed an arbitration demand with the american arbitration association seeking a declaratory judgment that the claimed defaults do not exist,but,if the panel finds that the claimed defaults do exist,then benihana of tokyo requests sufficient time to cure the alleged defaults.id.at.
despite its assurances to the contrary,benihana of tokyo continued to sell hamburgers at its honolulu location.an onsite inspection by benihana america on january,allegedly revealed that,in place of the beniburger,benihana of tokyo was now serving a tokyo burger,as well as a beni panda children meal consisting of two served with rice and arranged to resemble a panda face.these menu offerings were advertised using the benihana name and other trademarks in a manner allegedly not authorized by the agreement.
that discovery prompted benihana america on february,to send benihana of tokyo a notice of termination of the agreement effective february.the notice asserted that good cause for termination existed under either prong of article i failure to cure within thirty days and ii three notices of default within twelve months.the notice also stated that benihana of tokyo attempt to relitigate before an arbitral panel the question of whether benihana of tokyo may wait to cure until after the arbitration panel finds that the claimed defaults do exist,an argument rejected by the district court in october,suggests a level of contempt so extreme that termination of the license agreement is benihana america only option.joint app x at.that same day,benihana america filed a counterclaim in the arbitration seeking confirmation of its termination.
two days later,benihana america petitioned the district court for injunctive relief in aid of arbitration pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,seeking to enjoin benihana of tokyo 
from selling hamburgers or other unauthorized food items on the premises of the benihana restaurant it operates in hawaii pursuant to the license agreement,or using or publishing advertisements,publicity,signs,decorations,furnishings,equipment,or other matter employing in any way whatsoever the words benihana,benihana of tokyo,or the flower symbol that have not been approved in accordance with article of the license agreement and from arguing to the arbitration panel that it be permitted to cure any defaults if the arbitrators rule that benihana of tokyo breached the license agreement.
joint app x at.the petition argued that the advertising and the sale of these items are clear and blatant violations of the license agreement.id.at.because it would be irreparably harmed by the continuing violations and was likely to succeed on the merits before the arbitral panel,benihana america sought provisional relief so that the panel decision and award will not be rendered ineffectual.id.at.benihana america also argued that if either termination condition under article were met,then it was entitled to terminate without an additional cure period,and that benihana of tokyo should therefore be prohibited from arguing to the arbitrators for an extended cure period to which it was plainly not entitled under the agreement.
in its brief opposing the petition,benihana of tokyo creatively argued that it was not violating the agreement at all.it asserted that the tokyo burger was sold not in the restaurant but instead from an outside area,while the beni panda was not itself a burger but a fried rice dish albeit one that included two shaped as panda ears.cv pae,doc,at.but,in the spirit of cooperation,benihana of tokyo pledged again not to sell those items pending arbitration.id.benihana of tokyo contended that because the only advertising benihana america sought to enjoin pertained to the sale of these items,its pledge to discontinue these items pending arbitration mooted the advertising component of benihana america petition.lastly,benihana of tokyo argued that enjoining it from arguing to the arbitrators for an extended cure period would impermissibly involve the court in the merits of the arbitration and the powers of the arbitrators.id.at.
the district court granted benihana america petition in a ruling from the bench on february,enjoining benihana of tokyo from 
selling hamburgers or other unauthorized food items on the premises of,or in any manner in connection with,the benihana restaurant it operates in hawaii pursuant to a license from benihana america.
using or publishing,in connection with the benihana restaurant it operates in hawaii pursuant to a license from benihana america,advertisements,publicity,signs,decorations,furnishings,equipment,or other matter employing in any way whatsoever the words benihana,benihana of tokyo,or the flower symbol that have not been approved in accordance with article of the license agreement.
arguing to the arbitration panel,in the event the panel rules that it breached the license agreement so as to justify its termination,that it should be permitted to cure any defaults.
joint app x at.
as to the hamburgers,the court found that each of the four preliminary injunction factors favored benihana america.it found a likelihood of success clear beyond peradventure because serving hamburgers without benihana america consent plainly violated the agreement.id.at.the court also found that the sale of these burgers under a benihana name will irreparably harm benihana america by undermining its distinct image benihana does not do burgers its niche is to sell cuisine,like steak and seafood.id.at.the balance of hardships likewise favored benihana america,because it ought to be no hardship whatsoever for benihana of tokyo to refrain from selling burgers that it has no legal right to sell.id.at.finally,the court found that the public interest,while not seriously implicated,was served by assuring that lawful agreements are enforced.
the court analysis for the trademark use injunction was much the same as for the hamburgers.id.at.because the request would enjoin only use of the trademarks not authorized under the agreement,the court found that success on the merits was guarantee d and that use of benihana trademarks in violation of the agreement will irreparabl y harm benihana america brand and reputation just as much,if not more,than will the sale of unauthorized burgers.id.at.as with the hamburger injunction,the last two factors favored benihana america because complying with the agreement was not a hardship and the public interest would be served by enforcing the agreement.
turning to the injunction preventing benihana of tokyo from arguing to the arbitral panel for an extended cure period,the district court found that benihana america was highly likely to succeed on the merits,because the court had previously denied benihana of tokyo tro application for an extension of the cure period.id.at.r eviewing the issue afresh,the court explained that it can not identify,and benihana of tokyo has not identified,any basis in the licensing agreement on which a court or an arbitrator could lawfully give benihana of tokyo a cure period beyond that in the agreement.id.the court noted that the agreement gives benihana of tokyo a day cure period and reasoned that the agreement does not afford a basis for a court or an arbitrator to extend that period,much less following a hypothetical finding by an arbitral panel of a material breach by benihana of tokyo justifying termination.id.the court also found that benihana america would be irreparably harmed if benihana of tokyo somehow wrongly convinced the arbitrators to grant it a further cure period despite its material breach warranting termination.id.at.
benihana of tokyo timely appealed.
discussion 
where the parties have agreed to arbitrate a dispute,a district court has jurisdiction to issue a preliminary injunction to preserve the status quo pending arbitration.see blumenthal merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.the standard for such an injunction is the same as for preliminary injunctions generally.roso lino beverage,coca cola bottling,cir.a party seeking a preliminary injunction must demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits or sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in the plaintiff favor a likelihood of irreparable injury in the absence of an injunction that the balance of hardships tips in the plaintiff favor and that the public interest would not be disserved by the issuance of an injunction.salinger colting,cir alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
we review the grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion,reversing only if the injunction is based on an error in law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or if it can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.oneida nation cuomo,cir.
injunction against unauthorized menu items and use of trademarks 
the first two components of the district court injunction do not require extensive discussion,and because benihana of tokyo arguments as to them largely overlap,we consider them together.we conclude that the district court acted within its discretion in finding that each of the factors for a preliminary injunction favored benihana america and accordingly in granting those portions of the injunction.
likelihood of success on the merits 
benihana of tokyo concedes what it describes as technical violations of two ancillary provisions of the licensing agreement namely,the menu and advertising restrictions.appellant br.at.but,it contends,when assessing likelihood of success on the merits,that the question is not simply whether it has breached the agreement,but whether its breaches were grounds for termination.assuming that this is indeed the correct question,the answer depends largely on the accuracy of benihana of tokyo characterization of the violations as technical and the provisions as ancillary.benihana of tokyo does not fare well on either front.
the district court properly found that,far from committing merely trivial violations,benihana of tokyo was blatantly not complying with the license agreement,even after it could not have been more clear at an earlier hearing in acknowledging that it was forbidden under the license agreement to sell burgers,joint app x at,and even after it represented that it would cease doing so.instead,benihana of tokyo continued to flout the terms of the agreement,relying on,as the district court aptly put it,justification s utterly and unusually unconvincing,id.at,such as that burgers with rice and shaped as panda ears are not burgers.the menu item and advertising restrictions of the agreement were clear,and benihana of tokyo was clearly violating them.
nor do we agree with benihana of tokyo that the breached provisions are ancillary.control over menu and advertising is presumably a central concern for a licensor of a restaurant brand,and the agreement reveals precisely such a concern in this case.the agreement begins by explaining that benihana america has created and developed a unique system of restaurants and that benihana of tokyo understands and acknowledges the necessity of operating the business franchised hereunder in conformity with benihana america standards and specifications.id.at.moreover,the agreement included the menu and advertising restrictions among the provisions for violation of which benihana america could seek an injunction without showing irreparable harm.
as a fallback,benihana of tokyo contends that benihana america is not likely to prevail in the arbitration because,under the agreement,had it submitted the menu items and advertisements for approval,benihana america could not have unreasonably withheld its consent.thus,benihana of tokyo argues,its advertisements and burger sales are impermissible only if benihana america acts reasonably in prohibiting the advertisements and burger sales to begin with.appellant br.at.we express no view on whether benihana america withholding such consent would have been reasonable,for that question is beside the point.the agreement required benihana of tokyo to seek consent before taking these actions.failure to do so put benihana of tokyo in breach it also meant that benihana america obligation not to withhold its approval unreasonably was never triggered.we therefore reject benihana of tokyo contention that benihana america conduct makes it unlikely to prevail in the arbitration.
irreparable harm 
nor did the district court abuse its discretion in finding that the sale of these burgers under a benihana name will irreparably harm benihana america by undermining the distinct image it has worked so hard to create in the minds of consumers.joint app x at.benihana of tokyo argues that benihana america has offered no concrete evidence that the unauthorized menu items would cause irreparable harm and that because many restaurants regularly sell hamburgers at lunch,it is not at all axiomatic that serving hamburgers would in any way tarnish benihana america or constitute a deviation from quality standards.appellant br.at.but,as discussed above,control over menu selection appears central to the agreement.the district court was not required to demand expert testimony or consumer surveys before crediting benihana america argument that benihana does not do burgers,and that serving hamburgers undermined its distinct image a conclusion supported by common sense and the agreement.the district court also properly concluded that if the unauthorized sales continue,benihana america would suffer substantial harm to its reputation that is not calculable nor precisely compensable.joint app x at,citing power test petroleum,calcu gas,cir.
moreover,the licensing agreement provides that a violation of the prohibition on sell ing or offer ing for sale items not approved by benihana america in writing would result in irreparable injury for which benihana america shall be entitled to an injunction without the necessity of showing actual or threatened damage.joint app x at.as the district court noted,under our precedent such an irreparable harm provision in the parties agreement,while not controlling,is relevant evidence that can help support a finding of irreparable injury.id.at,citing atl.instruments,haber,cir.
similarly,benihana of tokyo argues that benihana america failed to present sufficient evidence of irreparable harm from the unauthorized advertising.specifically,it asserts that benihana america provided no evidence of customer confusion,and instead merely presented pictures of benihana of tokyo unauthorized advertising and asked the court to conclude that confused customers would probably think benihana america had sponsored the ads.appellant br.at.but before the district court,benihana of tokyo argued only that with its agreement not to sell the tokyo burger or the beni panda during the pendency of the arbitration,this issue is moot because the only unauthorized advertising concerned those items.cv pae,doc,at.because benihana of tokyo in its brief and in oral argument opposing the injunction application failed to contest the sufficiency of the evidence supporting irreparable harm from unauthorized advertisements,that argument is waived on appeal.see in re nortel networks.sec,cir.
balance of hardships and public interest 
we also agree with the district court that it is no hardship for benihana of tokyo to refrain from menu offerings and trademark uses that are not permitted under the agreement,whereas benihana america faces harm to its brand from the agreement violation.finally,we agree that,to the extent it is implicated,the public interest here is served by the enforcement of the parties lawful agreement,and that therefore this factor too favors benihana america.
ii.injunction against arguing to arbitrator for extended cure period 
benihana of tokyo argues that the district court exceeded its limited power to issue injunctive relief only as necessary to preserve the status quo pending arbitration.it notes that the parties agreed to arbitrate disputes regarding termination,with no explicit limitation on the arbitrators power to resolve such disputes.thus,benihana of tokyo maintains,its argument for an extended cure period poses a question for the arbitrators rather than the court.it contends that,by restricting the arguments it may make in arbitratio
