discussion 
appellants contend the interference claims fail as a matter of law and for want of substantial evidence the claim for misappropriation of confidential information and trade secrets is unsupported by substantial evidence the trial court erred in awarding costs and enforcement of the arbitration award judgment was improperly stayed.
interference claims 
appellants raise numerous contentions of error regarding the trial court determinations that they had engaged in tortious interference with contractual relationships and with prospective economic advantage.we do not find reversible error in these determinations.
the two torts in question,though related,are distinct.della penna toyota motor sales,cal th,d.in its simplest terms,to be liable for inducing breach of contract,there must be a valid contract.citation.in comparison,a cause of action for interference with prospective economic advantage necessarily assumes that a contract has not yet been formulated.pmc,saban entertainment,th,d.as our supreme court explained in della penna toyota motor sales,supra,cal th at page,d,courts must firmly distinguish the two kinds of business contexts,bringing a greater solicitude to those relationships that have ripened into agreements,while recognizing that relationships short of that subsist in a zone where the rewards and risks of competition are dominant.
the two torts thus differ in their elements.the elements which a plaintiff must plead to state the cause of action for intentional interference with contractual relations are a valid contract between plaintiff and a third party defendant knowledge of this contract defendant intentional acts designed to induce a breach or disruption of the contractual relationship actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship and resulting damage.pacific gas electric bear stearns cal d.
by contrast,the elements of the tort of interference with prospective economic advantage include the existence of a prospective business relationship containing the probability of future economic rewards for plaintiff knowledge by defendant of the existence of the relationship intentional acts by defendant designed to disrupt the relationship actual causation and,damages to plaintiff proximately caused by defendant conduct.citation.pmc,saban entertainment,supra,th at,d.
in addition,the plaintiff must establish that the defendant engaged in conduct that was wrongful by some legal measure other than the fact of interference itself.della penna toyota motor sales,supra,cal th at,d.as our supreme court clarified in quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,d,this additional requirement of independent wrongfulness does not apply to the tort of interference with contract.
to the extent that appellants challenge the trial court factual determinations,we examine the record for substantial evidence to support the trial court findings.nordquist broadcast
