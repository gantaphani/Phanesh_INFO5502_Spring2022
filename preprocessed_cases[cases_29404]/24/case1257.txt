plaintiffs filed this action against their former employer,alleging causes of action arising out of the termination of their employment.the employer filed a motion to compel arbitration pursuant to an arbitration provision contained in a document entitled,dispute resolution process drp.when plaintiffs were hired,they signed an acknowledgement form stating they agreed to submit disputes to arbitration.they opposed the motion to compel arbitration on the ground that the arbitration provision in the drp was unconscionable.the trial court ruled in plaintiffs favor and denied the motion.defendant appealed.
we conclude the trial court erred.although the arbitration agreement is procedurally unconscionable,none of its provisions is substantively unconscionable.we therefore reverse the order denying the motion to compel arbitration.
background 
the facts and allegations in this appeal are taken from the complaint and the declarations and exhibits submitted in connection with the motion to compel arbitration.
on november,plaintiffs alexis leos and jennifer stucker plaintiffs filed this action against their former employer,darden restaurants,darden,alleging causes of action under the fair employment and housing act feha,for sexual harassment,retaliation,failure to prevent harassment,and failure to investigate harassment.plaintiffs asserted common law causes of action for constructive discharge in violation of public policy and wrongful termination in violation of public policy.they also sought declaratory relief to the effect that darden arbitration provision was unenforceable.
motion to compel arbitration 
on february,darden filed a motion to compel arbitration pursuant to the drp,which consists of pages.under the drp,the parties must seek to resolve a dispute through four steps.the first step is the open door approach,which obligates the employee to bring a workplace concern or dispute to the attention of management for possible resolution.if the open door approach does not resolve the workplace concern or dispute,an employee may submit the matter to peer review,which requires that a dispute be presented to a panel of three employees.each side is allowed minutes to present its position to the panel,after which the panel issues a nonbinding decision.if either the employee or darden is dissatisfied with the decision of the peer review panel,the dissatisfied party may request mediation within days after the panel decision.otherwise,the panel decision becomes final and binding.the third step,mediation,is conducted in accordance with the mediation rules of the american arbitration association aaa.darden will pay the costs and fees of the mediation service and the mediator.if the mediator,the employee,or darden determines that further attempts to mediate the dispute are not worthwhile,either the employee or darden can submit the matter to binding arbitration.darden will pay the arbitrator fees and expenses,any costs for the hearing facility,and any costs of the arbitration service.the arbitration will be conducted according to the employment dispute resolution rules of the aaa.
plaintiff stucker commenced employment with darden in january.on january,she signed a dispute resolution process acknowledgement,which stated i have received and reviewed the dispute resolution process drp booklet.this booklet contains the requirements,obligations,procedures and benefits of the drp.i have read this information and understand and agree to the terms and conditions of the drp.i agree as a condition of my employment,to submit any eligible disputes i may have to the company drp and to abide by the provisions outlined in the drp.i understand that this includes,for example,claims under state and federal laws relating to harassment or discrimination,as well as other claims as defined by the drp.finally,i understand that the company is equally bound to all of the provisions of the drp.
plaintiff leos was hired on or about march,and on the same day,signed a dispute resolution process acknowledgment that contained the same language as the one signed by stucker.
darden filed its motion to compel arbitration pursuant to the california arbitration act code civ.in its memorandum of points and authorities,darden argued that the arbitration provision in the drp satisfied the requirements set forth in armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th armendariz.
plaintiffs filed an opposition,asserting the arbitration provision was unconscionable.in their supporting declarations,plaintiffs stated that they signed the drp acknowledgement as a condition of my employment they had no choice but to sign the acknowledgement to obtain employment they were told they had to sign the acknowledgement whether i wanted to or not and they were not able to negotiate the terms of the drp.
the motion to compel arbitration was heard on april.before the hearing,the trial court had prepared a tentative ruling denying the motion on the ground that the arbitration provision was unconscionable.at the conclusion of the hearing,the trial court adopted the tentative ruling as its order denying the motion.
darden filed an appeal from the order.see code civ,subd.a.
discussion 
whether an arbitration provision is unconscionable is ultimately a question of law.on appeal,when the extrinsic evidence is undisputed,as it is here,we review the contract de novo to determine unconscionability.suh superior court th,citations omitted accord,mercuro superior court th,mercuro.
as a preliminary matter,the parties disagree as to whether the arbitration provision is governed by the federal arbitration act faa or the california arbitration act caa code civ.
the faa applies to a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce,italics added.as explained in hedges carrigan th,the united states supreme court has interpreted the term involving commerce in the faa as the functional equivalent of the more familiar term affecting commerce words of art that ordinarily signal the broadest permissible exercise of congress commerce clause power because the statute provides for the enforcement of arbitration agreements within the full reach of the commerce clause,it is perfectly clear that the faa encompasses a wider range of transactions than those actually in commerce that is,within the flow of interstate commerce,congress commerce clause power may be exercised in individual cases without showing any specific effect upon interstate commerce if in the aggregate the economic activity in question would represent a general practice subject to federal control.only that general practice need bear on interstate commerce in a substantial way.hedges carrigan,at pp,citations omitted.
in woolls superior court th,the court of appeal addressed whether the faa governed a dispute between a homeowner renovating his single family home and the contractor retained to perform the work.the court of appeal stated because the contractor has not presented a factual record to establish that the parties agreement involves interstate commerce,his reliance on hedges carrigan,supra,th is misplaced.hedges found an agreement to purchase a single family residence was a contract which evidenced a transaction involving commerce within the meaning of the faa.there,the evidence showed,t he anticipated financing involved the use of a federal housing administration home loan which is subject to the jurisdiction of the united states department of housing and urban development headquartered in washington,further,the various copyrighted forms used by the parties and their brokers could only be utilized by members of the national association of realtors.unlike the showing made in cases such as hedges,the contractor has not presented any facts to show the instant transaction involved interstate commerce.this case is akin to steele collagen th,wherein the party asserting the application of the faa made no attempt to establish its actions fell within the ambit of federal law.we conclude the contractor failed to meet his burden of establishing the faa applies woolls superior court,at pp,citations omitted see hoover american income life ins.th,party seeking to compel arbitration has burden of proving that underlying agreement involves interstate commerce shepard edward mackay enterprises,th,discussing whether faa applies in context of real estate transactions.
in the present case,the drp recited that it is governed by the federal arbitration act or whatever state law is required to authorize enforce the arbitration.italics added.without evidentiary support,the drp stated that it is used throughout the united states.although darden contends in its opening brief that it is doing business in all states and around the world,in the operation of a restaurant which involved numerous interstate transactions as part of plaintiffs job duties,darden citations to the record do not support that contention.further,darden motion to compel arbitration was brought pursuant to the caa.because the drp does not unequivocally state that it is governed by the faa,and darden has not offered any evidence that plaintiffs employment or any relevant transaction involved interstate commerce,we conclude that the caa governs this case.we note,however,that regardless of whether the faa or the caa applies,we would reach the same conclusion the arbitration provision is not substantively unconscionable and is therefore enforceable.
doctrine of unconscionability 
in,the legislature enacted civil code section,which codified the principle that a court can refuse to enforce an unconscionable provision in a contract as section,subdivision a states if the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract,or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause,or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.because unconscionability is a reason for refusing to enforce contracts generally,it is also a valid reason for refusing to enforce an arbitration agreement under the caa,which provides that arbitration agreements are valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.the united states supreme court,in interpreting the same language found in section of the faa,recognized that generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements 
u nconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element,the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,the latter on overly harsh or results the prevailing view is that procedural and substantive unconscionability must both be present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability.but they need not be present in the same degree t he more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.armendariz,supra,cal th at,citations omitted accord,bruni didion th.the party resisting arbitration bears the burden of proving unconscionability.pinnacle museum tower pinnacle market development us,llc cal th.
the procedural element of unconscionability focuses on two factors oppression and surprise oppression arises from an inequality of bargaining power which results in no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice.surprise involves the extent to which the supposedly terms of the bargain are hidden in a prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce the disputed terms.bruni didion,supra,th at.
of course,simply because a provision within a contract of adhesion is not read or understood by the nondrafting party does not justify a refusal to enforce it.the term may only be denied enforcement if it is also substantively unreasonable substantive unconscionability focuses on whether the provision is overly harsh or and is shown if the disputed provision of the contract falls outside the reasonable expectations of the nondrafting party or is unduly oppressive.where a party with superior bargaining power has imposed contractual terms on another,courts must carefully assess claims that one or more of these provisions are and unreasonable.gutierrez autowest,th,citations omitted.
substantive unconscionability pertains to the fairness of an agreement actual terms and to assessments of whether they are overly harsh or a contract term is not substantively unconscionable when it merely gives one side a greater benefit rather,the term must be so as to shock the conscience.pinnacle museum tower pinnacle market development us,llc,supra,cal th at,citations omitted,italics added.simply put,the contract term must be either overly harsh or so as to shock the conscience.see id.at,citing hour fitness,superior court th,substantive element traditionally involves contract terms that are so as to shock the conscience,or that impose harsh or oppressive terms italics added.
procedural unconscionability 
because plaintiffs were required to sign the drp acknowledgement as a condition of employment,were unable to negotiate the terms of the drp,and had no meaningful choice in the matter,the drp was oppressive and procedurally unconscionable.see ajamian,th,martinez master protection th.but the arbitration provision was not hidden in a prolix printed form bruni didion,supra,th at,italics added and therefore did not involve an element of surprise.on the contrary,the arbitration provision was prominently featured as part of the drp,and the drp was a agreement that addressed only one subject the use of alternative dispute resolution in lieu of a civil suit.
substantive unconscionability 
plaintiffs contend the arbitration provision is substantively unconscionable in five respects.we discuss them in turn.
employer right to modify the drp 
the drp states that it may be updated from time to time as required by law.plaintiffs contend this clause renders the entire arbitration provision illusory and unenforceable or,in the alternative,constitutes an unconscionable clause itself.we disagree with both contentions.
as plaintiffs correctly point out,a n arbitration agreement allowing one party the unfettered right to alter the arbitration agreement existence or its scope is illusory,quoting dumais american golf cir.italics added.plaintiffs also argue t he fact that darden reserves the right to alter,amend,or modify the drp at its sole and absolute discretion at any time with or without notice creates no real promise,and therefore,insufficient consideration to support an enforceable agreement to arbitrate,citing floss ryan family steak houses,cir.and in ingle circuit city stores,cir,the court of appeals stated by granting itself the sole authority to amend or terminate the arbitration agreement,the employer proscribes an employee ability to consider and negotiate the terms of her contract.compounded by the fact that this contract is adhesive in the first instance,this provision embeds its adhesiveness by allowing only the employer to modify or terminate the terms of the agreement.therefore,we conclude that the provision affording the employer the unilateral power to terminate or modify the contract is substantively unconscionable.id.at,fn.omitted.
but under california law,an employer unilateral right to modify an arbitration provision is not unfettered it is subject to the limitations imposed by the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.in hour fitness,superior court,supra,th hour fitness,a female employee of hour fitness,doing business as hour nautilus nautilus,filed suit against her employer and several male employees,alleging sexual harassment.nautilus and the individual defendants filed motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication,seeking to establish that the employee had to arbitrate her claim as mandated by the arbitration of disputes section of nautilus personnel handbook.a separate document entitled,employment arbitration procedure manual,was incorporated by reference into the personnel handbook.
the employee opposed the motions on the ground that the personnel handbook was illusory because nautilus could amend it at anytime.the handbook contained a provision stating i acknowledge that nautilus reserves the right to change any provision in this handbook at any time for any reason without advance notice.though nautilus can make changes,i understand that nothing in this handbook can be modified or deleted,nor anything added,in any way by oral statement or practice.only the president of nautilus can change this handbook and the change must be in writing.if nautilus makes any material changes,it will give me a copy of them.hour fitness,supra,th at pp.when hired,the employee had signed an acknowledgment form,reciting that she had received and read the handbook and had also agreed to arbitrate all claims as provided in the arbitration procedure manual.id.at.the trial court denied the defendants motions.all parties sought writ relief.
in reversing the trial court as to all but one defendant,the court of appeal concluded that the modification provision was not illusory,saying in part w here the contract specifies performance the fact that one party reserves the power to vary it is not fatal if the exercise of the power is subject to prescribed or implied limitations such as the duty to exercise it in good faith and in accordance with fair dealings.nautilus discretionary power to modify the terms of the personnel handbook by written notice indisputably carries with it the duty to exercise that right fairly and in good faith so construed,the modification provision does not render the contract illusory.hour fitness,supra,th at,citations omitted accord,martinez scott specialty gases,th.
in peleg neiman marcus group,th,we held that,under california law,an arbitration agreement is illusory and thus unenforceable if an employer unilateral modifications apply where an employee claims have already accrued or are known to the employer.we also discussed the application of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,stating a unilateral modification provision that is silent as to whether contract changes apply to claims,accrued or known,is impliedly restricted by the covenant of good faith and fair dealing so that changes do not apply to such claims.under this analysis,the arbitration agreement in hour fitness is not illusory.if,however,a modification provision expressly addresses whether contract changes apply to claims that have accrued or are known to the employer,the covenant can not create implied terms that contradict the express language an arbitration agreement that expressly exempts all claims,accrued or known,from contract changes is valid and enforceable without resort to the covenant.if,on the other hand,an arbitration agreement expressly applies a contract change to such claims,the covenant can not vary the plain language,and the agreement is illusory.id.at.
the modification clause in this case does not grant darden an unfettered right to change the terms of the arbitration provision.rather,darden reserves the right to modify the arbitration provision as required by law.in our view,the modification clause is neither overly harsh or so as to shock the conscience.we fail to understand how a clause permitting a modification as required by law can itself be unlawful.if a particular modification is required by law,then the change is necessary to avoid the very result that plaintiffs seek here the invalidation of the arbitration provision.an employer should not be bound in perpetuity by the terms of an existing arbitration provision if a judicial decision or statute renders the provision invalid in some respect.
plaintiffs assert that the modification clause permits darden to require that only employee claims be submitted to arbitration,exempting its own claims from the arbitration process.but that type of modification would not be required by law.on the contrary,it would be unlawful.see,armendariz,supra,cal th at pp.it would also be inconsistent with the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.thus,to be lawful,an arbitration provision must require that both sides submit their respective disputes to arbitration.ibid.here,the drp states that it is the sole means for resolving covered disputes,instead of court actions.disputes eligible for drp must be resolved only through drp,with the final step being binding arbitration heard by an arbitrator.this means disputes will not be resolved by a judge or jury.neither the company nor the employee may bring disputes to court.the company and the employee waive all rights to bring a civil court action for these disputes.italics added.
the drp exempts certain types of claims from arbitration claims for workers compensation or unemployment insurance benefits claims that by law can not be subjected to mandatory arbitration and claims regarding wage scales,employee benefits,work rules,food quality,service standards,or company policies and procedures unless the dispute is brought pursuant to a specific federal or state statute,or other applicable legal standard.in light of these exemptions,the drp uses the term disputes to refer to claims not falling within one of the exemptions.
in sum,the clause granting darden the right to modify the arbitration provision in accordance with the law does not render arbitration illusory employees and darden are both required to submit claims to arbitration.nor is the modification clause substantively unconscionable.
limitations on discovery and the arbitration hearing 
plaintiffs challenge three clauses in the drp arbitration provision that govern discovery and the arbitration hearing.first,t he arbitrator has the authority to authorize reasonably needed discovery in addition to that provided by the american arbitration association rules.italics added.second,t he arbitration hearing will start no later than ninety days following the date of the selection of the arbitrator.however,the selected arbitrator may extend the hearing date if good cause is shown by either party.and third,t he arbitrator has the authority to set the duration of the hearing after conferring with both parties.typically,the arbitration hearing shall last no longer than two days.complex cases may require additional time.the employee and the company representative will each have one day to present their side of the dispute.the arbitrator may,for good cause,extend the duration of the hearing and adjust the timing of the presentations.also,the arbitrator may extend the hearing and any related discovery to whatever extent is necessary to meet any applicable legal requirements.
as a federal district court has explained in deciding the validity of these same clauses plaintiff contends that the provisions concerning discovery and the duration of the hearing hinder his ability to vindicate his statutory rights and therefore fail to satisfy armendariz.specifically,plaintiff argues,the arbitration agreement does not allow for adequate time for discovery,because it provides that the arbitration hearing start no later than days following the selection of the arbitrator.he also argues that it does not allow adequate time for the duration of the hearing,which is set at two days.both of these time limitations are subject to change by the arbitrator,for good cause these limitations,according to plaintiff,present unconscionable barriers to the vindication of his rights because as the plaintiff,he will require more time for discovery and more time to present his case at arbitration compared to the employer.moreover,the provision allowing the arbitrator to adjust the schedule for good cause is inadequate,plaintiff contends,because he would have to file an expensive motion for such relief from the arbitrator presumably,attorneys fees.
plaintiff arguments are unpersuasive.one of the benefits of arbitration is that it generally allows parties to reach a resolution on the merits more quickly than is possible in court.thus,california courts do not by any means require that an arbitration agreement permit unfettered discovery.mercuro,supra,th at.parties may certainly agree to something less than the full panoply of discovery provided in a civil action.armendariz,cal th at.
courts have upheld more stringent limitations on discovery.in a case that plaintiff himself cites for a different point,the arbitration agreement limited the parties to three depositions and an aggregate of discovery requests of any kind,with additional discovery requests to be granted only upon a showing of good cause.mercuro,supra,th at.yet the court rejected plaintiff argument that these limitations were unconscionable id.at.
something more than plaintiff speculative assertions about his ability to vindicate his rights is needed to invalidate discovery rules.mercuro and other cases make clear that whether limitations on discovery violate the principles in armendariz depends on the complexity of the claims,the nature of proof required,the precise discovery that the arbitration agreement does permit,and the burdens that the agreement imposes on the party who seeks to exceed the limits.see ontiveros dhl exp.usa,th,invalidating provision limiting depositions to one individual and any expert witness designated by another party because plaintiff would need to take at least to depositions and the arbitration agreement substantial need standard imposed too high a burden on plaintiff fitz ncr th,invalidating limitation on number of depositions because plaintiff demonstrated that a standard of compelling need unfairly required parties to demonstrate that a fair hearing would be impossible without additional discovery.
plaintiff has cited no authority finding presumptive time limits on discovery and the duration of the hearing,such as the limits in the drp,to be unconscionable nor has he shown how the discovery provision in the drp would necessarily prevent him from vindicating his statutory rights in his particular case.therefore,the court finds that the minimum requirement of adequate discovery has been met.rutter darden restaurants,no.cv ahm wl,pp,citation omitted,some italics added.
a rbitration is meant to be a streamlined procedure.limitations on discovery is one of the ways streamlining is achieved.in armendariz,the supreme court stated that the parties were entitled to discovery sufficient to vindicate their claims the court also acknowledged that discovery limitations are an integral and permissible part of the arbitration process armendariz specifically recognized that parties may agree to something less than the full panoply of discovery permitted in civil actions.dotson amgen,th,citations omitted.
i n roman superior court th,our colleagues in division seven pointed out that the rules of the american arbitration association aaa give the arbitrator authority to limit discovery and to order such discovery,by way of deposition,interrogatory,document production,or otherwise,as the arbitrator considers necessary to a full and fair exploration of the issues in dispute,consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration.the court of appeal rejected the argument that the aaa discovery provision was unconscionable because it unfairly delegates to the arbitrator the absolute discretion to deny depositions,contrary to the rules of civil discovery the court of appeal said in armendariz,the supreme court rejected an employee similar claim that a purportedly inadequate provision for discovery in an arbitration agreement was a proper ground for denying arbitration of their feha claims.although the supreme court observed some discovery is often necessary for vindicating a feha claim,it held whether or not the employees in this case are entitled to the full range of discovery provided in civil actions,they are at least entitled to discovery sufficient to adequately arbitrate their statutory claim,including access to essential documents and witnesses,as determined by the arbitrator s the court of appeal concluded there appears to be no meaningful difference between the scope of discovery approved in armendariz and that authorized by the aaa employment dispute rules dotson amgen,supra,th at,citations fn.omitted.as noted,the aaa employment dispute rules apply under the drp,and the arbitrator is authorized to permit discovery in addition to what the aaa rules provide.
here,plaintiffs assume that the arbitrator would not be fair in determining whether additional discovery was needed indeed,it is quite the opposite.we assume that the arbitrator will operate in a reasonable manner in conformity with the law.dotson amgen,supra,th at.unlike the discovery limitations in ontiveros dhl exp.usa,supra,th,and fitz ncr,supra,th fitz,the discovery provision in this case does not require a showing of substantial or compelling need to grant further discovery.dotson,at.t he agreement allows for e ither party to apply to the arbitrator for further discovery upon a showing of good cause thus,the discovery provision is not substantively unconscionable.abeyrama morgan chase bank,june,no.dmg wl.
in short,because the drp limitations on discovery,the timing of the hearing,and the length of the hearing are subject to change upon the arbitrator determination of good cause,the limitations do not render the arbitration provision unconscionable.
cost of reporter transcript 
under the drp,the employee may choose to arrange for a court reporter at his or her own cost.plaintiffs contend this clause unfairly burdens them with arbitration expenses.we disagree.under armendariz,an employer in an feha action must pay all types of costs that are unique to arbitration.armendariz,supra,cal th at,italics added.the cost of a reporter transcript is not that type of expense.even if plaintiffs causes of action were adjudicated in a judicial forum,plaintiffs would have to pay for a reporter transcript the employer would not be required to obtain a reporter transcript on the employees behalf.as provided by the california rules of court,if the services of an official court reporter are not available for a hearing or trial in a civil case,a party may arrange for the presence of a certified shorthand reporter to serve as an official pro tempore reporter.it is that party responsibility to pay the reporter fee for attendance at the proceedings,but the expense may be recoverable as part of the costs,as provided by law.cal.rules of court,rule c,italics added.
because an employee would have to pay for a reporter transcript in a civil action,darden may impose the same cost requirement in an arbitration proceeding without running afoul of armendariz or the doctrine of unconscionability.
availability of provisional relief 
the arbitration provision in the drp states the arbitrator has the same authority as a court of law to grant requested relief this would include relief requested regarding temporary restraints and preliminary injunctive remedies.however,this provision does not prevent either the employee or the company from requesting available temporary or preliminary injunctive remedies from an appropriate court,provided that the request does not remove the dispute from final resolution by the arbitrator.the request for temporary or preliminary injunctive remedies does not waive the requesting party right to arbitrate claims covered by the drp.plaintiffs argue that,because of this language,the arbitration provision lacks mutuality and is not bilateral.in other words,the arbitration provision exempts the causes of action that darden would be likely to bring.we conclude otherwise.
the caa contains a provision similar to the one in the drp.section,subdivision b section b of the caa provides a party to an arbitration agreement may file in the court in the county in which an arbitration proceeding is pending,or if an arbitration proceeding has not commenced,in any proper court,an application for a provisional remedy in connection with an arbitrable controversy,but only upon the ground that the award to which the applicant may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual without provisional relief.code civ,subd.b,italics added.the caa defines provisional remedy to include p reliminary injunctions and temporary restraining orders,subd.a.section b was enacted primarily to allow a party to an arbitration or subject to an arbitration agreement to obtain provisional judicial remedies without waiving the right to arbitrate,as some early case
