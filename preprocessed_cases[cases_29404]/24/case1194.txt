evidence code section et sets forth an extensive statutory scheme protecting the confidentiality of mediation proceedings,with narrowly delineated exceptions.in this breach of contract action arising from a medical malpractice suit,plaintiffs sought to enforce an oral settlement agreement allegedly formed during mediation.during pretrial proceedings,the doctor stipulated to,and submitted evidence of,events which had occurred during mediation,arguing that no enforceable contract was formed during mediation.for the first time at trial,the doctor invoked the mediation confidentiality statutes to prevent plaintiffs from introducing evidence relating to the mediation proceedings.over the doctor objection,the trial court admitted the evidence.
a majority of the court of appeal held that,despite the statutory confidentiality protections,the doctor was judicially estopped from arguing that evidence of the settlement agreement is statutorily inadmissible she placed before the trial court the facts of the mediation and sought a legal determination as to their effect.we conclude that the court of appeal improperly relied on the doctrine of estoppel to create a judicial exception to the comprehensive statutory scheme of mediation confidentiality and that the evidence relating to the mediation proceedings should not have been admitted at trial.
factual and procedural history 
on march,plaintiffs the minor son and mother of kintausha clemmons filed a wrongful death complaint against defendant lida ghaderi,alleging that her medical malpractice caused the death of kintausha clemmons.cooperative of american physicians,mutual protection trust was defendant medical malpractice insurance provider.
on july,the parties attended a mediation with the honorable robert altman,retired.plaintiffs and their counsel appeared.defendant was present with a claims specialist,the attorney,and cumis counsel under the provisions of her professional liability policy with,defendant had the right to withhold her consent to the settlement of any third party malpractice claim.at the request of the mediator,before the beginning of settlement discussions,defendant executed a standard form provided by.this document authorized to negotiate a settlement on defendant behalf,with the settlement value limited to.the document also stated that defendant consent to settlement could only be revoked in writing and would remain in force until a written revocation was received by at its offices.
the parties then engaged in settlement discussions while defendant waited in another room with cumis counsel.at one point,instructed judge altman to offer plaintiffs to settle the matter in exchange for a dismissal with prejudice and a waiver of costs.plaintiffs orally accepted the offer.judge altman then placed the essential terms of the settlement into a document for the parties to sign.when defendant was informed that the case had settled,she declared that she was revoking her consent and left the building without signing the settlement agreement.the claims specialist,unsure of how to proceed,contacted the office and learned that would consider defendant oral revocation of her consent valid.plaintiffs and their counsel signed the settlement agreement,but no one signed on behalf of defendant or.
the following day,plaintiffs attorney and attorney appeared in court and sought guidance.both counsel recounted the facts of the mediation to the court,including defendant written consent to settle for,the offer in that amount,the acceptance of the offer,and defendant departure while the settlement was being reduced to writing.the trial court speculated that there may be an enforceable oral settlement agreement.accordingly,the trial court vacated the trial date and set the matter for an order to show cause why the case should not be dismissed.
on july,defendant sent a letter formally revoking her consent to settle.
at the july,dismissal hearing,defendant spoke with the trial court.the court stated on the record that defendant was unwilling to consent to the settlement,but then suggested that plaintiffs move to enforce the settlement under code of civil procedure section 
on august,plaintiffs moved to enforce the settlement on the ground that an oral agreement had been reached with while had defendant consent to settle the action.plaintiffs supported their motion with a copy of defendant signed consent to settle,the written settlement agreement prepared by judge altman and signed only by plaintiffs and their counsel,and declarations from plaintiffs attorney and the mediator setting forth the events at the july mediation.
in opposing plaintiffs motion to enforce,defendant did not dispute their factual representations regarding the mediation.instead,arguing the legal effect of those facts,she claimed that the settlement could not be enforced because it did not meet the requirements of code of civil procedure section.defendant argued that no agreement had been consummated she had not signed the written settlement agreement and had withdrawn her consent,and therefore had no authority to execute a settlement agreement on her behalf.the trial court denied the motion to enforce settlement.it found that,because neither defendant nor had signed the written agreement,the requirements of code of civil procedure section had not been met.however,it noted there might be an enforceable oral contract and suggested plaintiffs amend their complaint to allege breach of contract.
following the trial court suggestion,plaintiffs amended their complaint to add a cause for breach of contract and alleged that defendant breached an oral settlement agreement reached during mediation.plaintiffs served a request for admissions on defendant and deposed her.in response to this discovery and in her motion for summary adjudication of the breach of contract cause,defendant did not dispute the events that had occurred during the mediation.indeed,in a declaration appended to her motion,defendant proffered that she had signed a written consent for to settle,her counsel had made a settlement offer to plaintiffs,and she had revoked her consent without executing the settlement agreement.
the trial court denied defendant motion for summary adjudication of the breach of contract cause of action and granted plaintiffs motion to sever the breach of contract and medical malpractice claims.the case proceeded to trial only on the breach of contract cause.
on october,nearly months after the mediation,defendant filed her trial brief.for the first time,she asserted that the mediation confidentiality statutes precluded plaintiffs from proving the existence of an oral settlement agreement.defendant trial brief raised no other issue.
at a bench trial,over defendant objection,plaintiffs submitted the following documents relating to the mediation the consent to settlement signed by defendant the settlement agreement prepared by judge altman defendant letter revoking her consent to settlement defendant deposition testimony the deposition testimony of the claims specialist and a declaration from judge altman.the parties agreed to almost everything that had occurred at the mediation,except what the claims specialist did once defendant had refused to sign the document.over defendant objection,the claims specialist testified about the events of the mediation.
the trial court concluded that plaintiffs and defendant agent,acting within his authority as evidenced by defendant signed consent agreement,had entered into a valid,enforceable oral contract before defendant withdrew her consent.it ordered specific performance of the agreement and entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs for,plus prejudgment interest.
in a decision,the court of appeal affirmed the trial court judgment.the majority held that a valid oral agreement had been reached during mediation.it further held that,because defendant had presented evidence of the occurrences at the mediation and failed to object to plaintiffs use of these facts during pretrial motions,she was estopped from asserting mediation confidentiality.in his dissent,justice aldrich maintained that the mediation confidentiality statutes prevented plaintiffs from proving the existence of an oral settlement agreement,that the majority focus on estoppel was a veiled attempt at relabeling waiver as estoppel,and that a party can not impliedly waive mediation confidentiality through litigation conduct.
we granted defendant petition for review to determine if she could be estopped from objecting to the admission of evidence proving the existence of an oral settlement agreement reached during mediation proceedings.
ii.discussion 
defendant contends that the court of appeal majority improperly relied on the doctrine of estoppel to create a judicial exception to the statutory requirements of confidentiality of mediation proceedings.et as explained below,we agree.
the mediation confidentiality statutes 
in,the legislature adopted the california law revision commission commission recommendations and revised the mediation confidentiality statutes.fair bakhtiari cal th,d,fair.it enacted section et,creating an extensive statutory scheme governing mediation confidentiality and its exceptions.fair,supra,at,d.
california legislature has a strong policy favoring mediation as an alternative to litigation.because mediation provides a simple,quick,and economical means of resolving disputes,and because it may also help reduce the court system backlog of cases,it is in the public interest to encourage its use.citation.doe superior court th,d.the legislature designed the mediation confidentiality statutes to promote a candid and informal exchange regarding events in the past this frank exchange is achieved only if the participants know that what is said in the mediation will not be used to their detriment through later court proceedings and other adjudicatory processes.citations.foxgate homeowners,bramalea california,cal th,d,foxgate.c onfidentiality is essential to effective mediation ibid.
section governs the general admissibility of oral and written communications made during the mediation process.it prohibits any person,mediator and participants alike,from revealing any written or oral communication made during mediation.foxgate,supra,cal th at,d.section,subdivision a states,in pertinent part,that except as otherwise provided in this chapter a no evidence of anything said or any admission made for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation is admissible or subject to discovery,and disclosure of the evidence shall not be compelled,in any civil action 
similarly,section,subdivision b states,in pertinent part,that except as otherwise provided in this chapter no writing that is prepared for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation or a mediation consultation,is admissible or subject to discovery,and disclosure of the writing shall not be compelled,in any civil action section,subdivision c further mandates that all communications,negotiations,or settlement discussions by and between participants in the course of a mediation shall remain confidential.
sections and specifically lay out exceptions for the admission of evidence produced during mediation.as relevant here,section,subdivision a provides that a communication or a writing that is made or prepared for the purpose of,or in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation or a mediation consultation,is not made inadmissible,or protected from disclosure,by provisions of this chapter if the following condition is satisfied all persons who conduct or otherwise participate in the mediation expressly agree in writing,or orally in accordance with section,to disclosure of the communication,document,or writing.
section specifies that an oral agreement made in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation is not made inadmissible,or protected from disclosure,if certain conditions involving section are satisfied oral agreements in accordance with section occur when a the oral agreement is recorded by a court reporter,tape recorder,or other reliable means of sound recording b the terms of the oral agreement are recited on the record in the presence of the parties and the mediator,and the parties express on the record that they agree to the terms recited c the parties to the oral agreement expressly state on the record that the agreement is enforceable or binding or words to that effect and d the recording is reduced to writing and the writing is signed by the parties within hours after it is recorded.
the legislative scheme also provides rules for the use of written settlement agreements produced during mediation.section protects the confidentiality of any written agreement made during mediation unless the parties expressly agree to disclosure or the agreement is used to show fraud,duress,or illegality 
further,statements made during mediation and mediation materials are confidential not only during the mediation,but also after the mediation ends.section clarifies that a nything said,any admission made,or any writing that is inadmissible,protected from disclosure,and confidential under this chapter before a mediation ends,shall remain inadmissible,protected from disclosure,and confidential to the same extent after the mediation ends.
in addition to the unambiguous language of the mediation confidentiality statutes,the commission comments further demonstrate that the legislature intended to apply confidentiality broadly and to limit any exceptions to confidentiality to narrowly prescribed statutory exemptions.fair,supra,cal th at,d,the commission official comments are deemed to express the legislature intent.the commission comment to section states explicitly that the section sets forth specific circumstances under which mediation confidentiality is inapplicable to an oral agreement reached through mediation.except in those circumstances,sections and codify the rule of ryan garcia th,d ryan mediation confidentiality applies to oral statement of settlement terms and reject the contrary approach of regents of the university of california sumner th,d regents mediation confidentiality does not protect oral statement of settlement terms.cal.law revision com,pt.west ann.supp.hereafter cal.law com.foll.
as noted in the commission comment,with section the legislature created a specific mechanism for the admission of evidence regarding oral settlement agreements made during mediation.this mechanism was created in reaction to two conflicting court of appeal decisions,ryan and regents.
in ryan,supra,th at page,d,the court of appeal held that under former section now section,evidence offered to prove the terms of an oral settlement agreement reached during mediation was inadmissible because it did not meet statutory requirements.in ryan,the parties went to mediation,agreed to a compromise,and orally recited the terms of the agreement.id.at,d.the agreement,however,was never reduced to writing,and the defendant later contested the terms of the settlement.ibid.the plaintiffs amended their complaint to add a cause of action to enforce the oral settlement.id.at,d.over defendant objections,the trial court admitted evidence of the oral recitation of the settlement terms to prove the existence of an agreement.ibid.the court reasoned that once the mediator announced the compromise,statements made thereafter were not produced in the course of mediation and were not protected under section.ryan,at,d.
the defendant appealed,claiming the statements concerning the existence and terms of the settlement agreement were part of the mediation and therefore inadmissible.ryan,supra,th at,d.noting that former section should be broadly interpreted to ensure confidentiality,the court of appeal held that the oral statements made after the announced compromise were made in the course of mediation.ryan,at,d.the court rejected the plaintiffs argument that such interpretation of the statutory scheme would divest mediation of its intended usefulness,and it noted that the statutes provided a procedural mechanism to protect confidentiality and simple and clear means for enforcement of settlements.id.at,d.
subsequently,in regents,supra,th,d,the court of appeal declined to follow ryan and held that former section did not bar introduction of oral statements evidencing a settlement made after a compromise had been achieved.although the court of appeal acknowledged its decision contradicted ryan,it nonetheless concluded that a trial court could admit evidence of oral statements made after a compromise had been reached.regents,supra,th at,d.
the regents rule,however,was expressly rejected by the legislature when it revised the mediation confidentiality statutes.the commission comment to section provides that,except when the requirements expressly laid out in sections and are met,sections and together codify the rule of ryan and reject regents.cal.law,supra,foll.section is more expansive than its predecessor,former section.section,subdivision a,extends to oral communications made for the purpose of or pursuant to a mediation,not just oral communications made in the course of the mediation.cal.law,supra,foll.it also explicitly applies in a subsequent arbitration or administrative adjudication,as well as in any civil proceeding.ibid.recognizing both the breadth and clarity of the mediation confidentiality statutes,we have concluded that the legislative scheme is clear and unambiguous,and that the legislature intended for mediation confidentiality to apply according to the statutory rules.foxgate,supra,cal th at,d.thus,mediation confidentiality now clearly applies to prohibit admissibility of evidence of settlement terms made for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to a mediation unless the agreement falls within express statutory exceptions,subd.a.
in the present case,an oral agreement may have been reached between defendant insurer and plaintiffs during the mediation however,the parties did not follow the statutory procedures that would have made this agreement admissible.specifically,no form of recordation of the oral agreement exists,nor is there a written agreement signed by both parties.the agreement as memorialized by judge altman is similarly inadmissible under sections,and,as there was no express agreement that it could be disclosed,and it was not signed by defendant or her attorneys.the court of appeal and the parties do not dispute that evidence of the oral settlement agreement was inadmissible under the statutory requirements.
judicially created exceptions to mediation confidentiality 
nevertheless,the court of appeal majority relied on the doctrine of estoppel to prevent a litigant from tardily relying on mediation confidentiality to shield from the court facts which she had stipulated to be true and had extensively litigated without raising such bar.the dissenting opinion noted,however,that,b y focusing on estoppel,the majority in essence is attempting to create a new exception to the comprehensive scheme.we agree with this latter characterization.
on limited occasions,courts have crafted exceptions to mediation confidentiality and compelled mediators to testify in civil actions.however,those instances are very limited.in rinaker superior court th,d,the court compelled a mediator to testify because it found that a minor due process right to confrontation of witnesses outweighed the statutory right to mediation confidentiality.in olam congress mortgage d,the parties themselves expressly waived confidentiality.because of this waiver,the court found that the policy driving mediation confidentiality had appreciably less force.id.at.
except in cases of express waiver or where due process is implicated,we have held that mediation confidentiality is to be strictly enforced.in foxgate,we addressed the general validity of judicially crafted exceptions to mediation confidentiality.foxgate,supra,cal th,d.there,the court of appeal found an exception to section that would allow a mediator to report a party failure to participate in good faith in the mediation process.foxgate,supra,cal th at,d.we held that the court of appeal erred in judicially creating an exception to section.distinguishing rinaker and olam,we noted that where a supervening due process right is not implicated or where no express waiver of confidentiality exists,judicially crafted exceptions to mediation confidentiality are not appropriate.foxgate,at,d.to this end,we announced that in order t o carry out the legislative purpose of encouraging mediation by ensuring confidentiality,the statutory scheme unqualifiedly bars disclosure of communications made during mediation absent an express statutory exception.id.at,d,fn.omitted.further,judicial construction of unambiguous statutes is appropriate only when literal interpretation would yield absurd results.id.at,d.
in deciding whether a judicial exception was appropriate to carry out the legislature goals,we observed that with the enactment of the mediation confidentiality statutes,the legislature contemplated that some behavior during mediation would go unpunished.foxgate,supra,cal th at,d.the legislature was also presumably aware that general sanctions statutes permit punishing bad faith conduct.considering this,we reasoned we were bound to respect the legislature policy choice to protect mediation confidentiality rather than create a procedure that encouraged good faith participation in mediation.thus,we held that evidence of a party bad faith during the mediation may not be admitted or considered.ibid.
we subsequently reaffirmed that the mediation confidentiality statutes unqualifiedly bar disclosure of certain communications and writings produced in mediation absent an express statutory exception.rojas superior court cal th,d,rojas.in rojas,the court of appeal concluded that,like work product,certain derivative materials exchanged during mediation were discoverable on a good cause showing.id.at,d.rejecting this conclusion,we noted that section of the code of civil procedure codified the good cause exception to the work product doctrine the legislature clearly knew how to enact a statutory good cause exception to the mediation confidentiality statutes,but it chose not to do so.rojas,at,d.furthermore,the legislature has enacted other statutory exceptions to mediation confidentiality.under the maxim of statutory construction,expressio unius est exclusio alterius,if exemptions are specified in a statute,courts may not imply additional exemptions unless there is a clear legislative intent to the contrary.citation.id.at,d.finding no such intent,we concluded that judicial exceptions should not be read into evidence code section.rojas,at,d,fair,supra,cal th at,d,reaffirming the disapproval of judicially crafted exceptions to the mediation confidentiality statutes.
like foxgate and rojas,the present case does not implicate any due process right equivalent to the right bestowed by the confrontation clause of the united states constitution,nor have the parties executed express waivers of confidentiality.thus,rinaker and olam are distinguishable,and their rationale inapplicable.instead,by creating fixed procedures that allow only certain evidence produced at mediation to be admitted in later civil proceedings,the legislature was undeniably aware that some agreements made during mediation would not be enforceable.the statutes thus reflect a policy judgment made by the legislature when weighing the value of confidentiality.creating exceptions to admit evidence that does not meet statutory requirements would run contrary to legislative intent.
despite the clear legislative intent,the court of appeal majority nonetheless estopped the defendant from invoking mediation confidentiality because she herself used and did not object to plaintiffs use of evidence describing the events of mediation.
the estoppel cases on which the court of appeal relied are inapt.the majority concluded that,once a party voluntarily declares certain facts to be true,stipulates that she does not dispute them and extensively litigates the legal effect of such facts,she is estopped to later claim that the court must disregard those facts based upon a belated assertion of mediation confidentiality.to support this statement,the majority opinion relied on gee american realty construction,th,d,and conservatorship of kevin th,d.these cases involved estoppel to contest jurisdiction.that doctrine provides that when a court has subject matter j
