in this case we consider whether an admittedly valid employment arbitration agreement that is governed by the federal arbitration act et faa may be enforced to dismiss a former employee administrative wage claim against his former employer for unpaid vacation pay.the former employee,respondent frank moreno,filed an administrative wage claim with the labor commissioner according to the berman process provided in labor code section et added by stats,ch.moreno former employer,appellant a,sonic,petitioned the superior court to dismiss the berman proceeding and compel arbitration in accordance with the parties arbitration agreement,which moreno conceded was a valid agreement.the superior court denied the petition as premature.we reverse the order denying sonic motion to compel arbitration.
sonic contends that the labor commissioner jurisdiction over this statutory wage claim was divested by the faa.sonic cites as controlling authority the united states supreme court recent decision in preston ferrer,d preston,in which the labor commissioner original and exclusive jurisdiction was held to be divested by the faa with regard to a contract dispute arising under the talent agencies act et taa.alternatively,sonic argues that even if the minimum requirements for arbitration set forth in armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,armendariz apply to this statutory wage claim,a berman hearing is not a prerequisite to arbitration,either under armendariz or gentry superior court cal th,d,gentry.
we conclude that moreno waived his right to a berman proceeding and enforcement of that waiver is not barred by armendariz or gentry.
background 
the facts are undisputed.frank moreno is a former employee of sonic,which owns and operates an automobile dealership.as a condition of his employment with sonic,moreno signed a predispute agreement that required both parties to submit their employment disputes to binding arbitration under the federal arbitration act,in conformity with the procedures of the california arbitration act civ.proc.et seq.by its terms,the arbitration agreement applied to all disputes that may arise out of the employment context that either party may have against the other which would otherwise require or allow resort to any court or other governmental dispute resolution forum,whether based on tort,contract,statutory,or equitable law,or otherwise.
at some point,moreno left his position with sonic.in december,moreno filed an administrative wage claim with the labor commissioner for unpaid vacation pay pursuant to section et.moreno alleged that he was entitled to unpaid v acation wages for days earned to at the rate of per day.
in february,sonic petitioned the superior court to compel arbitration of the wage claim and dismiss the pending administrative action.code civ.the parties agreed that the arbitration agreement applied to the wage claim,but disagreed as to whether the arbitration agreement contained a waiver of the right to a berman proceeding berman waiver,which would bar moreno administrative wage claim under section et.sonic argued that such a waiver was created by the provision of the arbitration agreement requiring arbitration of all employment disputes that could otherwise be brought in any judicial or other governmental dispute resolution forum.
the labor commissioner intervened below on behalf of moreno,who adopted the labor commissioner arguments.the labor commissioner argued that nothing in the arbitration agreement precluded moreno from filing an administrative wage claim under section et,which could then be followed by arbitration in lieu of the de novo appeal to superior court that is otherwise available under section.the labor commissioner argued against bypassing the berman process,claiming that,under armendariz,it is a necessary prerequisite to arbitration.the rationale for this conclusion was that,in the event the employee prevailed in the berman process and the employer then moved to compel arbitration,the arbitrator would be required to provide the employee with all of the protections that would otherwise be available if the employer had sought a de novo appeal in superior court under section.however,the labor commissioner failed to identify any statutory authority to support this conclusion.
the superior court denied the petition to compel arbitration as premature.citing armendariz,the superior court stated that,as a matter of basic public policy until there has been the preliminary hearing and decision by the labor commissioner,the arbitration provisions of the employment contract are unenforceable,and any petition to compel arbitration is premature and must be denied.
sonic appealed from the order of denial.code civ,subd.a order denying a motion to compel arbitration is appealable.during the briefing period,the united states supreme court decided preston,which held that the labor commissioner original and exclusive jurisdiction was divested by the faa with regard to a contract dispute arising under the taa.the labor commissioner has not filed a respondent brief in this appeal.
discussion 
a petition to compel arbitration is resolved in a summary proceeding with the trial court sitting as trier of fact and weighing declarations,documentary evidence and any oral testimony.engalla permanente medical group,cal th,d.pursuant to code of civil procedure section,unless the petitioner has waived arbitration,grounds exist for revocation of the agreement,or a party to the arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending matter with a third party and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue,the trial court shall order the parties to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists.amalgamated transit union local los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority th,d.whether an arbitration agreement applies to a controversy is a question of law to which the appellate court applies its independent judgment where no conflicting extrinsic evidence in aid of interpretation was introduced in the trial court.id.at,d.
as there were no disputed facts below,we will exercise our independent judgment on appeal.
i.the right to wages and the berman hearing process 
in cuadra millan cal th,d,cuadra disapproved on other grounds in samuels mix cal th,fn,d,the california supreme court discussed the employee right to receive earned wages and engage in the berman hearing process as follows the wage rights of an employee may be provided for in the employment contract between the employee and the employer,whether oral or written,including a collective bargaining agreement.the employee wage rights are also closely regulated by statute the labor code prescribes such matters as the time and manner of paying wages,minimum wage requirements,and mandatory overtime pay for certain industries and occupations,minimum wages and overtime pay are also prescribed by administrative regulations known as wage orders,issued by the industrial welfare commission pursuant to statutory authority see industrial welfare com.superior court cal d.fn.omitted.
if an employer fails to pay wages in the amount,time or manner required by contract or by statute,the employee has two principal options.the employee may seek judicial relief by filing an ordinary civil action against the employer for breach of contract for the wages prescribed by statute.or the employee may seek administrative relief by filing a wage claim with the commissioner pursuant to a special statutory scheme codified in sections to.the latter option was added by legislation enacted in stats,ch,and is commonly known as the berman hearing procedure after the name of its sponsor.
the berman hearing procedure is designed to provide a speedy,informal,and affordable method of resolving wage claims.fn.omitted.in brief,in a berman proceeding the commissioner may hold a hearing on the wage claim the pleadings are limited to a complaint and an answer the answer may set forth the evidence that the defendant intends to rely on,and there is no discovery process if the defendant fails to appear or answer no default is taken and the commissioner proceeds to decide the claim,but may grant a new hearing on request.the commissioner must decide the claim within days after the hearing.within days after notice of the decision any party may appeal to the appropriate court,where the claim will be heard de novo if no appeal is taken,the commissioner decision will be deemed a judgment,final immediately and enforceable as a judgment in a civil action.see generally,wilcox,cal.employment law to,to cuadra,supra,cal th at,d.
ii.the right to vacation pay 
under california law,vacation pay constitutes wages.the labor code defines wages as all amounts for labor performed by employees of every description,whether the amount is fixed or ascertained by the standard of time,task,piece,commission basis,or other method of calculation,subd.a.courts have recognized that wages also include those benefits to which an employee is entitled as a part of his or her compensation,including money,room,board,clothing,vacation pay,and sick pay,suastez plastic cal d,department of industrial relations ui video stores,th,d.murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th,d.
the right to a paid vacation is a contract right that,once vested,may not be forfeited upon termination.according to suastez plastic,supra,cal d at page,t he right to a paid vacation,when offered in an employer policy or contract of employment,constitutes deferred wages for services rendered.case law from this state and others,as well as principles of equity and justice,compel the conclusion that a proportionate right to a paid vacation vests as the labor is rendered.once vested,the right is protected from forfeiture by section.on termination of employment,therefore,the statute requires that an employee be paid in wages for a pro rata share of his vacation pay.fn.omitted.
in the absence of an arbitration agreement,it is clear that an employee may pursue a wage claim for vacation pay in either an administrative et or judicial forum.also,it is clear that even with an arbitration agreement,an employee may pursue a wage claim in a judicial forum,provided the agreement is not governed by the faa.under california law,section provides that a ctions to enforce the provisions of this article for the collection of due and unpaid wages claimed by an individual may be maintained without regard to the existence of any private agreement to arbitrate 
however,given that this action is governed by the faa,we are faced with the following issues whether preston compels the conclusion that the labor commissioner jurisdiction over moreno statutory wage claim was divested by the faa,and,if not,whether moreno contractually waived the statutory right to pursue his wage claim in an administrative forum berman waiver,and,if so,whether the berman waiver is unenforceable for public policy reasons under armendariz or gentry.
iii.preston is not dispositive of this case 
federal preemption generally 
section of the faa provides in relevant part a written provision in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction,or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof,shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.
according to preston,s ection declare s a national policy favoring arbitration of claims that parties contract to settle in that manner.southland keating,d.that national policy,we held in southland,appli es in state as well as federal courts and foreclose s state legislative attempts to undercut the enforceability of arbitration agreements,at.the faa displacement of conflicting state law is now,terminix dobson,d,and has been repeatedly reaffirmed,see,buckeye check cashing,cardegna,d doctor associates,casarotto,d perry thomas,d.fn.omitted.preston,supra,at.at.
the faa incorporates a strong federal policy of enforcing arbitration agreements,including agreements to arbitrate statutory rights.see broughton cigna healthplans cal th,d,and cases cited therein.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.in light of this strong federal policy,we are required to rigorously enforce agreements to arbitrate.express,mcmahon,d.fn.omitted.lagatree luce,forward,hamilton scripps th,d.
federal preemption under preston 
as previously mentioned,preston involved a contractual dispute involving an alleged violation of the taa.under california law,the labor commissioner has original and exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising under the taa,including the validity of personal management contracts between artists and their managers,and their respective liabilities thereunder.buchwald superior court d.styne stevens cal th,d,disputes arising under the taa must be heard by the commissioner,and all remedies before the commissioner must be exhausted before the parties can proceed to the superior court.
in preston,a personal manager instituted an arbitration proceeding against his client,an artist,for breach of contract,but the artist filed an administrative action with the labor commissioner,seeking to invalidate the entire contract based on the manager allegedly unlicensed talent agent activities on the artist behalf in violation of the taa the artist also filed a judicial action for injunctive and declaratory relief.the manager moved to compel arbitration,which the superior court denied,and the manager appealed from the order of denial.the appellate court affirmed the denial of the motion to compel arbitration in a published decision ferrer preston th,d,review denied,which was reversed by the united states supreme court while this appeal was pending.
given that the labor commissioner was asked to invalidate the parties entire contract on a defense,the supreme court concluded the artist had urged the labor commissioner and california courts to override the contract arbitration clause on a ground that buckeye requires the arbitrator to decide in the first instance.preston,supra.at.the supreme court pointed out that according to buckeye,supra,d,when parties agree to arbitrate all disputes arising under their contract,questions concerning the validity of the entire contract are to be resolved by the arbitrator in the first instance,not by a federal or state court.preston,supra.at.the dispositive issue,the supreme court stated in preston,is not whether the faa preempts the taa wholesale.citation.the faa plainly has no such destructive aim or effect.instead,the question is simply who decides whether preston acted as personal manager or as talent agent.id.at.
in rejecting the artist contentions,the supreme court considered whether allowing the administrative hearing to proceed would not violate the faa because arbitration would merely be postponed until the labor commissioner issued a nonbinding ruling on the validity of the artist defense.the supreme court concluded that this was not a viable argument,stating nor does ferrer the artist current a merely postpones examination.section a provides for de novo review in superior court,not elsewhere.arbitration,if it ever occurred following the labor commissioner decision,would likely be long delayed,in contravention of congress intent to move the parties to an arbitrable dispute out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as possible.moses cone memorial hospital mercury constr,d.if ferrer prevailed in the california courts,moreover,he would no doubt argue that judicial findings of fact and conclusions of law,made after a full and fair de novo hearing in court,are binding on the parties and preclude the arbitrator from making any contrary rulings.preston,supra.at.
the supreme court pointed out that a prime objective of an agreement to arbitrate is to achieve streamlined proceedings and expeditious results.mitsubishi motors soler,d.see also terminix,at.southland,at.that objective would be frustrated even if preston could compel arbitration in lieu of de novo superior court review.requiring initial reference of the parties dispute to the labor commissioner would,at the least,hinder speedy resolution of the controversy.preston,supra.at.
before concluding that the labor commissioner jurisdiction was preempted by the faa,the supreme court emphasized that the validity and substantive rights of the arbitration agreement were not in dispute,stating finally,it bears repeating that preston petition presents precisely and only a question concerning the forum in which the parties dispute will be heard.see supra,at.by agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim,a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral forum.mitsubishi motors,at.so here,ferrer relinquishes no substantive rights the taa or other california law may accord him.but under the contract he signed,he can not escape resolution of those rights in an arbitral forum.preston,supra.at.
for the above reasons,the supreme court concluded that the labor commissioner jurisdiction over the administrative action was divested by the faa.but it expressed this conclusion in a broadly worded statement we hold today that,when parties agree to arbitrate all questions arising under a contract,state laws lodging primary jurisdiction in another forum,whether judicial or administrative,are superseded by the faa.preston,supra.at.by focusing solely on the breadth of this holding,sonic argues that,under preston,we are compelled to conclude the faa preempts the labor commissioner jurisdiction over all wage claims filed under section et.we do not read preston so broadly.
as the supreme court in preston explained the artist was seeking to invalidate the entire contract based on the personal manager alleged violations of the taa,which is an issue that buckeye requires the arbitrator to decide in the first instance the validity and substantive rights of the arbitration clause were not in dispute and the only issue was whether the fee dispute should be resolved in an arbitral or administrative forum.the parties did not litigate in preston whether there were any generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,which would invalidate or restrict the arbitration agreement.only generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate or restrict arbitration agreements without contravening of the faa.doctor associates,supra,at.cronus investments,concierge services cal th,d.
in this case,the parties disagree as to whether it would be unconscionable under armendariz or gentry to restrict the arbitration clause by invalidating the berman waiver.accordingly,the issues in this case are distinguishable from those that were addressed in preston.we therefore disagree with sonic position that preston is dispositive of this case.
iv.the agreement contained a berman waiver 
under california law,an arbitration agreement may not be enforced to preclude an employee from pursuing a statutory wage claim in a judicial forum under section.but in perry thomas,supra,at page,the united states supreme court held that the faa preempted section,thereby denying a judicial forum to those employees whose arbitration agreements are governed by the faa.two years after perry was decided,the labor commissioner refused to consider an employee administrative claim for overtime pay in baker aubry d,on the ground that his statutory jurisdiction under section et was preempted by the faa.the labor commissioner jurisdictional ruling was upheld by the superior court in a writ of mandate proceeding,which was affirmed on appeal.the employee argued on appeal that because the right to overtime pay is statutory and can not be waived,it is therefore not subject to arbitration.in rejecting this argument and concluding that the arbitration agreement was enforceable to preclude an administrative forum for the wage claim,the appellate court stated that r esolution of baker overtime pay claim by arbitration does not deprive her of her substantive rights.it only changes the forum in which they will be resolved.citation.id.at.
in this case,the labor commissioner exercised jurisdiction over moreno wage claim on the theory that the arbitration agreement did not preclude him from engaging in the berman process prior to arbitration.whether the labor commissioner interpretation of the arbitration agreement was correct presents solely a question of law,given that no extrinsic evidence was presented below as to the meaning of the contract.the interpretation of a contract is purely a legal issue for the court unless the interpretation turns upon the credibility of extrinsic evidence.accordingly,an appellate court is not bound by a construction of the contract based solely upon the terms of the written instrument without the aid of evidence citations,where there is no conflict in the evidence citations,or a determination has been made upon incompetent evidence citation.citations.parsons bristol development cal d,fn.omitted.
according to the arbitration agreement,moreno was precluded from pursuing any judicial or other governmental dispute resolution forum,with the sole exception of claims arising under the national labor relations act which are brought before the national labor relations board,claims for medical and disability benefits under the california workers compensation act and employment development claims.in addition,the agreement stated that moreno was allowed to file administrative proceedings only before the california department of fair employment and housing,or the equal opportunity commission.italics added.
as shown by the above contractual provisions,the parties contemplated that moreno could pursue only those administrative remedies that were listed as exceptions to the agreement.given that neither the division of labor standards enforcement nor the labor commissioner was listed among the stated exceptions,we conclude,as a matter of law,that moreno was barred from pursuing an administrative wage claim under section et.having concluded that the arbitration agreement contained a berman waiver,we turn to the issue of whether the waiver is unenforceable for public policy reasons under armendariz or gentry.
v.the berman waiver is not unenforceable under armendariz or gentry 
according to armendariz,arbitration agreements that encompass unwaivable statutory rights must be subject to particular scrutiny.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.a n arbitration agreement can not be made to serve as a vehicle for the waiver of statutory rights.id.at,d.
armendariz enumerated several minimum requirements for arbitration that apply to unwaivable claims that are carefully tethered to statutory or constitutional provisions boghos certain underwriters at lloyd of london cal th,d,such as discrimination in violation of the california fair employment and housing act feha,et or wrongful discharge in violation of public policy,claims under tameny atlantic richfield cal d.giuliano inland empire personnel,th,d giuliano.the supreme court explained in gentry,supra,cal th,d,that it imposed the armendariz requirements because they are necessary to enable an employee to vindicate unwaivable rights in an arbitration forum.little auto stiegler,cal th,d.gentry,supra,at,d.it stated that even though a party who is compelled to arbitrate unwaivable rights does not waive them,but merely submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than a judicial,forum citation,arbitration can not be misused to accomplish a de facto waiver of these rights.little,supra,cal th at,d.gentry,supra,at,d.
gentry summarized the armendariz requirements as follows the arbitration agreement may not limit the damages normally available under the statute armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,there must be discovery sufficient to adequately arbitrate their statutory claim id.at,d,there must be a written arbitration decision and judicial review sufficient to ensure the arbitrators comply with the requirements of the statute ibid.and the employer must pay all types of costs that are unique to arbitration id.at,d.little auto stiegler,supra,cal th at,d,gentry,supra,cal th at,d.
a.the right to vacation pay,once vested,is unwaivable 
sonic contends that the superior court erroneously applied the armendariz requirements to this case because the right to vacation pay is
