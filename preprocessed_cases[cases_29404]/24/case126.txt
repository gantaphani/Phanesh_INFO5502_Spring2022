new york city and vicinity district council of the united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners of america the district council,a regional council of local unions,and association of and carpentry industries of new york,wcc,an employers association,are parties to a collective bargaining agreement the cba.separately,wcc is a party to an agreement the international agreement with the district council parent international union,the united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners of america ubc.the cba and the international agreement contain inconsistent provisions governing the staffing of jobs,jobs to be performed with two carpenters the district council asserts that wcc must follow the cba job provision,whereas wcc claims that its members may elect to invoke the international agreement provision to supersede that of the cba.
this otherwise straightforward labor dispute gains a layer of complexity from the fact that,due to a prior consent decree settling a government civil suit under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico against the district council,the cba negotiated by the district council and wcc could not go into effect without judicial approval.the parties disagreement over the job provisions arose after the district court richard berman,judge approved the cba.an arbitrator ruled in favor of wcc,and the district council brought this action seeking vacatur of the arbitral award.the district court granted summary judgment to the district council,holding that the award did not draw its essence from the cba,and further that it violated the district court earlier order approving the cba.
we conclude,to the contrary,that the arbitrator properly exercised his authority to interpret the cba,and that his award did not violate the judicial order of approval.accordingly,we vacate the judgment and remand the case to permit the district court to revisit its decision to approve the cba with the benefit of the arbitrator interpretation of its job provision.
background 
i.the consent decree and the monitorship of the district council 
some historical background is necessary to place the district court decision in context.the story begins in,when the government brought a civil rico action in the southern district of new york against the district council,alleging that it was controlled by organized crime,with predictable adverse consequences for businesses and dissident union members.see generally united states dist.council of vicinity of the united of carpenters,supp,district council i,rev,app x cir.district council ii.the case proceeded to a bench trial,but the parties announced that they had agreed to settle the case by consent decree.judge charles haight,to whom the case was originally assigned,approved the consent decree on march.see id.at.
the consent decree stated purposes were to ensure that there should be no criminal element or la cosa nostra corruption of any part of the district council and that the district council would be maintained and run democratically.consent decree at docket to that end,the decree called for the appointment of an investigations and review officer iro with investigative powers and the authority to review and veto district council expenditures and changes to the union constitution or bylaws.the decree also incorporated a number of rules governing the referral of union members to employers,and required the district council to give notice to the government and to the iro of any changes to those rules.the iro and the government were given the power to veto such changes,subject to review by the district court on the question whether the proposed change is consistent with the terms and objectives of this consent decree.id.at.the requirement of notice to the government was to remain in force until seven years after the end of the iro term,a period that ended on june.united states dist.council of vicinity of the united of carpenters,civ.csh,wl,at.
at the time of the consent decree,the district council collective bargaining agreements with employers contained a rule,under which employers were free to select half of the carpenters on any particular job site from within the district council membership,and the district council referred the other half according to rules incorporated in the consent decree.see district council i,supp.at.those rules required the district council to refer members from its list owl in the order in which they registered,except that an employer could continue to select carpenters beyond its quota if those carpenters had worked for that employer within the past six months.see id.
in,however,the district council renegotiated its collective bargaining agreements with employers associations,replacing the rule with a new request system.see id.at.the request system did away with the condition that,beyond the first of the workforce at a job site,an employer could freely request only those carpenters who had worked for the employer within the past six months,effectively giving employers free rein to select all the carpenters on a job and all but eliminating the role of the owl 
although the condition was enshrined in the rules incorporated in the consent decree,the district council did not inform the iro or the government of its intention to abolish it.the government,asserting that the district council had violated the consent decree notice requirement,sought an order of contempt against the district council and its president.the district court denied the motion,id.at,but we reversed,holding that the notice requirement did not exclude from its ambit changes to job referral rules that were effected through new collective bargaining agreements.district council ii,app x at.on remand,and following briefing and discovery,the district court issued an opinion addressing the appropriate remedy for the district council contempt.united states dist.council of vicinity of the united of carpenters,supp.district council iii see also united states dist.council of vicinity of the united of carpenters,supp,contempt order.
as relevant here,the district court voided the request system and reimplemented the rule,modified to cap at freely selected from within the union membership and an additional if the selected carpenters satisfied the condition the proportion of a job site workforce that could be selected by the employer.contempt order,supp.at.the district court explained this resolution is fair and equitable because it recognizes contractors economic and competitive concerns by allowing them to select most of the carpenter work force on any particular project,while restoring the owl as a meaningful source of employment for carpenters seeking work.district council iii,supp.at.the district court also reinstated the consent decree notice requirement,contempt order,supp.at,which,as noted above,had expired in.
meanwhile,the government continued to investigate the district council.its concern was no longer the influence of organized crime,but instead the practice of employers paying carpenters off the books at rates lower than those specified in collective bargaining agreements and failing to make contributions to the union benefit funds.see united states dist.council of vicinity of the united of carpenters,civ.csh,wl,at june.that practice required the cooperation of dishonest local union shop stewards and district council officers.id.the unsealing,in august,of an indictment against defendants associated with the district council and with certain employers prompted the government and the district council to enter into a new stipulation creating the position of review officer ro,with powers similar to those of the iro under the consent decree.id.at see also stipulation and order regarding appointment of a review officer docket ro stipulation.the district court approved the stipulation on june.
ii.approval of the cba 
in,the district council collective bargaining agreements were once again up for renewal.negotiations with wcc led to the parties adoption of a memorandum agreement,which was ratified by the district council delegate body on august.the agreement contained provisions on,among other things,wages,holidays,shift work,as well as the job provision at issue in this appeal discussed in more detail below and a manning provision.app x.the manning provision envisioned replacing the hiring ratio previously imposed by the district court as a contempt sanction with a new full mobility system,under which an employer could select all of the carpenters at any job site except for the second carpenter,who would be referred by the district council and appointed shop steward.
the full mobility system could not be implemented without an order from the district court lifting the hiring ratio,which would not be forthcoming unless the district court was satisfied that full mobility was consistent with the goals of the consent decree and the ro stipulation.the parties were concerned,however,that allowing employers to select almost all of their workforce might exacerbate the problem of employers underpaying carpenters off the books.as the ro later explained to the district court,b y having a percentage of union members who were not picked by the employers but rather were sent by the district council,there was a counterpoise to company men who might turn a blind eye to corruption.march,letter of dennis walsh at docket.accordingly,the district council and wcc further agreed on a package of measures,which included equipping shop stewards with wireless devices for electronically reporting carpenters hours to the district council,creating a website on which carpenters could ascertain that their hours were accurately reported,and paying sixteen retired carpenters to conduct spot inspections of job sites.see february,letter of james murphy at docket.
on february,judge berman to whom the case had by then been reassigned held a hearing on the proposed package of hiring provision changes and measures.the district council,wcc,the government,and the ro all spoke in favor of the package.the only negative note was sounded by several members of the district council who were invited to speak the parties summarized the history of the case and explained to the court their concern about corruption.the discussion then turned to an extensive review of the measures and technology.except during the colloquies with the members,there was essentially no debate over the merits of the full mobility provisions,and importantly only one brief mention of the job provision.at the conclusion of the hearing,the district court expressed its reluctance to approve the cba before it was finalized.on april,after the parties submitted a finalized version,the district court directed the district council to seek ratification from the delegate body,which the district council obtained on april 
finally,on may,the district court issued an order approving the cba.it began by noting that district council members,who had submitted many petitions and letters to the court,did not appear to have standing to litigate this proceeding regarding the cba.app x.it then stated the district council and the ro have argued persuasively that the new cba is advantageous for both the carpenters in the union and the contractors in wcc,app x,emphasizing the wage increases conceded by wcc in exchange for full mobility,the compliance package,and the fact that the district council had been without a collective bargaining agreement since the expiration of the previous version on june.it noted that the government and the ro had approved the cba,and that the district council delegate body had ratified it.it explained that the ability of the contractors to select the carpenters they employ appears to have been freely bargained for with the union,resulting in,among other things,a higher wage component.app x.most importantly,the district court concluded,the cba is a bargained over agreement and was approved by the executive committee of the district council and by the delegate body of the district council,lawfully designated representatives with the authority to approve collective bargaining agreements.app x.accordingly,the court approved the cba,and it went into effect.in approving the cba,the court made no mention of ubc and wcc separate international agreement.
iii.this dispute and the resulting arbitration 
the district council geographical jurisdiction is limited to the five boroughs of new york city and a small portion of nassau county,but wcc members are located throughout the broader new york city metropolitan area,including within the jurisdiction of other regional district councils of ubc.the cba limits wcc ability to hire carpenters affiliated with those other regional district councils whom the parties call by requiring to be matched with carpenters referred by the district council.thus,under the cba,an employer decision to hire comes at the price of giving up some control over the selection of its workforce.the matching rule applies to all jobs covered by the cba,but is repeated explicitly in the provision governing jobs.that provision reads,in relevant part 
for jobs only requiring two employees,the employer will be permitted to work without a certified shop steward without a time limitation.any employee who is not a member of the district council will be matched from the district council job referral list.the union will assign one of the two members with the duties of the shop steward.
app x.it further provides that if an employer fails to report the job to the district council or employs more than two carpenters without a shop steward,that employer will lose the right not to staff a shop steward on jobs for the remainder of the term of the cba.
the international agreement also contains an matching provision,but it does not apply to jobs.instead,an employer is permitted to bring in two key traveling employees from its home area to perform required work in any jurisdiction or geographical area of ubc without the necessity of securing work permits,provided that it informs the local council of the project and its intended duration.app x.if the employer requires more than the two key traveling employees,however,it must request the next two employees from the local council,and thereafter must match with members of the local council 
shortly after the district court approved the cba,a dispute arose between the parties over whether wcc members could invoke the international agreement to supersede the cba matching provision on jobs.the parties submitted the dispute to arbitration,and on july,the arbitrator,howard edelman,issued an award recognizing wcc right to invoke the international agreement.he relied,first,on unrebutted evidence that wcc members had for years been able to invoke wcc international agreements without objection from the district council.had the parties intended to put an end to that longstanding practice,the arbitrator reasoned,they would have said so in no uncertain terms.app x.the arbitrator also considered evidence that the district council negotiator believed that the cba job provision would obviate the need to invoke the international agreement on that issue.the arbitrator explained,however,that discouraging the use of international agreements hardly equates to giving up the right to use them.to the contrary,it strongly suggests that they may still be invoked but that they would not be utilized very often,if at all.app x.
iv.procedural history of this action 
the district council then brought this action,seeking vacatur of the arbitral award.wcc counterclaimed,seeking confirmation of the award.the parties for summary judgment.on april,the district court granted the district council motion and vacated the award,concluding that the award did not draw its essence from the cba the contract that the arbitrator was supposed to have interpreted and that the award also violated the court order approving the cba.vicinity dist.council of the united of carpenters ass of carpentry indus.of,civ,wl,at.as to the first ground for vacatur,the district court stated that t he two man job provision in the cba is a clear and unequivocal limitation to full mobility,id.at emphasis omitted,and that there is no reason to believe that the cba does not reflect the parties agreement as to jobs,id.at.as to the second,the district cour
