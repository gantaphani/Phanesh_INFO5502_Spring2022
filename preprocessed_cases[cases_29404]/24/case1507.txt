the mandatory fee arbitration act mfaa,under business and professions code section et,provides a quick and inexpensive method for clients,at their option,to resolve fee disputes with their attorneys in this case,we consider whether a client may assert his mfaa arbitration actually availing himself of delay and ultimately prevent the resolution of a fee dispute with his former attorney.under section,subdivision a a,the attorney must provide written notice of the client right to arbitration under the mfaa at or before the time the attorney serves a lawsuit on the client.as our supreme court has recently observed,in the typical mfaa case,the client receives the section a notice and thereafter expressly chooses either to proceed under the mfaa or not.aguilar lerner cal th,d.the case before us,however,is far from the typical mfaa case.
the law offices of dixon howell,doing business as business law group law firm or firm sued michael valley client on a promissory note that he had signed to memorialize an obligation for unpaid fees.client answer alleged a defense of estoppel based on law firm failure to give the requisite section a notice.the lawsuit proceeded over the course of almost months without any assertion by client that he wished to arbitrate the fee dispute.the court denied law firm motion for summary judgment because of its noncompliance with section a.six days later,on the eve of trial,the court granted client ex parte motion in limine to dismiss the complaint.client thereafter moved for an award of attorney fees of approximately,nearly one and times the amount in controversy in the action the court granted the motion but awarded fees of.law firm appealed the dismissal of the action and client appealed the fee order.
we are required to determine whether the court below applied the proper criteria in deciding client motion to dismiss.since we conclude that the trial court dismissed the action based upon the erroneous view that dismissal was mandatory because of law firm failure to give notice under section a,we reverse.after determining that reversal is required,we examine de novo the propriety of the court denial of firm motion for summary judgment.we hold that there was no triable issue of material fact and that client waived his defense of lack of notice under section a.summary judgment therefore should have been granted.
procedural history 
law firm filed its complaint for breach of written contract on november.the complaint alleged that client executed a promissory note in favor of firm on april,and that client breached his obligations under the note by failing to pay the sum of plus interest.
client filed a general denial to the complaint on january.his response included affirmative of which appear to have had no application to the a defense captioned estoppel that read defendant alleges that the complaint,and each cause of action alleged therein,are barred and plaintiff is estopped from obtaining any recovery from this answering defendant because plaintiff has failed to comply with business and professions code section.
the matter proceeded to judicial arbitration in august,pursuant to code of civil procedure section et there was an award in law firm favor that was rejected by client.
law firm filed a motion for summary judgment,or,in the alternative,a motion for summary adjudication that client estoppel defense under section was without merit collectively,the summary judgment motion or motion.the court denied the motion.in concluding that summary judgment was not appropriate,the court reasoned that while firm met its initial burden on summary judgment of proving each element of a breach of contract claim,its failure to give client notice of his right to arbitration under section a created a ground for dismissal of the action and client did not waive his arbitration rights by answering the complaint.likewise,the court denied summary adjudication because firm did not meet its burden of establishing that the estoppel defense was without because firm was required to give notice to client of the right to arbitration and client appearance where he had received no section a notice was not a waiver of arbitration.
thereafter,on february,days before the assigned trial date and after the case did not settle at a mandatory settlement court granted client ex parte motion in limine to dismiss the action due to law firm noncompliance with section a.at the same time,the court denied firm ex parte application to stay the action pending completion of mfaa arbitration.a notice of entry of dismissal was filed march.client moved for an order awarding attorney fees of,as the prevailing party in the action under code of civil procedure sections,subdivision a and he asserted that he was entitled to attorney fees because the action was on a contract promissory note which included an attorney fees provision on may,the court awarded client attorney fees of or slightly more than of the amount sought.it concluded that it was not reasonable to incur the full amount of fees sought,because a motion to dismiss or stay could have been brought and is reasonably likely to have succeeded.

discussion 
issues on appeal 
law firm two claims of error are as follows 
the dismissal of the action on the basis of firm noncompliance with section a was improper because it was based on the erroneous view that such dismissal was mandatory.
summary judgment should have been granted because law firm a established all elements of its breach of contract claim b negated the defense of estoppel under section by establishing that client waived his right to assert that the dispute had to be arbitrated and c established that client other defenses raised in opposition to the motion had no merit 
client contends in his appeal that the court abused its discretion by tak ing such a sharp scalpel in awarding only in attorney fees,instead of the requested.
we will address these contentions below.at the outset,however,we provide a necessary overview of the mfaa.
ii.the mandatory fee arbitration act 
the mfaa was enacted in following an earlier finding by the board of governors of the california state bar that fee disputes constituted the most serious problem between attorneys and their clients.see aguilar lerner,supra,cal th,d.the policy behind the mandatory fee arbitration statutes was to alleviate the disparity in bargaining power in attorney fee matters which favors the attorney by providing an effective,inexpensive remedy to a client which does not necessitate the hiring of a second attorney.citation.manatt,phelps,rothenberg tunney lawrence d.see also huang cheng th,d mfaa purpose and policy are to ensure the fair resolution of attorney fee disputes.
accordingly,the mfaa was enacted to require,at the option of the client,that the attorney arbitrate any fee dispute unless the client has agreed in writing to arbitration under this article of all disputes concerning fees,costs,or both,arbitration under this article shall be voluntary for a client and shall be mandatory for an attorney if commenced by a client,subd.c see also aguilar lerner,supra,cal th at,d.
the arbitrator or arbitrators of a fee dispute may take and hear evidence pertaining to the proceeding.administer oaths and affirmations.compel,by subpoena,the attendance of witnesses and the production of books,papers,and documents pertaining to the proceeding.subd.g.the award rendered in arbitration under the the final result where arbitration of other disputes is required by the parties agreement see moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,is not binding,and either the attorney or client may obtain a trial de novo,subd.a.
arbitration of disputes under the mfaa,however,is strictly limited by subject matter.the primary limitation of the mfaa is that it applies only to disputes concerning legal fees,costs,or both,subd.a and is specifically inapplicable to c laims for affirmative relief against the attorney for damages or otherwise based upon alleged malpractice or professional misconduct citation.aguilar lerner,supra,cal th at,d,quoting,subd.b.
in order to ensure that the client is made aware of its arbitration rights,the mfaa requires that the attorney give the client written notice of its right to arbitration at or before the time the attorney brings suit or other proceeding to collect on unpaid fees or costs.section a the statute that is central to the present a n attorney shall forward a written notice to the client prior to or at the time of service of summons or claim in an action against the client,or prior to or at the commencement of any other proceeding against the client under a contract between attorney and client which provides for an alternative to arbitration under this article,for recovery of fees,costs,or both.the written notice shall include a statement of the client right to arbitration under this article.failure to give this notice shall be a ground for the dismissal of the action or other proceeding.if an attorney commences an action or proceeding that is subject to arbitration under the mfaa,the client before responding may stay the action or other proceeding by serving and filing a request for arbitration,subd.b.
iii.dismissal of the action 
the court dismissed the action because of law firm failure to give client notice of right to arbitration under section a.firm challenges this decision,claiming that dismissal was based upon the court misconception that it was required to dismiss the case because of firm noncompliance with section a citing richards,watson gershon king th,d richards,law firm argues that dismissal was within the discretion of the court and the court here did not employ discretion at all since it believed dismissal to be mandatory.
the issue of whether failure to give notice under section a requires dismissal of an action for attorney fees is a matter of statutory interpretation.accordingly,we independently review the entry of dismissal below.richards,supra,th at,d see also huang cheng,supra,th,d independent review of whether section a notice must be served only after fee dispute has arisen.
we conclude that under richards,the court may,in its discretion,dismiss the action for attorney fees where the attorney fails to give the client the requisite section a notice.in this instance,it is evident that the court felt compelled to dismiss the case because of law firm noncompliance with mfaa notice requirements.we therefore must reverse the court dismissal of the action.
in richards,a law firm sued the client widow for recovery of attorney fees without sending a notice of right to arbitration under section a.richards,supra,th at,d.shortly after service of the suit,the widow moved to dismiss based upon such noncompliance with the mfaa notice requirements.id.at,d.she withdrew the motion after the law firm amended the complaint and accompanied it with written notice of the widow right to arbitrate.ibid.the widow again moved to dismiss,claiming that the law firm belated notice did not cure the defect because section a required notice prior to or at the time of service of the action.richards,supra,th at,d.the trial court dismissed the action,concluding that dismissal was mandatory where the attorney fails to comply with the mfaa notice requirements.ibid.
the court of appeal rejected the widow claim that section a use of the word shall,failure to give notice shall be a ground for the dismissal of the action meant that dismissal was mandatory d ismissal is discretionary is instead the correct interpretation.richards,supra,th at,d see also aheroni maxwell d.rejecting client contention that trial court was without jurisdiction to enter default judgment against him because attorney bringing suit for fees had not given notice under section a.it based this holding,inter alia,on the conclusions that if the legislature had intended mandatory dismissal,it would have said so richards,supra,th at,d,and the policy behind section does not require mandatory dismissal.id.at,d.
richards is directly applicable.here,we can not say that the trial court exercised discretion in granting client dismissal motion.client argued below as well as on appeal here that an attorney failure to notify a client in writing of the right to arbitrate fee disputes is fatal to the attorney claim,and that client was entitled to a dismissal as a matter of law.original emphasis.the record does not reflect that the court weighed facts in dismissing the case instead,evidencing the view that dismissal was required,the court noted that it understood the notice obligation to begin and end with business and professions code section.moreover,the manner of the court it granted dismissal by ex parte motion without presentation of evidence and where there was some question whether law firm had even received the motion papers before the hearing strongly suggests that there was no discretionary review of the dismissal motion.
neither huang cheng,supra,th,d,nor wager mirzayance th,d by the court the conclusion that dismissal for noncompliance with section a is mandatory.in huang,the principal issue was whether a notice of right to arbitration sent by the attorney before a dispute had arisen,the day after he sent the clients a bill for his services and over two years before filing suit satisfied mfaa notice requirements.huang cheng,supra,at,d.concluding that the time frame in which such notice is to be given is narrow id.at,d,the court held that the attorney must give the section a notice after a fee dispute arises.id.at,d.huang does not stand for the proposition that the failure to comply with the notice requirements of the mfaa compels dismissal in all instances.likewise,wager mirzayance,did not hold that dismissal for failing to serve notice under section a was mandatory.rather,the appellate court rejected the attorney argument that the court had dismissed the case based on its misunderstanding that it did not have the discretion to do otherwise,the case here there was no basis in the record to conclude that the trial court misunderstood its discretion in ruling on the motion to dismiss.wager mirzayance,supra,at,d.
accordingly,we conclude that dismissal under the mfaa is discretionary and the court misperceived that it was required to dismiss the case due to law firm noncompliance with section a notice requirements.we must therefore reverse the order granting the motion in limine to dismiss since the court refusal to acknowledge and exercise the discretion vested in it was itself an abuse of discretion.citations.richards,supra,th at,d see also fletcher superior court th,d trial court f ailure to exercise a discretion conferred and compelled by law constitutes a denial of a fair hearing and a deprivation of fundamental procedural rights,and thus requires reversal citations omitted dubois corroon black th,d failure to consider factors prescribed by statute in evaluating merits of discretionary motion to dismiss is an abuse of discretion.
iv.denial of summary judgment 
having determined that the order of dismissal must be peeling the outer skin from an examine the next layer whether the court properly denied law firm summary judgment motion.while an order denying summary judgment is not directly appealable,it is reviewable after entry of judgment.see sturm,ruger superior court d.we first identify the applicable standards for reviewing the court order,then analyze the motion and its opposition,and lastly address the three defenses the client asserted in such opposition,including the defense that firm failed to give notice under section a.
summary judgment standard of review 
the purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties pleadings in order to determine whether,despite their allegations,trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar.as such,the summary judgment statute code civ,provides a particularly suitable means to test the sufficiency of the plaintiff prima facie case of the defendant defense.caldwell paramount unified school dist.th,d.
the moving party bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.in moving for summary judgment,a plaintiff has met his burden of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if he has proved each element of the cause of action entitling him to judgment on that cause of action.once the plaintiff has met that burden,the burden shifts to the defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.the defendant may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but,instead,must set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.citation.id.at,d,quoting code civ,subd.o see also weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group.
our review of the granting or denial of summary judgment is de novo.buss superior court cal th,d,orrick herrington sutcliffe superior court th,d.in conducting such de novo review,we consider all the evidence set forth in the moving and opposition papers except that to which objections have been made and sustained.citation.guz bechtel national,cal th,d.this review consists of an independent assessment of the correctness of the trial court ruling,in which we apply the same legal standard as the trial court in determining whether there are any genuine issues of material fact or whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.iverson muroc unified school dist.th,d.we need not defer to the trial court and are not bound by the reasons in its summary judgment ruling we review the ruling of the trial court,not its rationale.kids universe th,d.
general analysis of law firm motion 
the court considering the motion found that law firm had met its initial burden of presenting admissible evidence supporting each element of its breach of contract claim.we concur with that finding.indeed,client admitted in his opposition to the motion that he executed the promissory note in favor of firm dated april,he did not pay on the note when it became due on april,and the full amount on the note plus interest remained unpaid.thus,putting aside any affirmative defenses discussed below,firm was entitled to summary judgment.see coyne krempels cal d,plaintiff entitled to summary judgment where he established by competent evidence the existence of contract,defendants breach,and damages,and defendants did not controvert such facts.
notwithstanding law firm prima facie showing,client argued that the motion should be denied on the basis of three of which was pleaded client alleged in the fifth affirmative defense in his firm noncompliance with the notice requirements of section was fatal to his claim.in addition,client claimed that,by soliciting and obtaining client execution of the subject promissory note,firm breached its ethical obligation to avoid interests adverse to client under the california rules of professional conduct.client apparently asserted that this alleged ethical violation was a defense albeit unpleaded to the action.third,client opposed the motion on the basis that there was a dispute as to whether the underlying obligation was owed by corporations that client controlled,as opposed to being an individual obligation.
we address below these three defenses asserted by client and conclude that none has merit.
law firm failure to give notice under section a 
waiver of mfaa arbitration rights generally 
we begin by asking whether a client,under appropriate circumstances,may waive mfaa arbitration rights,notwithstanding an attorney noncompliance with section a.by waive mfaa arbitration rights,we mean the client abandonment of its right to assert as a defense to an action for attorney fees or costs either that the fee dispute must be submitted initially to nonbinding arbitration,or the attorney failure to give the client notice of the right to arbitrate under section a bars the action.usually under circumstance,the waiver issue will arise in the context of a client belated request for arbitration under the mfaa.less typically under circumstance,the waiver issue occurs where a client does not seek mfaa arbitration belatedly or otherwise,but nonetheless urges dismissal of the action due to the attorney noncompliance with section a.here circumstance,client never asserted a desire to arbitrate.instead,both in opposition to the summary judgment motion and in his ex parte motion to dismiss,client urged that the action be dismissed because law firm did not give the required notice of arbitration rights 
since we have concluded above that the failure to give notice under section a does not compel dismissal of an attorney action against a client for attorney fees or costs see pt.iii,ante,the answer to this waiver question may seem obvious.given the specific language of the mfaa and the absence of case law,however,the matter requires closer consideration.
the mfaa provides for specific circumstances under which a client who receives the required notice under section a may waive its arbitration rights.see a waiver by failing to request arbitration within days of receipt of attorney notice of right to arbitrate,subd.b waiver by failing to request arbitration prior to filing answer or equivalent response after receipt of section a notice.the statute also identifies two instances in which the client waives arbitration,irrespective of whether the attorney gave written notice informing the client of its arbitration rights,namely,where the client commences an action or fil es any pleading seeking either of the following judicial resolution of a fee dispute to which this article applies.affirmative relief against the attorney for damages or otherwise based upon alleged malpractice or professional misconduct,subd.d.
at the heart of the matter,however,is whether the mfaa sets forth the only circumstances under which a client who does not receive written notice complying with section a may waive mfaa arbitration rights.we conclude that it does not.there is nothing in the statute suggesting that the only way a client may waive arbitration if the attorney does not give notice is by filing an action or pleading seeking either resolution of a fee dispute or affirmative relief against the attorney for malpractice or professional misconduct.see,subd.d.a holding that there are no nonstatutory grounds for waiving mfaa arbitration rights would permit a one aware of its right to arbitration under the mfaa despite not receiving a section a use the attorney failure to give notice as a means of manipulating the judicial process.courts will not allow such misuse of the system.as the supreme court held in a case where plaintiffs filed suit for the express purpose of determining their adversaries legal theories before attempting to arbitrate the dispute such procedural gamesmanship provides ample support for the trial judge conclusion that plaintiffs filed their action in bad faith,and by doing so waived their right to arbitrate.the courtroom may not be used as a convenient vestibule to the arbitration hall so as to allow a party to create his own unique structure combining litigation and arbitration.citation.christensen,supra,cal d.
further,our conclusion that a client may waive mfaa arbitration rights on nonstatutory grounds does no violence to the statute intent of encouraging arbitration of fee disputes and thereby reducing the inherent inequality between the attorney and client in such disputes.instead,we reject the view that a client may waive mfaa arbitration rights only as provided in the mfaa.such an inflexible rule would be based on two unwarranted presumptions that the client in all cases will be unaware of its arbitration rights simply because the attorney failed to give the section a notice and that in every fee dispute,no matter who the parties are and no matter what the circumstances may be,the attorney will always have the upper hand.richards,supra,th,d.
factors concerning mfaa waiver 
having determined that a client theoretically may waive mfaa arbitration rights for reasons other than as provided by statute,we must ascertain the legal principles under which such waiver may occur.there being little authority addressing the subject in the context of the mfaa we turn to case law considering waiver of arbitration rights where parties have agreed by contract to resolve their disputes through arbitration 
as our supreme court has recently noted,no single test delineates the nature of the conduct that will constitute a waiver of arbitration.citations.saint agnes,supra,cal th,d,see also christensen,supra,cal d at.cases have found arbitration waiver in a variety of contexts,ranging from situations in which the party seeking to compel arbitration has previously taken steps inconsistent with an intent to invoke arbitration citations to instances in which the petitioning party has unreasonably delayed in undertaking the procedure.citations.the decisions likewise hold that the bad faith or wilful misconduct of a party may constitute a waiver and thus justify a refusal to compel arbitration.citation.davis blue cross of northern california cal d.
just as the factors determinative of arbitration waiver are not formulaic,there is no particular stage of litigation prior to judgment that is the line of demarcation between the proper assertion and waiver of arbitration.see knight et,cal.practice guide alternative dispute resolution the rutter group.a party mere participation in a lawsuit is insufficient to preclude it from later enforcing its right to contractual arbitration.saint agnes,supra,cal th at,d,see also christensen,supra,cal d at,merely answering complaint without simultaneously seeking stay or dismissal not waiver of arbitration doers golden gate bridge.dist.cal d,mere filing of suit not arbitration waiver.at the other end of the continuum,it is not essential that the litigation be reduced to judgment in order to find that a party has waived its right to contractual arbitration.saint agnes,supra,at,d,mcconnell merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,d.
the supreme court in saint agnes agreed that the six factors identified by the appellate court in sobremonte superior court th,d sobremonte were relevant and properly considered in assessing waiver claims.saint agnes,supra,cal th at,d.those factors are whether the party actions are inconsistent with the right to arbitrate whether the litigation machinery has been substantially invoked and the parties were well into preparation of a lawsuit before the party notified the opposing party of an intent to arbitrate whether a party either requested arbitration enforcement close to the trial date or delayed for a long period before seeking a stay whether a defendant seeking arbitration filed a counterclaim without asking for a stay of the proceedings whether important intervening steps,taking advantage of judicial discovery procedures not available in arbitration had taken place and whether the delay affected,misled,or prejudiced the opposing party.citations.citation.sobremonte,supra,at,d,quoting peterson,cir.
while no single factor is determinative,it is nonetheless true that i n california,whether or not litigation results in prejudice also is critical in waiver determinations.citations.saint agnes,supra,cal th at,d,see also christensen,supra,cal d at.the mere fact that the opposing party has incurred some litigation expense before the arbitration right is claimed is not a sufficient form of prejudice.saint agnes,supra,at,d,groom health net th,d.prejudice,a resultant finding of arbitration be found where the party seeking arbitration has used the litigation to procure the opposing party defenses and strategies davis continental airlines,th,d kaneko ford design citipark,d,or information not obtainable through arbitration.guess,superior court th,d guess.
we acknowledge that the above principles apply to waiver of contractual arbitration rights and that there are clear differences between contractual arbitration and arbitration under the mfaa.see aguilar lerner,supra,cal th,d,mfaa arbitration differs from standard arbitration in that fee arbitration is nonbinding and is based on statutory directive giving the client the option to arbitrate.while we believe that these waiver principles are generally applicable here,we must view them in the specific context of a client statutory right to arbitration of fee disputes under the mfaa.with that perspective in mind,we now address law firm contention in the summary judgment motion that client waived his mfaa arbitration rights.
whether client waived mfaa arbitration rights 
generally,the determination of either waiver or estoppel is a question of fact.platt pacific,andelson,supra,cal th,d.when the facts are undisputed,however,and only one inference may reasonably be drawn,the issue is one of law and the reviewing court is not bound by the trial court ruling.citation.saint agnes,supra,cal th at,d,see also id.at,d.
here,without treating them as inflexible or formulaic,we find it useful to analyze waiver by considering the six sobremonte factors approved by the supreme court.see saint agnes,supra,cal th at,d.we conclude that the record demonstrates that five of the six factors strongly suggest waiver.only the fourth,whether a defendant seeking arbitration filed a counterclaim without asking for a stay of the proceedings sobremonte,supra,th at,d does not support the view that client waived mfaa arbitration rights.
action inconsistent with arbitration factor 
applying the first sobremonte factor to the undisputed evidence here,client actions were entirely inconsistent with the right to arbitrate.sobremonte,supra,th at,d.indeed,there is no evidence that client ever requested mfaa arbitration.
as far as client assertion of law firm noncompliance with section a is concerned,he raised the matter at the outset of the litigation as one of a host of affirmative defenses in his answer.client,however,did not move to stay or dismiss the action until months later and months after the action was filed.the assertion in a lawsuit of the defense that the matter is subject to arbitration is not the party asserting arbitration rights must generally take some affirmative steps,move to dismiss or stay or move to compel arbitration to enforce the arbitration right.thus,we find unpersuasive client claim that the allegation in the answer that the firm did not comply with section a immunized him from a finding that he subsequently waived mfaa arbitration rights.see davis continental airlines,supra,th,d.as the sobremonte court noted m ere assertion of this affirmative defense,without more,does not preclude a finding that subsequent conduct may cause a waiver of that right.citation.sobremonte,supra,th at,d.it is not sufficient for the client to raise mfaa arbitration the absence of notice under section a as an affirmative defense,and then allow extensive litigation to proceed without further assertion of the client mfaa rights.see ibid.waiver found where bank asserted contractual arbitration as one of affirmative defenses in answer,thereafter conducted extensive discovery,and moved to arbitrate months later davis continental airlines,supra,th,d defendants sued for sexual harassment waived contractual arbitration by answering suit,alleging failure to arbitrate as affirmative defense,but waited six months to demand arbitration and conducted extensive discovery in the interim.
litigation machinery substantially invoked factor 
there is no doubt here that the second sobremonte factor points to client waiver.clearly,the litigation machinery was substantially invoked.sobremonte,supra,th at,d.over the history of this lawsuit,the parties engaged in discovery,submitted the case to judicial arbitration,had the court consider law firm summary judgment motion,participated in a mandatory settlement conference,and allowed the case to proceed to the brink of trial before client brought his affirmative motion to dismiss.further,it was client himself who conducted significant discovery,namely,the depositions of law firm principal attorney dixon howell and its office manager,two sets of document demands,interrogatories,and request for admissions.guess,supra,th at,d holding that defendant conduct in responding to discovery and sending attorneys to depositions noticed by plaintiff was inconsistent with desire to arbitrate.
the other aspect of the second sobremonte factor is whether the parties were well into preparation of a lawsuit before the party notified the opposing party of an intent to arbitrate.sobremonte,supra,th at,d.although client at no time notified law firm that he wanted to arbitrate the dispute,waiver is suggested here since client did not move to dismiss the suit until the eve of trial.
lengthy delay factor 
the mere existence of some delay in asserting arbitration,of itself and without resulting prejudice,will be insufficient to support a finding of waiver.see christensen,supra,cal d.it is,however,normally desirable that a litigant wishing to assert arbitration rights do so promptly,if the party intends to do so at all.ibid.thus,in some of the contractual arbitration cases discussed,ante,the court found that the asserting party had waived arbitration under circumstances much less compelling than those existing here.see,guess,supra,th,d defendant waived arbitration by waiting three months after filing answer to bring motion to compel arbitration davis continental airlines,supra,th,d waiver found where defendants waited over six months after answering to bring motion to stay kaneko ford design citipark,supra,d.plaintiff waived arbitration by delay of five months.
here,client never asserted an intention to arbitrate,and waited nearly until six days before bring a motion to dismiss.therefore,the third sobremonte factor supports a waiver finding since client delayed for a long period before seeking dismissal.sobremonte,supra,th at,d.
courts will consider the existence or absence of a reasonable explanation for the party delay in asserting its arbitration right in making a determination of waiver.see guess,supra,th at,d defendant failed to offer any explanation for its decision to defer for three months its demand for arbitration.client was well aware from the outset of the litigation that he had the right to arbitrate the dispute under the mfaa.see christensen,supra,cal d,stressing importance of early awareness of arbitration clause and its applicability by party asserting arbitration.here,client explanation for not moving to dismiss until the eve of trial was that he believed that under huang cheng,supra,th,d,the proper procedure for a client to assert an attorney noncompliance with section a was to bring a trial motion in limine to dismiss.we reject this explanation as being wholly unreasonable for three reasons.
first,while the defendants in huang brought their motion to dismiss at trial,it is apparent that they did so because they originally represented themselves in propria persona and had no knowledge of their mfaa rights until they retained an attorney before trial.huang cheng,supra,th at,d.huang did not hold that the only stage in litigation that a client may assert noncompliance with section a is at trial.
second,there is substantial authority under the mfaa that is contrary to client contention that a challenge for lack of section a notice must be made at the time of trial.indeed,in many instances,the asserting party brought the issue to a head at the early stages of litigation.for instance,in richards,supra,th,d,the defendant filed a motion to dismiss based on the attorney noncompliance with section a only three months after the action was filed.see also aguilar lerner,supra,cal th,d,petition to compel arbitration filed in response to complaint alternative systems,carey th,d motion to stay made at case management conference.
third,contractual arbitration waiver cases likewise do not support client position.proper methods to enforce agreements to arbitrate include a petition or motion to compel arbitration code civ,or motion to stay action code civ.such motion should be brought at the earliest opportunity.see christensen,supra,cal d at.
therefore,client explanation for his delay in moving to dismiss is legally insufficient.he unreasonably delayed in bringing the lack of notice issue to the attention of the court.
important intervening steps taken factor 
it is without question that important intervening steps sobremonte,supra,th at,d took place in this action.as noted,these intervening steps included significant discovery,a nonbinding judicial arbitration,the hotly contested summary judgment motion,and a mandatory settlement conference the only step remaining was the trial itself.clearly,this fifth sobremonte factor also suggests client waiver.
prejudice factor 
the sixth sobremonte factor,prejudice,is,of course,critical.saint agnes,supra,cal th at,d.we note that the mere fact that law firm incurred litigation expense ibid.does not establish prejudice.we conclude that there was significant undisputed evidence that firm was prejudiced beyond mere delay or incurring litigation expense.indeed,under the contractual arbitration waiver cases discussed ante,there was clear prejudice.
client discovery,participation in judicial arbitration proceedings,vigorous opposition to the summary judgment motion,and participation at a mandatory settlement extensive information about law firm case.this information was clearly not available through mfaa arbitration,since the statute does not authorize prearbitration motions or discovery.see rules proc.for fee arbitrations and enforcement of awards by state bar,rule,pt.west ann.rules voluntary prearbitration exchange of documents encouraged.such use by client of the judicial process is both inconsistent with the assertion of mfaa rights and supports a finding of prejudice.see berman health net th,d prejudice found where defendant obtained substantive information in plaintiff discovery responses,even if responses were deficient,because defective responses might reveal case lack of merit guess,supra,th,d expense of pretrial discovery and motions and disclosure of trial tactics warranted finding of prejudice kaneko ford design citipark,supra,d.prejudice found from plaintiff delaying in seeking arbitration while participating in settlement negotiations and obtaining information on defendant legal theories.
the impact of the delay in assertion of arbitration rights on the policy objectives of arbitration is an important consideration in the prejudice analysis.as the supreme court has noted c ourts assess prejudice with the recognition that california arbitration statutes reflect a strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution and are intended to encourage persons who wish to avoid delays incident to a civil action to obtain an adjustment of their differences by a tribunal of their own choosing.citation.prejudice typically is found only where the petitioning party conduct has substantially undermined this important public policy or substantially impaired the other side ability to take advantage of the benefits and efficiencies of arbitration.saint agnes,supra,cal th at,d,quoting moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th,d.
since arbitration under the mfaa is similarly intended to provide clients with a speedy and inexpensive method of resolving fee disputes with their attorneys see liska arns law firm th,d,this prejudice inquiry under contractual arbitration waiver cases is equally applicable here.clearly in this instance,client substantial nearly delay in filing his dismissal motion substantially undermined the important public policy saint agnes,supra,cal th at,d,in favor of mfaa arbitration of providing an inexpensive and speedy method of resolving fee disputes.by delaying the motion filing until the eve of trial,client caused himself and his adversary alike to run up substantial legal expense before pulling the plug in so doing,he deprived himself and law firm of whatever efficiencies that would otherwise have been available to them through arbitration.guess,supra,th,d.client delay thus had a substantial negative impact on the policies that the mfaa was intended to promote,and as a result,prejudice was clearly shown.
conclusion re waiver 
applying the six sobremonte factors to the evidence here,five of the factors support strongly the conclusion that client waived his mfaa arbitration rights client conduct here was plainly inconsistent with a desire to arbitrate the attorney fee dispute,and he delayed an unreasonable period of time before moving to dismiss.after viewing the litigation as a whole mcconnell merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,supra,d,fn,we find that the only inference that can be drawn from the undisputed evidence is the existence of waiver.see guess,supra,th,d reversal of trial court order compelling arbitration because defendant waived arbitration as matter of law sobremonte,supra,th,d same.
claimed ethical violation 
in his opposition to the summary judgment motion,client contended that law firm procurement of the underlying promissory note was a breach of its ethical obligation to avoid interests adverse to client under california rules of professional conduct,rule rule this unpleaded defense posed no impediment to summary judgment.
our supreme court has held that an unsecured promissory note executed by the contrasted with a promissory note given by the client secured by a deed of trust with a power of not give the attorney a present interest in the client property required to trigger rule.an unsecured promissory note,by contrast,gives an attorney only a right to proceed against the client assets in a contested judicial proceeding at which the client may dispute the indebtedness.the note allows the attorney to obtain a judgment,and to seek to enforce the judgment against the client assets,if any.it does not give the attorney a present interest in the client property which the attorney can summarily realize hawk state bar cal d,see also hulland state bar cal d,attorney use of confession of judgment for client obligation improper and unnecessary,since a promissory note is equally effective to embody the obligation for legal fees into a readily enforceable form.thus,client assertion that law firm procurement of the promissory note violated rule was without merit 
contention regarding maker of promissory note 
client asserted in opposition to the motion that there was a dispute as to whether the underlying obligation was owed by corporations that client controlled,as opposed to being an individual obligation.this unpleaded defense likewise posed no bar to summary judgment.
client claim is,in essence,that law firm failed to join the corporations controlled by him as necessary parties defendant.as such,this misjoinder contention was one that client was required to plead he could not simply raise it in opposition to the summary judgment motion.see nat.bk.cooper d,misjoinder of defendants was matter that defendant was required to raise by demurrer or answer,and could not be raised for the first time in nonsuit motion.thus,aside from the apparent lack of merit of the contention it was not one that was properly before the court in considering the summary judgment motion.see city of hope nat.medical center superior court th,d unpleaded fraud could not be considered as part of opposition to summary judgment.
v.the order awarding attorney fees 
law firm contends that since the dismissal of the action must be reversed,the order awarding client attorney fees of can not stand.this position is correct.see giles horn th,d order awarding attorney fees falls with a reversal of judgment on which it was based.we therefore reverse the trial court postdismissal order awarding client attorney fees.
disposition 
the order dismissing the action and postdismissal order awarding attorney fees are reversed.law firm motion for summary judgment should have been granted.accordingly,we remand to the trial court with directions that it enter an order granting summary judgment and judgment in favor of law firm.

as one court has observed judicial arbitration is basically a creature of statute judicial arbitration act,code civ,et,but the system it describes is neither judicial nor arbitration.the hearing is not conducted by a sitting judge,and the right to a trial de novo removes the finality of true arbitration.extrajudicial mediation would be a more apt term.citation.parker babcock th,d.
as used in this section,unless the context clearly requires otherwise prevailing party includes the party with a net monetary recovery,a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered,a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief,code civ,subd.a.code of civil procedure section,subdivision a provides the following items are allowable as costs under code of civil procedure s ection attorney fees,when authorized by any of the following a contract.b statute.c law.
the promissory note read in the event action is required to enforce the terms of the promissory note,client promises to pay,in addition to all costs thereof,such sum as the court may award as attorneys fees.under civil code section,subdivision a,such obligation to pay attorney fees was deemed mutual in any action on a contract,where the contract specifically provides that attorney fees and costs,which are incurred to enforce that contract,shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party,then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract,whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.
the judge who decided the attorney fees motion was not the same judge who ruled on the summary judgment motion and ex parte dismissal motion.
client appeal was designated a purported.while this designation was not technically accurate,it was nonetheless timely even were it a true.see cal.rules of court,rule e.
law firm notice of appeal stated that,in addition to challenging the order dismissing the action and the order denying the summary judgment motion,it appealed from the order denying its application to stay the action.firm does not make the direct argument on appeal that the denial of the stay was erroneous.because we conclude,post,that the court erred in dismissing the action and that it should have granted firm summary judgment motion,we need not address the we believe was waived on appeal in any whether the court erred in denying firm stay application.
law firm argued below that it was not required under section a to give notice to client of his right to arbitration because the action was for breach of promissory note,not one for recovery of attorney fees.firm does not make the same argument on appeal.we need not decide the issue here since law firm has abandoned it.see tiernan trustees of cal.state university colleges cal d,fn,wiz technology,coopers lybrand th,fn,d.were we,however,faced with a case in which the attorney brought suit against the client under an instrument that plainly evidenced that it constituted a resolution of a prior fee dispute,promissory note or settlement agreement,we would likely conclude that the mfaa would not apply in such instance.
client asserts that the standard for reviewing the dismissal of the action is whether the court below abused its discretion.we agree that,after our determination that dismissal is mandatory,as claimed by must then review the court ruling to determine whether it abused its discretion.since we conclude,post,that the court failed to exercise its discretion because it viewed the mfaa as requiring dismissal,we hold that the court,indeed,abused its discretion by failing to exercise the discretion vested in it.
at the hearing on firm ex parte application to stay the action,the court noted that it was inclined to grant client ex parte motion to dismiss.firm counsel responded that he was not aware of a motion to dismiss,frankly.i was never put on notice that there was a motion to dismi
