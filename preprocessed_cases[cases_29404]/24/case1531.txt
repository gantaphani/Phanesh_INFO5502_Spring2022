ii.background 
a.the complaint 
the complaint,containing causes of action,was filed on august.it alleges plaintiff and defendant formed an equal partnership in to import and distribute name brand consumer products.in,the partnership was incorporated as a closely held corporation,abc international traders.in or,plaintiff and defendant sold percent of their stock to their.after the sale,plaintiff and defendant each owned percent of the stock of the company.in,plaintiff and defendant became equal percent shareholders in mga hong kong,limited and operated part of abc international traders,through this entity.in,the name of abc international traders,was changed to mga entertainment.in,plaintiff and defendant began having disputes over the operation of the company.plaintiff and defendant discussed having one brother buy out the other equity interest.an outside appraisal of the company valued the company at million to million.

in early,defendant called a meeting to discuss the new bratz product line with selected members of the company.defendant concealed the meeting and discussion about the proposed new product line from plaintiff.in february,defendant tried to dissuade plaintiff from attending the new york toy fair.plaintiff had routinely attended the new york toy fair in the past.defendant was furious with plaintiff for attending the toy fair,where discussions and research for market potential and new product lines take place.defendant expelled plaintiff from meetings plaintiff tried to attend.plaintiff was excluded from any discussions defendant may have had relating to the bratz product line at the fair.
in early march,defendant offered to purchase all of plaintiff percent interest in the company,mga entertainment,for million.the offer was based on a total value of the company at million.this did not include plans and actions already taken regarding the bratz product line,which allegedly would bring billion in sales in the next few years.the financial information at the company was handled by defendant and its controller,dennis medici.

it is alleged that,on september,defendant caused the company to enter into a worldwide licensing agreement of the bratz dolls and related items.defendant concealed the existence of the licensing agreement from plaintiff.during september,defendant continued to seek to buy plaintiff interest in mga entertainment.the complaint alleges defendant kept the bratz opportunity and other information about the true financial condition of the company hidden from plaintiff in an effort to secure plaintiff agreement to a proposed arbitration process with their uncle,morad zarabi.defendant agreed,and induced plaintiff to agree,to the arbitration process without disclosing that during the arbitration he would conceal the company plans and actions undertaken regarding the bratz line,and other financial information about the company so that such information would not be included in zarabi valuation of the company.
on september,plaintiff and defendant executed an agreement to arbitrate and selection of arbitrator.plaintiff alleges he was unaware of the true facts before executing the arbitration agreement had he known the true facts,he would not have entered into the agreement to arbitrate and would not have agreed to sell his shares he would have placed greater restrictions and obligations on the powers of any arbitrator including a requirement that the company be valued by an independent appraiser outside of the family and defendant fraudulently concealed the true facts from plaintiff and the arbitrator during the arbitration process.

b.the motion to compel arbitration 
on october,defendant moved to compel arbitration of the action on the grounds the parties entered into a broad arbitration agreement which covers the disputes alleged in the complaint by executing the september,agreement,plaintiff agreed to submit the fraud claim asserted in the complaint to the arbitrator and the arbitrator must decide the fraud claims as a matter of law.in support of the motion,defendant attached a copy of the september,arbitration agreement.paragraph of the september,arbitration agreement gave an uncle,morad zarabi,the power to arbitrate the disputes between the brothers.
defendant declared that the parties participated in the arbitration.the arbitrator,zarabi,retained an appraiser,an accountant,and attorneys.zarabi also gathered information and conducted hearings.in december,zarabi,the arbitrator,issued his award.the december,agreement required defendant to purchase plaintiff stock.according to defendant,the award was embodied in the agreement for sale of stock drafted by the arbitrator attorneys,stern goldberg.under the terms of the december,agreement,plaintiff was to receive for his stock.for the stock,defendant was to pay plaintiff at the closing of escrow.defendant was also obligated to execute a promissory note for the balance.under the terms of the promissory note,defendant was required to pay plaintiff million by april.moreover,defendant was obligated to pay plaintiff commencing the first of each month commencing june.interest was to accrue at the rate of percent per annum on unpaid sums.paragraph of the december,sales agreement contains the following arbitration clause a ny controversy between the parties arising out of this agreement or the agreements contained in the exhibits attached hereto shall be submitted to zarabi who shall serve as sole arbitrator with respect to said disputes.the decision of zarabi shall be final and binding upon both parties.
on january,plaintiff submitted a list of claims to the arbitrator,zarabi.plaintiff asserted these claims were subject to arbitration.the list included the december appraisal of mga,which the arbitrator relied upon to establish the value of mga,was substantially understated as a result of defendant concealment of the bratz doll license agreement.that license agreement was material to the value of mga but was not considered in setting mga value because of defendant concealment from the arbitrator.
plaintiff opposed the motion to compel arbitration on the grounds the court,not the arbitrator,must decide whether a party was fraudulently induced to consent to an arbitration agreement fraud in the inducement of the arbitration agreement was not submitted to any arbitrator and the court should resolve the fraud in the inducement claim because the arbitration proceedings could be void.plaintiff declared that on september,defendant secretly finalized and obtained a worldwide license agreement for the bratz dolls.the september,agreement provided that defendant and mga entertainment,were the exclusive worldwide distributors of bratz dolls and related products.ten days later,on september,defendant induced plaintiff to sign the arbitration agreement without disclosing the bratz opportunity and licenses.the bratz product line has generated several hundred million dollars in revenues for mga entertainment,and is expected to earn more than billion annually for the company.further,according to plaintiff,zarabi never returned an award.rather,the december,stock sale agreement was the result of negotiations between plaintiff and defendant.
in reply to the opposition,defendant argued plaintiff did not dispute the critical facts which required arbitration of the dispute.those facts included that the parties agreed to arbitrate the sale of the stock in september.zarabi,the arbitrator,decided which party should sell his stock to the other and the price.on december,the brothers signed the sales agreement incorporating the price and terms as determined by the arbitrator,zarabi.the parties have fully performed the sales transaction.defendant contended plaintiff submitted the fraud issue to the arbitrator in january.defendant further argued that the complaint only alleges fraud during the events leading up to the agreements it does not allege facts showing fraud in the inducement or execution of the arbitration clauses.according to defendant,the issue of whether he fraudulently withheld information during the arbitration process must be decided by the arbitrator.
the trial court denied the motion to compel concluding that the allegation of fraud in the execution of the arbitration agreement as alleged in the complaint must be decided by the court.in denying the motion,the court cited code of civil procedure section rosenthal great western fin.securities,supra,cal th at page,d,and bolter superior court th,d.the trial court ruled that the complaint adequately alleged that had plaintiff known about the pending bratz product line,he would not have signed the arbitration agreement,agreed to participate in the arbitration,and agreed to sell his shares in mga entertainment.the trial court further ruled it is true that there are references to the arbitration process in the f irst c ause of a ction.the concealment of the bratz line from the arbitrator was a piece of the process.that is,plaintiff would have no complaint if the full facts had been revealed in the arbitration.both those references do not eliminate the allegations that he would not have entered into the arbitration agreement but for the alleged fraud.
iii.discussion 
the outcome of this appeal is controlled by the provisions of the california arbitration act.the september,arbitration agreement explicitly provides it is subject to the california arbitration act.further,the december,agreement provides it is to be applied pursuant to california law.hence,the united states arbitration act,title united states code section et,is inapplicable to this appeal.volt information sciences,board of trustees of leland,d accord,mount diablo medical center health net of california,th,d.california law favors enforcement of arbitration agreements.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.section provides a written agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy thereafter arising is valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.the trial court has authority to compel arbitration pursuant to section,which provides in part on petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy,the court shall order the petitioner and respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists,unless it determines that b grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement.plaintiff argues that he was fraudulently induced to enter into the september,arbitration agreement.it is this fraud that plaintiff argues warrants revocation,or to be more precise,nonenforcement of the september,arbitration agreement.any doubts as to whether an arbitration clause applies to a particular dispute should be resolved in favor of requiring the parties to arbitrate.vianna doctors management th,d united transportation union southern cal.rapid transit dist.th,d.however,the right to compel arbitration depends upon the existence of a valid agreement to arbitrate between the parties.county of contra costa kaiser foundation health plan,th,d marsch williams th,d.the question of whether a valid agreement to arbitrate exists is determined by reference to the law applicable to contracts generally.engalla permanente medical group,cal th,d,kinney united healthcare services,th,d.although,as noted,california has a strong public policy in favor of arbitration,there is no preference for the arbitral forum when the parties have not agreed to arbitrate.freeman state farm mut.auto.ins.cal d,cione foresters equity services,th,d.

supreme court authority 
three supreme court decisions define the limited scope of judicial review of a claim that fraud prevents enforcement of an arbitration clause.in ericksen,arbuthnot,mccarthy,kearney walsh,oak street cal d,a lease contained an arbitration clause.a dispute arose about the air conditioning in the premises and the tenant,a law firm,filed suit.the tenant argued it was fraudulently induced to enter into the lease which contained the arbitration clause.the trial court accepted the tenant fraudulent inducement defense to the arbitration clause contention.the trial court entered an order denying the lessor motion to compel arbitration.
the supreme court held that claims of fraud in the inducement must be resolved by the arbitrator therefore,in the absence of indication of contrary intent,and where the arbitration clause is reasonably susceptible of such an interpretation,claims of fraud in the inducement of the contract as distinguished from claims of fraud directed to the arbitration clause itself will be deemed subject to arbitration.ericksen,arbuthnot,mccarthy,kearney walsh,oak street,supra,cal d at.associate justice joseph grodin then explained that the trial court order denying the motion to compel the parties to arbitrate because of the fraudulent representations which induced the tenant to execute the lease which contained the arbitration clause was in error indeed,the claim of substantive the air conditioning did not perform totally embraced within the claim of the lessor knew,at the time of the lease,that the air conditioning would not perform.thus,if the trial court were to proceed to determine the fraud claim it would almost certainly have to decide the claim of substantive breach as well,and the original expectations of the such questions would be determined through be totally defeated.however the fraud claim were determined,there would be virtually nothing left for the arbitrator to decide.we conclude that the arbitration clause is broad enough to include this claim of fraud in the inducement.id.at.
in rosenthal great western fin.securities,supra,cal th at page,d,the supreme court explained the distinction between arbitrable and nonarbitrable fraud claims which are asserted as grounds for voiding an arbitration clause california law distinguishes between fraud in the execution or inception of a contract and fraud in the inducement of a contract.in brief,in the former case the fraud goes to the inception or execution of the agreement,so that the promisor is deceived as to the nature of his act,and actually does not know what he is signing,or does not intend to enter into a contract at all,mutual assent is lacking,and the contract is void.in such a case it may be disregarded without the necessity of rescission.ford shearson lehman american express,d.fraud in the inducement,by contrast,occurs when the promisor knows what he is signing but his consent is induced by fraud,mutual assent is present and a contract is formed,which,by reason of the fraud,is voidable.in order to escape from its obligations the aggrieved party must rescind ibid.rosenthal great western fin.securities,supra,cal th at,d,see pacific state bank greene th,fn,d.
the supreme court then explained that when fraud in the inception or execution of the arbitration clause is present the first of the two types of fraud identified in the immediately preceding citation,the dispute is not arbitrable c laims of fraud in the execution of the entire agreement are not arbitrable under either state or federal law.if the entire contract is void ab initio because of fraud,the parties have not agreed to arbitrate any controversy by contrast,fraud in the inducement relating to other contractual terms does not render the arbitration agreement unenforceable,even when it might justify rescission of the contract as a whole.by entering into the arbitration agreement,the parties established their intent that disputes coming within the agreement scope be determined by an arbitrator rather than a court this contractual intent must be respected even with regard to claims of fraud in the inducement of the contract generally.rosenthal great western fin.securities,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court summarized its analysis thusly claims that a party has employed fraud in inducing consent specifically to the arbitration agreement,by actively concealing its existence or misrepresenting its meaning or value are,under prima paint flood conklin,to be decided by the court,because they go to the valid making of the arbitration clause itself.claims that,due to fraud in the execution of the agreement as a whole,the parties reached no contract containing an arbitration clause,are also to be decided by the court.but claims that the contract as a whole was obtained through fraud in the inducement are,in the absence of evidence of the parties contrary intent,arbitrable under prima paint.included in this rule of arbitrability are claims of a grand scheme of fraud,or fraud permeating the transaction.rosenthal great western fin.securities,supra,cal th at,d.
in rosenthal,when defining fraud in the inception or execution as it relates to an arbitration clause,the supreme court adverted directly to section of the restatement second of contracts including comments a and c,at pages.rosenthal great western fin.securities,supra,cal th at,d.section of the restatement second of contracts which is part of the discussion of misrepresentation states,if a misrepresentation as to the character or essential terms of a proposed contract induces conduct that appears to be a manifestation of assent by one who neither knows nor has reasonable opportunity to know of the character or essential terms of the proposed contract,his conduct is not effective as a manifestation of assent.comment a to section of the restatement second of contracts which is cited in rosenthal states in part rationale.under the general principle stated in,a party conduct is not effective as a manifestation of his assent unless he knows or has reason to know that the other party may infer from it that he assents.this section involves an application of that principle where a misrepresentation goes to what is sometimes called the factum or the execution rather than merely the inducement.if,because of a misrepresentation as to the character or essential terms of a proposed contract,a party does not know or have reasonable opportunity to know of its character or essential terms,then he neither knows nor has reason to know that the other party may infer from his conduct that he assents to that contract.comment c to section of the restatement second of contracts which is cited in rosenthal part merely indicates that an agreement described in this provision is a void contract.
in rosenthal,the supreme court reviewed the evidence presented by the different plaintiffs in order to determine whether there was fraud in the inception or execution of the arbitration agreement.the fraud in the inception or execution evidence as it related to the arbitration clauses in rosenthal differed amongst the plaintiffs.for varying reasons,some plaintiffs had not read the agreements containing the arbitration clauses.the supreme court adopted the following test for evaluating the fraud in the inception or execution claims of the plaintiffs which were asserted as a basis for voiding the arbitration clauses california law,like the restatement,requires that the plaintiff,in failing to acquaint himself or herself with the contents of a written agreement before signing it,not have acted in an objectively unreasonable manner.one party misrepresentations as to the nature or character of the writing do not negate the other party apparent manifestation of assent,if the second party had reasonable opportunity to know of the character or essential terms of the proposed contract.rest d contracts.if a party,with such reasonable opportunity,fails to learn the nature of the document he or she signs,such negligence precludes a finding the contract is void for fraud in the execution.corporation panac cal d.it follows that one party unreasonable reliance on the other misrepresentations,resulting in a failure to read a written agreement before signing it,is an insufficient basis,under the doctrine of fraud in the execution,for permitting that party to avoid an arbitration agreement contained in the contract.rosenthal great western fin.securities,supra,cal th at,d,see lovejoy v.a t t th,d pacific state bank greene,supra,th at,d.based on this legal premise concerning the scope of fraud in the inception or execution,the supreme court concluded some of the plaintiffs acted unreasonably in not reading the arbitration clauses.as to these plaintiffs,the trial court was not authorized to pass on their fraud defenses posited in response to the motion to compel arbitration.rosenthal great western fin.securities,supra,cal th at,d.but the supreme court noted that other plaintiffs who executed investment contracts containing arbitration clauses,some of whom had very limited understandings of english,were blind,or suffered from alzheimer disease,could reasonably rely on defendants agents representations as to the contents of the agreements including the arbitration clauses.this latter group of plaintiffs were entitled to have the trial judge eva
