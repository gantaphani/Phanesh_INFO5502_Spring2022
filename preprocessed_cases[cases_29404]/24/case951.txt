mark scheehle,an arizona tax lawyer,challenges as an unconstitutional taking the arbitrator appointment system of the maricopa county superior court appointment system,which requires that an experienced attorney serve as an arbitrator for up to two days a year with minimal compensation.following a decision by the arizona supreme court that the appointment system was permissible under arizona law,the district court reaffirmed its grant of defendants motion for summary judgment.we now affirm.we hold that scheehle constitutional challenge to the appointment system is properly considered under the regulatory takings test set forth in penn central transportation company city of new york,d,and applying that test,we conclude that the impact of the appointment system on scheehle does not amount to a taking for which scheehle is entitled to compensation under the fifth amendment.
arizona law requires that each superior court,by rule of court,provide for the arbitration of cases in which the amount in controversy does not exceed.at the time this action was filed,the local rules of practice for the superior court of maricopa county required that all attorneys who reside in the county and have been active members of the arizona bar for five years serve as arbitrators attorneys who served as arbitrators under the appointment system were paid a flat fee of for each day in which they actually conducted an arbitration hearing.the superior court rules further provided that an attorney who had served as an arbitrator for two or more days during the year could be excused.
scheehle has been a member of the arizona bar since,and a certified tax specialist since.in september,scheehle was appointed as the arbitrator in a motor vehicle personal injury action.he served as an arbitrator and submitted a report to the maricopa superior court in december.in july,scheehle was appointed as the arbitrator in a second motor vehicle personal injury suit and accepted the appointment.in october,while still serving as the arbitrator in the second action,scheehle was appointed as the arbitrator in a third personal injury action.
scheehle decided to challenge the authority of the arizona courts to require that he serve as an arbitrator.he returned the file to the presiding arbitration judge of the maricopa county superior court with a letter declining to serve as an arbitrator.he also expressed his unwillingness to serve as an arbitrator in any subsequent case,and his belief that the appointment system was unconstitutional and violated arizona law.the judge responded by holding a telephone conference at which scheehle placed his objections on the record.the judge further encouraged scheehle to apply for relief for good cause shown from the particular assignment,but scheehle declined,choosing to challenge the appointment system as a whole.scheehle was allowed to file a brief in support of his position.in january,the presiding arbitration judge entered an order rejecting scheehle arguments and imposing a sanction on scheehle for refusing the arbitrator appointment 
scheehle chose to initially challenge the sanction order by filing a petition for special action with the arizona supreme court,but the arizona supreme court declined to accept jurisdiction over the petition.scheehle then filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of arizona naming the justices of the arizona supreme court as the lead defendants.the complaint alleged that the appointment system amounted to an unconstitutional taking of property rights under the fourteenth amendment,a denial of due process under the fourteenth amendment,a denial of equal protection under the fourteenth amendment,a denial of rights of freedom of speech and freedom of association under the fourteenth amendment,involuntary servitude in violation of the thirteenth amendment,and violation of the separation of powers doctrine.the complaint also asserted supplemental state law claims.
on january,the district judge issued an order granting summary judgment to defendants on all of scheehle claims under the constitution and dismissing his supplemental state law claims.the district court concluded 
plaintiff claims under the united states constitution must fail.the limited service required of attorneys by the maricopa system is too minimal to constitute a compensable taking of property.plaintiff has raised no evidence of a procedural flaw in his treatment by the maricopa courts,nor has he supported his equal protection arguments.plaintiff first and thirteenth amendment claims have no basis in facts or in existing law.
scheehle filed an appeal with this court asserting that the appointment system constituted a taking of his property without compensation in violation of the fifth amendment and violated his rights under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.although we initially affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment,we subsequently vacated that opinion and certified a question concerning the propriety of the appointment system to the arizona supreme court.after the arizona supreme court answered the certified question,we remanded the case to the district court.scheehle justices of the supreme court of arizona,cir.
on remand,the district court,at scheehle request,again certified a question concerning the propriety of the appointment system under arizona law to the arizona supreme court.the arizona supreme court accepted the certification and held that it had authority to promulgate a court rule authorizing the superior courts in each county of this state to require active members of the state bar to provide limited service as arbitrators.scheehle justices of the supreme court of arizona.
following receipt of the arizona supreme court opinion,the district court denied scheehle motion for reconsideration of summary judgment and entered judgment.the case is again before us on scheehle timely appeal from the judgment.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.thomas city of beaverton,cir.however,this is not a situation where there are any outstanding questions of fact.rather,the provisions of the appointment system are known,as is the authority for the system under arizona law.thus,scheehle claim that the appointment system violates the just taking clause of the fifth amendment is ripe for determination.
scheehle asserts that the appointment system implicates two distinct types of property interests his services as a lawyer,and his costs necessarily incurred in arbitrating a case.he contends that he is deprived of the economic benefit of his labor when his services are taken for public use as an arbitrator.he notes that numerous courts have recognized that a lawyer has a property interest in his or her law practice,as well as the funds a lawyer must expend in order to practice law.from this premise,scheehle reasons that a court appointment compelling an attorney to serve as an arbitrator is a taking of property for which just compensation is required.scheehle further asserts that cases addressing real property takings that apply the regulatory takings test are not applicable to his case because the time and effort an attorney devotes to serving as an arbitrator can never be recovered,and the attorney is deprived of all economically beneficial use of such time and effort.
scheehle has not shown that he is entitled to compensation under the regulatory takings test.
there is no question that the appointment system deprived scheehle of something.the question is whether the deprivation is of a nature or amount such as to constitutionally require compensation.in lingle chevron,d,justice sets forth the framework to scheehle contentions.she noted 
the takings clause of the fifth amendment,made applicable to the states through the fourteenth,see chicago,chicago,provides that private property shall not be taken for public use,without just compensation.as its text makes plain,the takings clause does not prohibit the taking of private property,but instead places a condition on the exercise of that power.first english evangelical lutheran church of glendale county of los angeles,d.in other words,it is designed not to limit the governmental interference with property rights per se,but rather to secure compensation in the event of otherwise proper interference amounting to a taking.id.at,emphasis in original.
beginning with pennsylvania coal mahon,however,the court recognized that government regulation of private property may,in some instances,be so onerous that its effect is tantamount to a direct appropriation or that such regulatory takings may be compensable under the fifth amendment.in justice holmes storied but cryptic formulation,while property may be regulated to a certain extent,if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.at,the rub,of course,has to discern how far is too far.in answering that question,we must remain cognizant that government the adjustment of rights for the public good,andrus allard,d,and that government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law,mahon,supra,at.
since the fifth amendment does not prohibit the taking of private property,but rather places a condition on the exercise of that power,we must look to how the supreme court has defined that condition.in penn central,the court observed that the question of what constitutes a taking for purposes of the fifth amendment has proved to be a problem of considerable difficulty.at.the court proceeded to identify several factors of particular significance to an evaluation of a regulatory takings claim.in lingle,the court summarized these factors as follows 
primary among those factors are t he economic impact of the regulation on the claimant and,particularly,the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct expectations.at.in addition,the character of the governmental action for instance whether it amounts to a physical invasion or instead merely affects property interests through some public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good may be relevant in discerning whether a taking has occurred.ibid.the penn central each has given rise to vexing subsidiary served as the principal guidelines for resolving regulatory takings claims that do not fall within the physical takings or lucas rules.see,palazzolo rhode island,d id.at,concurring.
although our regulatory takings jurisprudence can not be characterized as unified,these three inquiries reflected in loretto,lucas,and penn central share a common touchstone.each aims to identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to the classic taking in which government directly appropriates private property or ousts the owner from his domain.accordingly,each of these tests focuses directly upon the severity of the burden that government imposes upon private property rights.
when the regulatory takings test factors are applied to scheehle claim,the compelled conclusion is that there has been no constitutional taking.first,the economic impact of the imposition on scheehle is negligible.he is required to devote two days out of the days in a year to arbitration.moreover,there is no showing or suggestion that this obligation interfered with any existing legal work second,the obligation does not interfere with any distinct expectations.to the contrary,in accepting admission to the arizona bar,and in practicing before the maricopa superior court,scheehle voluntarily became an officer of the court with the concomitant obligation to render service to the court when requested.see united states dillon,cir see also powell alabama.third,the appointment system merely affects property interests through some public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the public good.lingle,at.in return for a license to practice law in arizona,scheehle is obligated to serve for two days a year as an position that his training as a lawyer despite his subsequent specialization,admission to the bar,and years of practice make him particularly qualified to perform.there is no suggestion,nor will the record support the suggestion,that this obligation remotely outweighs the benefits conferred by admission to the practice of law.in sum,the appointment system imposition on scheehle when evaluated under the regulatory takings test is not a taking under the fifth amendment that requires compensation 
b.the per se test for takings under the fifth amendment is not applicable to scheehle claim.
scheehle seeks to avoid the compelled result of the application of the regulatory takings test by urging that we should use a per se test because the time and effort an attorney devotes to serving as an arbitrator can never be recovered,and the attorney is deprived of all economically beneficial use of such time and effort.he asserts that like the interest income at issue in phillips washington legal foundation,d his law license,knowledge,training,experience,expertise,skill,time,and energies are intangible properties that may not be taken without the payment of just compensation.
scheehle approach,however,is contrary to case law and circuit precedent.in lingle,at,the supreme court discussed when a per se rule should be used.it first noted that over the years it has recognized that government regulation of private property may,in some instances,be so onerous that its effect is tantamount to a direct appropriation or such regulatory takings may be compensable under the fifth amendment.id.at.the court indication that only onerous regulations require compensation implicitly confirms that the regulatory takings test is the general standard.indeed,the court went on to state 
our precedents stake out two categories of regulatory action that generally will be deemed per se takings for fifth amendment purposes.first,where government requires an owner to suffer a permanent physical invasion of her must provide just compensation.see loretto teleprompter manhattan catv,d,a second categorical rule applies to regulations that completely deprive an owner of all economically beneficial us e of her property.lucas,at,emphasis in original 
outside these two relatively narrow categories,regulatory takings challenges are governed by the standards set forth in penn central transp.new york city,d.
scheehle claim does not fit within either of these exceptions to the application of the regulatory takings test.obviously the obligation to serve two days a year as an arbitrator does not deprive scheehle of all economic beneficial use of his license.his better argument is that the obligation is in essence a minor,but permanent,physical invasion of his property.this argument,however,depends on viewing any imposition by a state on an attorney time as a discrete deprivation of property requiring compensation under the fifth amendment.this view has been rejected by court decisions recognizing that states may regulate the practice of law.see leis flynt,d since the founding of the republic,the licensing and regulation of lawyers has been left exclusively to the states and the district of columbia within their respective jurisdictions.
the position that any imposition on an attorney time must be compensated is foreclosed by our opinions in dillon,and united states acres of land,cir.in dillon,this court held that there was an obligation on the part of the legal profession to represent indigents upon court order,without compensation.at.the adoption of the balancing approach of the regulatory takings test rather than a per se approach is clear from the opinion,which went to note 
an applicant for admission to practice law may justly be deemed to be aware of the traditions of the profession which he is joining,and to know that one of these traditions is that a lawyer is an officer of the court obligated to represent indigents for little or no compensation upon court order.thus,the lawyer has consented to,and assumed,this obligation and when he is called upon to fulfill it,he can not contend that it is a taking of his services.kunhardt company,united states.
