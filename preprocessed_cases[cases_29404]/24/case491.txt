fina group asserts it does not offer or sell these alleged investments.
on december,appellees filed a statement of claim with the nasd seeking to arbitrate a dispute between fina group and themselves based on the alleged actions and omissions of gibson.appellees alleged in the arbitration that gibson sold fraudulent,unsuitable,and unregistered investments.appellees alleged that gibson recommended these investments while he worked for fina group,that fina group failed to supervise him,and that fina group was responsible for his actions.appellees also alleged that they knew gibson was a licensed broker for fina group and they made their investments based on his representations that he worked for his firm,they assumed his firm was supervising him,and they believed they were customers of his firm.
in response,fina group filed suit in the united states district court for the northern district of texas on march,seeking a declaration that fina group did not have to arbitrate the claims alleged by appellees in the nasd arbitration and an injunction to enjoin appellees from pursuing the nasd arbitration with fina group.fina group federal action was based on the affidavit of eduardo prado,fina group president and ceo.prado affidavit established that fina group did not offer or sell the investments alleged to have been purchased by appellees,that fina group did not receive any profit or benefit from appellees alleged investments,and that fina group did not have a contract with any of appellees with respect to their alleged investments.
after answering fina group federal action,appellees filed a motion to compel arbitration pursuant to section of the federal arbitration act faa,et.appellees argued that fina group was required to arbitrate the claims brought by appellees in the nasd arbitration,either based on nasd rule a or as a purported beneficiary of gibson form application for registration with the nasd.
rule a of the nasd uniform code of arbitration applies to all nasd members,including fina group,and provides 
any dispute,claim,or controversy eligible for submission under the rule series nasd administrative provisions between a customer and a member associated person arising in connection with the business of such member or in connection with the activities of such associated persons shall be arbitrated under this code,as provided by any duly executed and enforceable written agreement or upon demand of the customer.
nasd rule a emphasis added.
the nasd uniform code of arbitration does not define customer or associated person.the nasd conduct rules define customer as any person who,in the regular course of such member business,has cash or securities in the possession of such member.id.b however,several other nasd rules define customer as any person other than a broker or dealer.id.g see also id.d id.c c relying on rule definition id.e c same id.e same.the nasd define associated person as a natural person who is registered or has applied for registration under the rules of the association.of the nasd,art.i dd 
fina group does not dispute that gibson was an associated person.fina group contends that appellees can not be customers of fina group regardless of whether they were gibson own customers because fina group has never sold the investments at issue in this case.at a minimum,fina group requests a trial on the issues the district court had originally identified as needing resolution,whether appellees can be considered customers of fina group,and if so,whether the dispute between appellees and fina group arose in connection with the business of fina group.appellees allege that the term customer should be interpreted broadly,such that they can be considered customers for purposes of the rule,and accordingly,that they are entitled to arbitrate their claims.
additionally,gibson was required to submit a form,uniform application for securities industry registration or transfer,to register with the nasd to sell securities in the state of texas.pursuant to his form,gibson agreed 
t o arbitrate any dispute,claim or controversy that may arise between me and my firm,or a customer,or any other person,that is required to be arbitrated under the rules,constitutions,or of the organizations indicated in item as may be amended from time to time and that any arbitration award rendered against me may be entered as a judgement in any court of competent jurisdiction.
appellees claim that fina group accepted the benefit of gibson form and therefore is bound by its requirement that gibson arbitrate disputes with his customers.appellees argument related to gibson form is based on a beneficiary theory as well as on respondeat superior and agency theories.fina group asserts that the district court never accepted appellees argument concerning the form requirement of arbitration the court was correct because gibson was an independent contractor so fina group can not be obligated by his form agreement to arbitrate and there were no beneficiary issues.
on may,the district court initially denied appellees motion to compel arbitration as to fina group.the district court found that there was no written arbitration agreement between the parties.the district court also found that the case should be set for trial on an expedited schedule to determine whether arbitration was mandated under nasd rule,stating that the issue in determining whether arbitration was mandated would seem to be whether appellees were customers of fina group and whether the dispute between appellees and fina group arises out of or in connection with the business of fina group.on july,the district court also denied appellees motion for reconsideration of the denial of their motion to compel arbitration.
then,on august,the district court conducted a telephone hearing between the parties.
