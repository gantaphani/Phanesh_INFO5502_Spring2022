introduction 
in consolidated appeals,cruz cardenas rael contends the trial court erred in excluding as inadmissible a document prepared in the course of a mediation,and finding the purported agreement unenforceable as not signed by all parties she contends that promises made by one of the parties to the agreement were severable and separately enforceable.in his appeal,david davis contends that the trial court erred in refusing to award attorney fees pursuant to civil code section.
we conclude that the trial court did not err in excluding the agreement and finding it unenforceable.we thus affirm the judgment.we also affirm the trial court denial of attorney fees,as no statutory exception to mediation confidentiality permits application of civil code section.
background 
the pleadings 
in,cruz cardenas rael commenced this action for breach of contract against davis as the executor of the estate of her deceased husband,tony rael,and as the successor trustee of the rael family inter vivos trust the complaint alleged that tony rael,died in,and that prior to his death,he participated in a mediation regarding the distribution of his assets after his death with cruz cardenas rael and tony rael,julianne christina and yolanda southern on april,the mediation allegedly resulted in a settlement,memorialized in a written settlement agreement.it was alleged that under the settlement agreement,tony promised to exercise his power of appointment in favor of cruz,so that she would receive the assets of his estate,rather than the bequests given to her under tony preexisting will and living trust.the complaint alleged that tony breached the agreement by failing to amend the trust instrument in the manner promised.the complaint alleged that on march,cruz filed a creditor claim,and served the claim on davis,the executor of tony will and successor trustee of the trust,but davis failed to abide by the terms of the alleged written contract.the complaint prayed for damages equal to the estate assets,due to tony alleged breach of contract,and for costs and attorney fees.
in his answer to the complaint,davis denied the formation and enforceability of the alleged settlement agreement or any obligation under it,and objected to the discovery and admissibility of the agreement pursuant to evidence code section 
the court findings of fact 
the case was tried october,and,and the court filed its statement of decision january.because the court filed a statement of decision and cruz does not contend the evidence is insufficient to support the trial court findings,we are bound by the court factual findings set forth in the statement we therefore quote them at length.
plaintiff in this matter is the surviving spouse of the now deceased tony rael,having married him on june,and having been widowed by him on march.tony rael,was also survived by his three children,mark rael,julianne christina and yolanda southern,all from tony rael,prior wife who predeceased him.
prior to the death of tony rael,and more specifically on february,mark rael initiated a legal proceeding for conservatorship of the estate and person of tony rael,in the central district of the los angeles superior court under los angeles superior court case number bp the conservatorship matter as a result of the initiation of the conservatorship matter,tony rael,and mark rael were ordered by the court in the conservatorship matter to participate in a mediation.
four mediation sessions took place pursuant to the order by the court in the conservatorship matter,on the following dates march,march,april,and april.all the mediation sessions which took place pursuant to the aforementioned order were mediated by richard hirrel.various people participated in the four mediation sessions,including the following tony rael,each of his three children,plaintiff,muriel avina daughter of plaintiff,susan house legal counsel for tony rael,ruth phelps legal counsel for mark rael and james helms legal counsel for plaintiff.on march,all of the aforementioned mediation participants signed a retainer agreement for confidential mediation applicable to all the mediation sessions.
mark rael was not physically present at the last of the four mediation sessions,which took place on april.tony rael,julianne christina,yolanda southern and plaintiff signed a proposed settlement agreement document prepared at the april,mediation session on that day,which was also signed by susan house,ruth phelps and james helms.mark rael never signed any document prepared at the april,mediation session.
following the april,mediation session various letters were exchanged between legal counsel for the mediation participants,including a letter dated may,from susan house to ruth phelps,written at the request of tony rael,wherein susan house wrote as follows 
it has now been almost three weeks since our last mediation when everyone but your client,mark rael,signed the settlement agreement.although you and i have spoken on several occasions,you have described your client wishes and i have tried to respond,no progress has been made.
we have discussed the situation with our client.we have explained to him the demands being made by mark and the uncertainty surrounding the resolution of the conservatorship controversy caused by the conditional nature of the signatures given on april and your client refusal to sign.in light of all this,we have been instructed to inform you that unless mark rael signs the settlement agreement as it was signed by everyone else on april by the close of business on wednesday,may,there is no settlement and we will proceed to prepare for trial on july.by copy of this letter we are instructing hirrel to destroy the original settlement agreement in his possession unless your client signs by the close of business on wednesday.
we regret to have to proceed on this basis,but we see no alternative.we will need at least days to prepare for trial,and we must proceed as quickly as possible.
very truly yours,

tony rael,mark rael and plaintiff all participated in the august,trial.tony rael,was represented by legal counsel from the law firm of hahn hahn at the august,trial in the conservatorship matter,and plaintiff was represented by her lawyer,james helms,at the august,trial in the conservatorship matter.the august,trial in the conservatorship matter resulted in the appointment of plaintiff as conservator of the person and estate of tony rael.
after the first two mediation sessions but prior to the last two mediation sessions,tony rael,executed several estate planning documents,including a a will date d march,b an exercise of power of appointment dated march,and c a trust amendment dated march.the aforementioned will,exercise of power of appointment and trust amendment were all prepared for tony rael,at his request by his legal counsel,susan house,and were all executed by tony rael,in her presence on march.
plaintiff was named as a beneficiary in the aforementioned will,exercise of power of appointment and trust amendment.specifically,tony rael,left the following benefits to plaintiff pursuant to the terms of the march,estate planning documents a his liquor store business,including the liquor license associated with that business,b a right to occupy space in one of his properties in order to operate the liquor store for two years from the date of his death on a rent free basis,and c up to to pay off the balance of the plaintiff mortgage on her personal residence,as of the date of his death.the remainder of tony rael,jr assets were left equally to his three children,mark rael,julianne christina and yolanda southern.
after the death of tony rael,and specifically on august,plaintiff filed an unverified complaint in this matter alleging that her deceased husband,tony rael,had entered into a written contract with her at the april,mediation session,and that he breached the alleged written contract,causing her to suffer damages.
plaintiff alleged that the assets in tony rael,trust and probate estate,as of the date of his death,were valued at,and that she was entitled to one third of those assets,rather than the bequests given to her under the terms of the aforementioned march,estate planning documents 
the court conclusions 
the court found highly credible and compelling the testimony of tony attorney,susan house,that neither she nor tony intended him to be bound by the terms of the document prepared at the april mediation session unless his son mark also signed it.house letter of may confirmed that tony consent to the terms set forth in the document was conditioned upon the assent by all other parties,including mark.had counsel for either mark or cruz taken a different view,the court reasoned,either or both would have promptly communicated such disagreement to house.the court found it had been tony understanding that unless all parties signed the document prepared on april,there was no agreement.
the court also considered the testimony of mark attorney,ruth phelps,who testified unequivocally that she had no authority to bind her client to the agreement or to waive mediation confidentiality,and that her signature on the agreement was not intended to substitute for his further,both tina and yolanda testified that they never intended to waive confidentiality,or to be bound by any of the terms of the mediation agreement unless mark signed it.the court concluded that when tony and his daughters executed the april,document,they did so with the understanding that it would not become operative until all parties signed it,including mark.
the court rejected cruz testimony that tony told her before his death that he and cruz would be separately bound by the terms of the document,even if not signed by the other parties.the court found that cruz testimony was not credible,and that it was contradicted by her own deposition testimony the court also considered the pleadings in the conservatorship matter,the testimony of the attorneys for tony and mark and the conduct of all the parties to the mediation after april,the court concluded that neither tony,mark nor any of the participants in the april mediation session believed the document prepared on that date constituted an agreement.
the court further concluded that because there was no binding agreement,the term of the april document waiving confidentiality never took effect and the document was inadmissible as evidence.thus,the court held,davis was not obligated to perform any term of the document as tony executor and successor trustee.
judgment and appeal 
the court entered judgment in favor of davis january.the court awarded costs to davis as the prevailing party,but not attorney fees.cruz motion for new trial was denied april,and davis motion for attorney fees under civil code section was denied may.cruz timely filed a notice of appeal from the judgment,and davis timely filed a notice of appeal from the denial of his motion for attorney fees.the two appeals have been consolidated.
discussion 
standard of review 
cruz contends that a de novo standard of review applies to her appeal,because it involves the construction of contracts and statutes.we agree that the interpretation of a statute is a question of law that we consider de novo on appeal.burden snowden cal th,d.further,we review the trial court conclusions of law de novo.continental ins.superior court th,d.where the evidence is not in conflict,the appellate court independently interprets the language of a written contract.parsons bristol development cal d.
davis contends that a substantial evidence review is appropriate here.however,because cruz does not contend that the trial court factual findings are unsupported by substantial evidence,we are bound by them and do not review the evidence.peat,marwick,mitchell superior court,supra,d at.instead,we accept the facts set forth in the statement of decision,and determine whether those factual findings support the judgment as a matter of law.city of merced american motorists ins.th,d.
contentions 
cruz contends the court erred in requiring that she prove the agreement was enforceable against all parties to the mediation as a condition to its admissibility.she contends the court erred in excluding the april,document,and in finding that no enforceable agreement existed between herself and tony.cruz claims that tony obligation under the mediation agreement was severable and separately enforceable against tony,and that mark signature was unnecessary to her separate contract with tony.she argues that the court unnecessarily determined that no contract was formed by all the parties to the mediation,when the sole issue she presented was whether a separate contract was formed between herself and tony.
cruz recognizes that because mark did not sign the mediation agreement,he is not bound by it as a settlement of the underlying dispute,and she does not contend that the signature of mark attorney was sufficient for that purpose cruz cites the rule that in the absence of a showing that the contract is not intended to be complete until signed by all parties,the parties who did sign will be bound.angell rowlands d.thus,the signatories resisting enforcement of the contract bear the burden to establish that the signatures of all parties were contemplated as being a condition precedent to the validity of the contract citation.id.at.cruz contends that the court erred in admitting parol evidence of the parties subjective intent to prove such a condition precedent.cruz does not dispute the principle asserted by an agreement or stipulation that no party shall be bound by a contract unless all parties sign be proven by parol.see cavanaugh casselman cal.however,she contends that such parol evidence must consist of an objective manifestation of the agreement or stipulation that tony would not be obligated to cruz,absent the signature of all parties,including mark finally,she asserts that the parties testimony concerning their beliefs did not objectively manifest an agreement not to be bound without the signature of all parties see angell rowlands,supra,d at.
davis notes that the court rejected cruz testimony that tony told her that she and he had a contract regardless of the others signatures.cruz suggests that because she requested a finding that the agreement contained severable,independent covenants,the court should have examined the agreement before rejecting this evidence to do that,she argues,the court should have considered,as a threshold issue,the admissibility of the mediation agreement under section.for the court and davis to have done otherwise,cruz contends,was to put the cart before the horse.
davis contends that the uncontradicted testimony of tony counsel established that neither she nor tony intended to waive the confidentiality provisions of section unless mark signed the april,document.this intent was further shown by evidence that tony did not intend any agreement to come into effect unless all parties,including mark,signed the document.because mark did not do so,no no waiver contained in came into existence.
although davis agrees with the trial court determination that the document was not admissible,he contends the court erred in denying his motion for attorney fees pursuant to the attorney fee provision contained in it.he asks purposes of enforcing the attorney fees provision of the mediation agreement under civil code section be judicially estopped from claiming the agreement is inadmissible.
mediation confidentiality 
we agree that the admissibility of the mediation agreement must precede the issue of enforceability.a settlement agreement drafted during mediation must be admissible before a court can reach the issue of enforceability.fair bakhtiari cal th,d,fair.further,before the court determines whether a term is severable from the agreement and separately enforceable,the agreement must be admissible.ibid.
