where an action is brought solely to compel arbitration of contractual disputes between the parties,we conclude that a party who succeeds in obtaining an order denying the petition to compel arbitration is a prevailing party in the action on the contract even though the merits of the parties underlying contractual disputes have not yet been resolved and an order denying a request for costs and attorney fees under such circumstances is appealable as a special order after final judgment under code of civil procedure section,subdivision e.all statutory references are to the code of civil procedure unless otherwise specified.based on these conclusions,we reverse the order of the superior court denying fees and costs to the defendant herein.
factual and procedural background 
in connection with its development of two related highway projects in san diego county,san diego expressway,expressway entered into two contracts with general contractor otay river constructors otay referred to herein as the contract and the toll road contract together the contracts.thereafter,the parties entered into a third agreement called the coordination agreement,to ensure that the contracts complement ed and supplement ed one another and operated in a coordinated manner to allow completion of the two related projects.in the coordination agreement,the parties acknowledged that the work on both projects was interdependent and that otay failure to complete work governed by the contract would cause expressway to incur substantial damages.
each contract contained a dispute resolution provision governing disputes arising out of it.the contract provided that disputes would be resolved by project and executive level negotiations and then by a nonbinding dispute resolution board disputes board and,if necessary,litigation.the toll road contract contained similar dispute resolution procedures,but did not allow litigation and required binding arbitration.disputes under the coordination agreement would be governed by the dispute resolution provision of the toll road contract,binding arbitration.
otay initiated two arbitration proceedings against expressway,claiming that the disputes arose under the coordination agreement and that expressway breached that contract by demanding changes to certain drawings and refusing to execute a change order adjusting the contract price to reflect necessary retaining walls.in its arbitration demands,otay admitted that the claims arose under the contract,but argued that the claims presented a dispute under the coordination agreement and that under the coordination agreement binding arbitration was proper because the dispute procedures of the toll road contract applied.
after expressway denied the claims,otay filed a petition in superior court to compel arbitration under the coordination agreement,arguing that the disputes arose under the coordination agreement and must be arbitrated.expressway opposed the petition,arguing that it never agreed to submit contract disputes unrelated to the coordination agreement to binding arbitration.
the trial court rejected otay argument that the coordination agreement modified or superseded the terms of the contract and found no ambiguities and inconsistencies between the coordination agreement and the contract.it noted that the parties were very sophisticated and could easily have stated that the coordination agreement overrode the dispute resolution provisions of the contract,but that the parties intended to leave the dispute resolution procedures contained in the contract as is.accordingly,it denied the petition to compel arbitration because the claims arose out of the contract,which allowed for litigation of the disputes.otay did not appeal the order denying its petition to compel arbitration.
thereafter,expressway filed a motion for attorney fees and costs,claiming it was the prevailing party on the contract because it obtained a final order denying otay petition to compel arbitration.after bifurcating the issue of entitlement to attorney fees and costs from the issue of the amount of any award,the trial court denied expressway motion on the ground it was not a prevailing party because the parties contemplated additional litigation.expressway timely appealed this order.
discussion 
appealability 
otay asserts we should dismiss this appeal because an order issued after an appealable order is not appealable under the california arbitration act et.as explained below,we conclude that the order denying otay petition to compel arbitration was essentially a judgment on the only issue before the trial court accordingly,expressway could properly appeal from the order denying its motion for an award of attorneys fees and costs under subdivision e of section,which allows the appeal from a special order after final judgment.

in discussing proposed changes to the arbitration act,the california law revision commission noted this case law and stated it was unclear whether an appeal from an order denying a motion to compel arbitration is taken under former section or under former section,now section stats,ch,which related to appeals in civil proceedings generally.recommendation relating to arbitration cal.law revision com.accordingly,it advised the legislature to clarify that an order denying a motion to compel arbitration is appealable and provide for such in the arbitration statute.ibid.
the legislature followed the commission recommendation and,effective september stats,ch,the arbitration act made appealable a an order dismissing or denying a petition to compel arbitration b an order dismissing a petition to confirm,correct or vacate an award c an order vacating an award unless a rehearing in arbitration is ordered d a judgment entered pursuant to this title and e a special order after final judgment.
the provisions of the code of civil procedure concerning arbitration,including petitions to compel arbitration,are all found in part of the code of civil procedure,which pertains to special proceedings.because the legislature created a comprehensive procedural scheme to govern arbitration proceedings,we reject expressway contention that section,governing appeals in civil proceedings generally,provides the authority for this appeal.with this said,however,courts have looked to cases interpreting section for guidance in interpreting section.lamb holy cross hospital d.lovret seyfarth d.
