factual background and procedural history 
in,starpoint loaned money to namco capital group,and its affiliates namco.in,starpoint was entitled to repayment of the full value of these loans.appellant unitex industries,unitex,one of namco affiliates,entered into a promissory note with starpoint whereby it agreed to pay starpoint more than million.the note was secured by real property owned by unitex,while appellants homayoun namvar and ramin namvar along with others not parties to this action,guaranteed the full repayment of the note.
by october,unitex had defaulted on its payment obligations,and all the guarantors,including homayoun and ramin,had failed to repay the note.on october,starpoint filed an action for breach of contract and fraud in los angeles superior court.in order to settle the case,appellants,along with other defendants not parties to this appeal,invited starpoint to take part in a sale of real property owned by the namvars.on october,the parties entered into a settlement agreement and mutual general release the settlement agreement,under which starpoint agreed to dismiss all charges against appellants and the other defendants in exchange for the right to purchase real property owned by the namvars,and located at wilshire in los angeles the bundy property.
in order to effectuate the sale of the bundy property,two purchase and sale agreements were executed concurrently with the execution of the settlement agreement.under these agreements,starpoint and the other buyers of the bundy property were required to make a total of million hard money deposit,and to assume the existing loans on the bundy property.
the settlement agreement expressly stated that the parties had entered into it voluntarily,and with full knowledge of its significance,and that its terms had been negotiated at arms length among sophisticated parties represented by counsel.the settlement agreement also provided that if any of the parties were to bring an action against any other party under or relating to the settlement agreement,the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees and costs.
on november,as provided for in the october,settlement agreement,appellants and starpoint drafted a stipulation for entry of judgment the stipulation,which provided that starpoint shall be entitled to judgment against any of the defendants in the amount of,if certain events were to occur we describe these events below.the stipulation also stated that appellants had waived their right to appeal or attack any judgment issued pursuant to the stipulation,as well as any right to receive notice that judgment would be entered pursuant to the stipulation.the stipulation further indicated that appellants waived their rights freely and with the advice of counsel.
the stipulation provided that starpoint would obtain judgment against the defendants if any one of the following four events occurred the purchase agreement for the bundy property failed to close the purchase and sale agreements for the bundy property were modified or amended without starpoint consent,or were terminated the sale of the bundy property was affected by a bankruptcy proceeding or any attempt was made to force starpoint to disgorge any of the cash payments made under the settlement agreement.

eventually,both the purchase and sale agreements for the bundy property failed to timely close.furthermore,on december,an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding was filed against ezri namvar,who took part in the settlement agreement,but is not a party to this appeal,and namco,affecting the sale of the bundy property.finally,in march,two purchase agreements for the bundy property were terminated.each of these events alone was a basis for starpoint to obtain judgment against appellants pursuant to the terms of the stipulation.
