factual background 
brewing company the employer operates a beer distributorship in arlington heights,illinois,and employs union drivers and assistants to deliver products to roughly retail accounts in the northern suburbs of chicago.the drivers are paid on a commission basis,with the commission rate set forth in a year collective bargaining agreement the contract that took effect february,the contract provides one commission rate for drivers who work alone routes and a lower commission rate for drivers who are assisted by a helper routes.
from may to april,the employer and the union operated under an earlier collective bargaining agreement,which provided that drivers,whether assisted by a helper or not,received the same commission rate.this commission rate became an issue in negotiations,and after long,reasoned,and thorough negotiating sessions,the parties executed a new contract in that altered the prior commission arrangement and adopted a new commission payment structure as referred to above.the same commission rate payment provision was thereafter incorporated into and made a part of the parties and contracts,again after extensive and reasoned negotiations.during the term of the and contracts,the employer paid all the drivers at the commission higher rate.continued this practice of paying the drivers the increased rate of compensation,in contradiction of the written contract,only during the first two months of the newly negotiated,contract.in early april,the company announced that effective april,the drivers would henceforth be reimbursed according to the contract language now in force.according to testimony taken during the arbitration hearings,the decision was motivated by the company need to create more routes and hire additional helpers in response to an increasing number of customers as well as customer complaints dealing with the timeliness of their deliveries.at this same time,in order to achieve more pay for each driver,the employer reduced the number of routes from ten to nine,eliminating all expenses associated with one route and dispersed the cost savings and workload among the remaining nine drivers.on may,the union filed a grievance protesting the company decision to follow the terms of the contract,and the dispute proceeded to arbitration pursuant to the terms of the agreement.
the parties stipulated to the parameters of the issue as being,did the company violate the labor agreement by changing its practice to conform to the contract provision relating to route commission rates it is interesting to note that the question presented was is the company violating the contract when complying with the written terms of the most recent labor agreement the contract contained two clauses that limited the arbitrator power,the arbitration clause and the zipper clause,or merger clause.the zipper clause states that the written agreement constitutes the full and complete agreement between the parties and the written agreement supercedes all prior agreements and practices not specifically preserved in the contract.further,the contract specified that the arbitrator had no authority to add to,subtract from,modify or change the terms of the contract.the zipper clause in its entirety reads 
this agreement constitutes the full and complete agreement between the parties and supercedes all prior agreements between the parties or their representatives,oral or written,including all practices not specifically preserved by the express provisions of this agreement.this agreement is the entire agreement between the parties and is the result of extensive negotiations in which both parties had the right and the opportunity to submit proposals and to negotiate their proposals with the other party.
the arbitrator somehow sustained the union grievance,and found that the employer payment of the greater commission rate to all drivers during the brief span of but the first two months days of the new contract constituted a practice,in the eyes of the arbitrator,that rose to the level of a amendment of the agreement.this action,according to the arbitrator,allegedly nullified the company right to invoke the thoroughly negotiated and mutually agreed upon contract provision dealing with the parties agreement to have the commission rate.the arbitrator somehow made this finding in spite of the very specific and limiting language in the zipper clause of the contract,this agreement supercedes all prior agreements between the parties oral or written,including all practices not specifically preserved by the express provisions of this agreement,as well as the specific arbitration clause forbidding him from modifying the written contract.the arbitrator recognized that the company april,decision to pay the lower commission rate to drivers working routes was in full compliance with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement agreed to by the union and the company in each of the three contracts referred to herein that the contract also contained the zipper clause and that the contract was the product of exhaustive negotiations.but instead of adhering to the limitations the contract placed on his authority and to the unambiguous and plain language of the contract as it was written,the arbitrator took an around the clear and unambiguous restrictive terms of the contract.the arbitrator somehow reasoned that because the employer allowed the first two months of the contract to elapse before changing its practice to adhere to the written contract commission rates clause,it thus deprived the union of its right to bargain over commission rates for almost five years,a result that the arbitrator somehow felt without any explanation was a fundamentally unfair maneuver inconsistent with principles of collective bargaining.
in a vain attempt to find support for his newly fashioned remedy,the arbitrator reached all the way back and justified his overreaching decision in the partial testimony taken at the arbitration hearing that during a worker strike in,some thirteen years ago,the distributorship general manager commented to the drivers that the drivers would have the same pay whether they worked alone or with a helper.the arbitrator found that this passing statement somehow and someway became an oral understanding,which,according to the arbitrator,was readopted by the employer during the first two months of the contract in spite of the fact that each of the three most recent collective bargaining agreements ratified in,and contained the very explicit and properly limited zipper clause stating that the contract contained the parties entire agreement,as well as the identical language dealing with commission rates.further,these contracts failed to contain any indication,much less language,that the parties had reached any type of oral understanding that all drivers would be compensated equally,much less an understanding that was the product of a meeting of the minds reflecting an enforceable agreement supported by offer,acceptance and consideration,which is so vital to any contract.
thus,the arbitrator cast aside the written and thoroughly negotiated terms of the agreement and returned to the terms of the contract in effect prior to by ordering the employer to pay the higher commission to drivers regardless of whether they were working on one or routes.this finding by the arbitrator contradicts and ignores the express language throughout the contract at issue,including the unambiguous terms contained within the commission rates clause,the arbitration clause,and the zipper clause.moreover,the arbitrator finding the commission structure that the drivers agreed in negotiation to give up as a concession in and reaffirmed in the last two contracts in and.the arbitrator summarized his conclusion as follows 
n either the zipper clause nor the parole evidence rule bars amendment or modification of an agreement although i can not add to,subtract from,modify or change in any way the terms of this agreement,i am not precluded from giving effect to a practice or oral understanding reaffirmed and readopted by the company following execution of the agreement.
the employer filed suit in federal court requesting the court to vacate the award,and the union for enforcement of the arbitrator decision.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the union,holding that because the arbitrator had interpreted the parties agreement to include both the written collective bargaining agreement and a separate oral agreement,the decision should be affirmed under the high degree of deference given to arbitral orders.appeals.

a n arbitrator is confined to interpretation and application of the collective bargaining agreement he does not dispense his own brand of industrial justice.he may of course look for guidance from many sources,yet his award is legitimate only so long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.when the arbitrator words manifest an infidelity to this obligation,courts have no choice but to refuse enforcement of the award.

t he arbitrator decision should not be upset unless it is arbitrary or capricious or fails to draw its essence from the collective bargaining contract because it exceeds the confines of interpreting and applying the contract it is only when the arbitrator must have based his award on some body of thought,or feeling,or policy,or law that is outside the contract that the award can be said not to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.

the supreme court recently reiterated that judicial review of an arbitrator decision is limited,stating that the fact that a court is convinced the arbitrator committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.major league baseball players ass garvey,d quoting eastern coal mine workers,d internal quotations omitted.thus,we wish to make it clear that we are not questioning whether the arbitrator has misinterpreted the agreement.rather,our concern is limited to whether the arbitrator went beyond,or outside,the bounds of interpreting the contract before him while fashioning his award.the question is not whether the arbitrator misinterpreted the agreement,but only whether the arbitrator inquiry disregarded the very language of the agreement itself see chicago newspaper publ rs ass chicago web printing pressmen union,cir hill norfolk ry,cir.
the dissent claims that we may not reverse the arbitrator decision,given the law laid down in garvey.judge easterbrook seems to imply that garvey somehow worked a radical revision of arbitration law.but the dissent characterization of garvey as groundbreaking can best be classified as confusing because garvey contained no landmark reformulation of the standard of review in arbitration cases.in fact,garvey itself relies on the enterprise wheel case,cited throughout the majority opinion,and recognizes that in situations like this,when the arbitrator strays from interpretation and application of the agreement and effectively dispense s his own brand of industrial justice his decision may be unenforceable.garvey,at.quoting enterprise wheel,at.the notion that a reviewing court does not review the correctness of an arbitrator conclusion certainly is hardly a novel one.garvey merely follows enterprise decision rendered more than forty years we refuse to accept the dissent exaggerated implication that it has fundamentally reworked the standard of review in arbitration cases.

iii.discussion 
claims that the arbitrator modified rather than interpreted the terms of the contract when he found a way to employ language not found any place in the contract in fact contrary to the express language of the contract by relying on what he referred to as a long standing practice the payment of one commission rate for all drivers in spite of the very language of the zipper clause stating,this agreement constitutes the full and complete agreement between the parties and supercedes all prior agreements between the parties or their representatives,oral or written,including all practices not specifically preserved by the express provisions of this agreement.the company argues that the very language of the contract contained everything the arbitrator needed to render his decision and barred him from considering the parties practices.additionally,the company claims that the arbitrator improperly reached outside the contract and relied on the parties practices in place of the agreement clear and unambiguous language requiring the payment of disparate commission rates between drivers working alone and those using helpers.to place past practice on a par with the parties written agreement would create the anomaly that,while the parties expend great energy and time in negotiating the details of the agreement,they unknowingly and unintentionally commit themselves to unstated and perhaps more important matters which in the future may be found to have been past practice.chicago web printing pressmen union chicago newspaper publ rs ass n,cir.the employer further contends that the arbitrator exceeded the contract limitation on his power not to add to,subtract from,modify or change in any way the terms of the written contract.we agree with the employer.
in tootsie roll industries,at,we noted that,w hile an arbitrator reliance on the law of the shop is appropriate to interpret ambiguous contract terms the law of the shop can not be relied upon to modify clear and unambiguous provisions.see also international ass of,lodge general,cir the common law of the shop comes into play only when an ambiguity in the written collective bargaining agreement requires interpretation ethyl,at the arbitrator may not modify the contract unless authorized to do so.judson rubber works,prod serv.workers union,an award will not be enforced when it draws it essence solely from the parties past practice.
in reaching out for some validity in the arbitrator decision,judge easterbrook suggests that the arbitrator was unable to sharply differentiate pre from conduct and that i t is not sufficient to annul an award that an arbitrator might have acquiesced in a temptation to enforce conduct in the name of fair play.these assumptions are,at best,most problematical.judge easterbrook implies that the arbitrator might have relied on clearly forbidden conduct and thus the award should be preserved at all costs.but despite judge easterbrook creative and factually unsupported characterization of the arbitrator opinion,it is clear the arbitrator did actually rely not might have relied on the employer past practices.indeed,despite the arbitrator best and vain efforts to disguise the fact that he did rely on past practices,he actually admitted in his decision that he was going outside the very terms of the written contract by stating that he was giving effect to a practice or oral understanding reaffirmed and readopted by the company.second,all parties agreed that the contract was clear and unambiguous,facts entirely ignored by the dissent,as well as written in specific language that defined the limits of the negotiated agreement and the scope of the arbitrator authority.it required neither interpretation nor interpretative devices.in fact,neither the arbitrator nor the parties contend that there is any ambiguity in the language of the contract establishing commission rates for drivers.thus,there was no need for the arbitrator,in reaching his desired result,to interpret the unambiguous contract by reaching outside the contractual language and creating a scheme to rely on past contradictory practices or customs.as we have explained 
the existence of industrial common law does not necessarily mean,however,that the parties should be bound by their customs to the same extent as by explicitly negotiated provisions in their collective bargaining agreement.unlike contractual agreements,past practices may not always be the result of joint determination.in such cases there is no thought of obligation or commitment for the future.such practices are merely present ways,not prescribed ways,of doing things.

as stated earlier,the parties to the contract agree,and so do we,that the document at issue in this case is neither ambiguous nor incomplete,and the very language of the contract made clear and specific that the arbitrator was without authority to add to,subtract from,modify or change in any way the terms of the agreement.nevertheless,the dissent insists without any reference to the record,much less explanation or discussion,that arbitrator berman performed an interpretive task.but the dissent never explains what this task was or what term,in the contract that the parties agreed was unambiguous,required interpretation.indeed,the dissent ignores the fact that this contract required no interpretation the zipper clause was unambiguous the arbitration clause was unambiguous and the clause was unambiguous.any interpretation drawing its essence from the written contract necessarily would have recognized that the arbitrator was without the authority to modify or change the contract in any way.by contrast,in this case,the arbitrator issued an award based not on any reading of or language in the contract,but rather on his personal view of how the contract would read if conduct were somehow codified and inserted into the document itself.thus,it is evident that the arbitrator rejected the plain language of the contract,without ever claiming to be interpreting any provision of it and in doing so rewrote the contract and inscribed his own language upon the contract something that he was not authorized to do another sister circuit very recently agreed.in pennsylvania power ibew,cir,the third circuit reversed the award of an arbitrator who ignored a zipper clause like the one in this contract and,by considering the parties practices and other extrinsic evidence,exceeded his powers under the agreement and altered the agreement in direct violation of its provision that he had no power to do so.id.at.the court held that the arbitrator decision conflicts with the express provisions of the agreement between the company and the union and therefore,fails to draw its essence from that agreement.id.at.
carefully written,and thoroughly negotiated contracts are presumptively complete,and the added presence of a merger clause is further strong evidence that the parties intended the writing to be the complete and exclusive agreement between them.regensburger china adoption consultants,cir.the dissent states in seeking to avoid the impact of the merger clause and suggests that the arbitrator made an effort to interpret the contract by reference to conduct,and a collective bargaining agreement may be altered by the acts of the party sought to be bound.he dissenting judge goes on to cite several cases,contending that they support his theory that a collective bargaining agreement may be altered by the acts of the party sought to be bound.but it is obvious that these cases are irrelevant none of the contracts in those cases contain a strong,zipper clause as well as an arbitration clause barring the arbitrator from adding to,subtracting from,modifying or changing in any way the terms of the agreement.further,as judge rovner explains contrary to the dissent notion that the concurring opinion supports the dissent theory that whether the arbitrator was justified in concluding that effectively modified the contract is not a question we are called upon to answer,for that is not what the arbitrator held.there would be no need to prevent the arbitrator from adding to,subtracting from,modifying or changing in any way the terms of the agreement unless the parties clearly intended to prevent the arbitrator from relying on what the dissent calls conduct when interpreting the agreement.
let us not forget that the parties have stipulated that the contract before us is an unambiguous,exclusive statement of the parties rights and obligations.the conduct of the parties is absolutely irrelevant in situations like this involving a dual zipper clause,as the second circuit noted in leed architectural,united steelworkers of,cir.in leed,the court considered the effect of an arbitral clause,like the one in this case,which denie d the arbitrator the right to add to,subtract from,or any way modify its terms.id.at.the court held that t he zipper clause in the collective bargaining agreement,which denies the arbitrator the right to add to,subtract from or in any way modify its terms,is a pragmatic restatement of the above holdings.its purpose is to make the written contract the exclusive statement of the parties rights and obligations.id.thus,leed makes clear that the combined effect of the arbitration and zipper clauses was to prohibit the arbitrator from deviating from the clearly defined and thoroughly negotiated written contract.
the arbitrator decision paid only lip service to the limitations on his authority imposed by the combination of the language of the arbitration clause and the zipper clause.he saw fit to withdraw the commission provision specifically delineated in the,and contracts and proceeded to add to the agreement while ignoring its clear language and intent and substituted his personal views of fairness based on a factor he was forbidden to consider,namely the parties past practices.the dissent cleverly makes only a brief,passing reference to the arbitration clause,suggesting without explanation,that it is not sound to read a clause as if it were a clause emphasis added.the dissent argument is premised upon its assumption unsupported by any reference to the wording in the arbitrator decision that the arbitrator made an effort to interpret the contract even though the unambiguous and thoroughly negotiated,written contract barred any such he concluded that had itself modified the deal.but were we to accept the dissent theory,an arbitrator need only claim that he concluded,as did this arbitrator,the parties modified the contract in order to completely eviscerate all judicial review,which is what the arbitrator has attempted to do here.we can not agree to such a view.garvey makes clear that arbitrators can not stray from interpretation and application of the agreement.at.as we have pointed out,an arbitrator can not dress his policy desires up in contract interpretation clothing a wolf in sheep clothing is still nothing other than a wolf.nipsco,at emphasis added.in this case,the contract was clear and unambiguous and needed no interpretation.accordingly,we are convinced that the arbitrator,not the parties,modified the contract and thereby exceeded his authority.
arbitrators must not stray from interpretation and application of the agreement and effectively dispense their own brand of industrial justice.garvey,at.quoting enterprise wheel,at.but that is precisely what the arbitrator did when he cast aside the extensively negotiated contract and ignored the clear and specific language of the clause,the arbitration clause,and the zipper clause.indeed,the arbitrator himself admitted when he stated that the employer decision to adhere to the contract as negotiated and written,rather than its past practice,was a fundamentally unfair maneuver,making clear that the decision,in spite of the arbitrator sleight of hand,dispensed the arbitrator own brand of industrial justice.
we note further that the arbitrator personal opinion concerning the fairness of the employer actions is lacking of support in the record.he went on to find inequity in the fact that decision to abide by the contract deprived the union of its right to bargain over commission rates during the remaining term of the contract.but this analysis ignores the obvious fact that between and,the union and the employer,after extensive negotiation on each occasion,agreed to all the terms of the most recent contract,including the agreement specific commission structure and the zipper clause not once,but on three different occasions in,and.furthermore,despite the fact that the record reflects that the union agreed to the inclusion of the language of the commission provision in the two previous contracts as well as in the current agreement,nothing contained herein indicates that the union was surprised in any manner,much less precluded from renegotiating the commission rates for drivers during the respective bargaining sessions concerning each of the three contracts.the zipper clause set forth in each of the three contracts,as ratified by the union on three different occasions,clearly states that the contract is the result of extensive negotiations in which both parties had the right and the opportunity to submit proposals and to negotiate their proposals with the other party.it is also most interesting to note that all of the witnesses called to testify at the arbitration hearing both union and employer agreed that they were fully cognizant of the fact that the commission structure and the zipper clause was included in each of the three contracts.the witnesses further testified that following the execution of the first contract in,the employer made absolutely no promises or oral agreements to the union that payment of only the greater commission rate would continue into the future.
in any event,the word fairness is as wide and as deep as the ocean and can have a multitude of meanings depending on an individual arbitrator personal whims and caprice.thus,any decision motivated by an arbitrator view of what is fair is prohibited by the rule that a n arbitrator is confined to interpretation and application of the collective bargaining agreement he does not sit to dispense his own brand of industrial justice,and that courts have no choice but to refuse enforcement of the award when the award fails to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.enterprise wheel,at.the arbitrator reliance on the supposed unfairness of the employer conduct is also at odds with our prior holding that the arbitrator can not dress his policy desires up in contract interpretation clothing.nipsco,at see also appalachian reg l healthcare,united steelworkers of,cir even if we were to credit the arbitrator construction of the agreement as against its conflict with express provisions,we would still have to vacate the award as it imports notions not found in the agreement itself.
judge easterbrook goes on to argue that m any a reference to fairness is just a code word for a genuine interpretive principle,and points to the doctrine of good faith and fair dealing in contract law as an example.in an attempt to invent a cover for the arbitrator,the dissent implies that the arbitrator in this case was inartfully attempting to ground his decision using some similar interpretive device.however,the dissent fails to point to even a scintilla of evidence in the record to support its speculation that the arbitrator was relying upon any interpretive principle in fashioning his award.on the other hand,because the arbitrator explicitly stated that his award was designed to stamp out what he saw as fundamentally unfair maneuver s that worked to what he believed was the detriment of the labor union,we are quite confident that he was simply effectuating his personal bias regarding proper relations.if the arbitrator decision is read,and attention paid to the context in which the arbitrator uses the word fairness,it is clear that the arbitrator reference to fairness was not mere slippage of tongue,as the dissent argues in an unconvincing attempt to explain away the arbitrator actions instead it was and that unequivocally denounced the employer actions on the basis that they failed to comport with the arbitrator subjective notions of fairness in the collective bargaining process.a thorough reading of the record makes clear that the arbitrator did more than errantly invoke contract principles when he branded the employer actions unfair.
the majority opinion makes it perfectly clear that the arbitrator disregarded the plain language of the contract,including,but not limited to,language in the zipper clause,the arbitration clause,and the commission rates clause.nevertheless,the dissent would uphold the arbitrator based on mere speculation that the arbitrator relied on some unspoken interpretive device when reading the contract.were we to accept the dissent theory,then it would never matter whether the respective parties thoughts and ideas are clearly and unambiguously drafted and documented,nor how thoroughly the parties negotiated,nor how clearly the parties placed a precise issue before the arbitrator if the arbitrator personally felt offended by one party conduct,we would still uphold his award and permit him to impose his own brand of industrial justice upon the parties under the guise of good faith.we can not and will not accept this view.see enterprise wheel,at.
the arbitrator attempted to cloak his actions with noises of contract interpretation,but he improperly used the parties practices to add to the agreement,and his decision reads as though it was deeply rooted in his own personal idea of industrial justice,rather than living up to the very specific language of the contract at issue.it is particularly telling that the arbitrator,while on the one hand claiming to consider practices occurring only during the first two months of the contract,actually relied on the fact that the employer payment of the higher commission rate to all drivers was,to quote the arbitrator own words,a practice or oral understanding to which he was giving effect.had the arbitrator abided by the terms of the contract and disregarded past practices and understandings as he was bound to do by both the zipper clause and our case law,he certainly would have recognized and concluded that he had no authority to consider,much less rely upon,any supposed practice.
the arbitrator took it upon himself to right what he perceived to be a wrong in the workplace.in doing so,he improperly injected his personal notions of fairness into his decision and thus manifested an infidelity to his obligation to follow the law and the language of the contract and not to add to modify or change any portion of the thoroughly negotiated agreement.see tootsie roll,at.long and thoroughly negotiated written contracts would cease to have meaning should we approve of the actions of the arbitrator and allow him to completely ignore and disregard and cast aside clear and unambiguous contractual language and traverse beyond the limited scope of his review merely by invoking the magic words contract interpretation.we are convinced that the arbitration decision in this case failed to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement that took effect on february,because the decision exceeded the confines of interpreting and applying the contract.
on a final note,we agree with the dissent that one purpose of arbitration is to provide the parties with swift,inexpensive,and final decisions.but this does not vitiate judicial review of an arbitrator decision.arbitrators are not free to dispense their own brand of industrial justice and may not ignore the plain language of the contract.paperworkers misco,d emphasis added.thus,while the parties may agree to arbitration,they may also agree,as they did in this contract,to limit the arbitrator authority and preserve their right to challenge decisions when the arbitrator has reached out and rendered a decision that strays beyond his delegated authority and is barred by the negotiated contract.see george watts son,tiffany,cir people who want their arbitrators to have fewer powers need only provide this by contract.in this case,the arbitrator ignored the plain language of three clauses in the clause concerning commission rates,the zipper clause,and the arbitration of which limited his authority and were written by the parties to prevent the type of improper award that is the subject of this appeal.see ibew thomas betts,cir when a collective bargaining agreement prohibits the addition of contract terms,the arbitrator may not proceed to do so.
the arbitrator did not merely misread the contract he intentionally disregarded and thus violated the clear,specific language of the contract,and created an escape hatch through which he could dispense his own brand of industrial justice.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is r eversed.this case is remanded with instructions to vacate the award of the arbitrator and enter judgment in favor of.
the collective bargaining agreement,as written,gave anheuser busch the authority to pay individuals working on routes a lower commission than workers assigned to routes.the unambiguous terms of that agreement also barred the arbitrator from looking to practices the agreement what judge easterbrook refers to as conduct as a source of new or modified contract terms article,section expressly provided that t his agreement constitutes the full and complete agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements between the parties or their representatives,oral or written,including all practices not specifically preserved by the express provisions of this agreement.emphasis mine.we are agreed,therefore,that any prior oral understandings that may have had with the union,and any previous practice with respect to the commissions paid on routes,can not be imported into the agreement.
whether the arbitrator would have been justified in concluding that practice,for two months after the agreement took effect,of paying workers on routes at the higher,rate what judge easterbrook refers to as conduct effectively modified the terms of the agreement,is not a question we are called upon to answer,for that is not what the arbitrator held.the arbitrator never inquired whether the parties conduct was sufficient,in and of itself,to trump the plain language of the contract.at all times,he was concerned with whether the parties had signaled an intent to carry forward their understandings and practices in the agreement.this much is evident from the way in which the arbitrator framed the question before him i must decide whether a past practice supersedes the contract language.arbitrator opinion and award at emphasis mine,quoting the union brief at.but that question is answered unequivocally by article,section prior practices not expressly preserved by the contract are displaced,and the written terms of the contract control.
true enough,the arbitrator did advert to the parties conduct.but as the arbitrator rationale makes plain,he viewed the conduct as a window onto the parties past practices,not as an independent revision of the terms regarding commission rates.what the arbitrator seized upon is the parties failure,upon execution of the agreement,to promptly abandon their practice and conform their conduct to the pertinent terms of the new if longstanding practices were to be read into the contract unless timely discontinued by the parties.see arbitrator opinion and award at had the practice under review not been carried over into the term of the agreement,the zipper clause,as well as the parol evidence rule,would undoubtedly have invalidated it.in the end,it is the parties conduct that the arbitrator read into the contract their conduct is cited merely as a convenient bootstrap to reinsert a longstanding,but unwritten,practice into the agreement.see,arbitrator opinion and award at the company did,in fact,carry the practice embodied in green promise into the contract.yet,the unmistakable effect of article,section is to wipe the slate clean of such previous understandings and practices.and no one is arguing that the parties modified or abandoned that provision.without the conduct to rely upon,the arbitrator construction of the agreement is wholly bereft of support.
i do not think that the arbitrator was acting in bad faith,or that he purposely set about to dispense his own brand of industrial justice.his own perception of the equities does appear to have influenced his construction of the contract,however.see,arbitrator opinion and award at.more importantly,i think it evident that his decision purporting to interpret the agreement relied substantially on the unwritten understandings and lengthy course of conduct that preceded that resort to such conduct was verboten under the express terms of the contract.to that extent,i agree that the arbitrator exceeded his authority,and that his award must be vacated.
arbitrator herbert berman found that and its drivers union had modified their written collective bargaining agreement by conduct.the district court enforced that decision.now this court reverses.my colleagues separate opinions rely principally on the agreement integration clause,which forbids any reference to conduct and negotiating history.the arbitrator decision,my colleagues believe,effectively bound the employer to continue its treatment of routes,thus offending the integration clause.
because the conduct was a continuation of conduct,this is a possible understanding of what happened,but it is not an inevitable one.arbitrator berman recognized that the zipper clause invalidates prior agreements and prior practices not incorporated into the written contract see page of his opinion.he wrote that modified the deal,to the union benefit,when it continued paying the higher rates for two months after the new collective bargaining agreement became effective.this may be right or our review were plenary,i would join my colleagues in holding that it is it does not transgress the integration clause.it is an effort to interpret the contract by reference to conduct,and a collective bargaining agreement may be altered by the acts of the party sought to be bound.see employees union pacific,d see also international business lists,american telephone telegraph,cir matuszak torrington,cir.judge coffey denies the applicability of this principle on the ground that an integration clause which negates the significance of words and conduct makes modification by conduct impossible.this reads into the clause more than it contains.but if,as judge coffey believes,matters turn on the meaning of the particular text in this zipper clause,that is itself a subject for the arbitrator,and a court disagreement with an arbitrator understanding of contractual language does not justify displacement of the arbitrator decision.
to see the difference between misinterpreting clear language and ignoring it,consider a clear federal a,the exhaustion requirement in the prison litigation reform act.this law provides that no action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under,or any other federal law,by a prisoner confined in any jail,prison,or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.some courts of appeals concluded that,even if some administrative remedies are available,exhaustion is unnecessary unless these are the same remedies the prisoner seeks in court.booth churner,d,holds that this is not what the statute means exhaustion always is required.should the supreme court have said that the courts of appeals that had come to a different conclusion ignored a or dispensed their own brand of prison justice what it actually said is that those courts misinterpreted a.it is clear and comprehensive just like the zipper clause in this collective bargaining agreement,but texts that seem clear to some readers may be understood differently by others.this difference need not imply that one side has ignored the text or decided on grounds extrinsic to it.arbitrator berman
