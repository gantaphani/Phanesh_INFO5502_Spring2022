defendant and appellant pacific center,appeals from an order denying its motion to compel arbitration.on the basis of information contained in an unverified complaint filed by plaintiffs and respondents hotels nevada and inns nevada hotels nevada,as well as counsel arguments,the trial court concluded that appellant had failed to meet its burden to show that it had an enforceable agreement to arbitrate with hotels nevada.it further determined that an evidentiary hearing would be necessary to determine whether the parties had a meeting of the minds on material issues.

factual and procedural 
hotels nevada is owned and controlled by louis habash habash.in early,hotels nevada owned the alexis park hotel and the american inn apartments in las vegas,nevada.at that time,appellant and hotels nevada were engaged in negotiations for the sale of these properties.in connection with the negotiations,habash dealt with appellant authorized agents richard alter alter and eddie chan chan.
the parties agreed on a purchase price of million for both properties.at alter and chan request,habash also agreed to a holdback provision whereby appellant would be permitted to hold back million of the purchase price for a period of months in essence,appellant financed million of the purchase price through an loan from hotels nevada.the holdback provision was memorialized as section b of the written purchase and sale agreement agreement.in addition,the parties agreed to prepare and record a memorandum of agreement memorandum,which would provide notice of the transaction and specifically of appellant obligation to repay the million holdback within months.
in march,after the agreement and memorandum underwent several drafts,appellant forwarded final versions of both documents to hotels nevada.hotels nevada and its counsel verified that the final versions accurately reflected the terms to which the parties had agreed,including the holdback provision.
on march,habash and alter met at appellant attorneys offices to sign the agreement and memorandum.alter informed habash that appellant desired to modify the holdback provision to extend the holdback period from months to months.habash responded that hotels nevada would not agree to such a modification under any circumstances and left the meeting without signing either the agreement or the memorandum.alter immediately approached habash in the hallway and told him that appellant was agreeable to retaining the holdback period and proceeding with the transaction.habash returned to the attorneys offices,reviewed execution copies of the agreement and memorandum and confirmed that they both contained a holdback period.he then signed two originals of the agreement and memorandum.the following day,hotels nevada counsel received a copy of the fully executed documents which,again,contained the holdback period.
thereafter,hotels nevada received written confirmation that the agreement and memorandum had been transmitted to the escrow agent handling the transaction.on may,appellant recorded the memorandum with the clark county recorder in nevada.on may,the escrow officer mailed to hotels nevada attorney a copy of the recorded memorandum.although hotels nevada did not learn this at the time of the mailing,the memorandum it received contained a holdback provision.
hotels nevada learned of the holdback in april,when it wrote to appellant to provide it with wire transfer instructions and remind it of its obligation under the agreement,and appellant denied that the million payment was due in may.at an april,meeting,alter presented habash with a copy of the recorded memorandum,which contained the holdback provision,and a document that he represented was page of the agreement,which also contained a holdback provision.hotels nevada had not previously seen any version of the agreement or memorandum containing a holdback provision.
on may,hotels nevada filed a complaint against appellant,alleging causes of action for rescission based on fraud,cancellation of written instruments based on illegality and conspiracy.relevant to all causes of action,hotels nevada alleged buyer appellant manipulated,fabricated,and manufactured the version of the memorandum apparently recorded on may,to reflect an incorrect sixty month period for the holdback of the five million dollars of the purchase price by changing,modifying,removing,replacing and otherwise wrongfully and unlawfully altering the memorandum,as well as the agreement upon which it was based.seller at no time agreed to such sixty month holdback period,nor did seller ever agree to the manipulated and manufactured memorandum,nor to the equally manipulated and manufactured agreement upon which the recorded memorandum is based.indeed,and as hereinabove alleged,seller would never have agreed to such sixty month period holdback a five year interest free loan and would have walked away from the transaction in the event that buyer insisted upon inclusion of such sixty month holdback as part of the deal 
in july,appellant moved to compel arbitration.it relied on section of the agreement,which provided in relevant part that each claim,dispute or controversy of whatever nature,arising out of,in connection with,or in relation to the interpretation,performance or breach of this agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,including,without limitation,any claim based on contract,tort,or statute,or the arbitrability of any claim hereunder shall be settled by final and binding arbitration conducted in clark county,nevada.it also relied on a related provision,section of the agreement,providing in part that each signatory to this agreement hereby waives its respective right to a jury trial of any permitted claim or cause of action arising out of this agreement 
hotels nevada opposed the motion,asserting that its allegations of fraud in the execution of the agreement rendered the entire agreement,and hence the arbitration clause,void from the inception.appellant replied that because the alleged fraud occurred after the parties signed the agreement,hotels nevada had failed to state a claim for fraud in the execution and thus had no basis to avoid the arbitration clause.
the trial court denied the motion to compel arbitration.it characterized the matter as the rare case where the court is presented with a bona fide question as an issue of fact law as to whether or not there is an enforceable arbitration agreement.it concluded that appellant failed to meet its burden to show an enforceable agreement to arbitrate.rather,it found that the allegations in hotels nevada complaint required it to hold a hearing to determine whether the parties had a meeting of the minds to contract on material issues.the trial court acknowledged that such a hearing would probably adjudicate much of the case before sending it to arbitration,but concluded that the procedure was necessary because if there is no contract,there is no basis to send it to arbitration.
this appeal followed.see code civ,subd.a.
