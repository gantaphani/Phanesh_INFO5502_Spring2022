background 
procedural summary 
on march,the goffs and the firm participated in a fee arbitration pursuant to the mandatory fee arbitration act bus,et mfaa under the rules of the los angeles county bar association lacba and its arbitration services provider,dispute resolution services,drs.on june,after concluding the parties had agreed to binding arbitration,the panel of three arbitrators issued an award in favor of the firm in the amount of in fees and costs,plus percent simple interest from february,through the date of the award.
in july,the firm filed a petition and motion to confirm the award.the goffs opposed the petition and motion,arguing that the arbitrators exceeded their powers by purporting to issue a binding award although the goffs had not agreed to binding arbitration.they sought to have the award vacated and declared nonbinding,and they requested days in which to file a rejection of the award and a request for trial de novo.
after conducting three hearings,the court granted the firm petition and entered judgment confirming the award in the amount of,including interest.
ii.the fee arbitration 
the goffs operate an art gallery,and they retained the firm to represent them in a dispute with an artist concerning royalties.on september,the firm sent the goffs a letter advising them that they owed the firm in unpaid fees and costs on account of invoices from the firm dated october,through january.the firm advised the goffs it would be filing an action in the los angeles county superior court to collect the fees and costs owed,and that the goffs had the right under the mfaa to submit the matter to arbitration through lacba.
on january,the goffs submitted a request for binding arbitration of the fee dispute to lacba arbitration services provider,
on april,the firm advised drs that it declined binding arbitration 
drs then sent a letter to the parties,advising them that an arbitration panel was appointed consisting of timothy reuben,verna porter,and bernard krasnow,with reuben as chairman.the letter indicated that the firm had declined binding arbitration,and it advised the parties that if they agreed to binding arbitration before the start of the arbitration,then the arbitration would become binding.
on july,reuben sent a letter to the parties proposing dates for the arbitration and asking whether the firm would agree to binding arbitration.
on july,after having learned the identities of the arbitrators,the firm advised reuben it would agree to binding arbitration.
on august,reuben again wrote to the parties,stating that both sides have now agreed to have this matter heard as a binding arbitration.reuben nonetheless asked that the parties sign and return a stipulation for binding arbitration.counsel for the firm signed the stipulation on the firm behalf on august,and one of the firm partners signed it on august.
on september,the goffs advised reuben that they would not agree to binding arbitration.
on december,the firm asked the arbitrators to resolve the issue of whether the arbitration was binding as soon as possible,because the arbitration was scheduled to commence on january.
on december,reuben ruled that the goffs original request for binding arbitration constituted an offer that was accepted by the firm.reuben reasoned that the firm had not indicated a willingness to withdraw its request for binding arbitration,and the goffs had requested binding arbitration in their initial papers.
the arbitrators heard the substance of the parties fee dispute on march.there was no reporter present for the arbitration hearing.
on june,the arbitrators issued their award in favor of the firm.the arbitrators found that the firm generated a total bill of in fees and costs in connection with the goffs dispute with the artist,and that the goffs did not dispute that they owed the firm fees,the amount of time billed,or the firm billing rates.the arbitrators found that under the several fee agreements between the goffs and the firm,the firm was entitled to all fees sought and awarded in fees plus percent simple interest from february,through the date of the award.
the award expressly reiterated the arbitrators prior ruling that the award was binding because the parties had agreed in writing to be bound this matter is subject to binding arbitration.the goffs agreed to binding arbitration in their initial submission to the lacba dispute resolution services.the firm indicated arbitration in its initial submission,but then changed its position to elect binding arbitration in agreement with the goffs.after the goffs saw that the firm had also agreed to elect binding arbitration,the goffs requested that their binding arbitration election be withdrawn.the firm objected.a determination was made on december,ruling that the original election by the goffs of binding arbitration was an offer that was accepted by the firm and could not be revoked once accepted.
the award was accompanied by a form from lacba entitled notice of your rights after fee arbitration,advising the goffs that after service of a nonbinding arbitration award they had days to seek a new trial in court,and after service of a binding arbitration award they had days to file a petition to vacate or correct the award.
iii.the petition to confirm the award 
on july,the firm filed a petition to confirm the arbitrators award.the petition stated that the parties had agreed in writing prior to the arbitration that the award would be binding.on july,the firm filed a motion to confirm the arbitration award pursuant to code of civil procedure section and for entry of judgment thereon.
on august,the goffs filed opposition to the firm petition and motion,contending that the arbitrators exceeded their powers by ruling that the arbitration was binding.the goffs argued that the firm rejection of their offer of binding arbitration terminated the offer,which the firm therefore could not accept later when it changed its position accordingly,the parties never agreed to binding arbitration.in their opposition,the goffs asked that the award be vacated as a binding arbitration a ward and also asked that,once the award was declared to be,they be granted days in which to request trial de novo.
in reply,the firm defended the arbitrators ruling on bindingness and also argued that the goffs had waived the issue as follows according to the declaration of vincent green an attorney who had appeared on behalf of the firm at the arbitration hearing,at the start of the arbitration hearing the firm sought a continuance because it had recently become aware that the goffs were not only opposing the firm efforts to collect unpaid fees but also seeking a refund of fees previously paid,as well as asserting a claim for legal malpractice.according to green,as a result of the firm request for a continuance,the arbitrators asked the goffs if they would agree to a continuance in exchange for making the arbitration nonbinding,and the goffs declined.
the goffs filed evidentiary objections to green declaration and also filed a declaration by george goff,stating that green declaration was incorrect on several points.in particular,george goff declaration states that at the arbitration hearing the arbitrators did not ask the goffs if they would agree to a continuance in exchange for making the arbitration nonbinding,and that the goffs did not state that they were opposed to the arbitration proceeding as.
at a hearing on september,the trial court stated that it was tentatively inclined to grant the firm petition to confirm the award,but the court wished to conduct an evidentiary hearing concerning the conflict between the green and goff declarations.
the court conducted that evidentiary hearing on september.green testified that,at the start of the arbitration hearing,the arbitrators asked the goffs if they would agree to a continuance in exchange for making the arbitration nonbinding sort of as a to this no delay versus is this going to be a binding proceeding.according to green,the goffs left the hearing room,returned about five minutes later,and rejected the arbitrators offer.george goff testified that the arbitrators did not offer to make the arbitration nonbinding,that the goffs never left the hearing room to consider the question of a continuance,and that they did not unequivocally refuse to agree to the firm request for a continuance but merely stated that it would be a hardship for them to have to return for a second hearing date.esther goff testified that her recollection was the same as her husband.
after receiving further supplemental briefing,the court heard additional argument and rendered its decision at a hearing on october.the court expressly found green more credible than the goffs and accordingly found that at the start of the arbitration hearing the arbitrators made,and the goffs rejected,the offer described by green.the court concluded that the goffs rejection of that offer precluded the goffs from now arguing that the arbitration award was nonbinding.the court also reasoned that,assuming for the sake of argument that the arbitration award was nonbinding when it was made,the goffs failure to request trial de novo within days of service of the award rendered the award binding pursuant to lacba rules.
the court entered both an order granting the firm petition to confirm the award and a judgment to the same effect on november.the goffs timely appealed.

discussion 
we begin by addressing the goffs contention that the arbitrators ruling that the arbitration was binding is subject to independent judicial review,and we conclude that the contention is correct.we next turn to the goffs argument that the arbitrators ruling on that issue was legally erroneous,and again we agree with the parties did not agree to binding arbitration.finally,we analyze several waiver and forfeiture arguments raised by the firm and the dissent,and we conclude that they lack merit.
i.the arbitrators ruling that the arbitration was binding is subject to independent judicial review 
the threshold question presented in this appeal is whether the arbitrators ruling that the arbitration was binding is judicially reviewable at all.the goffs argue that under trabuco highlands community head th trabuco,the ruling is subject to independent judicial review.we agree.
in trabuco,two homeowners and their homeowners association agreed in correspondence to submit certain disputes to nonbinding arbitration.trabuco,supra,th at.the arbitrator,however,issued a binding arbitration award and decision.ibid.after one of the homeowners asserted that the arbitrator had mistakenly characterized the arbitration as binding,the association filed a petition to confirm the arbitration award.id.at.the homeowners opposed the petition on the ground that the arbitrator had exceeded his powers by purporting to render a binding award even though,according to the homeowners declarations,they had never agreed to make the arbitration binding.ibid.the association supported its petition with a declaration from the association lawyer stating that at the arbitration hearing the homeowners agreed to make the arbitration binding,and a letter from the arbitrator to the same effect.ibid.the trial court declined to hear oral testimony,treated the arbitrator letter as dispositive,concluded that the arbitration was binding,and granted the petition.id.at.
the court of appeal reversed.trabuco,supra,th at.the court recognized that by statute there are very few grounds on which an arbitration award may be vacated and that under moncharsh heily blase cal th moncharsh,subject to narrow exceptions,an arbitrator decision may not be reviewed for factual or legal errors.trabuco,supra,th at.but the court reasoned that not all types of factual or legal errors warrant the same treatment,so courts must not abandon all scrutiny of awards.ibid.in particular,w hen the issue goes to the integrity of the arbitration process itself,appellate courts have mandated de novo review of an arbitrator ruling.ibid.
the notion that a party should be bound by an arbitration award and precluded from substantive judicial review is premised on the assumption that the parties have agreed to such finality.citation.trabuco,supra,th at.accordingly,t he binding nature of the arbitration sought to be confirmed is a structural aspect of the arbitration,so i ndependent judicial review of whether an arbitration is binding is necessary to preserve the integrity of the arbitration process and the judicial system.ibid.because the trial court had granted the petition only on the basis of the arbitrator letter,it had abdicated its function of determining,as a matter of i ndependent judicial review,whether the arbitration was binding.id.at.that was wrong.id.at.accordingly,the appellate court reversed and remanded for the trial court to conduct a careful factual inquiry to determine that the parties had in fact agreed that the arbitration would be binding.ibid.
trabuco applies straightforwardly here.the arbitrators determined that the parties agreed to binding arbitration.but it is not clear whether a court has ever determined that the parties agreed to binding arbitration,and the goffs contend they did not.under trabuco,the trial court should have independently reviewed whether the parties had agreed to make the arbitration binding,and,because the relevant facts are undisputed,in the next part of our discussion we conduct that review on this appeal.agnes medical center pacificare of california cal th,when the facts are undisputed and only one inference may reasonably be drawn,the issue is one of law and the reviewing court is not bound by the trial court ruling.
any approach other than trabuco would mean that,because the arbitrators determined that the parties agreed to binding arbitration,no california court can review that determination,because according to the arbitrators,the parties agreed to be bound by it.that would be precisely the kind of impermissible bootstrapping that the arbitration case law warns against.bruni didion th.put differently,it would mean that the arbitrators determination is binding because the parties agreed to be bound by it,and we know the parties agreed to be bound by it because the arbitrators determined that the parties agreed to be bound by it,and that determination is binding because the way out of that vicious circle is to follow trabuco holding that i ndependent judicial review of whether an arbitration is binding is necessary.trabuco,supra,th at bruni,at parties can not be required to arbitrate anything until a court has made a threshold determination that they did,in fact,agree to arbitrate something.
the firm presents several arguments to the contrary,but none is persuasive.first,the firm argues that the arbitrators ruling on the issue of bindingness is insulated from judicial review because the goffs expressly concede in their briefs on appeal that the parties authorized the arbitrators to rule on that issue.the firm inference is invalid.although the issue of bindingness is undisputedly within the scope of the issues that the arbitrators were authorized to decide,it does not follow that the arbitrators had authority to bind the parties or,equivalently,to make unreviewable rulings on that issue or any other.even in a nonbinding arbitration,the parties are free to authorize the arbitrators to rule on any issue the parties choose,including bindingness or other jurisdictional issues.that is purely a matter of the scope of the issues to be arbitrated,and the parties can agree to make it as broad or as narrow as they please.but the parties agreement that bindingness shall be within the scope of the issues on which the arbitrators may rule does not constitute an agreement that the arbitrators ruling on bindingness or anything else shall itself be binding and hence unreviewable.rather,the parties may agree that the arbitrators ruling on bindingness and every other issue within the scope of their authority shall be nonbinding.that is exactly what the goffs contend happened here.
second,the firm appears to argue that,because the goffs concede that the parties authorized the arbitrators to rule on the issue of bindingness,it follows that the arbitrators did not exceed their powers,within the meaning of subdivision a of code of civil procedure section,by purporting to issue a binding award.the argument lacks merit.arbitrators in a nonbinding arbitration exceed their powers by purporting to issue a binding award.trabuco,supra,th at,fn.see also id.at the arbitrator exceed s his powers in a most fundamental way by issuing a binding award after the parties agreed only to nonbinding arbitration.therefore,if a party seeks to vacate or opposes confirmation of an arbitration award on the ground that the parties never agreed to make the arbitration binding,then,in order to determine whether the arbitrators exceeded their powers under subdivision a of code of civil procedure section,the court hearing the petition must independently review whether the parties agreed to be bound.
third,the firm attempts to distinguish trabuco.according to the firm,trabuco holds only that the trial court erred by not asking the parties for testimony about whether the arbitration was binding.that is not correct.on the contrary,the trabuco opinion expressly states that,i f the trial court had simply decided whether the arbitration was binding based on the declarations of the parties concerning what was said at the arbitration hearing,we might simply affirm the ruling by concluding it was a matter of credibility for the trial court to decide.but the trial court apparently did not base the ruling on that.trabuco,supra,th at,italics added.that is,the trial court erred not by basing its decision on written declarations instead of oral testimony,but rather by basing it on something else,namely,the letter from the arbitrator ibid.in granting the petition to confirm,the trial court expressly noted it was relying on a letter by the arbitrator that said the arbitration was binding.by doing so,the trial court abdicated its function to determine whether the arbitrator exceeded his powers in a most fundamental way by issuing a binding award after the parties agreed only to nonbinding arbitration.in other words,in trabuco the trial court error was that it did not determine for itself whether the arbitration was binding but instead relied on the arbitrator determination,expressed in the arbitrator letter 
we conclude that the firm has failed to present any sound basis for not applying trabuco.accordingly,we hold,following trabuco,that the arbitrators determination that the arbitration was binding is subject to independent judicial review.
moreover,the trabuco rule makes sense as a matter of policy.t he legislature has expressed a strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution citations,and it is the general rule that,with narrow exceptions,an arbitrator decision can not be reviewed for errors of fact or law.moncharsh,supra,cal th at.as the supreme court has explained,there is a risk that the arbitrator will make a mistake,but the risk is acceptable for two reasons.id.at.first,by voluntarily submitting to arbitration,the parties have agreed to bear that risk in return for a quick,inexpensive,and conclusive resolution to their dispute.ibid.second,the legislature has reduced the risk to the parties of an erroneous decision by providing for judicial review in circumstances involving serious problems with the award itself,or with the fairness of the arbitration process.id.at.because the statutory framework for judicial review of arbitration awards substantially reduce s the possibility of various kinds of error,the residual risk to the parties of an arbitrator erroneous decision represents an acceptable cost obtaining the expedience and financial savings that the arbitration process provides as compared to the judicial process.id.at.
in these ways,the entire system of narrowly circumscribed judicial review of binding arbitration awards is premised on the parties having agreed to it in effect,the parties agree to forgo their day in court subject to very limited exceptions in order to obtain the benefits that arbitration provides.conversely,if the parties have not agreed to binding arbitration,then there is no justification for channeling their dispute into the system of extremely limited judicial review that is applicable to parties who have agreed to it.
the key question,then,is this can a court treat an arbitration award as binding and hence unreviewable solely on the grounds that the arbitrator both ruled it is binding and had authority to rule on that issue the answer must be no.unless a court has first determined for itself that the parties agreed to be bound,the court has no basis for treating any part of the arbitrator award as binding.see bruni didion,supra,th at the parties can not be required to arbitrate anything until a court has made a threshold determination that they did,in fact,agree to arbitrate something.in particular,if the award itself states that the parties agreed to make the arbitration binding,then the court must still confront the question why should that statement in the award be treated as binding there is no way for the court to answer that question merely by looking to the award itself,because the same question will arise for every statement in the award.moreover,the court can not answer the question merely by determining that the arbitrator was authorized to rule on the issue,because the arbitrator may have been authorized only to make a nonbinding ruling on it.consequently,the only way for the court to justify treating anything in the award as binding is for the court first to determine that the parties actually agreed to be bound.and that yields the trabuco rule independent judicial review of whether an arbitration is binding is necessary.trabuco,supra,th at.
the trabuco rule also is fully consistent with various principles in the arbitration case law.for example,it is the general rule that parties to a private arbitration impliedly agree that the arbitrator decision will be both binding and final,so the parties are ordinarily presumed to know that the arbitrator award will be final and conclusive.moncharsh,supra,cal th at,quoting montifiori engels cal.but that presumption can not be controlling if the original arbitration agreement as in trabuco or the statutes governing the arbitration as in this case provide that the arbitration is nonbinding.in trabuco,the parties agreed in writing to nonbinding arbitration,and there was a factual dispute about whether they later orally agreed to make the arbitration binding.in the case before us,the mfaa and rules promulgated under it provide that fee arbitration is nonbinding unless the parties agree to make it binding see bus,subd.a,and the parties dispute whether their conduct gave rise to such an agreement.in neither case can a general presumption of bindingness resolve the issue.
the trabuco rule is likewise consistent with the principle that parties can agree to authorize the arbitrator to make binding determinations concerning jurisdiction or arbitrability.bruni didion,supra,th at the parties can agree to arbitrate almost any dispute even a dispute over whether the underlying dispute is subject to arbitration,although there is a presumption that they have not agreed to this see generally id.at surveying and synthesizing federal and california case law in this area see also greenspan ladt,llc th.the arbitration agreement may,for example,authorize the arbitrator to make a binding determination of the scope of the issues that are subject to arbitration.see,dream theater,dream theater th.but again,in the absence of a judicial determination that the parties agreed to binding arbitration of some issue or other,a court called upon to confirm an arbitration award would have no justification for treating any part of the award as binding.
we note that in the case of a civil action in which the defendant moves to compel arbitration on the basis of a predispute contractual arbitration agreement,the necessary judicial determination will ordinarily be made at that initial stage,when the court grants the motion to compel.see,greenspan ladt,llc,supra,th at the trial court found the parties have entered into a valid agreement to submit the relevant disputes to binding arbitration.moreover,the parties are generally presumed to have intended that the arbitration be binding moncharsh,supra,cal th at,and the issue of bindingness often will not even be contested.instead,the opposition to the motion to compel will often be based on other grounds,such as unconscionability or waiver.see,discover bank superior court cal th.
such cases are importantly different from cases like this one,which involves an mfaa arbitration.here,there is no predispute arbitration agreement,but rather a statutory scheme that makes arbitration mandatory for the attorney or firm upon the request of the client.see generally aguilar lerner cal th.the statutory scheme makes the arbitration nonbinding unless the parties agree in writing to make it binding.bus,subd.a.under these circumstances,if a defendant in a fee collection action requests nonbinding arbitration under the mfaa and never in any way vacillates from that position,then there is simply no question that everything the arbitrator says or does,every ruling the arbitrator makes,and every statement in the arbitrator award is nonbinding.the client has never agreed to be bound by anything in the arbitration.
but the rules of the arbitration might nonetheless authorize the arbitrator to decide on matters of jurisdiction,which might well include the issue of whether the arbitration is binding.lacba rules for conduct of arbitration of fee disputes and other related matters hereafter lacba rules include a provision concerning jurisdiction rule c of the lacba rules provides that the arbitrators shall have authority to determine jurisdiction.if jurisdiction includes the issue of whether the arbitration is binding,then the arbitrator in every mfaa arbitration conducted through lacba is authorized to rule on that issue 
what,then,happens if a client unequivocally requests nonbinding mfaa arbitration through lacba and never vacillates,but the lacba rules authorize the arbitrator to rule on the issue of whether the arbitration is binding the answer,however paradoxical it may sound,is straightforward the client has authorized the arbitrator to make a nonbinding ruling on the issue of whether the arbitration is binding,just as the client has authorized the arbitrator to make nonbinding rulings on all of the other issues within the scope of the arbitrator authority.
the scenario we have described is not merely an abstract or theoretical possibility.rather,we have described the actual circumstances of every client who requests nonbinding mfaa arbitration through lacba all such clients have agreed to nonbinding arbitration under the lacba rules,which authorize the arbitrators to rule on jurisdiction.therefore,assuming that jurisdiction includes the issue of bindingness,all such clients have authorized the arbitrators to make nonbinding rulings on the issue of bindingness.
the foregoing analysis reveals the firm and the dissent central argument to be a non sequitur.according to the firm and the dissent,because the goffs concede that the arbitrators were authorized to rule on the issue of bindingness,the arbitrators ruling on that issue is binding and hence not judicially reviewable.that can not be correct,because the foregoing analysis shows that authority to rule on the issue does not always mean authority to make a binding and hence unreviewable ruling on the issue.the goffs concession that the arbitrators were authorized to rule on the issue of bindingness therefore does not defeat their argument that the arbitrators decision on that issue is subject to judicial review 
for all of these reasons,we apply trabuco and hold that courts must independently review whether the parties agreed to make the arbitration binding.
ii.the parties did not agree to binding arbitration,and the arbitrators therefore exceeded their powers by purporting to issue a binding award 
the goffs argue that the arbitrators exceeded their powers by purporting to issue a binding award because the undisputed facts establish that the arbitration was nonbinding as a matter of law.we agree.
again,arbitration is a matter of the voluntary agreement of the parties as the goffs correctly point out,i t is hornbook law that an unequivocal rejection by an offeree,communicated to the offeror,terminates the offer.citation.once this occurs,the offeree can not later purport to accept the offer and thereby create an enforceable contract.guzman visalia community bank th.
thus,when the firm unequivocally rejected the goffs written request for binding arbitration and communicated that rejection to the goffs,the goffs offer was terminated and could not later be accepted by the firm.thereafter,when the firm changed its mind and submitted its own written request for binding arbitration,the goffs rejected that offer.accordingly,the parties never entered into a written agreement for binding arbitration,so the arbitration was nonbinding.
the firm only argument to the contrary is that under rule d of the lacba rules,as well as rule of the state bar rules of procedure for fee arbitrations and the enforcement of awards hereafter state bar rules,if the firm accepted the goffs offer for binding arbitration some time before the goffs withdrew it,then the goffs could not later withdraw it without the firm consent.the rules cited by the firm do not,however,provide any support for the firm argument.rule d of the lacba rules states that o nce both parties have agreed to be bound neither party can withdraw from the arbitration process without written consent from the other side.rule of the state bar rules states that a party who has requested binding arbitration may withdraw that request and request a change to arbitration in writing to the program and the other parties,so long as the other parties have not already agreed to binding arbitration.neither rule says anything about what happens to a request for binding arbitration that the other party rejects.consequently,neither rule provides any support for the firm position.the firm has therefore offered no reason to depart from the hornbook contract law that would otherwise be applicable 
we conclude that the arbitrators ruling that the arbitration was binding was erroneous as a matter of law and that the arbitrators therefore exceeded their powers by purporting to issue a binding award 
iii.the firm waiver and forfeiture arguments lack merit 
the firm argues on several grounds,including those adopted by the trial court,that the goffs waived or forfeited their argument that the arbitrators exceeded their powers by purporting to issue a binding award.we conclude that the firm arguments lack merit.
first,the firm argues that the goffs have forfeited the point because at no time during the arbitration proceeding did the goffs ever challenge or claim that the arbitration panel did not have the authority to decide whether the arbitration was binding or nonbinding.we reject the argument for the reasons already discussed the goffs concession that the arbitrators had authority to rule on the issue of bindingness does not constitute a concession that the arbitrators ruling on that issue would itself be binding and not subject to judicial review.
second,the firm argues that we are bound by the trial court factual finding that the goffs turned down the arbitrators offer to make the arbitration nonbinding in exchange for agreeing to a continuance,so we must also accept the trial court conclusion that by rejecting that offer the goffs waived or forfeited their right to nonbinding arbitration.the trial court factual finding that the goffs turned down the arbitrators offer to make the arbitration nonbinding in exchange for agreeing to a continuance is indeed supported by substantial evidence namely,green testimony,and it therefore can not be disturbed on appeal.crocker national bank city and county of san francisco,supra,cal d at.but we nonetheless review independently the trial court conclusions as to the legal significance of the facts.dorel industries,superior court th,see also crocker national bank city and county of san francisco,supra,cal d at.the trial court and the firm analysis is unsound because,accepting as we must the correctness of the trial court factual findings,as a matter of law the goffs rejection of the arbitrators offer did not constitute a waiver or forfeiture.before the arbitrators made the offer,the parties had not agreed to binding arbitration,as our discussion in part ii,ante,shows.having never entered into an agreement for binding arbitration,the goffs had an absolute right to insist on nonbinding arbitration.see bus,subd.a.the effect of the arbitrators offer was to charge the goffs a fee for exercising that right the goffs would have to agree to a continuance if they wanted the arbitration to be nonbinding.the goffs refusal to pay that price for the exercise of a right they were entitled to exercise for free does not constitute a waiver or forfeiture of the right,or an assent to its abrogation.on the contrary,the goffs rejection of the arbitrators offer was fully consistent with indeed,it was an expression of their position that they had an unfettered right to nonbinding arbitration and should not have to agree to a continuance or anything else in order to exercise it.
third,the firm argues that,assuming the goffs are right that the arbitration award was nonbinding when made,the goffs failure to seek trial de novo within days after service of notice of the award rendered the nonbinding award binding.we disagree.the firm argument is based on business and professions code section rule of the state bar rules,and rule of the lacba rules.the statute provides that,e ven if the parties to the arbitration have not agreed in writing to be bound,the arbitration award shall become binding upon the passage of days after service of notice of the award,unless a party has,within the days,sought a trial after arbitration pursuant to business and professions code section.bus,subd.b.rule of the state bar rules likewise provides that f ollowing service of a arbitration award either party may request a trial pursuant to business and professions code section within days,and i f a trial after arbitration is not requested,the award automatically becomes binding days after the award is served.and rule of the lacba rules similarly provides that,if there is already a court action pending and all parties have not agreed in writing to be bound by the arbitration award,the award shall nevertheless become final and binding on the parties,with the same effect as if the parties had originally agreed in writing to be bound,unless,within days after service of the award,a party files a rejection of arbitration award and request for trial after arbitration and otherwise complies with business and professions code section a.
we conclude that the statute and rules did not operate in this case to make the award binding.by its terms,the relevant provision of business and professions code section,subdivision b,applies only if the parties to the arbitration have not agreed in writing to be bound,and subdivision a of business and professions code section similarly provides that,i n the absence of an agreement to be bound,the parties shall be entitled to a trial after arbitration.but the award in this case states on its face that the award is binding because the parties agreed in writing to be bound.thus,until the award was vacated or corrected on that point,the statutes and the rules,for similar reasons did not apply.moreover,under these circumstances it would make no sense to require the parties to file a request for trial after arbitration unless and until the arbitrators determination that the award was binding was set then,any request for trial de novo would be rejected by the trial court,which would consider itself powerless to grant the request with respect to a facially binding award.because the law does not require an idle act see,germino hillyer th,we conclude that the legislature did not intend to require a party in the goffs position to file a futile request for trial de novo before obtaining relief from the arbitrators erroneous ruling that the award was binding.we therefore hold that in the case of an arbitration award that states on its face that it is binding,the statute and rules on which the firm relies do not operate to render the award binding if no party requests trial de novo within days of service of the award 
lastly,the dissent also endorses certain waiver arguments not raised by the firm,but we find them unpersuasive as well.first,the dissent reasons that,because the goffs did not contest the issue of bindingness after the arbitrators ruled that the arbitration was binding,and the goffs instead proceeded in the arbitration when they could have withdrawn from it,they waived their objections to the ruling.dis.opn.at,post.we disagree.before the arbitrators ruled on the issue of bindingness,the goffs argued,in written submissions to the panel,that the arbitration was nonbinding.there is no reason why they needed to present their arguments to the arbitrators again,after the arbitrators ruled,in order to preserve the issue for judicial review.the dissent cites no authority to the contrary,and we are aware of none.in general,a party aggrieved by a ruling need not seek reconsideration in order to preserve the issue for later review advocating an opposing position before the ruling is sufficient.and considerations of judicial economy weigh heavily against requiring or even allowing a party to present the same argument repeatedly to a decision maker who has already rejected it.civ,subd.a providing that motions for reconsideration are permitted only when based on new or different facts,circumstances,or law.
the dissent inference of waiver from the goffs failure to withdraw from the arbitration is likewise unsound.if a party disagrees with an arbitrator ruling on an issue early in the arbitration,the party need not walk out of the arbitration in order to preserve the issue for later review.the arbitration would presumably continue in the party absence,and it would make little sense for a party to run such a severe risk of prejudice merely to preserve an argument for later presentation to a court,which might reject the argument on the merits or refuse to consider it on the merits at all.again,the dissent cites no authority for the exceptionally harsh waiver rule that it applies here,and we are aware of none.united firefighters of los angeles city of los angeles d,when a court enters an order compelling arbitration,the party resisting arbitration does not waive his right to attack the order by proceeding to arbitration the order is reviewable on appeal from a judgment confirming the award,quoting witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.
second,the dissent reasons that it would be unfair to permit the goffs to change course at whim because the goffs sometimes treated the award as binding,and at other times as nonbinding,misleading the firm and the arbitrators,and also because b y blowing hot and cold the goffs left the firm in a state of uncertainty.dis.opn.at,post.we disagree.the only time the goffs changed course was at the very beginning,when they first insisted on nonbinding arbitration.before the identities of the arbitrators were known,the goffs asked for binding arbitration,but the firm declined and insisted that the arbitration be nonbinding.after the identities of the arbitrators were revealed,the firm switched its position and wanted binding arbitration.the goffs,presumably seeing the firm change of heart as a red flag,switched their position too and insisted on nonbinding arbitration which they had every right to do,because the parties had never agreed to make the arbitration binding.since then,everything the goffs have done has been consistent with their position that the arbitration was nonbinding.when the firm asked the arbitrators to decide the issue of bindingness,the goffs contended that the arbitration was nonbinding.when the arbitrators ruled in favor of the firm,the goffs had no choice but to proceed with the arbitration and raise their objections at an appropriate time in court.when the arbitrators offered to make the arbitration nonbinding in exchange for the goffs agreement to a continuance,the goffs rejection of the offer was fully consistent with their position that they had an unfettered right to nonbinding arbitration and should not have to agree to a continuance or anything else in order to exercise it.the arbitrators issued their award on june,and the goffs had days from notice of the award to file a petition to vacate.the firm beat them to it by filing a petition to confirm on july,so the goffs raised their objections to the award in their timely opposition to the firm petition.none of this amounts to changing course at whim,blowing hot and cold,or sometimes treating the arbitration as binding and at other times as nonbinding.on the contrary,ever since their first insistence on nonbinding arbitration which was occasioned by the firm own change of position,the goffs have acted consistently,reasonably,and sufficiently expeditiously to preserve and assert their right to nonbinding arbitration 
for all of the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the firm waiver and forfeiture arguments lack merit.
disposition 
the judgment is reversed and the trial court is directed to enter an order vacating the arbitration award,declaring the award to be nonbinding,and granting the goffs days from service of the order in which to request a trial after arbitration.appellants shall recover their costs of appeal.
the majority asks,c an a court treat an arbitration award as binding and hence unreviewable solely on the grounds that the arbitrator both ruled it is binding and had authority to rule on that issue opn.ante,at.as this division held in greenspan ladt,llc th greenspan,the parties may submit to arbitration issues they were not contractually compelled to submit to arbitration,and the arbitrator ruling on such issues is not reviewable by any court.yet,ignoring greenspan and the very limited exclusive statutory grounds for review of code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,the majority holds otherwise.
in their briefs,appellants the goffs concede they submitted the question to the arbitrator the goffs do not contend that the panel did not have the authority to make a ruling on the issue of whether the arbitration was binding.capitals boldface omitted.the majority asserts that while the arbitrator could decide that question,his decision on this was nonetheless reviewable,and is reviewable as a matter of law in every case.however,pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,the grounds for review of an arbitrator ruling are exclusively limited to causes or events that are extrinsic to the process itself.these include bias corruption fraud misconduct of the arbitrator lack of a continuance failure to disclose grounds for disqualification of an arbitrator the arbitrators exceeded their powers the arbitrators refused to hear evidence material to the controversy.code civ,subd.a.these grants of judicial review are necessary to prevent structural error in the process and to preserve the integrity of the process and protect the rights of the parties to the benefit of their bargain,namely,a fair and neutral arbitration.
however,as here,where the parties have voluntarily submitted the issue to the arbitrator and there is no evidence of factors extrinsic to the process that have corrupted it,the courts have no role in overturning that award.in distinguishing greenspan,supra,th and relying on the inapposite precedent of trabuco highlands community association head th trabuco,the majority strains to announce a new rule of law devoid of jurisprudential basis,and which as a result has no utility within the framework of california law.the majority new rule makes a mockery of the arbitration process,undermines the basic principles of severely limited judicial review of matters parties have agreed to submit to arbitration,and ignores countless decades of california jurisprudence that the rulings of arbitrators are reviewable only in very limited circumstances.
the determination of the proper standard of review of the panel decision is key to understanding the limits of our power.in determining whether arbitrators have exceeded their powers,a court must give substantial deference to the arbitrators own assessments of their contractual authority advanced micro devices,intel cal th.however,except where the parties have conferred upon the arbiter the unusual power of determining his own jurisdiction citation,the courts retain the ultimate authority to overturn awards as beyond the arbitrator powers,whether for an unauthorized remedy or decision on an unsubmitted issue.id.at.thus,in determining whether an arbitrator exceeded his powers,we review the trial court decision de novo,yet we give substantial deference to the arbitrator own assessment of his contractual authority.id.at,fn.we accept the trial court findings of fact if substantial evidence supports them,and we must draw every reasonable inference to support the arbitrator ruling.luster collins th.
the backbone of arbitration law in california is the concept of contract.once parties agree to arbitrate an issue,it is insulated from review except in very rare instances where a court will intervene to prevent structural errors in the process.in moncharsh heily blase cal th moncharsh,our supreme court made it clear that the grounds for judicial review of a contractual arbitration award are extremely limited.under moncharsh,we can not review the merits of the controversy,the arbitrator reasoning,or the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the award.id.at.even an error of law apparent on the face of the award that causes substantial injustice does not provide grounds for judicial review.id.at.
code of civil procedure sections and provide the only grounds for challenging an arbitration award.moncharsh,supra,cal th at.code of civil procedure section,subdivision a provides that an arbitration award may be vacated where the arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision the rationale is that the arbitrator powers derive from and are limited by the agreement to arbitrate,and awards in excess of those powers may be corrected by the court.bak mcl financial group,th.
moncharsh explained because the decision to arbitrate grievances evinces the parties intent to bypass the judicial system and thus avoid potential delays at the trial and appellate levels,arbitral finality is a core component of the parties agreement to submit to arbitration.thus,an arbitration decision is final and conclusive because the parties have agreed that it be so.by ensuring that an arbitrator decision is final and binding,courts simply assure that the parties receive the benefit of their bargain.cal th at.further,because arbitrators are often not bound by the same rules of law and evidence as the trial court,judicial review is of questionable value.parties who stipulate in an agreement that controversies that may arise out of it shall be settled by arbitration,may expect not only to reap the advantages that flow from the use of that nontechnical,summary procedure,but also to find themselves bound by an award reached by paths neither marked nor traceable and not subject to judicial review.case alperson d.
in addition,where the parties have contracted to resolve their dispute by arbitration,their agreement contemplates that the arbitration will have the power to decide any question of historical fact,contract interpretation,or general law,in the arbitrator understanding of the case,to reach a decision.cable connection,directv,cal th,cable connection.inherent in that power is the possibility the arbitrator may err in deciding some aspect of the case.arbitrators do not ordinarily exceed their contractually created powers simply by reaching an erroneous conclusion on a contested issue of law or fact.ibid.indeed,a contrary holding would permit the exception to swallow the rule of limited judicial review a litigant could always contend the arbitrator erred and thus exceeded his powers.moncharsh,supra,cal th at,accord,pearson dental supplies,superior court cal th,pearson dental.to take themselves out of the general rule that the merits of the award are not subject to judicial review,the parties must clearly agree that legal errors are an excess of arbitral authority and is reviewable by the courts.in such case,the parties may so deprive the arbitrator of the power to commit legal error.cable connection,supra,cal th at.
on the other hand,the deference due an arbitrator decision on the merits of the controversy requires a court to refrain from substituting its judgment for the arbitrator in determining the contractual scope of those powers.citations.giving substantial deference to the arbitrators own assessments of their contractual authority is consistent with the general rule of arbitral finality advanced micro devices intel,supra,cal th at.thus,a ny doubts about the arbitrator power to decide issues must be resolved in his favor.citation.roehl ritchie th.in sum,in the absence of more specific restrictions in the arbitration agreement,the submission or the rules of arbitration,the remedy an arbitrator fashions does not exceed his or her powers if it bears a rational relationship to the underlying contract as interpreted,expressly or impliedly,by the arbitrator and to the breach of contract found,expressly or impliedly,by the arbitrator.advanced micro devices,at.
the narrower question of whether the parties here agreed to binding arbitration is similarly decided under principles of contract law.there must be a voluntary agreement to arbitrate the dispute adajar rwr homes,th,and the existence of such an agreement is determined under standard rules of contract interpretation.mitchell american fair credit th.an agreement to arbitrate may be implied by conduct,and even in the absence of a party agreement to arbitrate,a party who voluntarily submits to arbitration and pursues the matter to an award can not switch course and contend the award exceeds the arbitrator authority.environmental barrier slurry systems,cir.
unless the parties unambiguously provide otherwise,the question of whether they agreed to arbitrate a dispute is to be decided by the court,not the arbitrator.bouton usaa casualty ins.cal th,code civ.however,the parties may confer by agreement such power upon the arbitrator.patchett bergamot station,th,howsam dean witter reynolds.if the parties agreed the arbitrator would decide such questions,the court must defer to the arbitrator decision in that regard.first options of chicago,kaplan,d.if,however,the parties did not submit the arbitrability issue to the arbitrator,courts may decide the question de novo in proceedings to vacate the award.ibid.
as we previously held in greenspan,the parties may submit to the arbitrator issues they were not contractually compelled to submit,and in such event,we look to the contract and the scope of submissions to determine the arbitrator authority.greenspan,supra,th at.arbitration submissions are generally broadly construed,and an arbitrator is authorized to determine all questions which he needs to determine in order to resolve the controversy submitted to him,and the arbitrator decides which questions need to be determined.ibid.the question of whether the parties have submitted a particular issue to the arbitrator is an issue for judicial determination unless the parties otherwise agree.id.at.we will not assume the parties agreed to arbitrate unless there is clear and unmistakable evidence they did so.ibid.
in determining the scope of the parties agreement,such agreement may include the rules under which the parties agreed to arbitrate.greenspan,supra,th at.thus,where the parties arbitration agreement incorporated american arbitration association aaa rules in their agreement,and such rules provided the arbitrator would have the power to rule on his or her jurisdiction,such parties clearly evidenced their intention to accord the arbitrator the authority to determine issues of arbitrability.rodriguez american technologies,th.
the mandatory fee arbitration act mfaa bus,et,under which the parties arbitrated the dispute here,is a distinct arbitration scheme governing fee disputes.in contrast with the california arbitration act caa,the mfaa has its own rules and limitations.the mfaa is a closed system and the arbitration is conducted by a local bar association under the mfaa,not a private alternative dispute resolution service provided in another forum.alternative systems,carey th.the mfaa applies only to disputes concerning legal fees,costs or both and is inapplicable to other claims for affirmative relief.bus,subd.a,b.in contrast,any other type of civil dispute may be resolved by the caa.code civ.
as explained in aguilar lerner cal th,t he nature of the obligation to arbitrate under the mfaa differs from that under standard arbitration in two important ways.first,the obligation to arbitrate under the mfaa is based upon a statutory directive and not the parties agreement.thus,a client may invoke the mfaa and proceed to arbitration despite the absence of any prior agreement to do so.by contrast,standard arbitration requires that both parties to a dispute agree to arbitrate.id.at.further,pursuant to the mfaa,arbitration is voluntary for the client but mandatory for an attorney if the client commences the arbitration.bus,subd.c.in other words,whereas a client can not be forced under the mfaa to arbitrate a dispute concerning legal fees,at the client election an unwilling attorney can be forced to do so.aguilar,at.
there is no dispute the goffs consented to the panel authority to rule on the issue whether the arbitration would be binding.in selecting los angeles county bar association lacba dispute resolution services,drs as the forum for the mfaa arbitration a selection the goffs had the unilateral right to impose on respondent the firm pursuant the mfaa the goffs consented to be bound by its rules of procedure.these rules of procedure became part of the agreement to arbitrate,and defined the scope of the panel power.pursuant to drs rule c the panel had the power to determine its own jurisdiction,and it was pursuant to that power that the panel decided the arbitration would in fact be binding.thus,because the parties agreed to incorporate this rule into their agreement,there is unmistakable evidence they agreed to submit the binding issue to the panel.see,patchett bergamot station,supra,th at trial court properly confirmed arbitration award notwithstanding contention arbitrator exceeded his powers where arbitration clause authorized arbitrator to determine arbitrability of any claim.we must accord great deference to this finding within the scope of the panel authority 
thus,to the extent the goffs argue they never agreed to binding arbitration under principles of basic hornbook contract law,this argument becomes irrelevant where,as here,they consented to the panel authority on this issue.first,the issue of deciding whether they in fact consented to binding arbitration was submitted to the arbitrator,who applied principles of contract law and the drs rules in concluding the arbitration would be binding.the panel found the goffs original election of binding arbitration was an offer that was accepted by the firm.
the fact the panel ruling may have been contrary to hornbook contract law,pursuant to which the firm election of nonbinding arbitration had the effect of rejecting the goffs initial offer of binding arbitration,does not permit or mandate our interference.we are without the power to review the panel ruling.as a result,the goffs argument is nothing more than an attack on the arbitrator reasoning or,at best,an assertion of an error of law apparent on the face of the award.creative plastering,hedley builders,th.therefore,although the goffs attempt to characterize the panel actions as in excess of its powers,they are incorrect.there is no question the arbitrator had the power to decide the binding nature of the arbitration,because the parties expressly granted the panel that power.
nonetheless,the majority relies on trabuco for the proposition that the arbitration award is subject to judicial review because the panels legally erroneous ruling represents a type of structural error going to the integrity of the arbitration process itself.in trabuco,the court stated,independent judicial review of whether an arbitration is binding is necessary to preserve the integrity of the arbitration process and the judicial system.trabuco,supra,th at.a true statement of the law,but the majority applies trabuco to a factual situation where it simply doesnot apply.
in trabuco,the defendants owned a home in a subdivision subject to the conditions,covenants and restrictions cc rs in favor of the plaintiff homeowners association.a dispute arose over amounts due the homeowners association,and the parties agreed in writing they would submit the dispute to nonbinding arbitration.after the arbitration,the arbitrator issued a binding arbitration award and decision in the homeowners association favor.trabuco,supra,th at.
approximately two months later,the defendant homeowners attended an association meeting where they took the position the award was nonbinding the association asserted the award was binding,and a month later,filed a petition to confirm the award.trabuco,supra,th at.the petition alleged that the homeowners contacted the arbitrator for clarification,and the arbitrator asked for input from the parties.the association submitted a letter to the arbitrator in which it asserted at the outset of the arbitration the parties agreed to binding arbitration.the defendants did not respond.the arbitrator issued a letter indicating his notes of the arbitration proceedings conformed to the association view,and that the parties had agreed to seek a final resolution of the dispute.the arbitrator ruled the proceeding was binding.ibid.
in response to the petition,the defendants requested the court to vacate the award on the grounds it was procured by fraud and exceeded the arbitrator authority.one of the homeowners asserted that although she has expressed her desire to put the whole ugly dispute behind her and would be relieved when the dispute was finally resolved,she never agreed to make the arbitration binding.the association replied with the arbitrator letter,and a declaration from its attorney in which he stated he was present at the arbitration and the defendants agreed to make the arbitration binding.trabuco,supra,th at.
at the hearing on the petition,the court did not take any testimony,stating it done by declaration.the defendants pointed out it was a letter,not a declaration,but the court replied that i accepting it for what it says to the court,and for you,that he the arbitrator,and it is binding your client defendants sat on it.did nothing.let the time go by.if it were not binding,and she did like the award,she still had her remedies.did do anything.the court confirmed the award.trabuco,supra,th at.
trabuco held that although the trial court might properly have found the arbitration was binding,it reached its result by an impermissible means and the case must be reversed and remanded to properly determine whether the defendants agreed to binding arbitration.trabuco,supra,th at.because it relied on the letter of the arbitrator,the trial court abdicated its function to determine whether the arbitrator exceeded his powers in a most fundamental way by issuing a binding award after the parties agreed only to nonbinding arbitration.id.at.
contrary to the majority reasoning,trabuco does not stand for the proposition that we may correct every error of law in an arbitrator determination of whether an arbitration is binding.rather,it stands for the proposition that if an arbitrator exceeds his or her authority the scope of the parties contractual agreement by determining the arbitration was binding,the arbitrator decision is subject to judicial review.if the arbitrator has exceeded his or her authority in deciding that issue,the error is indeed structural.
trabuco is factually distinguishable from the case before us and illustrates the flaw in the majority reasoning.neither party in trabuco consented to the arbitrator deciding whether the arbitration was binding.rather,the arbitrator unilaterally and without the parties agreement decided this issue at the conclusion of the arbitration.as such,the arbitrator actions were in excess of the authority conferred upon him by the parties agreement and was therefore subject to vacation pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.here,the panel decision was part of the arbitral process itself a premerit decision,consented to by the parties,and thus was not extrinsic to the process.code civ,subd.a.on the central issue of decision,the facts in this case could not be farther from those in trabuco.
the majority,in broadly reading trabuco for a proposition it did not decide and ignoring the statutory basis of trabuco in code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,has created a new rule of law.in the absence of fraud,bias,or other extrinsic error,there is no grounds for judicial review for issues the parties consented to submit to an arbitrator.such is the case here,therefore,we are squarely within the strictures of code of civil procedure section,subdivision a and greenspan,supra th,and easily distinguishable from trabuco.
finally,the majority engages in a logical fallacy of circular reasoning.according to the majority although the goffs submitted the issue to the arbitrator,because the arbitration was nonbinding,the arbitrator could not issue a binding ruling that it was binding.this conclusion diminishes the arbitration process itself.the majority strips the process as properly defined the by agreement of the parties of any meaning by concluding an authorized decision nonetheless has no effect.the result is a new rule of law creating a loophole in judicial review of arbitration that is based upon an idle act.
whether the arbitration was to be binding was precisely the issue to be decided,and in consenting to submit the issue to the arbitrator,the parties ceded the authority to the arbitrator to change the nature of the proceedings,putting this case squarely within greenspan,supra,th 
the majority finds my conclusion the panel decision on the issue of whether the arbitration was binding constitutes impermissible bootstrapping because it means that the arbitrators determination is binding because the parties agreed to be bound by it,and we know that parties agreed to be bound by it because the arbitrators determined that the parties agreed to be bound by it,and that determination is binding because opn.ante,at.
the majority reasoning illustrates how the majority mischaracterizes greenspan.we do not ascribe cause and effect in the fashion the majority argues rather,we conclude the parties are bound by the arbitrator decision on whether they had agreed to binding arbitration not because that was what the arbitrator found after the fact,but because they submitted the issue to the arbitrator in the first instance and before the arbitrator made any finding on the issue.why have a nonbinding determination that the arbitration is binding or nonbinding when it is already nonbinding the submission of the issue to the arbitrator would be an idle act.
the majority states,a lthough the issue of bindingness is undisputedly within the scope of the issues that the arbitrators were authorized to decide,it does not follow that the arbitrators had authority to bind the parties or equivalently,to make unreviewable rulings on that issue or any other.even in a nonbinding arbitration,the parties are free to authorize the arbitrators to rule on any issue the parties choose,including bindingness or other jurisdictional issues rather,the parties may agree that the arbitrators ruling on bindingness and every other issue within the scope of their authority shall be nonbinding.opn.ante,at.
this logical nonsequitur violates our prior decision in greenspan because if the arbitration panel had the authority to decide whether the award was binding,then its determination on that issue is not reviewable by a court unless the parties also explicitly and unambiguously agreed that such a ruling could be reviewed for errors of law.see greenspan,supra,th at.
the majority further states,arbitrators in a nonbinding arbitration exceed their powers by purporting to issue a binding award.trabuco,supra,th at,fn.see also id.at the arbitrator exceed s his powers in a most fundamental way by issuing a binding award after the parties agreed only to nonbinding arbitration.therefore,if a party seeks to vacate or opposes confirmation of an arbitration award on the ground that the parties never agreed to make the arbitration binding,then,in order to determine whether the arbitrators exceeded their powers under subdivision a of code of civil procedure section,the court hearing the petition must independently review whether the parties agreed to be bound.opn.ante,at.
again,the majority assumes its conclusion that because the arbitration was nonbinding,the arbitrator conclusion was reviewable the arbitrator exceed s his powers in a most fundamental way by issuing a binding award after the parties agreed only to nonbinding arbitration.but whether the arbitration would be binding was the precise question to be addressed by the panel whether the parties had agreed to binding or nonbinding arbitration.
the majority continues,if the parties have not agreed to binding arbitration,then there is no justification for channeling their dispute into the system of extremely limited judicial review that is applicable to parties who have agreed to it.opn.ante,at.
the majority engages again in faulty reasoning by assuming the conclusion.the predicate of the majority argument,namely,if the parties have not agreed to binding arbitration,is precisely the issue the parties sought to have decided by the arbitrator.thus,the conclusion the majority draws from this premise,namely judicial review is appropriate,is not valid.opn.ante,at.
in summary,the majority attempt to distinguish greenspan is futile.we agree mfaa arbitrations may be nonbinding at the request of a party and do not involve a predispute arbitration agreement,but rather proceed under a statutory scheme.however,here the parties acquiesced to the arbitrator deciding the issue of whether the arbitration should proceed as binding or nonbinding based upon the sequence of events leading up to the panel decision in that regard.as greenspan held,the scope of the arbitrator power derives from the parties agreement,and may include not only a predispute agreement to arbitrate or,in the case of a mfaa arbitration,the statutory scheme and lacba rules but any other matters the parties agree to submit to the arbitrator.greenspan,supra,th at.here,the goffs do not contest,and the majority concedes,that the arbitrator had the authority to determine whether the arbitration would be binding.as a consequence,this dispute remains squarely within greenspan.
i would also affirm the trial court finding the goffs waived any contention they did not agree to binding arbitration.waiver is the relinquishment of a known right,but can also refer to loss of a right as a result of a party failure to perform an act it is required to perform.agnes medical center pacificare of california cal th,fn.there is no singular determinative test of waiver,which may be express or implied from conduct that indicates an intent to relinquish the right.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th.a party to an arbitration who has knowledge of irregularity in the proceedings can not sit by and take part in the proceedings and later object on the basis of the irregularity such party waives any objection on account of such irregularity for he can not thus take the chance of a favorable outcome.blatt farley d.

the course of this fee dispute demonstrates the goffs have waived at numerous junctures any right to contest the panel finding.
first,at the outset of the process,the goffs did not object to the firm request to the panel to determine whether the parties had agreed to binding arbitration,nor did they contest the panel finding in this regard during the three months between reuben december,letter and the commencement of the arbitration on march,instead,the goffs proceeded in the arbitration.if the goffs believed the arbitration should have been nonbinding,they had numerous grounds on which to object.as the client,they had the right to control the initiation of an mfaa arbitration,which provided them a statutory right to nonbinding arbitration,unless all parties agreed otherwise and they could have objected to the panel december,finding on the grounds of drs rule d and pursuant to state bar advisory and withdrawn from the arbitration.this they did not do.instead,they continued with the fee arbitration.
second,after the award was rendered,if the goffs believed in spite of the panel ruling the arbitration was nonetheless nonbinding,they should have proceeded to apply,within days after the panel conclusion,for a trial de novo under drs rule.see also bus,subd.b.we reject any claim that moving under drs rule to seek a trial de novo would have been a futile act.not only would moving promptly to assert their claim have avoided needless time and additional expense,their failure to seek review is evidence of waiver.
the majority asserts that because the award mistakenly purported to be binding,the parties could not have challenged it under business and professions code sections,subdivision b and,subdivision a because those rules apply to nonbinding awards,and the award stated it was binding hence,the goffs would have assumed they were powerless to challenge the award,rendering any attempt to set aside the award or request a trial de novo futile.however,these rules apply if the parties to the arbitration have not agreed in writing to be bound and i n the absence of an agreement to be bound.bus,subd.b,subd a.but that was precisely the goffs position though disingenuous,it appears they had never agreed to be bound,and were in a similar position as the parties in trabuco,supra,th,who had never agreed to be bound.as we have discussed,trabuco simply does not apply because the arbitrator here made no post hoc determination that the arbitration was binding.
trabuco does not compel a different result on the issue of waiver by failing to request a trial de novo.trabuco found the defendant homeowners,who had not moved for a trial de novo,had not waived the right to object to the arbitrator actions in excess of his authority.after noting that parties must raise certain issues at arbitration or waive later review,the court stated o ne can not raise an issue about which one is not and can not be aware.the homeowners could not be expected to raise with the arbitrator the arbitrator characterization of the arbitration as binding.trabuco,supra,th at.here,in contrast,the goffs can not claim they were unaware of the right to nonbinding arbitration they initially asserted.on the contrary,there was nothing after the fact.they did not enter the arbitration believing both parties had agreed to nonbinding arbitration rather,they were aware the panel had ruled,over the goffs assertions to the contrary,the arbitration was binding.
third,the trial court found the goffs assented to the arbitration proceeding as binding by their conduct during the arbitration when they turned down the panel offer to make the arbitration nonbinding in exchange for agreeing to a continu
