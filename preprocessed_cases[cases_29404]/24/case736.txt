the plaintiffs appeal from an order confirming a decision by an arbitration panel that denied the plaintiffs all the relief they had sought.the plaintiffs are a securities and a life insurance company,both owned by american express and both members of the national association of securities dealers the insurance company sells variable annuities,which are considered securities.the defendants are that compete with the plaintiffs.they also belong to the nasd and are affiliated with insurance companies that sell variable annuities and compete with the plaintiff insurance company,ids.the plaintiffs charge that beginning in the defendants tortiously interfered with the plaintiffs contracts with their broker employees,for example by falsely representing to the brokers that the covenants not to compete that the brokers had agreed to in their contracts with the plaintiffs were unenforceable.in the plaintiffs brought this suit against the defendants and other parties,not before us on this appeal for tortious interference with contract,basing federal jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship.the defendants demanded arbitration,citing rules of the nasd that require members to arbitrate any dispute arising out of the employment with any member,with the exception of disputes involving the insurance business of any member which is also an insurance company.
at the defendants behest,the district court stayed the suit while the parties arbitrated.after preliminary skirmishes discussed in our opinions in ids life ins.sunamerica,cir,and,cir,and in several unpublished orders,the arbitration was conducted in sessions over a period of months beginning in january of,resulting in an award so incomprehensible that three years later the judges and the parties are still trying to figure it out.
the plaintiffs sought from the arbitrators an injunction against the defendants raiding the plaintiffs brokers,and damages for loss of business caused by the previous raids.the defendants sought a declaration that the covenants not to compete in the plaintiffs contracts with their brokers were unenforceable.in may of the arbitrators rendered their decision.they denied all the requests of the parties for relief but stated that where the respondents the plaintiffs in the district court,the two american express companies are concerned,all actions of the panel pertain only to the firm.no contentions pertaining specifically to ids life insurance company were presented to the panel.
the plaintiffs asked the district court to vacate the panel award on the ground that the arbitrators had so imperfectly executed their powers that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.this is one of the grounds on which the federal arbitration act,which is applicable to this arbitration because the parties dispute arises out of a contract that evidences a transaction involving commerce,see southland keating,d,authorizes the vacation of an arbitral decision.a commonwealth coatings continental casualty,d flender,cir eljer,kowin development,cir.persuaded that the arbitral award was incomplete,the district judge in february of remanded the case to the arbitrators,who in june of that year responded that the second sentence that we quoted from the award no contentions pertaining specifically to ids life insurance company were presented to the panel was intended to have been the basis of the first sentence about the panel actions pertaining only to the affiliate.they added the panel gave full consideration to all issues and claims presented to it.when read in its entirety,our award encompasses all of the parties to this action as filed and the list that follows includes ids life insurance company.
the plaintiffs again asked the district court to vacate the arbitrators award as incomplete.they pointed out that the award says nothing about ids damages claims,and in addition they argued that the award is internally inconsistent because it denies relief to the plaintiffs while refusing to hold that the covenants not to compete,on which the plaintiffs claim of tortious interference is based,are unenforceable.if they were unenforceable,soliciting the plaintiffs employees to break them would not be tortious interference with contract there would be nothing to break.the plaintiffs also argued that ids claims were not arbitrable,because it is an insurance company and its claims involve the insurance business.the district court rejected these arguments and confirmed the award,precipitating this appeal by the plaintiffs,who also appeal from the denial of their motion for sanctions,an issue we defer to the end of this opinion.
we sympathize with the plaintiffs dissatisfaction with the arbitrators response to the direction to clarify their award.the response is unclear,and its lack of clarity is of a piece with their response to previous requests for clarification.see at.the plaintiffs point us to portions of the arbitration record which suggest that the arbitrators lacked the professional competence required to resolve the parties disputes.the length of the arbitration hearing separate sessions over a period of months that followed two years of prehearing preparation,a recent overhaul by the nasd of its arbitration procedures,and the inarticulateness and unresponsiveness of the arbitrators,give color and substance to the plaintiffs criticisms.
but the grounds for challenging an arbitration award are narrowly limited,reflecting the voluntary contractual nature of commercial arbitration.within exceedingly broad limits,the parties to an arbitration agreement choose their method of dispute resolution and are bound by it however bad their choice appears to be either ex ante or ex post.baravati josephthal,lyon ross,cir chicago typographical union chicago,cir merit ins.leatherby ins,cir uhc management computer sciences,cir ford nylcare health plans,cir davis prudential securities,cir.the plaintiffs did not have to join the nasd though they could not become without doing so by choosing to do so they became contractually bound by the association rules governing the resolution of employment disputes.austin american association of neurological surgeons,cir.they point to nothing in the rules that gave them a contractual right to insist on arbitrators abler,swifter,or more articulate than the ones they got.they point to nothing that entitles us to scour the record for signs of arbitral incompetence.the grounds on which the plaintiffs can attack the award are limited to those set forth in the federal arbitration act.the plaintiffs wisely do not invoke the controversial nonstatutory ground,manifest disregard of the law,which we have limited to the situation in which the arbitral award directs the parties to violate the law.george watts son,tiffany,cir.unless there is a specific ground for vacating an award,it must be confirmed.menke monchecourt,cir smiga dean witter reynolds,cir taylor nelson,cir.
the only ground pertinent to this case is the one we quoted earlier,that the arbitrators so imperfectly executed their powers that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.we take mutual and final to mean that the arbitrators must have resolved the entire dispute to the extent arbitrable that had been submitted to them,dreis krump international ass of machinists aerospace workers,cir fradella petricca,cir,and definite to mean much as in the case of injunctions.d that the award is sufficiently clear and specific to be enforced should it be confirmed by the district court and thus made judicially enforceable.flender,supra,at diapulse of america carba,cir.we note parenthetically that some cases deem an arbitral award final if it finally resolves a separate claim,or the liability of a particular party,even if other claims or other parties remain before the arbitrators.publicis communication true north communications,cir hart surgical,ultracision,cir.these cases create a regime that is similar to the one that.b creates for federal litigation,yet is in tension with the absence from the federal arbitration act of any counterpart to that rule.but it is not a tension t
