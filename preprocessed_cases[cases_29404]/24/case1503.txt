petitioner,a builder of homes,challenges the trial court denial of its motion to compel judicial reference of the underlying construction defect action brought against it by homebuyers.the trial court refused to enforce a clause in home purchase contracts requiring homebuyers who sue petitioner to submit the dispute to judicial reference on the ground the clause is unconscionable.in contrast to the trial court,we find the provision enforceable and grant the relief petitioner seeks.
statement of facts 
petitioner trend homes,trend constructed homes in a fresno development.real parties in interest own six homes within that development real parties,along with other individuals who own other homes within the development,filed suit against trend and robert mccaffrey who the plaintiffs allege is trend majority shareholder,officer and responsible managing officer to recover damages allegedly suffered due to defective construction of their homes 
the standard purchase and sale agreements between trend and real parties contain a paragraph entitled judicial reference the provision.the provision requires any civil action involving a dispute arising out of the agreement to be heard by a single judicial referee pursuant to code of civil procedure sections through the parties are to use their best efforts to agree on the selection of the referee,but if they are unable to do so,either party can seek to have a referee appointed under sections and.the parties further agree the referee will decide all issues of fact and law,and issue a statement of decision.
in reliance on the provision,trend moved to compel a reference with respect to real parties claims,as they are the only plaintiffs who have contracts with trend that contain the provision.trend represented the judicial reference would be for purposes of trial on the facts or law only,including summary judgment motions,and all of the parties would stipulate to the appointment of a special master,who would supervise the case management and settlement conference process,including the real parties claims.
real parties objected,arguing the provision should not be enforced because it is unconscionable and its enforcement could result in a multiplicity of actions.real parties each submitted a declaration as part of their opposition.nine of the real parties asserted they were first time homeowners.all of the real parties declared that when they signed the paperwork to buy their homes,the judicial reference clause which trend is trying to enforce was never explained to them,trend never told them the clause was negotiable or could be stricken from the home purchase contract,and they had no idea they were exposed,under this clause,to the payment of judicial reference fees in an indeterminate amount.real parties also each stated they could not afford this and probably will not go forward if they had to pay a referee.in addition,real parties counsel submitted a declaration in which he stated that fees for an experienced mediator can run from to per hour,which he believed would also apply to a judicial reference,and the reference fees for a proceeding could easily total or more.
following oral argument on the motion,the trial court adopted its tentative decision denying the motion.the trial court concluded the agreements were contracts of adhesion and the provision was unconscionable.trend sought a writ of review,which we issued to consider trend contentions on the merits.
discussion 
the provision at issue here requires judicial reference of real parties claims as provided in sections through.judicial reference involves sending a pending trial court action to a referee for hearing,determination and a report back to the court.sy first family.partnership cheung th,d sy jovine fhp,th,d.a general reference occurs when the court,with the parties consent,directs a referee to try all of the issues in the action.sy,supra,th at,d.the court appoints the referee,although the parties may chose the referee by agreement.the hearing before a referee is conducted in the same manner as it would be before a court under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings.citations.sy,supra,th at,d.in a general reference,the referee must prepare a statement of decision which stands as the decision of the court and is reviewable in the same manner as if the court had rendered it.citations.sy,supra,th at,d.thus,the primary effect of the provision is to require trial by a referee,as opposed to the court or a jury.
here,the trial court refused to enforce the provision on the ground it is unconscionable.the validity and enforceability of a judicial reference provision in a home purchase contract must be determined on a basis.greenbriar homes communities,superior court th,d greenbriar woodside homes of california,superior court th,d woodside pardee construction superior court th,d pardee.accordingly,appellate courts have reached different conclusions regarding the enforceability of judicial reference provisions in home purchase contracts due to unconscionability,with division of the fourth district finding such a provision unenforceable in pardee,while division of the fourth district and the third district both have found such a provision enforceable in woodside and greenbriar respectively.naturally,real parties contend we should follow pardee,while trend contends woodside and greenbriar control.since the provision enforceability depends on the facts before us,we look to each of these cases for guidance and conclude,based on this record,that the provision is not unconscionable and therefore must be enforced.
although the doctrine of unconscionability was judicially created citation,civil code section now provides a statutory basis for refusing to enforce a contract which the court finds as a matter of law to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the crucial term,unconscionable,is not defined,but the law has clearly established that the term has both a procedural and a substantive element.the former takes into consideration the parties relative bargaining strength and the extent to which a provision is hidden or unexpected,while the substantive element requires terms that shock the conscience or at the least may be described as harsh or oppressive.citation.both elements must be present,but the more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.citation.woodside,supra,th at,d.
as further explained in woodside,i t has been held that the party who prepared and submitted a contract containing unexpected or harsh terms has the burden of showing that the other party had notice of them citation,but also that the party asserting unconscionability as a defense has the burden of establishing that condition.citation.woodside,supra,th at,d.
the provision at issue here appears in standardized sale agreements.the provision,paragraph of the agreement,is entirely capitalized.it appears on page eight of the agreement,and reads in full 
judicial reference.
a the parties agree that in any civil action or proceeding involving a dispute arising out of or relating to this agreement,the action or proceeding shall be heard by a judicial reference as provided in california code of civil procedure sections through.disputes arising out of this agreement include,without limitation,the design,planning,engineering,testing,surveying,and construction of improvements to the property and the disposition of buyer purchase money deposits.
b the parties agree to the appointment of a single referee and shall use their best efforts to agree on the selection of the referee.if the parties are unable to agree upon a referee within ten calendar days of a written request to do so by either party,either party may thereafter seek to have a referee appointed under california code of civil procedure sections and.
c the parties agree that the selected or appointed referee shall have the power to decide all issues in the action or proceeding,whether of fact or of law,and shall report a statement of decision thereon.
d by initialing the space below,each party waives any and all rights to a trial by jury for all civil actions or proceedings involving a dispute arising out of or relating to this agreement.
buyer initials seller initials unnecessary capitalization omitted further quotations of paragraph in this opinion will also omit unnecessary capitalization,emphasis in original.
the issue here is whether the provision is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.we will discuss each element in turn.
procedural unconscionability 
as explained above,the procedural element focuses on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power.little auto stiegler,cal th,d,little,quoting armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,armendariz.the oppression component arises from the inequality of the parties bargaining power and an absence of real negotiation or a meaningful choice on the weaker party part,while the surprise component comes into play when the terms to which the party supposedly agreed are hidden in a prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce them.citations.kinney united healthcare services,th,d.the procedural element generally takes the form of a contract of adhesion,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.armendariz,supra at d.little,supra,cal th at,d.a contract of adhesion is a standardized contract,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.citation.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.procedural unconscionability,however,may be present even if a contract is not adhesive.harper ultimo th,d.
here,the evidence does not support the conclusion the provision is procedurally unconscionable.first,the record does not support the trial court finding that the agreements are adhesive.real parties offered no evidence that they attempted to negotiate the provision and were rebuffed,or they had no meaningful choice but to agree to the provision.the only evidence real parties presented on this issue was their statements that they were never told the provision was negotiable or could be stricken.this does not establish,however,that trend would not have stricken the provision had real parties objected.notably,the seller was also required to initial the judicial reference provision,which supports the conclusion that the clause was negotiable.
in asserting the agreements are adhesive,real parties compare their situation to that of the homeowners in pardee.although the pardee court noted there was no specific evidence of adhesion,it nevertheless concluded the contracts were adhesive because the builder acknowledged that all homes in the development contained a judicial reference provision which no purchaser had stricken,which showed the plaintiffs had little choice but to sign the agreements as presented as potential buyers of the homes,the plaintiffs were unlikely to have significant economic bargaining power and the plaintiffs could not go elsewhere to buy a home because a home is unique.pardee,supra,th at,d.
in contrast here,trend did not concede that no buyer had stricken the provision,and there is no evidence the provision was included in every purchase agreement within the development or that trend denied any buyer request to strike the provision while most of the real parties were first time homebuyers,they offered no evidence that they lacked the education,experience,or sophistication necessary to understand the contracts.see,woodside,supra,th at,fn,d court refused to conclude purchasers of homes lacked education,experience or sophistication necessary to understand home purchase contracts merely from the price of the homes or the buyers ethnicity.real parties also did not state that they had insufficient time to read the provision,were pressured to sign it without reading it carefully,or were not afforded the opportunity to consult with anyone else,such as an attorney,before signing the agreement.
in addition,there was no evidence concerning the availability of similarly priced housing in the area.woodside,supra,th at,d noting lack of such evidence in concluding judicial reference provision was not procedurally unconscionable.real parties contend their agreements are adhesive even if they could have bought a home elsewhere,citing villa milano homeowners il davorge th,d,in which the court found a declaration of covenants,conditions and restrictions,which contained a binding arbitration clause covering construction and design defect claims,to be a contract of adhesion because the declaration was recorded before the homebuyers purchased their homes,thereby requiring them to purchase subject to the declaration or not purchase at all.in contrast here,real parties entered into the agreements at the time they purchased their homes,which gave them the opportunity to negotiate with respect to any provision contained in them.
there also is no element of surprise,since the provision is clearly written,entirely capitalized,and easily understood.although the provision is on the eighth page of the agreement,it could not be overlooked,since both the buyer and seller placed their initials immediately below the provision.this necessarily made real parties aware of the existence of the judicial reference provision because they had to initial the paragraph separately.wheeler joseph hospital d.wheeler.
real parties contend the provision should have been explained to them,citing wheeler,in which the court stated that when a contract is one of adhesion,conspicuousness and clarity of language alone may not be enough to satisfy the requirement of awareness.where a contractual provision would defeat the strong expectation of the weaker party,it may also be necessary to call his attention to the language of the provision.citation.and if the language of such provision is too complicated or subtle for an ordinary layman to understand,he should also be given a reasonable explanation of its implications.citations.wheeler,supra,d at.applying these principles,the wheeler court concluded hospital staff should have pointed out and explained the implications of an arbitration clause incorporated into its admission form to a patient who signed the form on his admission to the hospital.id.at.
we do not agree that the provision is too complicated or subtle for the ordinary person to understand so that it required trend to explain the provision.the provision clearly states that in the event of a civil action involving a dispute arising out of the agreement,the action will be heard by a judicial reference,cites the pertinent code of civil procedure sections that describe judicial reference,explains that only one referee will be appointed and what occurs if the parties can not agree on the referee,and states that the referee will have the power to decide all issues in the action.most importantly,the provision clearly states in bold print above the parties initials that each party waives any and all rights to a trial by jury for all civil actions or proceedings involving a dispute arising out of or relating to this agreement.thus,the most important aspect of judicial it does not involve a clearly and conspicuously set forth.see woodside,supra,th at,d.moreover,a home purchase does not involve the same concerns the wheeler court had about hospital admissions,which compelled it to find the arbitration provision should have been home buying may be stressful,it is not a traumatic experience like being admitted to the hospital,and no one is directing a home buyer to purchase a particular home like a doctor directs a patient to a particular hospital.see wheeler,supra,d at.
since there is no evidence of oppression and surprise,real parties have failed to show the provision is procedurally unconscionable.nevertheless,even if we assume an imbalance of bargaining power,that trend prepared the contracts as the stronger party to its own advantage,and trend would not have stricken the judicial reference provision if real parties had asked,real parties have s
