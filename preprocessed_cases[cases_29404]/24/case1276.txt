defendants and appellants mercedes benz financial services usa llc,formerly known as dcfs usa llc mercedes financial,and mission imports,doing business as mercedes benz of laguna niguel mission imports mercedes financial and mission imports are collectively referred to as defendants,appeal from an order denying their petitions to compel arbitration.defendants sought to compel plaintiff and respondent lee anne caron to arbitrate her claims based on an arbitration provision included in the retail installment sales contract she signed to purchase a preowned vehicle from mission imports.
finding itself bound by the recent decision in fisher dch temecula imports llc th,d fisher,the trial court ruled that the arbitration provision was unenforceable because it waived caron right to bring a class action under the consumers legal remedies act,et clra and the federal arbitration act et.faa did not preempt the clra prohibition against waivers.because it found the clra rendered the arbitration provision unenforceable,the trial court declined to rule on caron challenge that the arbitration provision was also unconscionable.
defendants argue the trial court erred because the faa preempts the clra prohibition against class action waivers and therefore the trial court could not rely on the clra as a ground for denying defendants petitions.based on the united state supreme court decision in at t mobility llc concepcion,d at t mobility,we agree the faa preempts the clra provision because the provision acts as an obstacle to the faa intention of enforcing arbitration agreements according to their terms.
consequently,we reverse the trial court order denying defendants petitions to compel arbitration and remand this matter for the trial court to consider caron unconscionability challenge.if the court finds any term unconscionable,it must also decide whether the term may be severed and the remainder of the arbitration provision enforced.
facts and procedural history 
in october,caron purchased a certified preowned mercedes benz vehicle from mission imports for approximately.the sales contract caron signed described the transaction terms and conditions.a few days later,caron returned to mission imports to purchase an extended warranty for the vehicle and mission imports had her sign a new sales contract that recalculated the amount financed.
approximately one month later,mission imports phoned caron to inform her mercedes financial would not finance her vehicle purchase unless she agreed to shorten the length of her installment contract.caron agreed and mission imports had her sign a third sales contract shortening the installment contract to months.mission imports backdated both of the later sales contracts caron signed to the original purchase date.mission imports assigned caron third and final sales contract to mercedes financial.
each sales contract caron signed included an identical arbitration provision on the back of the,agreement.in pertinent part,the arbitration provision stated.either you or we may choose to have any dispute between decided by arbitration and not in court or by jury trial.if a dispute is arbitrated,you will give up your right to participate as a class representative or class member on any class claim you may have against including any right to class arbitration or any consolidation of individual arbitrations.any claim or dispute,whether in contract,tort,statute or otherwise between you and us which arises out of or relates to your credit application,purchase or condition of this vehicle,this contract or any resulting transaction or relationship including any such relationship with third parties who do not sign this contract shall,at your or our election,be resolved by neutral,binding arbitration and not by a court action any claim or dispute is to be arbitrated by a single arbitrator on an individual basis and not as a class action.you expressly waive any right you may have to arbitrate a class action any arbitration under this arbitration clause shall be governed by the faa and not by any state law concerning arbitration.if any part of this arbitration clause,other than waivers of class action rights,is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason,the remainder shall remain enforceable.if a waiver of class action rights is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason in a case in which class action allegations have been made,the remainder or this arbitration clause shall be unenforceable.
after her purchase,caron experienced various difficulties with the vehicle and repeatedly returned it to mission imports for repairs.mission imports,however,could not repair the vehicle to caron satisfaction.in may,caron filed this action against mission imports,mercedes financial,and mercedes benz usa llc,alleging various class and individual claims under the clra,the automobile sales finance act,et,and the unfair competition law bus,et.she also alleged additional individual claims for false advertising,intentional and negligent misrepresentation,vehicle code violations,and song beverly consumer warranty act,et violations.
defendants separately petitioned to compel caron to arbitrate her individual claims and stay this action under the arbitration provision in the sales contracts.caron filed a consolidated opposition,arguing the class action waiver in the arbitration provision rendered the entire provision unenforceable.citing the recent opinion in fisher,caron argued the class action waiver was invalid because it required her to waive her statutory right to bring a class action under the clra.she asserted the arbitration provision itself contained a poison pill clause making the entire provision unenforceable if a court found the class action waiver invalid.caron also claimed the arbitration provision was unconscionable and defendants failed to properly authenticate the sales contract.in reply,defendants argued the faa preempted fisher and prohibited the trial court from invalidating the arbitration provision class action waiver.defendants also disputed that the arbitration provision was unconscionable and claimed they adequately authenticated the sales contract.
the trial court denied both petitions on the grounds that the faa does not preempt state law and under the clra,the arbitration provision is unenforceable as it requires plaintiff to waive her statutory rights to bring a class action in violation of the clra provision.the court further explained,the facts of this case are virtually identical to the facts in fisher which was decided only three months ago.while defendants argue that fisher was wrongly decided or at best incomplete,as it failed to take into consideration one or more supreme court decisions,it is not for this court to determine whether the court of appeal is right or wrong in its analysis.trial courts are still bound by the principle of stare decisis.because the invalid class action waiver extinguished the entire arbitration provision,the court also found the unconscionability issue was moot.nor did the court expressly rule on caron objection that defendants failed to adequately authenticate the sales contract.
defendants both timely appealed from the trial court order.
discussion 
caron contends we may affirm the trial court refusal to enforce the arbitration agreement on any one of three independent grounds defendants failed to adequately authenticate the sales contract containing the arbitration agreement and therefore failed to meet their burden to show the parties agreed to arbitrate caron claims the clra rule invalidated the arbitration provision waiver and the provision poison pill clause rendered the entire arbitration provision unenforceable and the arbitration provision is unconscionable.
defendants adequately authenticated the parties arbitration agreement 
caron argues defendants failed to authenticate the sales contract containing the arbitration provision because the declaration by mission imports attorney lacked personal knowledge of how the agreement was executed and whether the agreement qualified as a business record.similarly,caron argued the employee declaration mercedes financial offered failed to authenticate the sales contract because the employee did not witness caron sign the agreement and failed to establish all of the elements necessary for the agreement to qualify as a business record.caron challenge lacks merit because other evidence sufficiently authenticated the sales contract containing the arbitration provision.
documents must be authenticated before the trial court may receive them into evidence.a document is authenticated when sufficient evidence has been produced to sustain a finding that the document is what it purports to be citation.as long as the evidence would support a finding of authenticity,the writing is admissible.the fact conflicting inferences can be drawn regarding authenticity goes to the document weight as evidence,not its admissibility.jazayeri mao th,d jazayeri see also.
the authentication methods on which caron relies are just two of several methods the evidence code recognizes for authenticating documents.people smith th,d smith.for example,evidence code section also provides,a writing may be authenticated by evidence that a the party against whom it is offered has at any time admitted its authenticity or b the writing has been acted upon as authentic by the party against whom it is offered.
in ambriz kelegian th,d ambriz,the court of appeal relied on evidence code section to conclude a plaintiff properly authenticated a portion of a deposition transcript because the defendant had offered a different portion of the same transcript to support their summary judgment motion.id.at,d.the ambriz court explained,defendants admitted the authenticity of the transcript of detective pitcher deposition by seeking to use portions of that deposition in support of their motion for summary judgment.raising an objection as to lack of authentication of an excerpt from the same deposition defendants themselves relied upon in their motion is disingenuous,unless defendants can establish that the excerpt plaintiff offered was not part of the deposition transcript.defendants made no such allegation.fn.omitted.ibid.
here,the sales contract defendants offered was a,document with caron signature.the arbitration provision appeared on the back of the document.caron attached a copy of the front of the same sales contract to her complaint and alleged it was a true and correct copy of the agreement for her vehicle purchase.as in ambriz,caron admitted the sales contract authenticity by relying on a different part of it and she made no attempt to show the arbitration provision on which defendants relied was not part of the same agreement.the sales contract authenticity is further bolstered by the fact the front page of the agreement defendants offered matched the front page caron attached to her complaint.smith,supra,th at,d circumstantial evidence,content and location are all valid means of authentication jazayeri,supra,th at,d same.
defendants adequately authenticated the sales contract containing the arbitration provision and therefore we reject caron contrary argument

standard of review 
in general,t here is no uniform standard of review for evaluating an order denying a motion to compel arbitration.citation.if the court order is based on a decision of fact,then we adopt a substantial evidence standard.citations.alternatively,if the court denial rests solely on a decision of law,then a de novo standard of review is employed.citations.citation.laswell ag seal beach,llc th,d.whether the faa preempts the clra rule is a purely legal question we review de novo.fisher,supra,th at,d.
governing principles regarding faa preemption 
the faa was designed to overrule the judiciary longstanding refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate,citation volt info.sciences leland stanford,d volt.it applies to all agreements to arbitrate a dispute arising from a contract involving interstate commerce and commands that they shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.
section of the faa is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary citation.i n enacting of the federal act,congress declared a national policy favoring arbitration and withdrew the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration.citation.perry thomas,d perry.that national policy appli es in state as well as federal courts and foreclose s state legislative attempts to undercut the enforceability of arbitration agreements.citation.preston ferrer,d preston.
the faa contains no express provision,nor does it reflect a congressional intent to occupy the entire field of arbitration.citation.but even when congress has not completely displaced state regulation in an area,state law may nonetheless be to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law that is,to the extent that it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.citation.volt,supra,at.
the principal purpose of the faa is to ensur e that private arbitration agreements are enforced according to their terms.citations.at t mobility,supra,at.at stolt nielsen animalfeeds international,stolt nielsen volt,supra,at the faa passage was motivated,first and foremost,by a congressional desire to enforce agreements into which parties had entered.
the faa displacement of conflicting state law is now,citation,and has been repeatedly reaffirmed,citations.preston,supra,at.it preempts state statutes that expressly invalidate arbitration agreements.see,perry,supra,at,the faa preempts california labor code provision requiring judicial resolution of certain wage claims despite agreement to arbitrate.the faa also preempts state statutes that do not expressly invalidate arbitration agreements but have been judicially interpreted to do so.see,southland keating,d the faa preempts state statute interpreted by the california supreme court to require judicial resolution of claims brought under the california franchise investment law.finally,the faa preempts rules that stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the faa objective of enforcing arbitration agreements according to their specific terms.at t mobility,supra,at.at.
in at t mobility,the united states supreme court recently addressed whether the faa preempted the discover bank rule,which california courts frequently used to find arbitration provisions in certain consumer contracts of adhesion unconscionable because they included a waiver of the consumer right to bring a class action.at t mobility,supra,at.at.the california supreme court created the discover bank rule because waivers in consumer contracts of adhesion allowed companies to effectively exonerate themselves from liability for cheating large numbers of consumers out of money individually too small for a consumer to bring an individual action ibid.
in at t mobility,the lower courts refused to enforce the parties arbitration agreement based on the discover bank rule.they found the rule was not preempted by the faa because that rule was simply a refinement of the unconscionability analysis applicable to contracts generally in california.citation.at t mobility,supra,at.at.the united states supreme court rejected that analysis and held the faa preempted the discover bank rule b ecause it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress in enacting the faa,citation id.at,d.
the at t mobility court explained that arbitration under the faa is a contractual matter and the parties are therefore generally free to structure their arbitration as they desire.at t mobility,supra,at pp.at,stolt nielsen,supra,at.at volt,supra,at.for example,the parties to an arbitration agreement may agree to limit the issues subject to arbitration,citation,to arbitrate according to specific rules,citation,and to limit with whom they will arbitrate their disputes,citation.the point of affording parties discretion in designing arbitration processes is to allow for efficient,streamlined procedures tailored to the type of dispute.it can be specified,for example,that the decisionmaker be a specialist in the relevant field,or that proceedings be kept confidential to protect trade secrets.and the informality of arbitral proceedings is itself desirable,reducing the cost and increasing the speed of dispute resolution.at t mobility,at,original italics.
the supreme court emphasized that a prime objective of an agreement to arbitrate is to achieve streamlined proceedings and expeditious results,citation.at t mobility,supra,at.at.towards that end,the arbitration agreement in at t mobility not only required the parties to arbitrate all disputes,but also prohibited the plaintiffs from asserting any class claims or joining any other parties in the arbitration.the at t mobility court explained that allowing class claims would sacrifice the principal advantage of arbitration its informality and make the process slower,more costly,and more likely to generate procedural morass than final judgment because class claims require procedural formality and necessitate additional and different procedures to protect absent parties interests.id.at.
because the discover bank rule prevented the parties from achieving the benefits of the bilateral arbitration to which they agreed,the at t mobility court found the rule erected an obstacle to the faa objective of enforcing arbitration agreements according to their terms.the faa therefore preempted the discover bank rule.at t mobility,supra,at pp.at.
the plaintiffs in at t mobility argue d that the discover bank rule,given its origins in california unconscionability doctrine and california policy against exculpation,is a ground that exist ed at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract under faa and therefore the faa did not preempt the rule.at t mobility,supra,at.at.the supreme court rejected that argument,explaining the faa preemptive effect may extend even to grounds traditionally thought to exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract when those grounds have been applied in a fashion that disfavors arbitration.id.at.the at t mobility court concluded the discover bank rule applied california unconscionability doctrine in a manner that disfavored arbitration because the rule in its practical application had a disproportionate impact on arbitration agreements.id.at,d.
caron argues the faa preempts only state laws that single out arbitration for special treatment.she cites several supreme court decisions stating,by enacting of the faa,we have several times said,congress precluded states from singling out arbitration provisions for suspect status,requiring instead that such provisions be placed upon the same footing as other contracts.citation.see,doctors assocs.casarotto,d doctors assocs.
the cases caron cites,however,do not define the limits of the faa preemptive effect they merely describe why the faa preempted the laws at issue in those cases.see,doctors,supra,at holding faa preempted state statute conditioning arbitration agreements enforceability on compliance with a special notice requirement not applicable to contracts in general.at t mobility makes clear the faa preemptive effect extends to any state law that stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objective of the faa.at t mobility,supra,at.at see also parks,supra,cal th cal.lexis,national bank act nba preempts california statute requiring certain disclosures on preprinted checks provided to credit card users because the statute stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of the nba.
the clra anti waiver rule stands as an obstacle to the faa purpose of enforcing arbitration agreements according to their terms 
the clra makes unlawful various unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer,subd.a.a consumer who suffers damages because of a prohibited act or practice may bring an action for actual damages,injunctive relief,restitution,and punitive damages,subd.a.the consumer may also bring a class action to recover the same relief on behalf of other similarly situated consumers,subd.a.
the clra declares that a ny waiver by a consumer of its provisions is contrary to public policy and shall be unenforceable and void.because the clra expressly authorizes consumers to bring class actions,this provision renders a consumer waiver of the right to bring a class action unenforceable and void.fisher,supra,th at,d.
here,the trial court found this provision invalidated the waiver in the parties arbitration agreement and therefore the poison pill clause made the entire arbitration agreement unenforceable.the court also found the faa did not preempt the clra provision.we disagree with this latter conclusion.
no meaningful difference exists between the clra class action prohibition and the discover bank rule.both are rules that prevent enforcement of an arbitration agreement according to its terms.as in at t mobility,caron and defendants arbitration agreement not only required them to arbitrate all of their disputes,but also prohibited caron from asserting any class claims or joining any other parties in the arbitration.by limiting the arbitration to caron individual claims,the agreement ensured the parties would receive the benefits of contractual arbitration to which they agreed lower costs,greater efficiency and speed,and the ability to choose expert adjudicators to resolve specialized disputes.citation.at t mobility,supra,at.at.applying the clra prohibition against waivers would deprive the parties of those benefits because it would allow caron to assert class claims and impose the complex,costly,and procedures that the supreme court in at t mobility found so objectionable.id.at.under at t mobility reasoning,the clra provision stands as an obstacle to the faa purpose and objective because it prevented the parties from enforcing their arbitration agreement according to its terms.
the trial court concluded the recent decision in fisher required it to find the faa did not preempt the clra rule.fisher involved a petition to compel arbitration based on a retail installment sales contract containing the identical arbitration agreement at issue in this case.fisher,supra,th at,d.the fisher court found the clra provision invalidated the arbitration agreement waiver and that the faa did not preempt the clra provision.id.at,d.
fisher preemption analysis did not address whether the clra provision stood as an obstacle to the faa purposes and objectives of enforcing arbitration agreements according to their terms.instead,the fisher court analysis relied on the faa savings clause,which allows courts to deny enforcement of an arbitration agreement on such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.fisher,supra,th at,d.the fisher court found that california law generally prohibits any contract from impairing statutory rights enacted for a public purpose,and the right to bring a clra class action was an unwaivable statutory right enacted for a public purpose.fisher,at,d.accordingly,fisher concluded,the right to bring a clra class action lawsuit is a separate,generally available contract defense not preempted by the faa.citation.id.at,d.
the court of appeal issued the fisher decision before the united states supreme court decided at t mobility.consequently,the fisher court lacked the opportunity to apply at t mobility reasoning to its case,particularly whether the faa preemptive effect may extend to generally available contract defenses if they are applied in a manner that generally discriminates against arbitration.at t mobility,supra,at.at.
we conclude fisher applied the clra provision in a manner that discriminates against arbitration and therefore the faa preempts it.applying the clra provision to waivers in arbitration agreements effectively prevents clra claims from being arbitrated ev
