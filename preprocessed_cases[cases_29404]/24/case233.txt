background 
the parties entered into a licensing agreement in december under which phoenix,a german corporation,granted ecoplas,an american corporation,an exclusive license to produce and sell phoenix polyester up moulding compounds.phoenix further agreed to provide ecoplas with secret technical knowledge as well as technical relative to the manufacture of those compounds.in exchange ecoplas agreed to pay phoenix royalties and an annual licensing fee.
the licensing agreement contained an arbitration clause,which provided in relevant part 
the parties shall make a diligent effort to settle amicably all disagreements in conjunction with this contract.if an amicable agreement is not reached then the arbitration court of the international chamber of commerce in zurich shall have jurisdiction at the exclusion of regular courts.this agreement is subject to swiss law.
in august,phoenix informed ecoplas that it had sold a business portfolio to bakelite ag,a german company,and requested that ecoplas agree to a transfer of the licensing contract to bakelite ag as well.ecoplas,in response,informed phoenix that it would not be continuing the license agreement with bakelite ag,and it is being considered terminated.a dispute then arose over whether ecoplas had terminated the agreement prematurely.phoenix claimed that because ecoplas refused to allow the license transfer,the original contract obligations between phoenix and ecoplas remained in place.ecoplas maintained that the contract had been terminated in by mutual agreement.ecoplas did not pay the license fees for and.
on april,phoenix filed a complaint with the international court of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce icc.defending its failure to pay the fees,ecoplas argued that phoenix sale of its business portfolio to bakelite ag had dissolved the licensing agreement between phoenix and ecoplas,and that,in any event,phoenix had failed to provide usable technical advice as required by the agreement.
the arbitrator rejected ecoplas contentions and rendered a decision in favor of phoenix on december.he found that the sale of assets to bakelite ag did not void the contractual relationship between phoenix and ecoplas,and that the licensing agreement did not require phoenix to provide ecoplas with more technical assistance than had already been provided.the arbitrator awarded phoenix approximately,plus in arbitration costs and swiss francs in legal fees.
because ecoplas failed to pay the arbitration award,phoenix commenced an action seeking confirmation of the award in the western district of new york pursuant to the convention.in response,ecoplas claimed that the federal district court lacked jurisdiction over phoenix action because the arbitration agreement did not reflect the parties intent to consent to judicial confirmation of the arbitration award,as required by of the federal arbitration act faa.citing article v b of the convention,ecoplas further argued that the district court should not honor the arbitration award because the arbitrator had refused to hear certain evidence regarding the competency of the technical advice provided by phoenix.
the district court adopted a recommendation from magistrate judge hugh scott that the court confirm the award.in doing so,the court observed that it remained an open question whether the provision of had been preempted by for cases arising under the convention.the court held,however,that even if the requirements of did apply,the licensing agreement complied with those requirements.the agreement,judge arcara wrote,sufficiently demonstrates the parties intent that the result of the icc arbitration be final and binding,such that the claims would not be heard de novo in any court.by adopting the reasoning of magistrate judge scott,judge arcara also implicitly rejected ecoplas article v b claim.ecoplas appeals.
