after a lengthy arbitration spanning several years,during which the arbitrator conducted days of hearings,reviewed pages of transcripts,and received over exhibits,petitioner westerbeke corporation westerbeke prevailed against respondent daihatsu motor company daihatsu in its action for breach of a sales agreement.westerbeke subsequently filed an action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york marrero,seeking to confirm the million arbitration award pursuant to.daihatsu moved in turn to vacate the award pursuant to a.the district court held that,by awarding expectancy damages for a breach of a preliminary agreement,the arbitrator acted in manifest disregard of new york law.it denied westerbeke petition,granted daihatsu motion to vacate,and remanded to the arbitration tribunal for further proceedings on the damages issue.
we hold that the district court did not accord the proper deference to the arbitrator factual determinations and improperly set aside his interpretation of the sales agreement as a contract with a condition precedent,rather than as a preliminary agreement.as daihatsu has not met its burden of demonstrating that this underlying contractual interpretation was itself in manifest disregard of law,it can not claim that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded new york law by refusing to apply principles that dictate that only reliance damages may be awarded for breach of a preliminary agreement.
daihatsu argues that the award may alternatively be vacated because the arbitrator acted in manifest disregard of the law of the case doctrine exceeded his authority and issued an award that was not drawn from the essence of the agreement.as none of these additional grounds for vacatur has merit,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions for the district court to confirm the arbitral award.
background 
in the early,westerbeke,a delaware corporation engaged in the production and marketing of generators,marine generators and marine propulsion engines,expressed interest in doing business with daihatsu,a subsidiary of the toyota motor company that manufactures engines and engine components.westerbeke purchased carcass engines from other manufacturers and marinized them for resale daihatsu produced carcass engines suitable for marinization.this natural alignment of interests created the prospect of a mutually beneficial business partnership.accordingly,in,westerbeke commenced negotiations with daihatsu for a sales agreement under which westerbeke would purchase daihatsu carcass engines for eventual marinization and incorporation into westerbeke product line.westerbeke planned to sell its marinized engines both through a distribution network and directly to builders of boats.westerbeke daihatsu motor,d.
the parties ultimately entered into a component sales agreement csa on may.under the csa,daihatsu agreed to supply westerbeke with certain engines on an exclusive basis in the united states and canada.moreover,westerbeke also possessed some rights with respect to daihatsu future engine models.article of the csa provided westerbeke with a limited right of first refusal 
when daihatsu desires to sell in the territory other gasoline engines of fewer than four cylinders for the products than the engines sic.westerbeke shall have the first refusal during the first six months after the date of daihatsu first offer of the estimate for the said engines.during the said six months of the first refusal for westerbeke,daihatsu shall not offer the said engines to any third party in the territory and if and westerbeke come to an agreement on the specifications,prices,minimum purchase quantities,delivery terms,of the said engines,such engines shall be added to the engines as defined by the sic paragraph of the sic article of this agreement.in such case,if need be,the parties shall amend the provisions of this agreement relating to the said agreement on the engines added.
after the csa expiration,it was twice renewed for additional terms.yet relations between the two companies deteriorated in the early.at that time,daihatsu developed a new,gasoline engine,the.instead of offering to sell this new product to westerbeke,daihatsu entered into an agreement with another north american distributor,the briggs stratton corporation b s.this agreement granted b s the exclusive right to distribute the.
westerbeke eventually learned of daihatsu business arrangement with b s through advertisements in trade publications.id.at.westerbeke was eager to gain access to daihatsu new engine,particularly as the,unlike westerbeke product line,could be sold in the united states under the new emissions standards promulgated by the federal environmental protection agency and the california air resources board.
in late,the parties entered into negotiations for the sale of the engine.no agreement was ever finalized,however,because daihatsu conditioned the sale of the engines on westerbeke renunciation of its rights of first refusal and exclusivity.in october,daihatsu provided westerbeke with timely notice that it did not desire to renew the csa.the csa was therefore terminated as of april.under section of the csa,westerbeke was allowed to put in a final order for all daihatsu engines that fell within the scope of the csa,excluding the.
in,westerbeke filed actions in the norfolk superior court and the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.westerbeke filed a separate action against b s for its role in the dispute between the parties.all of these actions were voluntarily dismissed or stayed when westerbeke invoked article of the csa,which required that all disputes be resolved by arbitration pursuant to the trade arbitration agreement of september.pursuant to the csa,the situs of arbitration was new york.
the arbitrator bifurcated the proceedings into a liability and a damages phase.the liability phase was almost exclusively focused on the question of whether the was an engine within the meaning of article.the arbitrator therefore examined the facially ambiguous language of article when daihatsu desires to sell in the territory other gasoline engines of fewer than four cylinders for the products than the engines.the parties had advanced two separate readings of that phrase.westerbeke argued that its right of first refusal was triggered if a new engine was suitable for use in westerbeke marine generator sets or marine propulsion engines.daihatsu,in contrast,contended that a new engine fell within the scope of article only if daihatsu desired to sell the engine for use in marine generator sets or marine propulsion engines.finding both of these readings plausible,the arbitrator ultimately concluded that article had been adopted in order to secure westerbeke access to a continuous supply of engines on an exclusive basis.the arbitrator therefore read the provision in favor of westerbeke.the arbitrator also noted that,because daihatsu had drafted article,it would be fair to interpret any ambiguity in the provision against daihatsu.
in his interlocutory award memorializing his liability rulings,the arbitrator stated 
the primary issue for decision is whether respondent daihatsu motor company,limited violated the contractual rights of claimant westerbeke corporation in refusing to negotiate for the inclusion of the engines as engines within the meaning of the component sales agreement between the two parties.the tribunal holds that it did.
despite this reference to a refusal to negotiate,the parties had not up to that point briefed and the arbitrator did not explicitly rule on whether article of the csa constituted a preliminary agreement to agree in fact,the arbitrator also used language suggesting that article was a contract with condition precedent.for example,the arbitrator described the negotiation of such matters as quantit y and delivery terms as a precondition to an engine sic becoming an engine,and noted that westerbeke would have the right of first refusal on engines meeting a certain definition,subject to stated conditions.
after the arbitrator handed down his interlocutory award,the parties briefed the damages issue.at the arbitrator request,daihatsu submitted a supplemental letter brief on the applicability of goodstein constr.city of new york,which prohibits the award of expectancy damages for the breach of a preliminary agreement.daihatsu argued that,given the arbitrator finding at the liability phase that daihatsu had violated westerbeke contractual rights by refusing to negotiate,goodstein obviated all of westerbeke damages as a matter of law.westerbeke countered that goodstein did not apply because the csa,unlike the contract at issue in goodstein,was a binding contract with open terms under the and lost profits damages were reasonably foreseeable in the present case,while they were not foreseeable in goodstein.
in the final award,the arbitrator reaffirmed his liability holding that daihatsu had violated its duty to negotiate at the damages phase of the proceedings,yet observed whether westerbeke is entitled to expectancy damages depends,at least in part,upon daihatsu obligations under the contract.the essence of daihatsu argument is that,even assuming as this tribunal had held that daihatsu was legally obliged to negotiate toward agreement during the right of first refusal period and that it did not do so,new york law limits westerbeke recovery to reliance damages.
relying on cases such as teachers ins.annuity ass of am.tribune,the arbitrator rejected westerbeke argument that article of the csa created an enforceable contract for the purchase of the engines under or regardless of whether the parties agreed on sales terms for the engine.the arbitrator held that article was not a binding contract with open terms under the new york,because the terms left open by article were substantive and significant and because,under the express terms of the csa,an enforceable contract for the sale of the would be formed only if and westerbeke came to an agreement on the specifications,prices,minimum purchase quantities,delivery terms,of the said engines.
the arbitrator likewise rejected daihatsu argument that article was a preliminary agreement to agree,however.instead,the arbitrator found that t he fact that daihatsu had a legal obligation to negotiate in good faith with westerbeke but did not do so does not help to answer the question of whether westerbeke is entitled to expectancy damages for its breach.the appropriate analytical framework is that of a contract with condition precedent to the addition of a new engine.the arbitrator construction of article as a contract with condition precedent was influenced in part by his finding that article was fashioned to prevent daihatsu from balking at negotiating with westerbeke and thereby rendering the right of first refusal for which westerbeke had bargained illusory.the arbitrator also based this conclusion on repeated statements made by both parties during the arbitration that indicated that,once the condition of agreement on the terms of sale had been met,the would become an engine within the scope of the csa.from this evidence,the arbitrator inferred that westerbeke right of first refusal became operative once the condition precedent of agreement on the relevant purchase terms was satisfied.under the arbitrator construction of article,this condition precedent was met so long as there was an objective meeting of the minds on the four specified,price,minimum purchase quantities,and delivery if the parties did nothing to express this agreement,and even if daihatsu did not want to sell the engine at therefore did not make a formal offer or would not sign a contract.relying largely on the fact that no disagreements over material items were identified by the parties,the arbitrator found that this condition precedent had in fact been satisfied the arbitrator concluded consequently,assuming for purposes of analysis the applicability under the ucc of goodstein and like cases,they do not insulate daihatsu from expectancy damages.the arbitrator awarded westerbeke approximately million in cover and lost profit damages.
westerbeke brought an action in the southern district of new york to confirm the arbitration award.daihatsu moved to vacate,arguing that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded new york damages law exceeded the scope of his authority in violation of a manifestly disregarded the record and terms of the csa and manifestly disregarded the law of the case doctrine.westerbeke,d at.the district court vacated the arbitrator award for manifest disregard of new york damages law without reaching the other three grounds.the district court relied in part on the fact that the arbitrator had made only a single liability finding in its interlocutory award that daihatsu violated westerbeke contractual rights by failing to negotiate for the inclusion of the engine in the csa.id.at.rejecting the arbitrator reading of article as a contract with condition precedent in the final award,id.at notwithstanding the court initial concurrence with the interlocutory award,the arbitrator final award takes an unusual and legally fatal turn t he final award stretches beyond the limits of sound jurisprudence and in effect substitutes the arbitrator own judgment for the intentions of the parties,the district court found instead that article created a binding preliminary agreement,id.at.applying goodstein,the district court concluded that only reliance damages could be awarded for a breach of that contractual provision.

we hold that daihatsu has not met its burden of demonstrating either the existence of a clearly governing legal principle or the arbitrator manifest disregard of such a principle.
clearly governing legal principle 
new york law of damages 
a legal principle clearly governs the resolution of an issue before the arbitrator if its applicability is obvious and capable of being readily and instantly perceived by the average person qualified to serve as an arbitrator.merrill lynch,at.we begin our analysis by outlining the legal principles daihatsu claims clearly control the outcome of this case.daihatsu points specifically to kenford county of erie,kenford i,kenford county of erie,kenford ii,and goodstein const.city of new york,a trilogy of new york court of appeals decisions that together set forth the standard for assessing what measure of damages is appropriate to remedy breaches of contractual obligations.
the kenford appeals arose from a single contractual dispute.the plaintiff had contracted to donate land to erie county.in return,the county had agreed to build a stadium on the land,which the plaintiff would then operate.as part of the agreement,the county was to assess increased real estate taxes on peripheral lands developed by the plaintiff.for budgetary reasons,the county reneged on its agreement to construct the stadium.the plaintiff sued for breach of contract and was awarded lost profits for plaintiff contemplated operation of the stadium,as well as damages for the loss of the anticipated appreciation in the value of the peripheral lands.kenford i addressed the former damages award,while kenford ii considered a separate challenge to the latter land appreciation damages award.
in kenford i,the court of appeals held that lost profit damages may be awarded only if a plaintiff demonstrates with reasonable certainty that such damages have been caused by the breach the alleged loss was capable of proof with reasonable certainty and lost profit damages were fairly within the contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting.at.finding that the lost profits award was based on a speculative assessment of how much income would be generated by the stadium,the court of appeals held that plaintiff proof failed on the second prong.id.at.the court of appeals also found,on the basis of the record before it,that lost profits damages had not been within the contemplation of the parties.id.
in kenford ii,the court of appeals reaffirmed that a party may not be liable for special damages unless such damages were within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting.at.after reviewing the contract to discern what the parties would have concluded had they considered the subject,the kenford ii court determined that the county had never intended to assume liability for the lack of appreciation in the plaintiff investment.id.at.the court of appeals concluded that a ccording to kenford version of the facts,kenford was to realize all of its anticipated gains with or without the stadium.clearly,such a result is illogical and without any basis whatsoever in the record.id.at.
finally,in goodstein,the court of appeals held that a plaintiff was entitled only to reliance damages for the breach of a contractual duty to negotiate in good faith arising under a preliminary agreement.at.at issue in goodstein was a letter agreement in which the city of new york the city and a real estate developer had agreed,among other things,to negotiate the terms of a land disposition agreement lda for a particular plot of real estate.under the letter agreement,the city retain ed the right to terminate negotiations at any time in which case the city could negotiate with any other applicant or.id.at.moreover,if the negotiations were successfully completed,the lda would become binding only if certain conditions were fulfilled,including approval by the various community and city planning boards.the city breached this letter agreement when the city decided to reserve the site in question for commercial development and refused to negotiate in good faith with the plaintiff.id.at.
in deciding that the plaintiff was precluded,as a matter of law,from recovering the lost profits it would have realized if the lda had been successfully negotiated,the court of appeals emphasized that the city obligations arose from a preliminary agreement and not a completed lda.id.at,an analysis of plaintiff claim for loss of profits must start with an examination of the precise nature of the obligation on which the claim is based.that obligation,it must be emphasized,arises not from the actual lda,but from a preliminary agreement to negotiate an lda.moreover,the city anticipated performance under the lda was expressly conditioned on factors that were outside the city control.because the city sole obligation was to put the plaintiff in as good a position as it would have been in had the contract been performed,and because t he city was neither bound to agree to an lda nor to continue the negotiating process,granting expectancy damages on the prospective terms of a contract that the city was at liberty to reject would have placed the plaintiff in a better position than plaintiff would have enjoyed had the city satisfied its obligations under the preliminary agreement.id.at.
the arbitrator construction of the csa 
in attempting to evaluate whether the principles outlined above govern our consideration of the csa,we encounter a threshold,the inherent difficulty in determining whether a given legal principle controls the outcome of this case while the nature of the csa remains in dispute.although daihatsu appeal ostensibly challenges the arbitrator manifest disregard of new york law of damages,a closer examination of the arguments advanced by daihatsu reveals that,in fact,daihatsu contests the tribunal allegedly impermissible reading of the csa as a contract with condition precedent.
daihatsu protests that it is not disputing the arbitrator factual findings.rather,daihatsu maintains that,because the arbitrator had previously determined in the interlocutory award that the only obligation imposed by article was a duty to negotiate in good faith,and because,by the arbitrator own admission,this liability ruling remained binding in the final award,the only authentic factual finding and contractual interpretation made by the arbitrator was that article was an agreement to negotiate.the record does not support daihatsu reading of the arbitral judgment,however.
any ambiguity on this issue stems from the fact that the arbitrator alternatively uses the language of preliminary agreement and of contracts with condition precedent in the interlocutory and final awards.admittedly,were we to examine the interlocutory award in isolation,we might conclude that the arbitrator construed article as a preliminary agreement,under which the parties bound themselves to negotiate in good faith to work out the remaining open terms.shann dunk,cir.but that issue was not before the arbitrator at that stage of the proceedings,and as noted supra at,other language in the interlocutory award indicated that the arbitrator had read article as creating a contract with condition precedent.we need not deconstruct the interlocutory award in order to figure out how the arbitrator construed the csa,however,as the arbitrator clarified his findings in the final award.there,the arbitrator indicated that article must be read as a contract with condition precedent,the condition in question being objective agreement on the sale terms.the arbitrator further suggested that this condition had in fact been satisfied t he tribunal has reviewed the record itself in order to ensure that the condition precedent to the addition of the to the csa was met.there was no genuine dispute over terms here.in rendering his decision,the arbitrator relied on the fact that westerbeke had a contractual right of first refusal.this right was more extensive than a mere right to negotiate for terms.thus,the arbitrator concluded that the contract could not be read in such a way that daihatsu could eviscerate westerbeke contractual right of first refusal if daihatsu later decided not to sell its new products to westerbeke through the simple expedient of refusing to give its consent to acceptable terms proposed by westerbeke.
daihatsu asks that we ignore these later findings as plainly contrary to the arbitrator previous liability holding.as a preliminary matter,internal inconsistencies within an arbitral judgment are not grounds for vacatur.see saint mary home,serv.employees int l union,dist,cir internal inconsistencies in the opinion are not grounds to vacate the award notwithstanding the home plausible argument that the arbitrator decision was misguided or our own concerns regarding the arbitrator conclusion.more to the point,we see no inherent inconsistency between the findings made by the arbitrator at the interlocutory and final award stages of the arbitration proceeding.
daihatsu assumes that,because the arbitrator held at the liability phase of the arbitration proceedings that daihatsu breached the csa by failing to negotiate for terms,the arbitrator necessarily construed article as a preliminary agreement to agree.the arbitrator finding that daihatsu had breached its contractual obligations by refusing to negotiate is not inherently irreconcilable with the arbitrator later reading of the csa as a contract with condition precedent,however.assuming that article creates a contract with condition precedent,daihatsu would have had an implied obligation not to do anything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract or to act in such a way as to frustrate or prevent the occurrence of the condition,city hous,quotation marks omitted see also stern gepo realty,t he rule is that one may not take advantage of a condition precedent,the performance of which he himself has rendered impossible.the breach referred to by the arbitrator in the interlocutory award can plausibly be seen as a breach of this implied duty of good faith to fulfill the condition precedent.consol,adelaide realty,dep t holding that where a contracting party conditions the contract on the transfer of a title,that party implicitly promised to use his good faith best efforts to bring about this result quotation marks omitted stendig,thom rock realty,dep t t he express language of the condition may give rise to the implied language of promise.see also cauff,lippman apogee fin.group,the prevention doctrine is substantially related to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing implicit in every contract the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing requires a promisor to reasonably facilitate the occurrence of a condition precedent by either refraining from conduct which would prevent or hinder the occurrence of the condition,or by taking positive action to cause its occurrence.citations omitted.the arbitrator could have concluded that,by refusing to negotiate for terms,daihatsu had breached its obligation to help bring about the occurrence of the relevant on proposed,acceptable therefore thwarted the formation of the contract 
notwithstanding the arbitrator finding that the appropriate analytical framework for assessing damages for a breach of article is that of a contract with condition precedent,the district court,embarking upon an independent examination of the contractual language,found that article of the csa instead constituted a preliminary agreement.westerbeke,d at.under the manifest disregard standard,however,the governing law must clearly apply to the facts of the case,as those facts have been determined by the arbitrator.see wonderland greyhound park,autotote,cir an arbitrator factual findings are generally not open to judicial challenge,and we accept the facts as the arbitrator found them.quotations marks and citations omitted conntech dev.of.educ,cir holding that an erroneous factual determination is not a ground for vacating an arbitration award in re atl.shipping,cir under our limited scope of review of arbitration awards,we are bound by the arbitrators factual findings and by their interpretation of the contract united paperworkers int l union misco,d no dishonesty is alleged only improvident,even silly,factfinding is claimed.this is hardly a sufficient basis for disregarding what the agent appointed by the parties determined to be the historical facts.the arbitrator factual findings and contractual interpretation are not subject to judicial challenge,particularly on our limited review of whether the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law.see yusuf ahmed alghanim sons toys r us,cir interpretation of a contract term is within the province of the arbitrator and will not be overruled simply because we disagree with that interpretation.see also id.at this court has generally refused to second guess an arbitrator resolution of a contract dispute.in re andros compania maritima,cir w hatever arbitrators mistakes of law may be corrected,simple misinterpretations of contracts do not appear to be one of them.quotation marks omitted in re stavborg,cir holding that there are no grounds to reverse arbitration award based on a clearly erroneous contract interpretation misco,at.i t is the arbitrator view of the facts and of the meaning of the contract that the parties have agreed to accept.
both daihatsu and the district court impermissibly conclude that goodstein establishes the applicable legal principle only because they reject the arbitrator conclusion that article created a contract with condition precedent and that this agreement on the been satisfied.see westerbeke,d at the tribunal finding that there was,in effect,an agreement between the parties with regard to the new engines is particularly untenable in light of commercial realities.whether or not goodstein is clearly applicable to the csa as construed by daihatsu,as opposed to the contract as construed by the arbitrator,is irrelevant.unless daihatsu can show that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded a clearly applicable and explicit principle of contract construction in reading article as a contract with condition precedent,we will not disturb the arbitrator contractual interpretation.daihatsu can not make this showing.
the determinative factor in differentiating a nonbinding preliminary agreement from a binding contract is the intent of the parties.see,teachers ins.annuity ass tribune,underscoring that,in differentiating between a binding contract and a preliminary agreement,prime significance attaches to the intentions of the parties and to their manifestations of intent kleinschmidt div.futuronics,holding that whether parties intended for an agreement to be binding despite the existence of open terms is a question of fact marquette norcem,dep t same forgan mckenzie,misc d,holding that whether contractual provision constituted condition precedent depended on the intent of the parties.the arbitrator correctly applied this legal standard.the arbitrator recogniz ed the importance of intent in ascertaining the nature of the csa,and set about gleaning the parties intent from the evidence of the record,and primarily from the csa itself.based on his review of the relevant evidence,the arbitrator found that the parties adopted article in order to secure westerbeke a right of first refusal for new daihatsu products,but in order to protect daihatsu,conditioned westerbeke exercise of this right on the parties objective agreement on purchase terms.
goodstein,the only controlling case law identified by daihatsu,does not speak to the issue of whether a contract such as the csa must be interpreted as a preliminary agreement.rather,goodstein starts from the assumption that the contract at issue is a preliminary agreement,see goodstein,at,the obligation on which the claim is based,it must be emphasized,arises not from the actual lda,but from a preliminary agreement to negotiate an lda,and then states the damages rule that should be applied to such a contract.goodstein by no means mandates that the csa must likewise be construed as a preliminary agreement.article differs from the preliminary agreement in goodstein in several material respects.under the goodstein agreement,the only right enjoyed by the plaintiff was exclusively to negotiate the terms of a possible lda with the city until such time as the city exercised its right to terminate negotiations.id at.in contrast,daihatsu did not reserve the right to terminate negotiations with westerbeke.indeed,there is no reference in article to a right to negotiate.westerbeke instead bargained for a much broader right of first refusal.
moreover,unlike the goodstein agreement,article is couched in mandatory language.it affirmatively provides that westerbeke shall have the first refusal during the first six months after the date of daihatsu first offer of the estimate for the said engines,and if the parties come to an agreement on the specifications,prices,minimum purchase quantities,delivery terms,of the said engines,such engines shall be added to the csa.the arbitrator relied extensively on this language of first refusal in reaching his conclusion that westerbeke had bargained for greater rights than had the plaintiff in goodstein.the arbitrator distinguishing of goodstein is not without color.
daihatsu next claims that,as a matter of law,a duty to negotiate toward a contract can not itself be a contract with condition precedent because a condition precedent must be a provision within an existing contract.this argument is easily refuted.first,article is a provision within an existing csa.second,under new york law,a condition precedent can be either a condition that must occur before a party performance under an existing contract becomes due or a condition to the formation of the contract itself.see malan constr.for our purposes,it is irrelevant whether the arbitrator understood objective agreement on terms as a condition within the existing csa that,if met,would trigger daihatsu further performance under the csa specifically,the sale of the engine,or as a condition precedent to the formation of a separate contract for the sale of the engine.daihatsu has not identified a governing principle that would preclude either interpretation.
more fundamentally,daihatsu misconstrues the arbitrator holding.the arbitrator did not hold that a preliminary agreement containing only a duty to negotiate is the functional equivalent of a contract with condition precedent.instead,he rejected daihatsu argument that article should be read as a preliminary agreement.
finally,daihatsu urges us to hold,as a matter of law and sound public policy,that agreement on terms can not be the condition precedent to the formation of a contract the effect of the arbitrator analytical framework is to convert all covenants to negotiate toward agreement into contracts with a conditions precedent,the condition being agreement on terms.the defendant errs by presupposing that the arbitrator conclusion with respect to one conclusion which turns on the intentions of the contracting translate into a per se rule governing all contracts that contain a provision requiring negotiation of terms.in any event,this is not the proper forum for a policy debate over the optimal construction of a contract such as the csa.we do not sit in judgment over the wisdom of the arbitrator holdings see pike,at.more pertinently,our announcement of such a principle,no matter how,would not affect the outcome of this case.our sole task is to determine whether there already exists a,clearly governing decisional rule under new york law that would prohibit the arbitrator from reading the csa as a contract with condition precedent.daihatsu has not met its burden of showing that such a rule exists.
application of goodstein and kenford to the csa as construed by the arbitrator 
because the arbitrator was within the bounds of his authority in interpreting the csa as a contract with condition precedent,the district court should have analyzed whether goodstein or kenford i and ii clearly and explicitly foreclose an award of expectancy damages as a remedy for the breach of a duty to refrain from thwarting the occurrence of a condition precedent.we now conclude that they do not.as a general matter,if the cases that establish a particular legal principle are factually distinguishable in a material respect from the case at bar,then that principle is not well defined,explicit,and clearly applicable.we have twice endorsed this particularized,approach when reviewing whether an award of lost profit damages for a new business contravened the principles set forth in the kenford cases.toys r us,at int l telepassport usfi,cir holding that,because kenford i did not establish a per se rule prohibiting the award of expectancy damages to a new business,the arbitrator did not violate a clearly governing legal principle by awarding lost profits to a new business see also webster am.president lines,cir holding that an arbitration panel did not manifestly disregard case law that established that a carrier can not be held liable for cargo damaged after it has been delivered to a port,where the panel found that a contractual provision deeming the port employees charged with offloading the cargo servants of the carrier sufficiently distinguished those precedents.in toys r us,the arbitration panel found that,in contrast to the plaintiff in kenford i,who could provide no reasonable basis for predicting the revenues that would have been generated by a concession stand in the stadium,the plaintiff in the case before it could accurately gauge lost profits based on a previous record of sales from similar stores.at.because kenford i establishes a inquiry,and because the arbitral tribunal found kenford factually distinguishable,there was no manifest disregard of law.id.
in kenford i,the court of appeals concluded,on the basis of the evidence before the court,that liability for lost profits over the length of the contract was not in the contemplation of the parties.at,see also ashland mgmt.janien,the rule that damages must be within the contemplation of the parties is a rule of foreseeability.the party breaching the contract is liable for those risks foreseen or which should have been foreseen at the time the contract was made.nothing in either of the kenford cases dictates that the arbitrator was required to conclude,on the basis of the evidence before him,that the parties had contemplated an award of expectancy damages for the breach of westerbeke right of first refusal.
similarly,the csa is materially different from the contract at issue in goodstein.even had the city performed under the goodstein contract,there was no guarantee that a contract would have been formed.the plaintiff could not show that the city breach was the cause of plaintiff damages.at.in contrast,daihatsu was obligated to form a contract for inclusion of the engine if the condition precedent of agreement on sales terms was objectively met.the arbitrator concluded that the goodstein court primary the plaintiff would be able to reap the benefits of a contract that the city was free to not implicated in the instant case,as daihatsu freedom to reject the amendment of the contract was limited by the terms of the csa.moreover,the arbitrator found that daihatsu was the cause of westerbeke injuries,stating t he real problem was not a sticking point on specifics,as there was agreement on all of them,but rather was daihatsu unwillingness to offer the engine to westerbeke absent renunciation of certain of westerbeke rights in the csa 
given these distinctions,we can not say that either the kenford cases or goodstein establish a rule of decision,in a way that is obvious and capable of being readily and instantly perceived by the average person qualified to serve as an arbitrator,merrill lynch,at,that expectancy damages were unavailable for a violation of article of the csa.
manifest disregard 
even if we were to accept daihatsu invitation to conduct a de novo analysis of the csa,and even if we were then to conclude that the csa is a preliminary agreement,daihatsu still could not prevail under the second prong of the manifest disregard test.it is not enough that the moving party provide proof that the arbitrator was aware of the governing legal principle there must also be a showing of intent.see dirussa,at explaining that the arbitrator must either knowingly refuse to apply or intentionally disregard governing law.a party seeking vacatur must therefore demonstrate that the arbitrator knew of the relevant principle,appreciated that this principle controlled the outcome of the disputed issue,and nonetheless willfully flouted the governing law by refusing to apply it.see merrill lynch,at t he term disregard implies that the arbitrator appreciates the existence of a clearly governing legal principle but decides to ignore or pay no attention to it.
explicit rejection of governing law provides the strongest evidentiary basis for a finding that the arbitrator acted with the requisite intent.hence,this circuit recently vacated an arbitration award when an arbitrator acknowledged on the record that this court had previously ruled on the issue in question,but nonetheless repudiated that precedent.tele,at.the manifest disregard doctrine is not confined to that rare case in which the arbitrator provides us with explicit acknowledgment of wrongful conduct,however.halligan,at w e doubt whether even under a strict construction of the meaning of manifest disregard,it is necessary for arbitrators to state that they are deliberately ignoring the law.a court may find intentional disregard if the reasoning supporting the arbitrator judgment strain s credulity,or does not rise to the standard of barely colorable,see willemijn,at fahnestock,at confirming award so long as any colorable justification supports the decision siegel titan indus,cir confirming an arbitration award of damages even though the tribunal did not explain the calculus used to arrive at the damages amount,because the moving party submitted an affidavit explaining how the tribunal may have arrived at its damages award without violating the governing law.
daihatsu can not prove that the arbitrator appreciated that the goodstein rule controlled the damages issue and that he nonetheless intended to ignore it.given the arbitrator understanding of the nature of the contract,his rationale for taking this case outside the rule established in goodstein is at least slightly colorable,which is all that is required given the strong presumption that the arbitrator has not acted in manifest disregard of the law.
ii.additional grounds for vacatur 
daihatsu requests that,if we vacate the district court judgment with respect to the manifest disregard of new york damages law,we remand for the district court to consider in the first instance whether daihatsu may prevail under three alternative grounds raised below the arbitrator acted in manifest disregard of new york law of the case doctrine the arbitrator exceeded his authority by awarding expectancy damages or the arbitrator failed to draw from the essence of the agreement.because these arguments were fully briefed below and on appeal,and because we find them to be without merit,we dispose of them fully on this appeal.
manifest disregard of the law of the case doctrine 
the law of the case doctrine is a rule of practice followed by new york courts that dictates that a decision on an issue of law made at one stage of a case becomes binding precedent to be followed in subsequent stages of the same litigation.in re korean air lines disaster,quotation marks and citation omitted.the new york court of appeals recently elaborated on the application of this doctrine 
the term law of the case is used,often in federal court decisions,to describe the doctrine requiring a lower court,on remand,to follow the mandate of the higher court.in that setting,there is no discretion involved the lower court must apply the rule laid down by the appellate court.although we too have employed the term in that way,we now refer to it primarily in the manner raised on this a concept regulating rulings made by courts of coordinate jurisdiction in a single litigation.

daihatsu claims that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded new york law of the case doctrine when he ruled in the final award that article was a contract with condition precedent.daihatsu contends that the arbitrator essentially abandoned his earlier ruling that daihatsu breached the csa by refusing to negotiate for the sale of the engine.as discussed supra at part i,the arbitrator did not in fact abrogate a previous liability ruling when he held that article was a condition precedent.assuming that the arbitrator did revisit his liability holding at the final award phase of the case,daihatsu argument would still fail in a number of respects.
first,assuming arguendo that the arbitrator was bound to follow this procedural rule,we doubt that an arbitrator manifest disregard of the law of the case doctrine could ever support vacatur of an arbitral judgment.law of the case is a discretionary doctrine.in re korean air lines disaster.at arizona california,d law of the case directs a court discretion,it does not limit the tribunal power.the evans court contrasted the law of the case doctrine with res judicata and collateral estoppel whereas the latter concepts are rigid rules of limitation,law of the case is a judicially crafted policy that expresses the practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided,and is not a limit to their power.as such,law of the case is necessarily amorphous in that it directs a court discretion,but does not restrict its authority.evans,at,citations omitted see also new york palumbo,dep t holding that law of the case,as applied to the effect of previous orders on the later action of the court rendering them in the same case,merely expresses the practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided,not a limit on their power,and does not strip courts of their authority to revisit their previous decisions.as a predicate for a finding of manifest disregard,this amorphous rule of practice is a far cry from the substantive legal principles that constitute clearly applicable governing law.
second,the law of the case doctrine may be properly invoked only if the parties had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the initial determination.people bilsky,quotation marks omitted.the issue of the type of contract created by article was not fully and fairly litigated at the liability stage,where the pleadings and the decision were directed toward another issue the engine fell within the scope of article.subsequent to the interlocutory award,the arbitrator held more than twenty days of hearings and received extensive briefing on the precise issue of the type of contract that was formed,and consequently the types of damages that could be awarded for a breach.the law of the case doctrine was therefore inapplicable.
finally,daihatsu only support for its argument that the arbitrator must have been aware of new york law of the case doctrine is the arbitrator statement at the first page of the final award that the holding in the interlocutory award remains fully binding.that is not sufficient to show that the arbitrator was even aware of the applicability of the law of the case doctrine,and certainly is not evidence of willful disregard.
arbitrator exceeded his authority 
the faa permits vacatur of an arbitral judgment where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.a.daihatsu contends that vacatur is appropriate under this provision because the arbitrator exceeded the authority granted to him by the parties in the csa when he awarded expectancy damages precluded by new york law.
we have consistently accorded the narrowest of readings to the arbitration act authorization to vacate awards pursuant to a,especially where that language has been invoked in the context of arbitrators alleged failure to correctly decide a question which all concede to have been properly submitted in the first instance.in re andros,at.our inquiry under a thus focuses on whether the arbitrators had the power,based on the parties submissions or the arbitration agreement,to reach a certain issue,not whether the arbitrators correctly decided that issue.dirussa,at see also in re fahnestock,at w e have recognized that if arbitrators rule on issues not presented to them by the parties,they have exceeded their authority and the award must be vacated.quotation marks omitted.
in fahnestock,this court considered whether new york garity rule,which categorically prohibits the imposition of punitive damages by an arbitrator,precluded a punitive damages award under an arbitration agreement that was silent on the punitive damages issue.at.holding that arbitrators lack the authority to award punitive damages under new york law,we vacated the judgment.id see also katz feinberg,cir holding that the arbitration panel exce
