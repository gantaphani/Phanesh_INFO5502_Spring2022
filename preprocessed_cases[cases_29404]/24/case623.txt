on the surface,this appeal presents a straightforward question did the district court err when it concluded that the parties reached an enforceable oral agreement to settle their dispute but we can not reach that question unless the appellants can overcome several procedural hurdles.the underlying case was brought by crystal elustra and her mother christine lopez,who appeared as next friend of crystal younger sisters,moriah elustra and najati elustra both minors.the suit arose out of an argument that erupted on july,over the bill that the elustra girls and some friends owed at the buffalo wild wings restaurant,which is owned by brad fralich.before things settled down,the police had been called and the girls were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and curfew violations.those charges were ultimately dropped,paving the way for this action against frankfurt police officer tom mineo,fralich,and buffalo wild wings.the elustras asserted that officer mineo had violated their civil rights and that fralich had falsely imprisoned them.moriah elustra also complained about injuries to her head and wrists that she suffered during the course of the arrest.
shortly after the suit was filed,the parties initiated settlement discussions.magistrate judge morton denlow presided over a settlement conference,the details of which we provide below.he concluded that the parties reached an oral settlement at the end of that conference and recommended that the district court enter judgment dismissing the suit pursuant to the agreement.the district court did so.although the court proceedings were not as smooth as they might have been,we see no error in the district court decision,and we therefore affirm.
the settlement conference before judge denlow took place on november.the elustras attended the conference with their attorney,michael conway.defendants were present only through counsel.during the conference,defendants presented a global settlement offer of in exchange for a release of all claims.what happened next is disputed,but it appears that judge denlow communicated this offer to the plaintiffs and their attorney,and they accepted the offer.the settlement conference was off the record,but judge denlow later reported that agreement was reached.
before anyone had a chance to commit the terms of the agreement to writing,morad father of the elustra girls and a to speak with conway.the two men began to argue,and the conversation ended with morad telling conway that the family would find another lawyer.the entire family then the courtroom,gathered their coats,and left they pointedly ignored warnings that it was in their best interest to stay and participate in the hearing.
at that point,the defendants orally moved to enter judgment dismissing the case with prejudice,in accordance with the settlement agreement,and judge denlow announced that he would rule immediately.he confirmed that an agreement had been reached and indicated that everyone in particular the plaintiffs had understood the settlement and that the process had been a fair one.conway was present for this hearing and continued to speak for the elustras,despite the exchange with their father.judge denlow concluded with a recommendation to the district court to enforce the settlement by which he meant to dismiss the case with prejudice in accordance with the agreement the parties had reached.on december,the district court held a brief hearing.conway appeared for the plaintiffs,notwithstanding morad effort to terminate his representation.the record does not indicate whether crystal elustra or lopez shared morad dissatisfaction with conway.conway told the court,without elaboration,that plaintiffs recollection was that there was no agreement he did not mention the confrontation with morad.relying on judge denlow report,the district court entered an order on december,granting the defendants motion to dismiss with prejudice.
on december,lopez filed a terse,handwritten pro se motion to vacate and reinstate the claims.with new counsel,the elustras supplemented lopez motion on january.interpreting the january filing as a motion for relief from final judgment under rule b because it was filed after the expiration of the period for rule e motions,the district court denied the motion on april.the elustras now appeal.
the elustras have asked this court to decide whether the district court correctly found that the parties reached a binding settlement agreement,under which the case would be dismissed with prejudice in exchange for a global payment of.the defendants,however,argue that we can not review that decision directly.in their view,the only question properly before us is whether the district court abused its discretion when it denied the motion to reconsider.thus,there are at least two preliminary questions before us first,was the district court correct to treat the january filing as the first motion to reconsider,and thus one filed under rule b,or did it have before it a timely rule e motion,thanks to lopez december filing second,if we are to use the december motion as our point of reference,was it effective to postpone the period for filing a notice of appeal if the answer to that is yes,then we may reach the merits of the dispute over the settlement agreement.otherwise,we would consider only the question whether the district court abused its discretion in rejecting plaintiffs request for reconsideration.
although the defendants never raised the issue,we were concerned about lopez apparent effort directly to represent,without counsel,both her minor daughters and her adult daughter when she filed the december motion.we therefore requested supplemental briefing on this question.normally,representative parties such as next friends may not conduct litigation pro se pleadings may be brought before the court only by parties or their attorney.see providing that parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel.a requiring that every motion be signed by an attorney or a party proceeding pro se.see also lewis,cir per curiam.lopez is neither a party nor an attorney.this means that her december motion may have been utterly without legal significance.
the first question we must address is whether we should look to state or federal law to resolve this problem.on the one hand.b provides that capacity to sue is defined by state law.on the other hand,federal courts are entitled to use their own procedures,whether the case is one arising under federal law as this one was,in part or it is one based on another ground such as supplemental jurisdiction as this one also was,in part or diversity of citizenship.see hanna plumer,d.our problem has less to do with capacity to sue than it does with the right to act in court,which is normally a matter regulated by the rules of professional conduct.federal courts have the inherent authority to adopt their own rules in this field,and the northern district of illinois has done so.see.loc.general bar local rule governing admission to practice before the district court.loc.unauthorized practice of law.loc.bar admission and disciplinary matters.all of this suggests that even though the ultimate issue before us concerns a settlement agreement,which is a matter governed by state law,it is federal law that dictates whether lopez was entitled to act for one or more of her three daughters in the way that she did.
even though federal law controls,this is the kind of question for which state law might provide useful guidance.it is common for federal law to borrow principles from state law,especially when there is a benefit to having a uniform answer within a particular state on a certain topic.see generally boyle united technologies,d clearfield trust united states.the ability of a parent to represent a child interests is a question that arises frequently in state court.and when we look for general guidance to illinois law,it turns out that a number of illinois state court decisions offer support to the elustras.see applebaum rush.med,stating that the nullity rule,which invalidates complaints filed by a nonparty,should be invoked only where it fulfills its purposes of protecting both the public and the integrity of the court system from the actions of the unlicensed,and where no other alternative remedy is possible trinity med,d,reinstating a complaint improperly filed pro se on behalf of an estate to avoid the bar when the plaintiff was represented by counsel at every stage since filing the complaint janiczek dover management,d,declining to invalidate a complaint filed by a disbarred attorney because doing so would penalize an innocent party and would overlook the fact that the party did secure the services of a licensed attorney to represent him at trial.taken together,these cases suggest that an illinois court would not dismiss a nonparty filing out of hand instead,it would distinguish between a filing that merely allows the party to go forward and more general prosecution of the lawsuit.
the question for us is whether there is comparable flexibility in the general rule that a person may appear in the federal courts only pro se or through counsel.one consequence of the normal rule is that a next friend may not,without the assistance of counsel,bring suit on behalf of a minor party.see cheung youth orchestra found.of buffalo,cir a parent must be represented by counsel in bringing an action on behalf of his or her child.meeker kercher,cir per curiam under.c and,a minor child can not bring suit through a parent acting as next friend if the parent is not represented by an attorney.similarly,a parent may not argue an appeal pro se on behalf of her child.see navin park ridge sch.dist,cir.this rule is designed to protect the interests of the minor party in addition,it jealously guards the judiciary authority to govern those who practice in its courtrooms.myers loudoun county pub,cir.
the rule is not ironclad,however.there are,for example,some exceptions for particular kinds of proceedings.thus,parents may bring claims pro se on behalf of their children in an effort to secure social security benefits.see machadio apfel,cir.see also winkelman parma city sch,d explicitly not reaching the issue whether parents may litigate claims on behalf of their children pro se under the individuals with disabilities education act idea.to our knowledge,no comparable exception has ever been recognized for a lawsuit based on or general state tort law.
but the question before us is not such a sweeping one.lopez did not file this action as next friend without the assistance of counsel,and,with the exception of the period between december,and january,she did not proceed pro se.at least until december,she was represented by conway,and by january she had secured replacement counsel.the narrow question is thus whether the motion that she lodged with the court on december on behalf of at least two of her three daughters,while she was in the process of lining up new counsel and while the clock that applied at the time for rule e motions was ticking,is a nullity because they did not yet have replacement counsel.
if the december motion was a timely rule e motion,then the time for taking an appeal from the district court judgment dismissing the case on the basis of the settlement did not begin to run until the motion was denied,and we can reach the merits of that order.if,on the other hand,the first cognizable motion was the one filed by counsel on january,then it was too late to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal under fed.a iv and vi as they read prior to december,and we may review only the disposition of the motion to reconsider.
in this connection,it is important to recall that the point of the rule forbidding a next friend to litigate pro se on behalf of another person is to protect the rights of the represented party.discussing the application of the general rule outside the setting,we observed that m any good reasons exist for the strict adherence to this rule,not the least of which is that a party may be bound,or his rights waived,by his legal representative.lewis,at.this concern is even stronger in the context of a minor or other person who is unable to speak for herself.here,however,the minors had no ability to file their own rule e motion.if that motion had indeed been,counsel would have said so in the january filing.what actually happened,however,was that counsel effectively ratified the earlier filing.if we were to override that action,we would be harming the minors interest in a way that subverts the purpose of the rule,just because the family could not obtain counsel during the short period permitted for a rule e motion.
remedial considerations also support a decision to give effect to the december motion.many of the cases that reject parents pleadings filed pro se on behalf of their children acknowledge that the appropriate remedy is to allow the child to the case with counsel.see,cheung,at remanding child claim litigated by a parent for retention or appointment of counsel,or,alternatively,for dismissal without prejudice.see also lewis,at invalidating the notice of appeal and brief filed by a nonparty,but allowing the appellant to file a proper notice of appeal and to brief the court of appeals pro se or through counsel.the second circuit explicitly took remedy into account in a decision in which it declined to vacate the injunction obtained by a parent litigating pro se on behalf of a child.murphy arlington cent.sch.dist.bd.of,cir it is hardly in the best interest of the child to vacate an injunction that inures to his benefit so that he may this issue below with licensed representation in order to a victory already obtained.the choice before us is more stark we must treat the motion as valid or bar the elustras from challenging the underlying settlement agreement on appeal.while we were willing to direct such a harsh outcome in navin,that was a case where the parent pursued the appeal pro se on behalf of the child through oral argument.here,within a week of lopez motion,the elustras once again had counsel,and they have proceeded appropriately ever since.
the elustras have presented additional arguments in support of their position,including one that draws an analogy between the rule e motion and a formal notice of appeal,but we see no need to consider them in depth.we note only that while,on the one hand,fed.c provides that a pro se notice of appeal is considered filed on behalf of the signer and the signer spouse and minor children if they are parties,unless the notice clearly indicates otherwise,on the other hand this court held that a notice of appeal filed by a pro se parent on behalf of his child was ineffective as to the child.navin,at the notice of appeal is signed only by the parent and therefore is ineffective to seek review on behalf of the child the district court dismissal of the child claim therefore is conclusive,and the appeal proceeds with the parent as the only appellant.if we were to attempt an analogy to notices of appeal,we might also consider whether there is some way to provide for renewal of the motion by counsel.see united states,and,june,order dismissing appeals without prejudice,subject to renewal by appellate counsel cert.denied,lundeby bruinsma,d.but that has already happened here,through counsel january motion.
under the circumstances of this is,where the plaintiffs had counsel through the issuance of a judgment,the plaintiffs were briefly without counsel during the very limited time allotted for a rule e motion,the next friend filed a rule e motion pro se on behalf of the minor children,and then counsel was retained to conduct the rule e proceedings and any subsequent appeal of the conclude that the december motion should not be disregarded just because it was not filed by counsel.we note that no one has argued that crystal elustra,who was an adult at all times,should be excluded from any benefits conferred by that motion in light of our ruling on the merits,we have no need to explore her situation in greater detail.
the next question is whether lopez december filing was otherwise sufficient as a rule e motion.the first hurdle is the time allotted to file such motions we reiterate,under the version of the rules then prevailing.the district court entered judgment enforcing the settlem
