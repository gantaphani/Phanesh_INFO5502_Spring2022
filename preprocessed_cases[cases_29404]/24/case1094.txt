the norway steam boiler exploded on may,while the cruise ship was in the port of miami.six of the crewmembers represented in this action were killed and four were injured each crewmember employment agreement with defendant ncl includes an arbitration clause,which the district court enforced pursuant to the united nations convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,opened for signature june,the convention,and its implementing legislation,the convention act.see bautista star cruises,d.plaintiffs appeal presents an issue of first impression in this circuit whether the crewmembers employment agreements were shielded from arbitration by the seamen employment contract exemption contained in section of the federal arbitration act,the faa because the faa seamen exemption does not apply and the district court had jurisdiction to compel arbitration,we affirm.
background 
i.the suits against star cruises and ncl 
following the explosion aboard the norway,plaintiffs filed separate but nearly identical suits in florida circuit court against ncl,owner of the norway,and star cruises,alleged by plaintiffs to be the parent company of ncl.the complaints sought damages for negligence and unseaworthiness under the jones act,and for failure to provide maintenance,cure and unearned wages under the general maritime law of the united states.
ncl removed the ten cases to federal district court pursuant to section of the convention act,which permits removal before the start of trial when the dispute relates to an arbitration agreement or arbitral award covered by the convention.see in the notices of removal filed with the district court,ncl described how the crewmembers were bound by employment agreements that include an arbitration provision covered by the convention.
ii.the crewmembers employment agreements incorporate an arbitration provision 
at the time of the explosion,each crewmember employment was governed by the terms of a standard employment contract executed by the crewmembers and representatives of ncl in the philippines between august and march.the philippine government regulated the form and content of such employment contracts,as well as other aspects of the seamen hiring process,through a program administered by the philippine overseas employment administration poea,a division of the department of labor and employment of the republic of the philippines dole.
each crewmember signed a standard employment agreement created by the poea,with some variations according to the position for which the crewmember was hired.each agreement sets forth the basic terms and conditions of the crewmember employment,including the duration of the contract,the position accepted,and the monthly salary and hours of work.additional terms and conditions are incorporated by reference paragraph provides that the contract terms and conditions shall be observed in accordance with poea department order and poea memorandum circular.department order,in turn,incorporates the document containing the arbitration clause the standard terms and conditions governing the employment of filipino seafarers on board vessels the standard terms section of the standard terms requires arbitration in cases of claims and disputes arising from the seaman employment,through submission of the claims to the national labor relations commission nlrc,voluntary arbitrators,or a panel of arbitrators.standard terms,
a poea official verified and approved the execution of the employment contract by the crewmembers and ncl representatives.although plaintiffs dispute that the crewmembers saw the arbitration provision or had it explained to them,see pls.mot.for remand,exs,copies of the standard terms provided to the district court by ncl indicate the crewmembers initialed or signed the standard terms.see defs.resp.to pls.mot.for remand,exs.ncl also provided affidavits from managers at various manning agencies licensed by the poea to recruit seamen.in the affidavits,the managers attest that they explained the employment documents to the seamen in their native language the seamen had an opportunity to review the documents and the seamen were required to attend a orientation seminar for seamen,which was conducted in both the english and filipino languages and which reviewed,among other subjects,the standard terms and the dispute settlement procedures provided for in the employment contract.id.at exs.
iii.the district court compels arbitration 
in an order issued on october,the district court granted ncl motion to compel arbitration and denied plaintiffs motion to remand the case to state court.in disposing of the case,the district court ordered that the parties submit to arbitration in the philippines pursuant to section of the standard terms and retained jurisdiction to enforce or confirm any resulting arbitral award.plaintiffs appeal.
jurisdiction 
a case covered by the convention confers federal subject matter jurisdiction upon a district court because such a case is deemed to arise under the laws and treaties of the united states.defendants removed these cases from state court pursuant to,which permits removal of disputes relating to arbitration agreements covered by the convention.see,notice of removal.plaintiffs claim that this case is not covered by the convention,and thereby challenge the district court jurisdiction.we discuss this challenge below.assuming the district court exercised jurisdiction appropriately,its order is final and appealable because,by compelling arbitration of the dispute,it dispos ed of all the issues framed by the litigation and left nothing for the district court to do but execute the judgment.see employers ins.bright metal specialties,cir

discussion

two jurisdictional prerequisites are at issue here.first,we must determine whether the arbitration agreement arises out of a commercial legal relationship.second,we ask whether there exists an agreement in writing to arbitrate the matter in dispute.lastly,we consider plaintiffs purported affirmative defenses that the arbitration provision is unconscionable under law and incapable of being arbitrated under the law of the philippines.in analyzing these arguments,we are mindful that the convention act generally establishes a strong presumption in favor of arbitration of international commercial disputes.indus.risk insurers gutehoffnungshutte gmbh,cir citing mitsubishi motors soler,d.plaintiffs arguments fail.
plaintiffs employment contracts are commercial legal relationships under the convention act,regardless of the faa seamen exemption 
we have yet to determine whether the faa exemption for seamen employment contracts applies to arbitration agreements covered by the convention act the district court determined that it does not.this conclusion is consistent with that of the fifth only court of appeals to decide this several district courts.see freudensprung offshore tech,cir francisco stolt achievement mt,cir,cert.denied,d acosta norwegian cruise line,d adolfo carnival,wl,dist.lexis,amon norwegian cruise lines,dist.lexis.
as we take up this issue of statutory interpretation,the first step is to determine whether the statutory language has a plain and unambiguous meaning by referring to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson shell oil,d.the inquiry ceases if the language is clear and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.id.at.quoting united states ron pair enterprises,d.such is the case here.the statutory framework of title and the language and context of the convention act preclude the application of the faa seamen exemption,either directly as an integral part of the convention act or residually as a provision of the faa.
a.the faa seamen exemption does not apply to the convention act directly 
overview of the convention and the convention act 
the convention requires that a contracting state shall recognize an agreement in writing under which the parties undertake to submit to arbitration all or any differences which have arisen between them in respect of a defined legal relationship,whether contractual or not,concerning a subject matter capable of settlement by arbitration.convention,art.ii when the united states acceded to the convention in,it exercised its right to limit the convention application to commercial legal relationships as defined by the law of the united states 
the united states of america will apply the convention only to differences arising out of legal relationships,whether contractual or not,which are considered as commercial under the national law of the united states.
convention,plaintiffs assert that the united states national law definition of commercial resides in section of the faa,which defines commerce and provides that nothing herein contained shall apply to contracts of employment of seamen.although section clearly exempts seamen employment contracts from the faa,see circuit city stores,adams,d,the exemption application outside the faa is restricted by the second and third chapters of title.
the statutory framework of title of the united states code 
the three chapters of title are closely interrelated,but,contrary to plaintiffs argument,they are not a seamless whole.as indicated,the faa and the convention act comprise chapter and chapter,respectively.chapter contains the legislation implementing the convention on international commercial arbitration,entered into force june.the act.within the general field of arbitration,each act has a specific context and purpose.congress,as it added the convention act and then the act to title,anticipated conflicts among these statutes and the faa.congress addressed potential conflicts in two ways,each of which limits the degree to which title may be considered a single statute.
the first is general in nature.the faa applies residually to supplement the provisions of the convention act and the act.rather than put the convention act and the act on equal footing with the faa in the field of foreign arbitration,congress gave the statutes primacy in their fields,with faa provisions applying only where they did not conflict.see the convention act residual provision the act residual provision.this hierarchical structure accords with our understanding that,a s an exercise of the congress treaty power and as federal law,the convention must be enforced according to its terms over all prior inconsistent rules of law.indus.risk insurers,at quoting sedco,petroleos mexicanos mexican oil,cir.
the second technique for reconciling title chapters is more specific.certain provisions of the convention act and the act refer explicitly to specific sections of other chapters of title.section of the act,for example,directly incorporates several sections of the convention act s ections,and of this title shall apply to this chapter as if specifically set forth herein.most relevant for the instant case is the reference in section of the convention act to section of the faa.
section of the convention act 
in contrast to the act direct incorporation of several convention act sections,section does not incorporate section of the faa as an exhaustive description of the convention act scope.rather,section uses section as an illustration of the types of agreements covered by the convention act.
in articulating the convention commercial scope under the laws of the united states,section of the convention act provides that an agreement falls under the convention if it aris es out of a legal relationship,whether contractual or not,which is considered as commercial,including a transaction,contract,or agreement described in section of this title.emphasis added section of the faa makes valid and enforceable a written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration.emphasis added.
the convention act reference to section does not indicate an intent to limit the definition of commercial to those described in section of the faa as modified by section the expansive term including would be superfluous if the faa provided the full and complete definition.including demonstrates that,at the very least,congress meant for commercial legal relationships to consist of contracts evidencing a commercial transaction,as listed in section,as well as similar agreements.see federal land bank bismarck lumber.the term including is not one of definition,but connotes simply an illustrative application of the general principle.argosy hennigan,cir the word includes is usually a term of enlargement,and not of limitation it therefore conveys the conclusion that there are other items includable,though not specifically enumerated by the statutes.
we therefore understand the reference to section of the faa to be generally illustrative of the commercial legal relationships covered by section.the illustration rendered by section includes employment agreements and makes no mention of the section seamen exemption.circuit city stores,at.at construing section and rejecting the proposition that an employment contract is not a contract evidencing a transaction involving interstate commerce.accordingly,the terms of the convention act do not provide that we read section into section 
plaintiffs cite committee testimony in the legislative history in the hope of demonstrating that congress intended section of the convention act to incorporate the faa seamen exemption.ambassador richard kearney,chairman of the secretary of state advisory committee on private international law,testified before the senate foreign relations committee that 
the definition of commerce contained in section of the original arbitration act is the national law definition for the purposes of the declaration.a specific reference,however,is made in section to section of title which is the basic provision of the original arbitration act.
comm.on foreign relations,foreign arbitral awards,at.although it is plausible to infer from ambassador kearney comments that he believed the section exemptions should apply to the convention act,his views as a single state department official are a relatively unreliable indicator of statutory intent.see circuit city stores,at.at legislative history is problematic even when the attempt is to draw inferences from the intent of duly appointed committees of the congress.francisco,at quoting circuit city stores to discount ambassador kearney testimony.plaintiffs nevertheless claim that,according to udall tallman,d,his views are entitled to great deference.pls.op.br.at.udall,however,accords such deference only to the officers or agency charged with the statute administration,at.at,and there is no indication that the state department is so charged.even if the above testimony were owed some deference,it could not alter the plain terms of the convention act.see barnhart sigmon coal,d floor statements from two senators can not amend the clear and unambiguous language of a statute.rather than directly incorporate an faa provision that congress did not,we adhere to the framework congress provided and evaluate the applicability of an unmentioned faa section according to the convention act residual application provision.
b.the faa seamen exemption does not apply residually 
as noted above,section of the convention act provides that provisions of the arbitration act apply residually to convention act cases 
chapter et applies to actions and proceedings brought under this chapter et to the extent that chapter is not in conflict with this chapter et or the convention as ratified by the united states.
emphasis added providing for residual application of the faa to the act.under this residual provision,the issue is whether the faa seamen exemption conflicts with the convention act or the convention as ratified by the united states.
a conflict exists between the faa seamen exemption,which is narrow and specific,and the language of the convention and the convention act,which is broad and generic.plaintiffs,under the impression that an faa term may only be contradicted by name,argue that no conflict exists because section of the convention act is silent as to seamen employment contracts.according to this logic,a statutory provision pertaining to persons above the age of eighteen would not conflict with a provision that exempts thirty.because the convention act covers commercial legal relationships without exception,it conflicts with section,an faa provision that exempts certain employment agreements for the be commercial legal relationships.the fifth circuit came to the same conclusion in francisco 
in short,the language of the convention,the ratifying language,and the convention act implementing the convention do not recognize an exception for seamen employment contracts.on the contrary,they recognize that the only limitation on the type of legal relationship falling under the convention is that it must be considered commercial,and we conclude that an employment contract is commercial.
at.we see no reason to diverge from the sensible reasoning of our sister circuit.
indeed,to read exceptions into the broad language of the convention act would be to hinder the convention purpose 
the goal of the convention,and the principal purpose underlying american adoption and implementation of it,was to encourage the recognition and enforcement of commercial arbitration agreements in international contracts and to unify the standards by which agreements to arbitrate are observed and arbitral awards are enforced in the signatory countries.
scherk,d emphasis added see also indus.risk insurers,at identifying additional purposes of the convention,such as relieving congestion in the courts and providing an expedient alternative to litigation.in pursuing effective,unified arbitration standards,the convention framers understood that the benefits of the treaty would be undermined if domestic courts were to inject their parochial values into the regime 
in their discussion of article ii,the delegates to the convention voiced frequent concern that courts of signatory countries in which an agreement to arbitrate is sought to be enforced should not be permitted to decline enforcement of such agreements on the basis of parochial views of their desirability or in a manner that would diminish the mutually binding nature of the agreements.
scherk,at.at.this concern is addressed by the broad language of section of the convention act.considering the language of the convention act in the context of the framework of title and the purposes of the convention,we find no justification for removing from the convention act scope a subset of commercial employment agreements.the crewmembers arbitration provisions constitute commercial legal relationships within the meaning of the convention act.
ii.plaintiffs employment agreements were agreements in writing,which vested the jurisdiction of the district court 
finding no error in the district court determination that instant arbitration provisions are commercial legal relationships,we turn to the other relevant jurisdictional prerequisite,that the party seeking arbitration provide an agreement in writing in which the parties undertake to submit the dispute to arbitration.convention,art.ii see also czarina,at.agreements in writing include an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement,signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams.convention,art.ii.
ncl supplied the district court with copies of the employment agreement and the standard terms signed by each crewmember.see defs.resp.to pls.mot.for remand,exs.although plaintiffs claim the crewmembers did not have an opportunity to review the entirety of the standard terms before signing,plaintiffs do not dispute the veracity of the signatures.see pls.op.br.at.accordingly,this documentation fulfills the jurisdictional prerequisite that the court be provided with an agreement to arbitrate signed by the parties.plaintiffs try in vain to identify three reasons why the signed documents fail to constitute agreements in writing.
first,plaintiffs impugn the incorporation of the standard terms into the employment agreement,citing decisions of other circuits that interpret article ii to require inclusion of an arbitration provision in a signed agreement or an exchange of letters or telegrams.see std.bent glass,at kahn lucas lancaster,lark int l,cir united states fidelity guar.west point constr,cir finding that,under the faa,the incorporation of an arbitration provision expressed an intent of the parties to arbitrate.this argument fails to address the fact that the crewmembers signed the standard terms,the document containing the arbitration provision.
second,plaintiffs assert that,in order to satisfy the requirement,ncl bears an evidentiary burden of establishing that the crewmembers knowingly agreed to arbitrate disputes arising from the employment relationship.see pls.op.br.at.the parties disagree as to whether the crewmembers were specifically notified of the arbitration provision,and each side supports its position with affidavits.see pls.mot.for remand,exs.defs.resp.to pls.mot.for remand,exs.plaintiffs also emphasize the general solicitude for seamen reflected in the jones act and garrett.plaintiffs,however,offer no authority indicating that the convention or the convention act impose upon the party seeking arbitration the burden of demonstrating notice or knowledgeable consent.to require such an evidentiary showing in every case would be to make an unfounded inference from the terms of the convention and would be squarely at odds with a court limited jurisdictional inquiry,an inquiry colored by a strong preference for arbitration.see francisco,at.it is no better to style plaintiffs defective notice claim as an affirmative defense,as virtually every case would be susceptible to a dispute over whether the party resisting arbitration was aware of the arbitration provision when the party signed the agreement.in the limited jurisdictional inquiry prescribed by the convention act,we find it especially appropriate to abide by the general principle that o ne who has executed a written contract and is ignorant of its contents can not set up that ignorance to avoid the obligation absent fraud and misrepresentation.vulcan painters mci constructors,cir.
third,plaintiffs argue that the prerequisite remains unfulfilled because ncl did not attach the signed copies of the standard terms to its notices of removal to the district court.ncl was under no such obligation.the prerequisite does not specify when a party seeking arbitration must provide the court with the agreement in writing.the convention act removal provision states that t he procedure for removal of causes otherwise provided by law shall apply,except that the ground for removal provided in this section need not appear on the face of the complaint but may be shown in the petition for removal.section does not require a district court to review the putative arbitration investigate the validity of the signatures assuming jurisdiction the language of strongly suggests that congress intended that district courts continue to be able to assess their jurisdiction from the pleadings alone.beiser weyler,cir requiring only a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal.ncl notices of removal met procedural requirements by identifying the relevant documents and describing how they bind the plaintiffs to arbitration.see,see also whole health chiropractic wellness,humana medical plan,cir the law disfavors court meddling with removals based upon distinguished from.
iii.plaintiffs affirmative defenses fail 
the convention requires that courts enforce an agreement to arbitrate unless the agreement is null and void,inoperative or inca
