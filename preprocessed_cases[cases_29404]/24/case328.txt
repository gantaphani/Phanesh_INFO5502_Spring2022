factual background 
mme is a natural gas retailer that sells natural gas to end users in the northeastern united states.in october,mme entered into a master agreement with appellant txu,another natural gas retailer that undertook to obtain natural gas through a wholesale trading affiliate for delivery to under this master agreement,mme agreed to purchase gas from txu pursuant to written confirmations that would specify the term,volume,and price for particular purchases.for a period of approximately two years after the signing of the master agreement,mme made purchases under the agreement using written confirmations.mme also,on various occasions,made purchases of additional quantities of gas,the terms of which were negotiated by telephone with txu representatives.these telephone transactions related to what the parties refer to as purchases.transactions were transactions wherein a specified volume of gas would be ordered by mme for a period only,and the price per dekatherm of such gas would not be provided by txu until after the gas had been delivered.it also appears from the record that the telephonic transactions between the parties typically involved shorter lead times between order and delivery when compared to the purchases made by mme from txu pursuant to the written confirmation process set forth in the master agreement.
article xiv of the master agreement contained an arbitration provision indicating that any disagreement,difference or dispute among the parties arising under this agreement shall be resolved pursuant to arbitration according to the procedures set forth in this article xiv.this arbitration clause called for each party to select one arbitrator,with the two initial arbitrators thus selected jointly selecting a third.the arbitration provision further provided that t he arbitrator shall settle all disputes in accordance with the federal arbitration act and the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association,to the extent that such rules do not conflict with the terms of such act or the provisions of this agreement.
in october,mme initiated arbitration proceedings against txu pursuant to the arbitration clause contained in the master agreement.mme claimed that txu had breached the master agreement by overcharging mme for various purchases of natural gas between november and february.mme initial statement of claims indicated that the telephonic purchases referenced above were among the purchases for which mme had allegedly been overcharged.in setting forth its cause of action for breach of contract,mme statement of claims alleged that txu has further violated the agreement by supplying gas to mme for spot purchases made between november and february and subsequently overcharging mme for said purchases.the parties refer to the period between november and february as the disputed period.
txu responded to mme claims by arguing that transactions between the two parties were not governed by the pricing provisions contained in section of the master agreement.instead,txu argued in its second amended response that either a the prices for purchases were established under a separate contract between txu and mme or b the course of dealing between txu and mme had operated to modify the pricing provisions of the master agreement insofar as purchases were concerned.
the parties proceeded to arbitration,which resulted in a march,award in favor of txu.the arbitration panel found that the purchases were not governed by the master agreement,and were instead subject to a separate course of performance contract.the latter arose from the parties actual dealings,in which,according to the arbitration panel,txu had charged prices that reasonably reflected market conditions at the time of each purchase by the arbitration panel also awarded txu of its attorneys fees,finding that txu was the prevailing party in the arbitration and thus was the party under the attorney fee provision contained in the master agreement.
mme responded to the arbitration award by filing suit in district court.mme sought to vacate the arbitration award on the ground that the arbitration panel,once having determined that purchases during the disputed period were governed by a separate contract,had exceeded its authority by also stating that txu prices under that contract were reasonable and accurately reflective of prevailing market conditions.the district court agreed,holding that the arbitration panel had exceeded its authority by determining the reasonableness of txu prices under the contract.the district court also vacated the arbitration panel award of attorneys fees,finding that the panel decision concerning attorney fees was necessarily based on the panel inappropriate decision that txu charges were reasonable under the spot gas contract 
ii.analysis 
the district court exercised diversity jurisdiction over mme suit pursuant to.we exercise appellate jurisdiction over the district court final order pursuant to.
this appeal centers on the question of whether the arbitration panel exceeded the scope of its authority by stating in its written award decision that txu sales of gas to mme during the disputed period were consistently priced and properly reflected market price on the dates volumes were requested and delivered.mme argued before the district court that once the arbitration panel determined that txu sales were not governed by the pricing provision contained in the master agreement,the panel lacked authority to decide whether txu prices under a separate contract were reasonable and fairly reflected market conditions.mme based its argument on the fact that the master agreement arbitration clause covers any disagreement,difference or dispute among the parties arising under this agreement.emphasis added.mme argued that since the parties had agreed only to arbitrate disputes arising under the master agreement,the arbitration panel finding that spot gas transactions during the disputed period were not governed by the master agreement deprived the panel of the authority to address the reasonableness of txu prices under an implied contract that lacked an arbitration clause.the district court agreed with mme,holding that once the arbitration panel had determined that txu sales to mme were not subject to the master agreement,the panel inquiry should have ceased.the district court reasoned that the issue of whether txu had or had not breached a separate contract was not a dispute arising under the master agreement,and thus was not subject to arbitration.
on appeal,txu argues that the arbitration panel award reflects a legitimate exercise of the panel authority.txu maintains that the submissions made by the parties during arbitration,taken as a whole,provided a reasonable basis for the arbitration panel to conclude that it was empowered to incorporate into award its findings concerning the reasonableness of txu prices in connection with sales to mme during the disputed period.txu also argues that the district court decision fails to reflect the substantial deference owed by a federal court to an arbitration panel award pursuant to the faa.
review of arbitration awards under the faa is extremely deferential.dluhos strasberg,cir.vacatur is appropriate only in exceedingly narrow circumstances,such as where arbitrators are partial or corrupt,or where an arbitration panel manifestly disregards,rather than merely erroneously interprets,the law.see local int l of teamsters jersey coast egg producers,cir stating that error of law is insufficient basis for vacatur.likewise,an arbitrator improvident,even silly,factfinding does not provide a basis for a reviewing court to refuse to enforce the award.see major league umpires american league of professional baseball clubs,cir quoting major league baseball players ass garvey,d.
here,mme challenge to the arbitration award focuses not upon the underlying merits of the panel analysis,but rather upon whether the panel exceeded its authority by resolving in its opinion an issue the parties had not agreed to arbitrate.the district court adopted mme view,predicating its opinion on a provision in the faa which indicates that an arbitration award may be vacated if the arbitrators exceed their powers,or so imperfectly execute them that a mutual,final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.a.the concerns raised by mme and the district court arise from the principle that arbitration is a creature of contract,and an arbitration panel has the authority to decide only the issues that have been submitted for arbitration by the parties.see matteson ryder,cir.
in matteson,we considered the standard of review applicable where a party seeks to vacate an arbitration award based upon allegations that the arbitrators exceeded the scope of their authority by purporting to resolve issues the parties had not agreed to arbitrate.we began by explaining that in reviewing a district court decision concerning the validity of an arbitration award,our assessment of the arbitration panel actions is governed by the same standard that governed the district court review.see matteson,at.thus,we owe no deference to the district court analysis,and instead we exercise plenary review over the district court decision to vacate the arbitration award.
in relation to our review of the arbitration award itself,we noted that an arbitrator has the authority to decide only the issues actually submitted by the parties.see id.at citing united parcel,international brotherhood of teamsters,chauffeurs,warehousemen and helpers of america,local union,cir.we then stated that i t is the responsibility of the arbitrator in the first instance to interpret the scope of the parties submission,but it is within the courts province to review an arbitrator interpretation.id.at citing mobil oil independent oil workers union,cir.in determining the appropriate standard for our review of the arbitrator interpretation of the scope of a submission,we indicated that there is no doubt that our review of the interpretation of a submission is highly deferential.id.we also rejected the argument that lesser deference should be accorded to an arbitrator assessment of the scope of his own authority where such an assessment was based upon the arbitrator factual determinations concerning which issues were actually submitted by the parties.see id.at.however,we cautioned that e ffusively deferential language notwithstanding,the courts are neither entitled nor encouraged simply to rubber stamp the interpretations and decisions of arbitrators.id.at.
we noted in matteson that our efforts to apply this standard of review were hampered by the parties failure during the course of the arbitration jointly to prepare a single document listing the precise issues they wished to submit to the arbitration panel.see id.at.under such circumstances,we held that absent a formal,written submission,we must look to the parties conduct as a whole.id.we stated that t o determine the intent of the parties given the circumstances in this case we can not limit ourselves to simply one or a few documents.id.we also stated that we would not focus upon isolated statements within the documents submitted by the parties,but would instead examine the documents with an eye towards arranging each of them to create a complete picture.id.
to summarize,matteson indicates that the arbitrators have the authority in the first instance to interpret the scope of the parties submissions in order to identify the issues that the parties intended to arbitrate.when confronted with an allegation that the arbitrators exceeded their authority by resolving an issue the parties did not intend to submit,we will review the arbitrator interpretation of the parties intentions under a highly deferential standard.nonetheless,this deference is not a rubber stamp,and our review must focus upon the record as a whole in determining whether the arbitrators manifestly exceeded their authority in interpreting the scope of the parties submissions.
mme argues that the arbitration panel written opinion in support of the arbitration award reveals that the panel exceeded its authority.where an allegation that an arbitration panel has exceeded its authority is based upon the language of the written opinion in support of the panel award,our decision in roadway package system,kayser,cir,provides additional guidance concerning our inquiry.in roadway package,after surveying earlier authority addressing such issues,we distilled three basic principles that must guide our review a reviewing court should presume that an arbitrator acted within the scope of his or her authority this presumption may not be rebutted by an ambiguity in a written opinion but a court may conclude that an arbitrator exceeded his or her authority when it is obvious from the written opinion.at.
with these principles in mind,we turn to mme challenge to the arbitration panel award.we must question at the outset the manner in which mme and the district court have interpreted the panel written opinion supporting its award.the district court apparently adopted the view that the arbitration panel had first determined that txu sales to mme during the disputed period were governed by a contract,and had then,as a separate inquiry,determined that txu charged reasonable,prices under this contract.we do not believe the arbitration panel necessarily compartmentalized its analysis in this manner.an alternative reading of the panel written opinion is that the panel assessed the evidence concerning the prices charged by txu for transactions,found that these prices accurately reflected market conditions at the time,determined that these prices met the expectations of both parties at the time of txu spot gas sales to mme,and then held,based on the mutual satisfaction of the parties contemporaneous expectations,that transactions were governed by an implied contract rather than by the pricing structure set forth in the master agreement.
support for this reading flows from the sequence in which the arbitration panel set forth its factual findings on the second and third pages of its opinion.the panel cited testimony from txu witnesses indicating that txu intended all sales during the disputed period to be at market prices otherwise available for sale and purchase at the specific delivery points.the panel noted that these same witnesses testified that txu calculation of the market price for these transactions was based upon information drawn from the market indices contained in the industry publications inside ferc and gas daily.the panel also noted that documentation sent by txu to mme in connection with these transactions indicated that the prices for sales were different than the prices f
