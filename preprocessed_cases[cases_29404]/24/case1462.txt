introduction 
plaintiffs and appellants cable connection,tv options,swartzel electric,and orbital satellite,appeal from the trial court order in favor of defendant and respondent directv,vacating an arbitration award by which the majority of arbitrators determined that the parties arbitration agreement,though silent on the issue,nonetheless permitted classwide arbitration.code civ.the trial court vacated the arbitration award on the grounds that the arbitrators exceeded their authority by writing terms into the parties agreement the arbitrators refused to hear material evidence of intent offered by directv and the arbitrators exceeded their powers by making errors of law and erroneously relying on california procedural law,even though the arbitration agreement specifically withheld from the arbitrators the power to make errors of law,and provided that errors of law were subject to judicial review.
we conclude that the provision in the arbitration agreement purporting to provide for judicial review of errors of law is void and unenforceable,and must be severed from the agreement.accordingly,the trial court exceeded its authority when it reviewed the merits of the controversy.we further conclude that the arbitrators did not violate any express provisions of the parties agreement,and did not refuse to hear material evidence.we shall therefore reverse the order vacating the arbitration award,and shall direct the trial court to enter a new order confirming the award.
factual and procedural background 
appellants hereafter,the dealers are current and former directv dealers who sold and installed directv services and products.in,the dealers were required to enter into directv residential dealer agreement.in,the dealers were required to sign a new contract,the sales agency agreement.
both the residential dealer agreement and the sales agency agreement contain a provision requiring arbitration of disputes arising out of the agreement.both contracts are silent,however,on the issues of class action lawsuits and classwide arbitration 
the arbitration provision in the sales agency agreement,which is set forth in section of the contract,states as follows a any dispute or claim arising out of the interpretation,performance,or breach of this agreement,including without limitation claims alleging fraud in the inducement,shall be resolved only by binding arbitration,at the request of either party,in accordance with the rules of the american arbitration association,modified as herein provided the arbitrators shall apply california substantive law to the proceeding,except to the extent federal substantive law would apply to any claim the arbitrators shall not have the power to commit errors of law or legal reasoning,and the award may be vacated or corrected on appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error.the decision of the arbitrators may be entered and enforced as a final judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.the parties shall share equally the arbitrator fees and other costs of the arbitration.italics added.
section,subsection c,provides this section and any arbitration conducted hereunder shall be governed by the united states arbitration act section,et.the parties acknowledge that the transactions contemplated by this agreement involve commerce,as defined in said act.this section shall survive the termination or expiration of this agreement.
appellants initially brought suit in oklahoma state court,seeking to litigate claims on behalf of a nationwide class.the oklahoma court apparently directed the dealers to file a demand for arbitration in california state court.
on march,the dealers filed a statement of claim and demand for class arbitration with the american arbitration association aaa.the class is defined as directv dealers who sold,installed,repaired,or maintained home satellite service for directv from until the present.the dealers claimed that directv unilaterally reduced commissions and assessed chargebacks,in breach of the parties agreements.the dealers state claims for breach of contract,unfair business practices,breach of fiduciary duty,violation of california antitrust law,and conversion of commission payments.
directv served its answer and counterclaim on april.
in keeping with aaa rules,the arbitrators first addressed the issue whether the parties agreement to arbitrate permits or prohibits classwide arbitration.those rules provide upon appointment,the arbitrator shall determine as a threshold matter,in a reasoned,partial final award on the construction of the arbitration agreement,whether the applicable arbitration clause permits the arbitration to proceed on behalf of or against a class the clause construction award.the arbitrator shall stay all proceedings following the issuance of the clause construction award for a period of at least days to permit any party to move a court of competent jurisdiction to confirm or to vacate the clause construction award if any party informs the arbitrator within the period provided that it has sought judicial review,the arbitrator may stay further proceedings,or some part of them,until the arbitrator is informed of the ruling of the court.
a preliminary conference was held in november,and thereafter the parties submitted briefing on the issue of class arbitration.oral argument was held in january.
in march,the arbitration panel issued its first amended clause construction award.two of the three arbitrators agreed that the arbitration clause was silent regarding the right to bring a class action.recognizing that the arbitration agreement provided that california substantive law is to be applied,the majority construed the agreement as permitting class arbitration,pursuant to blue cross of california superior court th,d blue cross,and keating superior court cal d,keating,reversed on other grounds in southland keating,d the majority made clear that they were not yet requiring class arbitration and we not certifying a class.we are simply saying that the clause in question does not forbid class arbitration and therefore find it is permitted.
the third arbitrator dissented,finding that t here is ample indication in the parties agreement that they intended their disputes to be resolved by arbitration between them separately and individually,and not in a arbitration.the dissenting arbitrator further opined that the jurisprudence established in the keating and blue cross cases permitting classwide arbitration was inapplicable as a procedural rule in a case that is to be governed by the federal arbitration act.
directv then filed in the trial court a petition to vacate the award.the parties submitted briefs,and oral argument was held in june.after the california supreme court issued its decision in discover bank superior court cal th,d,the trial court sought additional briefing from the parties and held another oral argument.
the bases upon which directv sought vacatur were that by writing terms into the parties silent agreements,the arbitrators exceeded their authority the arbitrators refused to hear material evidence of intent offered by directv and because the arbitration agreement specifically withheld from the arbitrators the power to make errors of law,the arbitrators exceeded their authority by making errors of law and legal reasoning.
on november,the trial court vacated the award,finding that the arbitrators exceeded their powers by rewriting the parties agreements to allow for classwide arbitration,by applying keating,supra,cal d,and blue cross,supra,th,d finding them to be inapplicable because they establish procedural and not substantive law,and committed reversible error by failing to admit extrinsic evidence offered by directv.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
this appeal is taken from the trial court order vacating the arbitrators partial final award establishing that the parties arbitration agreement permits classwide arbitration code civ,party may petition court to confirm,correct or vacate arbitration award,subd.c aggrieved party may appeal from order vacating an award.the parties do not dispute that it was proper for the arbitrators to decide,in the first instance,whether classwide arbitration is permitted under their agreement.rather,directv contends that the arbitrators wrongly decided that classwide arbitration is to be permitted even though they found the agreement to be silent on the issue and that,accordingly,the trial court properly vacated the award.an arbitration award may be vacated where the trial court determines that t he arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted,subd.a.
the dealers contend that the trial court erred in vacating the arbitrators award because the arbitrators did not exceed their powers,and indeed,the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction by examining whether the arbitrators made errors of law.they argue that,despite the presence of language in the arbitration agreement purporting to allow for judicial review of errors of law by the arbitrators,such review is not permissible.as we shall explain,we agree.
we recognize that the dealers did not raise this argument in the trial court,and instead responded only on the merits of directv legal arguments against the award.however,we decline directv suggestion that we consider the issue as having been forfeited because it is being raised for the first time on appeal.this court has discretion to consider a new theory on appeal which presents an issue of law based on undisputed facts.in re santos th,fn,d.because the issue involves whether the trial court exceeded its statutory authority to review arbitration awards under the california arbitration act,et,and whether by contract the parties can expand the court authority under the of continuing public concern and involving important public find forfeiture to be inappropriate,and shall consider the issue.neumann melgar th,d.
judicial review of arbitration awards 
in determining whether an arbitrator exceeded his powers,we review the trial court decision de novo,while giving substantial deference to the arbitrators own assessment of their contractual authority.advanced micro devices,intel cal th,d.
the parties contract contained standard language regarding arbitration,that a ny dispute or claim arising out of the interpretation,performance,or breach of this agreement,shall be resolved only by binding arbitration,at the request of either party.italics added.as is typically the case in arbitration agreements,the parties thus indicated their intent that the arbitration award would be final.
it is by now that both because it vindicates the intentions of the parties that the award be final,and because an arbitrator is not ordinarily constrained to decide according to the rule of law,it is the general rule that,the merits of the controversy between the parties are not subject to judicial review.citations.more specifically,courts will not review the validity of the arbitrator reasoning.citations.further,a court may not review the sufficiency of the evidence supporting an arbitrator award.citations.thus,it is the general rule that,with narrow exceptions,an arbitrator decision can not be reviewed for errors of fact or law.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,hereafter moncharsh.
directv points out,however,that moncharsh also recognized that arbitration agreements are contracts,and that parties to such contracts may vary the terms of their agreement.the moncharsh court stated in cases involving private arbitration,t he scope of arbitration is a matter of agreement between the parties citation,and t he powers of an arbitrator are limited and circumscribed by the agreement or stipulation of submission.citations.moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.directv contends that the trial court was not bound to follow moncharsh limitations on judicial review in light of the parties specific arbitration contract which required the arbitrators to follow the rule of law,and provided for judicial review of errors of law.
however,the moncharsh court also made clear its view that the legislature placed limits on the scope and availability of judicial review of arbitration awards,and that state courts and parties must abide by those statutory limits.section,et,the california arbitration act,represents a comprehensive statutory scheme regulating private arbitration in this state.citation.moncharsh,supra,at,d.the court conclude d that an award reached by an arbitrator pursuant to a contractual agreement to arbitrate is not subject to judicial review except on the grounds set forth in sections to vacate and for correction.id.at,d.the legislature set forth various grounds for vacation and correction of arbitration awards,and a n error of law is not one of the grounds.citation.id.at,d.
the moncharsh court further explained in light of the development of decisional law embracing as exclusive the statutory grounds to vacate an arbitration award,as well as the apparent intent of the legislature to generally exclude nonstatutory grounds to vacate an award,we adhere to the line of cases that limit judicial review of private arbitration awards to those cases in which there exists a statutory ground to vacate or correct the award.those decisions permitting review of an award where an error of law appears on the face of the award causing substantial injustice have perpetuated a point of view that is inconsistent with the modern view of private arbitration and are therefore disapproved.moncharsh,supra,at,d,italics added.in addition,the court made clear that arbitrators do not exceed their powers within the meaning of former section,subdivision d now subdivision a,or section,subdivision b,by making errors of law in reaching their decision.it is well settled that arbitrators do not exceed their powers merely because they assign an erroneous reason for their decision.citations.a contrary holding would permit the exception to swallow the rule of limited judicial review a litigant could always contend the arbitrator erred and thus exceeded his powers.id.at,d.
the language in the arbitration agreement at issue here,that the arbitrators shall not have the power to commit errors of law or legal reasoning,has no effect on the availability of judicial review for errors of law.while the agreement varied in this respect from the typical arbitration agreement contemplated by the moncharsh court,in which the arbitrators are not constrained to follow the rule of law,still the review which may be conducted by the courts is limited by statute.an argument similar to the one directv makes here was rejected in pacific gas electric superior court th,d.the court stated appellant argues that this case lies within exceptions to the general rule.its most claim is that an arbitration award predicated upon a qualified submission,by which the arbitrator is directed to apply the law as would a court,is reviewable for errors of law.appellant impliedly locates this exception in former section,subdivision d now subdivision a,which directs the vacation of an award when the arbitrators exceeded their powers the argument simply put is that if the arbitrators are directed to apply the law and fail to do so they exceed their powers.the claim is not persuasive.it confuses the mode of decision with its finality.pacific gas electric superior court,supra,th at,d,italics added,fn.omitted abrogated on other grounds by advanced micro devices,intel,supra,cal th at,d.accord baize eastridge companies th,d.
the court in alexander blue cross of california th,d agreed.arbitrators do not exceed their powers within the meaning of former section,subdivision d merely by rendering an erroneous decision on a legal or factual issue,so long as the issue was within the scope of the controversy submitted to the arbitrators.the arbitrator resolution of these issues is what the parties bargained for in the arbitration agreement.moncharsh,supra,at d.moshonov walsh cal th,d,italics added.in short,h aving submitted the issue to arbitration,plaintiff can not maintain the arbitrator exceeded his powers,within the meaning of section,subdivision b,by deciding it,even if he decided it incorrectly.moore first bank of san luis obispo cal th,d.alexander blue cross of california,supra,th at,d.the alexander court continued even where an arbitration agreement requires the arbitrator to apply a particular law or body of law,an arbitrator failure to apply such a law is not in excess of an arbitrator powers within the meaning of section,subdivision d.marsch williams th,d arbitrator did not exceed power by failing to apply california corporations law even though agreement stated that california law was to control.a different conclusion would unduly extend the scope of judicial review of arbitration proceedings.the fact that the parties restrict the arbitrator to a decision of the issues in the manner of a court of law does not mean that they expect that the decision is reviewable.the mode of decision and its reviewability are separate questions.pacific gas electric superior court,supra,th at d,italics added.alexander blue cross of california,supra,th at,d.
in addition,of course,the arbitration agreement at issue here provided that the award may be vacated or corrected on appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error of law or legal reasoning.suffice it to say,however,that we are in accord with the appellate courts that have previously considered the effect of similar language and concluded that parties can not contractually expand the jurisdiction of the trial courts to permit review of arbitration awards for legal error.
in crowell downey community hospital foundation th,d hereafter crowell,the plaintiff complaint sought a declaration of rights as to the enforceability of an arbitration provision explicitly requiring that the arbitrator make findings of fact and conclusions of law,that the award be supported by law and substantial evidence,and that the merits of the award be subject to court review.specifically,the arbitration agreement stated that upon the petition of any party to the arbitration,a court shall have the authority to review the transcript of the arbitration proceedings and the arbitrator award and shall have the authority to vacate the arbitrator award,in whole or in part,on the basis that the award is not supported by substantial evidence or is based upon an error of law.crowell,supra,at,d.
relying on moncharsh,supra,and its conclusion that the statutory bases for vacating and correcting arbitration awards are exclusive,the crowell court held that the contractual language quoted above was void and unenforceable.crowell,supra,at,d.it concluded that,because the legislature clearly set forth the trial court jurisdiction to review arbitration awards when it specified the grounds for vacating or correcting awards in sections and,parties can not expand that jurisdiction by contract to include a review on the merits 
the crowell court further noted,as did the court in moncharsh,that the legislature specifically provided in section,governing public construction contract arbitration agreements,that the parties may agree to judicial review of an arbitrator award crowell,supra,at,d moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.section also specifies that,if the parties agreement so provides,a court shall vacate the award if upon review the court finds the award to be unsupported by substantial evidence,or to be based on an error of law.
regarding section,the moncharsh court observed by specifically providing in that provision for judicial review and correction of error,but not in section,we may infer that the legislature did not intend to confer traditional judicial review in private arbitration cases.where a statute,with reference to one subject contains a given provision,the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject is significant to show that a different intention existed.citation.people drake cal d.moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.see also crowell,supra,th at,d no such review is authorized for other forms of arbitration in the act.this suggests the legislative intent that parties can not agree to a review on the merits.if that were not the case section would be superfluous.
crowell was followed in county coliseum authority cc partners th,d cc partners,in which the parties license agreement contained a provision purporting to allow for de novo judicial review of questions of law decided by the arbitrator the cc partners court agreed with the holding in crowell,that the parties to an arbitration agreement can not contractually expand the scope of judicial review beyond that provided by statute.cc partners,supra,at,d,citing crowell,supra,th at,d.
directv further contends that because the parties specified that the federal arbitration act faa would govern the arbitration proceedings,we are constrained to enforce the arbitration agreement according to its terms,including the provision that allows for judicial review of legal error.directv cites the case of volt info.sciences leland stanford,d volt,as authority for the proposition that the primary purpose of the faa is to ensur e that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their terms in order to give effect to the contractual rights and expectations of the parties.however,numerous federal circuit courts have considered the precise issue whether private parties may contract for an expanded standard of judicial review of arbitral decisions under the faa.the circuits are currently split on whether to extend the ruling in volt to permit enforcement of such provisions.
the ninth circuit court of appeals has held that federal courts may only review an arbitrator decision on the grounds set forth in the faa which grounds are admittedly broader than those set forth in the california arbitration act,and that private parties have no power to alter or expand those grounds.kyocera cir en banc kyocera,overruling lapine technology kyocera cir see discussion thereof in crowell,supra,th at,d.w e conclude that congress has explicitly prescribed a much narrower role for federal courts reviewing arbitral decisions.the faa enumerates limited grounds on which a federal court may vacate,modify,or correct an arbitral award.neither erroneous legal conclusions nor unsubstantiated factual findings justify federal court review of an arbitral award under the statute,which is unambiguous in this regard.because the constitution reserves to congress the power to determine the standards by which federal courts render decisions,and because congress has specified the exclusive standard by which federal courts may review an arbitrator decision,we hold that private parties may not contractually impose their own standard on the courts.kyocera,supra,at.
the kyocera court continued p rivate parties have no power to determine the rules by which federal courts proceed,especially when congress has explicitly prescribed those standards.pursuant to volt,parties have complete freedom to contractually modify the arbitration process by designing whatever procedures and systems they think will best meet their review by one or more appellate arbitration panels.once a case reaches the federal courts,however,the private arbitration process is complete,and because congress has specified standards for confirming an arbitration award,federal courts must act pursuant to those standards and no others.private parties freedom to fashion their own arbitration process has no bearing whatsoever on their inability to amend the statutorily prescribed standards governing federal court review.kyocera,supra,at,italics added.
the seventh and tenth circuits have similarly held that private parties can not contract for a different standard of judicial review.see chicago typographical union chicago cir,bowen amoco pipeline cir.see also uhc management computer sciences cir,strongly suggesting that the faa precludes parties from agreeing to an alternate standard of review,but resolving the matter on other grounds.
in contrast,the first,third,fourth,and fifth circuits have held that the faa does not preclude parties from agreeing to an expanded standard of judicial review.see puerto rico telephone phone cir,roadway package system,kayser cir,syncor intern.mcleland cir,table wl unpublished gateway technologies mci telecommunications cir.
insofar as we need pronounce on the issue,we agree with the reasoning of the ninth circuit in kyocera,supra.nothing in the faa purports to give private parties the power to expand by contract the statutorily conferred jurisdiction of courts to vacate arbitration awards.just as the faa does not compel federal courts to enforce attempts to contractually expand their limited power to review arbitral decisions,it also does not compel california courts to enforce attempts to contractually expand their power to review arbitral decisions conferred by the california arbitration act.thus,we decide that we are not required by the faa to enforce the arbitration agreement according to its terms,including the provision that allows for judicial review of legal error.
accordingly,we conclude that the arbitration award before us was subject to the limited judicial review described by the supreme court in moncharsh.as such,the merits of the controversy between the parties were not properly subject to judicial review.the trial court candidly stated that i n determining whether to vacate the award,it was required to analyze whether the arbitrators properly applied california law,and whether the arbitrators made errors of law.however,the trial court was not authorized to review the validity of the arbitrators reasoning for errors of fact or law,or to determine whether the evidence was sufficient to support the arbitrators award.moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.in deciding that the arbitrators misapplied california substantive law regarding contract interpretation by inserting a new term into the sales agency agreement to permit classwide arbitration,the trial court categorically exceeded the reach of its authority.there is no dispute that deciding whether classwide arbitration was to be permitted was a matter within the scope of the controversy submitted to the arbitrators,and that the arbitrator resolution of this issue is what the parties bargained for in the arbitration agreement.the trial court could not properly find that the arbitrators exceeded their powers within the meaning of section,subdivision a,by deciding the issue incorrectly.moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d,moshonov walsh,supra,cal th at,d,moore first bank of san luis obispo,supra,cal th at,d,alexander blue cross of california,supra,th at,d.
disregard of an express provision in the arbitration agreement 
directv contends that the trial court order vacating the award nonetheless finds support in case law establishing that arbitrators exceed their powers within the meaning of section by disregarding express provisions of the arbitration agreement.for example,in belgum th,d,a dispute involving dissolution of a law partnership,the court of appeal reversed the trial court judgment confirming an arbitration award,with directions to vacate the award,on the basis that the arbitrator had exceeded his powers by awarding a remedy that was forbidden by the parties partnership agreement.the award directed the withdrawing partners to forfeit their capital accounts,despite the fact that the partnership agreement at issue expressly provided for a return of capital,even to a wrongfully withdrawing partner.in addition,the partnership agreement was governed by the uniform partnership act,in which no provision is made for forfeiture of capital accounts id.at,d.
similarly,in california faculty superior court th,d,in reviewing a university president decision not to grant tenure to a professor,the arbitrator authority was limited by the parties agreement to determining whether the president decision was based on reasoned judgment or constituted an abuse of discretion.the arbitrator was not to undertake an independent evaluation of the professor performance and scholarly achievements,but clearly did so in overturning the president decision.id.at,d.the court found that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority as expressly defined by the parties agreement,and therefore affirmed the trial court grant of the university motion to vacate the award.id.at,d.
finally,in bonshire thompson th,d,the underlying contract contained an arbitration clause and an integration clause that expressly barred the arbitrator from considering extrinsic evidence in interpreting the contract.bonshire thompson,supra,th at,d.one of the parties to the contract sought to reform it,and the arbitrator examined extrinsic evidence in framing the arbitration award.id.at,d.the court concluded that the arbitrator had exceeded his powers,given the express prohibition on extrinsic evidence.id.at,d.
by contrast here,the arbitrators did not violate any similarly express provision in the sales agency agreement.directv contends that certain language in the agreement indicates that the parties contemplated only separate and individual arbitrations rather than classwide arbitration.that is vastly different from saying that the agreement expressly prohibits classwide arbitration.there simply is no provision in the parties agreement that prohibits classwide arbitration.the cases cited above upon which directv relies are entirely distinguishable.
erroneous application of california procedural law 
directv further contends that the arbitrators exceeded their powers by relying on keating superior court,supra,cal d,approving of classwide arbitration and blue cross,supra,th,d permitting arbitrators to order classwide arbitration in a case governed by federal arbitration act where the parties agreement is silent because those cases establish only procedural law,and the arbitration agreement at issue directs the arbitrators to apply federal procedural law and california substantive law.we disagree with directv characterization of keating and blue cross as establishing only procedural law when they held classwide arbitration to be permissible.
substance and procedure are not static legal concepts.a statute or other rule of law will be characterized as substantive or procedural according to the nature of the problem for which a characterization must be made.grant mcauliffe cal d.as a general rule,laws which fix duties,establish rights and responsibilities among and for persons are substantive laws in character,while those which merely prescribe the manner in which such rights and responsibilities may be exercised and enforced in court are procedural laws.vienna california horse racing bd.d,citing black law dict.ed.berman rca auto d.
taken together,keating and blue cross established that,under appropriate circumstances,parties to adhesion contracts enjoy the right to pursue redress of grievances by way of classwide arbitration.their conclusions were based in large part on the fact that arbitration is highly favored,as well as the perception that gross unfairness would result in some cases from the denial of the opportunity to proceed on a classwide basis.see blue cross,supra,at,d.in this context,the right to pursue classwide arbitration can not be said to constitute a mere procedural vehicle.rather,it is more accurately described as constituting a substantive right.
in discover bank superior court,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court discussed the procedural and substantive elements of the doctrine of unconscionability,in the context of considering the enforceability of class action waivers in contracts of adhesion.the court comments in that regard are instructive for our purposes here.it said some courts have viewed class actions or arbitrations as a merely procedural right,the waiver of which is not unconscionable.see,strand bank national association nd,strand blaz belfer cir,johnson west suburban bank cir,champ siegel trading,cir,but see leonard terminix intern.so d,class action waiver together with limitation of damages clause in adhesive consumer arbitration agreement deprives plaintiffs of a meaningful remedy and is therefore unconscionable state berger,holding contract provision limiting class action rights unconscionable powertel bexley so d,same.but as the above cited cases of this court have continually affirmed class actions and arbitrations are,particularly in the consumer context,often inextricably linked to the vindication of substantive rights.affixing the procedural label on such devices understates their importance and is not helpful in resolving the unconscionability issue.discover bank superior court,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
we conclude that the trial court erred in ruling that the arbitrators exceeded their powers by relying on principles established in keating and blue cross,as the holdings of these cases do indeed constitute substantive law,which the arbitrators were directed to follow.as such,even if the arbitration award were properly reviewable by the trial court and by this court for legal error,the trial court ruling that the majority arbitrators erred in their application of california substantive law would require reversal.the law established in blue cross and keating gives arbitrators discretion to order classwide arbitration even where the arbitration agreement is silent on that issue,in divergence from the general rules of contract interpretation that terms are not to be inserted into contracts.
refusal to admit extrinsic evidence 
directv submitted to the arbitrators the declarations of several equipment retailers and of the person who drafted the sales agency agreement on behalf of directv,in an effort to support its argument that the parties did not intend to permit classwide arbitration when they entered into the arbitration agreement in the sales agency agreement.directv contends that the trial court properly vacated the arbitration award on the basis that the arbitrators failed to consider relevant extrinsic evidence,the retailers and drafter declarations.pursuant to section,subdivision a,a trial court shall vacate an arbitration award if the court determines that the rights of the party were substantially prejudiced by the refusal of the arbitrators to hear evidence material to the controversy.the trial court based its vacation of the award,in part,on this ground.we conclude that the trial court erred in so doing.
the record on appeal contains the following comments by one of the arbitrators the next issue to address was the request that the panel was going to consider the declarations attached to respondent brief that the declarants be required to let the declarants be physically present today.we all read the brief and we have read the declarations,but our view is that it essentially a question of law and construction interpretation of the contract itself.and so the declarations are not of significance but it is denied.
thus,the request that was denied was that the panel allow the declarants to be physically present the denial was not with regard to admitting the declarations.in addition,the statement by the arbitrator that we have read the declarations,effectively ends our inquiry because it definitively demonstrates that the arbitrators did not refus e to hear evidence material to the controversy,subd.a.
the court in gonzales interinsurance exchange d.concluded that alleging a failure to consider evidence is not tantamount to alleging a refusal to hear evidence,and failure to allege a refusal to hear evidence renders fatally defective a petition to vacate brought pursuant to section,subdivision a.webster defines the words consider and hear to leave no other conclusion.hear is to perceive by the auditory sense to take cognizance of by ear to give audience or allowance to speak to listen to consider is to view attentively to fix the mind on,with a view to careful examination to think on with care to ponder to study to meditate on it is obvious from these definitions that the two words are not synonymous.one can not consider what one has refused to hear.legally speaking the admission of evidence is to hear it,and the weighing of it is to give it consideration.the failure to allege a refusal to hear evidence renders this petition fatally defective in this respect,since failure to consider evidence is not a ground to vacate the award.id.at.see also cal.jur d arbitration and award,database updated may.
the record on appeal makes clear that the arbitrators did not refus e to hear evidence material to the controversy,subd.a,italics added.vacation of the award on this basis was not warranted.
in any event,the declarations at issue were not relevant.they merely offered the subjective opinions of a few dealers and the drafter of the arbitration agreement for directv regarding their undisclosed understanding and intention that the arbitration provision would not permit classwide arbitration,without relating any objective facts surrounding the negotiations over the provision that would demonstrate that the matter was considered or discussed.
although the intent of the parties determines the meaning of the contract,the relevant intent is objective that is,the objective intent as evidenced by the words of the instrument,not a party subjective intent.beck american health group,d.the true intent of a contracting party is irrelevant if it remains unexpressed.d.see also city of mill valley transamerica ins.d.shaw regents of university of california th,d.see also titan group,sonoma valley county sanitation dist.d.it is the objective intent,as evidenced by the words of the contract,rather than the subjective intent of one of the parties,that controls interpretation.i t is now a settled principle of the law of contract that the undisclosed intentions of the parties are immaterial and that the outward manifestation or expression of assent is controlling.brant california dairies,cal d.hess ford motor cal th,d,because the testimony of the contracting parties described their disclosed intentions,it was undoubtedly relevant.as such,we do not address the issue whether undisclosed intentions are admissible to assist the trier of fact in understanding the surrounding circumstances and negotiations neverkovec fredericks th at,fn.d.as such,we further conclude that the arbitrators did not refus e to hear evidence material to the controversy,subd.a,italics added.
severability 
the parties did not initially address in their briefs on appeal what the effect should be were we to conclude,as we have,that the trial court exceeded its authority by examining the legal merits of the arbitrators award.we therefore requested supplemental briefing from the parties to address the following issue if this court determines to be invalid and unenforceable the provision in the parties arbitration agreement that the award may be vacated or corrected on appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction for any errors of law or legal reasoning,can that provision be severed from the arbitration agreement 
the alternatives would be to sever the invalid provision,to find the entire arbitration agreement to be void,or to remand the matter for the purpose of holding an evidentiary hearing on the issue.having considered the applicable law and the supplemental briefing,in which directv argues against severability and the dealers argue in favor thereof,we conclude that the invalid provision can and should be severed from the arbitration agreement.
in crowell,supra,th at page,d,the appellate court concluded that t he provision for judicial review of the merits of the arbitration award was so central to the arbitration agreement that it could not be severed.to do so would be to create an entirely new agreement to which neither party agreed.accordingly,the crowell court concluded that the plaintiff could not amend his complaint for declaratory relief to sever the unenforceable provisions of the arbitration agreement,with the effect that the entire arbitration agreement was determined to be null and void.
the court in cc partners,supra,th,d,also found invalid a provision in an arbitration agreement that attempted to permit judicial review of legal errors,but diverged from the crowell court with regard to the severability of the invalid provision.the court analysis is instructive,and we therefore quote from it at some length we agree with the primary holding in crowell.we do not have the power to review de novo any questions of law decided by the arbitrator.that does not mean,however,that we necessarily follow crowell and find the parties arbitration agreement void and unenforceable.
the crowell court was not reviewing a judgment confirming an arbitration award.it was reviewing the sust
