up operates a railway system in the central and western portions of the united states.bmwed is an unincorporated labor association and the collective bargaining representative for those up employees who maintain,repair,and inspect railroad tracks and other railroad facilities.up and bmwed are parties to several collective bargaining agreements cbas,including agreements that cover different portions of up railway system for example,one cba covers employees who work on the up proper,which encompasses the northern and western portions of the up system,and includes facilities and operations in laramie,wyoming.this cba will be referred to herein as the up proper agreement.another cba covers employees who work on the southern division,which,as its name suggests,encompasses the southern portion of the up system,and includes facilities and operations in north little rock,arkansas.this cba is generally referred to as the mprr agreement in addition to the cbas that cover portions of the railway system,up and bmwed are also parties to an cba dated february,the february agreement which provides,in pertinent part,that carriers such as up have the right to transfer work transfer employees throughout the system which do not require the crossing of craft lines.app.at.
in performing track construction and maintenance,employees engage in what is referred to as fabrication,which involves attaching rails to wooden ties to create a section of track.id.at.a necessary component of this process is plating the ties,which involves attaching plates to the wooden ties.the rails are then,in turn,fastened to the ties.
the up proper agreement provides,in pertinent part,that the c onstruction and maintenance of roadway and track,such as rail laying,tie renewals,ballasting,surfacing and lining track,fabrication of track panels and other work incidental thereto will be performed by forces in the track subdepartment.id.at.in,however,up announced that it would begin purchasing track panels for use on the up proper,and would therefore close its plant in laramie,wyoming,where employees fabricated track panels for use on the up proper.bmwed responded by filing suit against up in federal court.that case was ultimately dismissed as a minor dispute under the rla and referred for compulsory arbitration.see of maint.of way employees union pac.cir bmwed i.an arbitration board established by the parties under the rla and headed by neutral member gerald wallin ultimately agreed with bmwed that up purchase of track panels violated the provision of the up proper agreement the wallin award app.at.
in,up began purchasing and installing rail ties on the up proper.bmwed,concerned that this action was prohibited by the up proper agreement,complained and the matter,which was again classified as a minor dispute,was ultimately submitted to arbitration.on april,an arbitration board established by the parties under the rla and headed by neutral member herbert fishgold found that up purchase of ties would violate the provisions of the up proper agreement by taking work away from employees the fishgold award id.at.
on december,up notified bmwed that,pursuant to the terms of the february agreement,it was transferring all tie plating work being performed on the up proper to its north little rock,arkansas,track panel plant located in up southern division.id.at.the work at that plant is governed by the mprr agreement and the past practices thereunder.in its notice,up indicated that the transferred work would be performed by employees coming under the jurisdiction of the mprr agreement.id.up asserts,and bmwed does not deny,that in the southern division up has a practice of purchasing ties from third parties,a practice in which bmwed has acquiesced.app.at.bmwed,however,appears to have been under the impression that all the transferred work would still be done by employees.id.at see also aplee br.at.
in early,disputes arose between bmwed and up regarding up use of ties,including ties that up purchased prior to the issuance of the fishgold award.id.at.for example,in january,bmwed contacted up and objected after learning that up was performing track work in nampa,idaho,using ties that were not by employees.accordingly,on february,bmwed filed a lawsuit seeking to enforce the fishgold award.brotherhood of maint.of way employes union pac,case.bmwed ii.id.at.up moved to dismiss bmwed lawsuit,arguing that it was a minor dispute over which the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction as to the merits,up position was that the wallin and fishgold awards had been rendered moot by the transfer of the work to a location within the scope of the mprr agreement.on january,the district court granted up motion to dismiss and up motion for a preliminary injunction prohibiting bmwed from striking.id.at.in doing so,the district court agreed that the dispute was a minor one,in that it would require the district court to interpret the fishgold award in several respects.accordingly,the district court remanded the matter to the fishgold arbitration board.
while the bmwed ii suit was still pending,bmwed learned that up had entered into an arrangement with a company named nevada rr.under up arrangement with nevada rr,nevada rr set up a facility in up north little rock yard and,using employees,produced ties there which it then provided to up.in the spring of,bmwed confirmed that up was buying from nevada rr ties for installation on up proper lines.
on april,bmwed filed the present lawsuit against up.bmwed complaint alleged that,by installing on the up proper rail ties and track panels produced by nevada rr,up violated section seventh of the rla by effecting a unilateral change of the up proper agreement in conjunction with the filing of its lawsuit,bmwed served a strike notice on up.
up moved to dismiss bmwed lawsuit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,contending the dispute was a minor one,and that the lawsuit was essentially identical to bmwed ii.up also moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting bmwed from striking.on october,the district court issued an order conditionally granting up motion to dismiss and preliminarily enjoining a strike by bmwed.in its order,the district court concluded that the dispute at issue was a minor one and that it therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute.notably,however,the district court granted up motions pursuant to the following conditions 
a.the parties submit the issues in dispute to the special board of adjustment known as the fishgold board or panel within days of the date of this order 
up shall continue to require that any ties installed on the up proper be by employees represented by bmwed 
in its appeal,up contends the district court erred,and indeed lacked subject matter jurisdiction,to condition the granting of the injunction on the parties submitting their dispute to the fishgold arbitration panel.questions involving a district court subject matter jurisdiction are reviewed de novo by this court.see australian gold,hatfield,cir.assuming the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to issue an injunction,we review for abuse of discretion the district court decision to grant that injunction,including the conditions placed by the district court on that injunction.see brotherhood of locomotive engineers,d mkt see also wyandotte nation sebelius,cir noting the general rule that abuse of discretion standard applies to district court grant or denial of preliminary injunction.in doing so,we review the district court determinations of law de novo.burlington northern santa fe ry.of locomotive eng rs,cir.a district court necessarily abuses its discretion when it commits an error of law,and a decision to grant a preliminary injunction that is premised on an error of law is entitled to no deference and must be reversed.united air lines int l ass of machinist and aerospace workers,cir.
the rla dispute resolution framework 
we begin by outlining the rla dispute resolution framework in general,and its minor dispute resolution framework in particular.the rla provides a comprehensive and mandatory framework for the resolution of labor disputes between carriers,railroad operators and labor organizations that represent employees of those carriers.see hawaiian airlines,norris,d.under this framework,such disputes are classified as either major or minor.see id.major disputes relate to the formation of collective bargaining agreements or efforts to secure them.id.brackets in original internal quotation marks omitted.minor disputes,in contrast,relate either to the meaning or proper application of a particular provision of a cba with reference to a specific situation or to an omitted case.consol.rail ry.labor executives ass n,d conrail.in other words,major disputes seek to create contractual rights,minor disputes to enforce them.id.at.in this case,it is now uncontroverted that the parties dispute is a minor one under the rla as were the prior two disputes that lead to the wallin and fishgold awards.
the rla minor dispute resolution procedures 
the rla offers two alternative mechanisms for the resolution of minor disputes.first,either party to a minor dispute may petition the national railroad adjustment board nrab to decide the dispute,first i.the nrab is a permanent,arbitration panel composed of total members,half of which are selected by carriers and the other half of which are selected by labor organizations that represent railroad employees.id.first a.if the nrab is unable to resolve a dispute because of a deadlock or inability to secure a majority vote of its members,a neutral person,known as a referee,is selected to sit with the nrab and help resolve the dispute.id.first l.second,and alternatively,the parties to a minor dispute can,if mutually agreeable,establish their own arbitration board to resolve the dispute.id.second.under this procedure,each party to a minor dispute typically appoints one member to the arbitration board.id.if the arbitration board is unable to agree on the outcome of the dispute,a third,neutral member is selected to help resolve the dispute.id.whichever of the two procedures is used,an award resolving the dispute is considered final and binding upon both parties to the dispute.id.first m second.
in their prior disputes,bmwed and up relied on arbitration boards,the wallin and fishgold boards,rather than the nrab.the wallin board concluded that up violated the up proper agreement when it used persons other than employees to fabricate track panels to be used in constructing and maintaining tracks on the up proper.the fishgold board concluded that the of rail ties for use in the construction and maintenance of tracks was work which was to be performed by employees,and that the of such tracks by a manufacturer violated that rule.
district court subject matter jurisdiction 
up contends that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to place conditions on the granting of up motions.more specifically,up contends that,once the district court determined that the claim forwarded in bmwed amended complaint raised a minor dispute,it had no subject matter jurisdiction over the lawsuit,and thus no authority to place conditions on its dismissal of the case.aplt.br.at.
as up correctly notes,district courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over minor disputes.see consol.rail,at.that said,however,district courts may enjoin strikes arising out of minor disputes.id.at.as the supreme court stated in brotherhood of railroad trainmen chicago river and indiana railroad company,d,it has authorized the use of injunctive relief to vindicate the processes of the railway labor act.that is,the supreme court has approved of district courts enjoining strikes during the consideration of minor disputes by the boards authorized under the rla to hear such disputes.in addition,the supreme court has also held that a district court may impose conditions on such injunctive relief,at least where the conditions are designed to promote the interests of justice,and also to preserve the jurisdiction of the rla arbitration board.mkt,at.thus,contrary to up assertion,we conclude the district court had jurisdiction to not only enjoin bmwed from striking during the resolution of the parties minor dispute,but to also place conditions on the granting of that injunctive relief.
did the condition imposed by the district court amount to an abuse of discretion 
that leads to up main argument,that the district court erred when it conditioned the injunction upon the parties minor dispute being remanded to,and decided by,the fishgold board.in electing to impose this condition,the district court offered two rationales the possibility of inconsistent decisions from two different arbitration panels,the fishgold board and a new board created by the parties to hear the instant dispute and reference to a panel with familiarity of the issues,the fishgold board preserves arbitration resources and leads to more efficient resolution app.at.
although both of these rationales seem reasonable at first blush,the condition imposed by the district court is inconsistent with the remedial scheme for minor disputes set forth in the rla.as previously noted,when a minor dispute within the scope of the rla arises,the rla affords the parties two alternative,and exclusive,methods for resolving the dispute submit the dispute for arbitration before the nrab or establish their own arbitration board and have that board resolve the dispute.by conditioning its grant of the injunction on the parties submitting their dispute to the fishgold panel,the district court effectively ignored these provisions of the rla and deprived up of its statutory right to have either the nrab or a decide the dispute based upon its pleadings,up appears to favor the creation of a new board.see generally mkt,at.noting that a federal district court authority to enjoin a strike arising out of a minor dispute hinges on the dispute being properly submitted for arbitration under the provisions of the rla,noting that the federal courts ought not act in such a way as to infringe upon the jurisdiction of the nrab order of ry.conductors of america pitney.holding that district court erred in granting a permanent injunction finally resolving the merits of a minor dispute between a railroad and two employee accredited bargaining agents that was within the jurisdiction of the nrab pursuant to the rla.
importantly,the rla expressly provides that an arbitration board newly formed by the parties would have authority to determine all matters not previously agreed upon by up and bmwed with respect to the establishment and jurisdiction of the board.second.in other words,a board could first decide,as a threshold matter,whether the parties instant dispute involved interpretations of the up proper agreement,the mprr agreement,the february agreement,the fishgold award.to the extent the board determined the instant dispute involved an interpretation of the fishgold award,it could then,pursuant to first m,refer the dispute back to the fishgold board for resolution.similarly,to the extent the board determined the instant dispute involved an interpretation of the february agreement,it could refer the dispute to the arbitration board specified in the february agreement,special board of adjustment.
the possibility that a arbitration board might render an award inconsistent with the fishgold award is simply a product of
