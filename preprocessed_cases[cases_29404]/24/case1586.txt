plaintiff and appellant edward fittante plaintiff appeals a final judgment dismissing his wrongful termination action against his employer,defendant and respondent palm springs motors,the employer.the trial court had instead sent the matter to arbitration.in the context of granting the employer motion to compel arbitration of plaintiff employment dispute,the court also denied plaintiff motion to require the employer to pay the arbitrator fees.
plaintiff asserts that the arbitration agreement,required as a condition of employment,was invalid as an unconscionable adhesion contract,under armendariz foundation health psychcare services,mercuro superior court and stirlen supercuts,we discern differences between the arbitration agreement at issue here and those involved in the cited cases that ameliorate the perceived oppressive conditions and effects that rendered those agreements unconscionable.accordingly,we conclude,except for one severable portion,that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable.we do agree with plaintiff,however,that vindication of his unwaivable statutory rights claim under labor code section mandates that the employer bear the cost of the arbitrator fees.we shall therefore reverse the order compelling arbitration with directions for modification,to make clear both that the employer must bear the costs of arbitration,and that the purported appeal clause is invalid.
facts and procedural history 
as of march,plaintiff was employed as a mechanic or service technician at an automobile dealership in beverly hills,california.on march,plaintiff applied for a similar position with the employer,an automobile dealer in palm springs.
the job application consisted of several pages.plaintiff signed the last page of the application,entitled applicant statement and agreement applicant statement.the applicant statement included a provision for arbitration of disputes between the employee and the company.it is that arbitration provision which is at issue here.
the employer service director showed plaintiff data indicating that work of the specialized kind that plaintiff performed was plentiful,and that he therefore could expect an income at least equal to that he was earning in beverly hills.
plaintiff quit his beverly hills job and moved his family to the desert on the strength of the employer representations.after he started working in palm springs,plaintiff discovered the representations were false.plaintiff stayed on the job,even at a reduced income,because he had very little choice financially.
plaintiff worked for the employer from march of through february.the employer terminated plaintiff on the latter date,allegedly because plaintiff had defrauded a vehicle repair customer.
plaintiff filed suit against the employer,alleging causes of action for fraud in the inducement,defamation,and wrongful termination in violation of public policy under labor code section fraudulently inducing an employee to move to take employment.
the employer responded to the action by filing a petition to compel arbitration.the court granted this petition and stayed plaintiff action pending resolution by binding arbitration.plaintiff then sought a clarifying order that the employer should be required to bear the entire cost of the arbitrator fees.plaintiff argued that the arbitration agreement was silent on the matter,and that his action included a statutory rights claim.the california supreme court in armendariz had held that,where the employer exacts an agreement to binding arbitration as a condition of employment,the employee may not be required to pay unreasonable costs and arbitration fees when vindicating statutory rights the trial court denied the motion to require the employer to pay the arbitrator fees and dismissed plaintiff action with prejudice.
plaintiff now appeals.
standard of review 
we are here concerned with an arbitration agreement in an employment context.the arbitration agreement is subject to the same rules of construction as any other contract,including the applicability of any contract defenses.
a motion to compel arbitration is,in essence,a request for specific performance of a contractual agreement.the trial court is therefore called upon to determine whether there is a duty to arbitrate the matter necessarily,the court must examine and construe the agreement,at least to a limited extent determining the validity of the arbitration agreement,as with any other contract,is solely a judicial function unless it turns upon the credibility of extrinsic evidence accordingly,an appellate court is not bound by a trial court construction of a contract based solely upon the terms of the instrument without the aid of evidence.citation.here,no extrinsic evidence was presented concerning the validity of the agreement itself.thus,we review any validity determination de novo.
as part and parcel of our review,we are concerned not only with validity in the sense of proper contract formalities,but also with defenses to the enforceability of a facially valid agreement.put another way,an arbitration agreement is subject to the same defenses applicable to all contract disputes,including fraud,duress,or unconscionability whether an arbitration agreement is unconscionable is also a matter of law for the court and therefore is also subject to de novo review.
ii.plaintiff contentions 
plaintiff attacks the validity of the arbitration agreement on several grounds.first,he appears to argue that the arbitration clause is too vague to be valid or enforceable.second,he argues that the agreement constitutes an unconscionable adhesion contract.we conclude,that the arbitration agreement is not unlawfully vague.we also determine that the arbitration agreement is an adhesion contract.that determination begins,however,and does not end,our inquiry.on the question of the validity of the arbitration agreement,as a contract of adhesion,we further hold that,a except as to the appeal provisions,plaintiff has failed to show the agreement is unconscionable b the appeal provision is severable from the remainder of the arbitration agreement and c the remainder of the arbitration agreement is properly enforceable.
another,preliminary,issue is implicit throughout plaintiff argument,but not separately articulated as such.plaintiff has alleged a cause of action asserting an unwaivable statutory right.the california supreme court in armendariz held that,where such statutory claims are subject to a mandatory employment arbitration agreement,the arbitration procedure must allow the employee to vindicate the statutorily protected right in the arbitral forum.thus,certain minimum procedural requirements must be met.the arbitration agreement is lawful if it provides for neutral arbitrators,provides for more than minimal discovery,requires a written award,provides for all of the types of relief that would otherwise be available in court,and does not require employees to pay either unreasonable costs or any arbitrators fees or expenses as a condition of access to the arbitration forum.
the employer responds that armendariz applies solely to claims under the fair employment and housing act feha.because plaintiff has not raised a claim under feha,the armendariz factors do not apply.
we turn first to the question of the armendariz factors and their applicability to plaintiff statutory rights claim.
iii.the arbitration agreement satisfies the armendariz requirements 
plaintiff has asserted a statutory right subject to armendariz analysis 
one of plaintiff claims is that he was fraudulently induced to move to take employment,in violation of labor code section.
although some statutory rights may be waived,other statutory rights are deemed unwaivable.as the california supreme court pointed out in armendariz,arbitration agreements that encompass unwaivable statutory rights must be subject to particular scrutiny.agreements which have as their object directly or indirectly,to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another,or violation of law,whether willful or negligent,are against the policy of the law.thus,while a ny one may waive the advantage of a law intended solely for his or her benefit,a law established for a public reason can not be contravened by a private agreement.
the court found,naturally,that the statutory rights established by the feha are for a public reason.the feha expressly declares as public policy the protection of the rights of all citizens to seek and maintain employment and housing without invidious discrimination.
similarly,we conclude that labor code section was enacted for a public reason,and to vindicate a public policy.its original purpose was to protect migrant workers from the abuses heaped upon them by unscrupulous employers and potential employers,especially involving false promises made to induce migrant workers to move in the first instance.the language of the statute is by no means restricted to agricultural laborers,however,and thus has been properly applied to other kinds of employment rules against fraud and abuse by unscrupulous employers inure to the benefit of the public generally,not merely to a particular employer or employee.the court in mercuro superior recognized that an employee statutory rights under both the feha and labor code section are unwaivable.it would be contrary to public policy for an employer to exempt itself from compliance with labor code section by the expedient of requiring waiver as a condition of employment.consequently,an employee statutory rights under labor code section are subject to armendariz analysis.that is,any mandatory arbitration of employee grievances must be capable of vindicating the statutory right protected by labor code section.
b.the arbitration agreement satisfies the armendariz criteria 
an arbitration procedure passes muster under armendariz if it provides for neutral arbitrators,provides for more than minimal discovery,requires a written award,provides for all of the types of relief that would otherwise be available in court,and does not require employees to pay either unreasonable costs or any arbitrators fees or expenses as a condition of access to the arbitration forum 
i.the arbitration agreement provides for neutral arbitrators 
the arbitration clause here satisfies the first criterion.it incorporates the arbitration rules of the federal arbitration act,and the procedures of the california arbitration act,each of which require neutral arbitrators.in addition,the agreement provides that any arbitrator selected shall be a retired california superior court judge.retired superior court judges are trained and in the precepts and practices of neutral.
ii.the agreement provides for appropriate discovery 
the arbitration agreement provides for more than minimal discovery.it states that the arbitration shall be conducted in conformity with the procedures of the california arbitration act civ.proc.et,including section and all other rights to discovery italics added.code of civil procedure section provides for depositions and production of evidence,including producing documents,such as files,books and records,and producing persons to testify.it further provides for penalties and sanctions to enforce discovery obligations.
iii.the agreement implicitly,or by incorporation,provides for a written award 
the arbitration agreement does not expressly provide for a written arbitration award,but the california arbitration act,in code of civil procedure section,does so provide.
iv.remedies are not restricted 
neither the arbitration agreement nor the federal arbitration act or the california arbitration act makes explicit provision for the types of remedies afforded by the same token,no provision explicitly restricts the remedies provided.implicitly,therefore,the arbitration agreement here complies with the requirement under armendariz that all types of relief otherwise available in court be afforded to vindicate plaintiff statutory rights.
v.the agreement may be construed so that the employee is not required to bear unreasonable costs or arbitrators fees or expenses 
the sticking point,for purposes of our analysis here,is the final requirement,that the employee not be required to bear unreasonable costs or to pay arbitrators fees as a condition of access to the arbitral forum.
at the time the court granted the employer petition to compel arbitration,plaintiff sought an order that the employer be required to bear the costs of arbitration.the employer opposed the request on the ground that the armendariz factors applied only to statutory claims under the feha,and that plaintiff here had raised no such claim.the court apparently agreed with the employer interpretation of armendariz,because it denied plaintiff request that the employer be required to pay the arbitrator fees.
we conclude that the trial court erred.
the employer argument against the requested order was essentially the same argument with which we began our analysis that armendariz applies solely to statutory claims under the feha,and that,because plaintiff has raised no feha claim,armendariz does not apply.we have already rejected that argument.by its own terms,armendariz applies to any mandatory employment arbitration agreement which purports to subject unwaivable statutory rights claims to arbitration.
an unwaivable statutory right is one enacted for a public purpose,and may be recognized by the test question,would it contravene public policy to allow the parties to exact a waiver of its protection labor code section was manifestly enacted for a public purpose,to prevent unscrupulous treatment of employees who are induced to move on the promise of employment.it would also contravene public,it would entirely vitiate the public purpose of its employers were allowed to exact an exemption from its provisions as a condition of employment.employers should not be permitted to circumvent the statutory policy and insulate themselves from liability for the precise fraudulent,oppressive or unscrupulous conduct against which the statute is designed to protect.plaintiff claim under labor code section meets this test.
the arbitration agreement itself is silent on the payment of arbitration fees.instead,it incorporates the procedures of the california arbitration act.the california arbitration act,in code of civil procedure section,provides that,unless agreed otherwise,each party to the arbitration shall pay his or her pro rata share of the expenses and fees of the neutral arbitrator,together with other expenses of the arbitration incurred or approved by the neutral arbitrator,
it has been held,however,that code of civil procedure section is a default provision,which must yield to other statutory imperatives.for example,in armendariz itself,the california supreme court pointed out that requiring an employee to bear significant costs,which would not be required if the same claim were brought in court,would operate to discourage and burden the exercise of statutory feha rights.an employee pursuing feha claims in court would not be required to incur the direct cost of paying for the judge to hear the case or to rent a courtroom.even the prospect of having to incur such costs would unduly discourage the exercise of the statutory right accordingly,when an employer imposes mandatory arbitration as a condition of employment,the arbitration agreement or arbitration process can not generally require the employee to bear any type of expense that the employee would not be required to bear if he or she were free to bring the action in court.
armendariz characterized its principle,that an employer can not generally require the employee to bear any type of expense that the employee would not be required to bear if he or she were free to bring the action in court,as a rule that would ensure that employees bringing unwaivable statutory claims will not be deterred by costs greater than the usual costs incurred during litigation,costs that are essentially imposed on an employee by the employer.thus,in cases where an employer requires an employee to arbitrate his or her claims,including statutory claims,the agreement must be interpreted in the absence of any express terms to the contrary to require the employer to pay any unusual costs associated with arbitration,such as the arbitrator fees.
naturally,as armendariz held,such costs as filing fees and other similar and usual administrative costs,are common to both court and administrative proceedings,and are therefore not problematic.but costs uniquely associated with arbitration,such as payment of the arbitrator fees and room to paying a judge salary and courtroom not imposed directly on litigants in state or federal courts.such unique costs must be borne by the employer,if the arbitration agreement may be so interpreted.
here,to reiterate,the arbitration agreement is silent on the payment of fees,and merely incorporates the california arbitration act provisions.the relevant california arbitration act provision,code of civil procedure section,is a default provision which must yield to a more specific legislative intent.in the case of unwaivable statutory rights,the legislature has deemed the policy underlying the relevant statute important enough to prohibit evasion by exculpatory waivers.in such cases,the default provision for pro rata sharing of arbitration expenses can not apply.
nothing in the present arbitration agreement prevents an interpretation consistent with the mandates of armendariz.there are no express provisions which provide for the payment of fees and costs.the agreement is capable of construction consistent with the dictates of armendariz.it thus satisfies,and does not contravene,the fifth armendariz factor.
because the arbitration agreement complies with the requirements of armendariz,it may properly be enforced,even though it was required as a condition of employment.
iv.the arbitration agreement is not unlawfully vague 
plaintiff urges that several terms of the arbitration agreement are vague,and that the agreement as a whole is therefore unenforceable.for example,plaintiff posits that the arbitration agreement exemption for exclusively monetary claims of less than is vague because the term exclusively monetary claims is not defined,and no provisions explain whether claims of the same class may,or must,be aggregated.he also suggests that the agreement provision for arbitration of any dispute or controversy requiring or allowing resort to any court or other governmental dispute resolution forum could be interpreted to require,workers compensation claims or unemployment insurance claims,to be arbitrated.
plaintiff further complains of the scope of the agreement,as purporting to cover disputes not only between the employee and the company,but including the employer owners,directors,and officers,and parties affiliated with its employee benefit and health plans,which aris e from,relate to,or hav e any relationship or connection whatsoever with the employee seeking employment with,employment by,or any other association with,the employer.plaintiff argues that the agreement is so broad as to define away his right of access to the c ourts even as to matters outside of his employment,and as against persons or entities who are unknown to him for whose actions the employer is not liable as well as matters well outside the scope of plaintiff employment.
plaintiff also attacks the arbitration agreement provision that proceedings in arbitration must be governed by controlling law,excepting,however,any notions of just cause,as unduly restrictive of the proper controlling law governing certain claims.
we find it unnecessary to dwell on plaintiff claims of vagueness or overbreadth,inasmuch as they present only phantasms in the present context.plaintiff claims here all arise unquestionably out of his employment or application for employment with the employer.just cause is a term of art as employed in collective bargaining agreements.attendant upon that term are established concepts of industrial fairness and due process of both a substantive and procedural nature.plaintiff claims do not involve a collective bargaining agreement.the arbitrator,who must be a retired superior court judge,is charged with the duty to apply the applicable rules of law,and the employee retains all of his or her legal and equitable remedies.under these conditions,the preclusion of consideration of just cause provisions of collective bargaining agreements does not affect the powers of the arbitrator to afford complete relief under controlling law.the arbitration agreement presents no issues of vagueness respecting the claims or theories plaintiff has alleged.
v.the arbitration agreement is generally enforceable 
plaintiff contends that,even if the arbitration agreement satisfies the armendariz requirements,it is nevertheless an unconscionable adhesion contract,and therefore unenforceable.we agree with plaintiff that the contract is adhesive,but,with one specific term,hold that it is not unconscionable.with respect to the single invalid term,the appeal provision,we conclude that it is severable from the remainder of the agreement.
a.the arbitration agreement is an adhesion contract 
a contract of adhesion,generally speaking,is a standardized contract,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.citation.
the arbitration agreement,contained within a standardized employment application,was presented to plaintiff on a take it or leave it basis.the employer unquestionably had superior bargaining strength it proffered preprinted documents,cast in generic language,and there was no opportunity to negotiate.had plaintiff refused to sign the form,his application undoubtedly would not have been considered.the employment application,including the arbitration agreement,meets the definition of an adhesion contract.
except for the appeal provisions,the arbitration agreement was not unconscionable 
describing a contract as one of adhesion does not,however,affect its enforceability.rather,an adhesion contract remains fully enforceable unless the provision falls outside the reasonable expectations of the weaker party,or the provision is unduly oppressive or unconscionable plaintiff asserts both that the arbitration agreement was outside the reasonable expectations of a lay employee applicant,and that its terms are unconscionable.
we do not consider plaintiff argument that the arbitration is outside the expectations of the weaker party 
plaintiff argues that the arbitration agreement is outside the reasonable expectations of an applicant for employment he iterates essentially the same vagueness and overbreadth argument he raised earlier.plaintiff claims here are plainly within matters which may reasonably be expected to be covered by a proper employment arbitration agreement.that some hypothetical claims might be beyond the reasonable expectations of the adhering party is no reason to reject its application to a matter which is clearly within the reasonable expectations of the parties.
the arbitration agreement is not,in general,unconscionable 
in determining whether an arbitration clause is unconscionable,courts generally apply a test.citations.they determine whether the clause is procedurally unconscionable and whether it is substantively unconscionable.
u nconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element.citations.the procedural element focuses on two factors oppression and surprise.citations.oppression arises from an inequality of bargaining power which results in no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice.citations.surprise involves the extent to which the supposedly terms of the bargain are hidden in a prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce the disputed terms.citations.the substantive prong of unconscionability encompasses overly harsh or results.stated another way,t he substantive component of unconscionability looks to whether the contract allocates the risks of the bargain in an objectively unreasonable or unexpected manner.both procedural and substantive unconscionability must be present to deny enforcement to the contract,but there may be an inverse relation between the two components,such that the greater the unfair surprise or inequality of bargaining power,the less unreasonable the risk reallocation which
