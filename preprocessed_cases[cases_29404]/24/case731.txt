backgrounda.facts 
michael rosenblum was the principal owner of muffin communications.muffin was a media business that,among other things,produced a travel magazine.in the spring and summer of,rosenblum negotiated the sale of muffin to travelbyus,a canadian corporation that operates a website.rosenblum agreed to sell muffin to travelbyus for a total price of million this agreement was memorialized in a contract that was executed on july,acquisition agreement.
the acquisition agreement provided that rosenblum was to receive a total of million in cash and travelbyus stock in exchange for muffin.rosenblum received in cash at the closing and was due to receive the balance on december.according to the agreement,rosenblum was to receive one million shares of travelbyus stock on december.at the time the agreement was executed,the stock was trading around per share.the agreement provided that,if the stock fell below per share,rosenblum would receive a combination of cash and stock equal to million on december.the contract left the precise combination of cash and stock to travelbyus discretion.
as a condition precedent to the acquisition agreement,the parties also executed the employment agreement on july.under the terms of that agreement,rosenblum agreed to work for travelbyus in the position of senior of muffin,which continued its corporate existence after the sale to travelbyus.in that capacity rosenblum would develop content for travelbyus and receive a salary of per year.the employment agreement included a broad arbitration clause.the arbitration clause,in pertinent part,states except for any matters for which this agreement expressly provides otherwise,any matter in dispute under or relating to this agreement shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration.
both the acquisition agreement and the employment agreement contain merger clauses.article of the acquisition agreement states this agreement together with the other agreements and documents to be delivered pursuant to this agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements whether oral or written.the employment agreement provides 
this agreement constitutes and expresses the whole agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the employment of the executive by the company and with respect to any matters or things herein provided for or hereinbefore discussed or mentioned with reference to such employment.all promises,representations,collateral agreements and understandings relative thereto not incorporated herein are hereby superseded and cancelled by this agreement.
both contracts also include noncompete agreements,which prevent rosenblum from competing with travelbyus for two years after his employment ceases.
in the months following the execution of the contracts,travelbyus stock decreased significantly in value.on december,when travelbyus was required to make the final payment to rosenblum,its stock was trading at far less than the per share price at which it was valued in the summer of.travelbyus failed to make any payment,and rosenblum brought this action alleging breach of contract and fraud.
district court proceedings 
rosenblum complaint alleged that travelbyus breached the acquisition agreement and engaged in a pattern of fraudulent conduct designed to acquire muffin business relationship with mobile media entertainment.the acquisition agreement was attached to the complaint.travelbyus responded with a rule b motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.travelbyus attached the employment agreement to its motion and submitted that the employment agreement arbitration clause barred rosenblum action.travelbyus sought dismissal of the case or,in the alternative,a stay of proceedings pending the outcome of arbitration.
the district court granted travelbyus motion and dismissed the action.the court held that the employment agreement is incorporated by reference into the acquisition agreement,the two agreements are clearly interrelated and are explicitly part of the entire agreement,dist.op.at.the court further concluded that t he arbitration provision here is a broad one it covers all matters relating to the employment agreement.id.thus the court found that the dispute at issue here was covered by the arbitration provision and dismissed rosenblum complaint.
discussiona.threshold matters 
rosenblum advances two interrelated procedural arguments that must be addressed before we consider the principal issue in this appeal.he contends that the district court erred in considering the employment agreement at all.he submits that,because the employment agreement was not referenced in his complaint,the court should not have considered it on a rule b motion.rosenblum further contends that,once the district court decided to include the employment agreement in its deliberations,it should have converted travelbyus rule b motion to a motion for summary judgment.had it done so,rosenblum continues,the court should have denied the motion because of travelbyus failure to comply with local rule and because rosenblum uncontested rule statement of facts created genuine issues for trial.
as a general rule,on a rule b motion,the court may consider only the plaintiff complaint.rule c provides,however,a copy of any written instrument which is an exhibit to a pleading is a part thereof for all purposes.c.this court precedent makes clear that this rule includes a limited class of attachments to rule b motions.d ocuments attached to a motion to dismiss are considered part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the plaintiff complaint and are central to his claim.such documents may be considered by a district court in ruling on the motion to dismiss.wright ins,cir.this exception is aimed at cases interpreting,for example,a contract.levenstein salafsky,cir.the court is not bound to accept the pleader allegations as to the effect of the exhibit,but can independently examine the document and form its own conclusions as to the proper construction and meaning to be given the material.wright miller,federal practice procedure civil,at.
although rosenblum did not refer explicitly to the employment agreement in his complaint,that agreement nevertheless falls within the exception.from travelbyus point of view,the contract under review is the combination of the acquisition agreement and the employment agreement.in moving to dismiss on the ground that the contract,read in this matter,requires that the parties resort to arbitration,travelbyus is entitled to take the position that rosenblum has appended only a part of the relevant instrument and to append what it contends is the remainder.it would have been impossible for the district court or for this court to evaluate the disagreement between the parties without having all of the documentation.it is impossible to render the necessary adjudication without reference to the employment agreement.see venture assocs.zenith data,cir.
b.the arbitration clause 
we turn now to the central controversy in this appeal whether the employment agreement arbitration cla
