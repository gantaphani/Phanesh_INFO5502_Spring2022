background 
in january,stuart weisbrod and michael gotthelf,through gotthelf company,mag portfolio consult,gmbh mag,formed merlin biomed asset management,llc mbam,merlin biomed advisors,llc,and merlin biomed services,llc collectively,the old merlins.weisbrod and mag each had a stake in each company forming the old merlins.the old merlins managed two investment funds focused mainly on health care securities.in,weisbrod and mag decided to end their partnership,and on may,mag and the old merlins executed two agreements which had the effect of extinguishing mag interest in the old merlins.
the first agreement was a purchase and sale agreement which transferred mag stake in the old merlins to mbam in exchange for and a guarantee of either a year for five years starting in or of the annual profits for each of the same years,whichever was greater.the agreement also specified that if any of the old merlins attempted to transfer assets to other funds in which a member or officer of the old merlins had an equity interest of or more during the five years mag was to receive a share of the profits,mag was entitled to receive of the profits earned from managing those transferred assets.finally,the agreement specified that the parties would submit disputes arising under it to arbitration.
the second agreement made was a marketing agreement.under that agreement,mag was to make a good faith effort to ensure that a german company,deutsche vermogenbildungsgeselschaft gesellschaft fur wertpapiersparen mbh,would invest in the funds managed by the old merlins.in the end,the german company did not invest in the funds,and weisbrod alleges that mag breached this agreement.as a result of the loss of the assets of the german company,the old merlins needed new business.weisbrod aggressively began to market the merlin funds but found new investors reticent,he claims,because the old merlins did not invest exclusively in health care funds,their area of expertise.somehow,the solution to this problem required that the old merlins resign from their duties as fund managers and that they be replaced by newly created entities,merlin biomed group,llc and merlin biomed investment advisors,llc the new merlins.weisbrod asserts he was the principal shareholder in all the old and new merlins and thus had the right to effect the changes that he did.the effect of this transaction was that the old merlins had substantially reduced profits.
on february,mag commenced arbitration proceedings against mbam for breach of the purchase agreement.on march,mbam brought suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york hellerstein,alleging that mag had,among other things,fraudulently induced mbam to enter into the purchase and marketing agreements.the complaint also sought an order staying the arbitration proceedings.mag for an order compelling arbitration,which the district court granted.on may,mbam informed mag by letter that two of the old merlins had resigned their management positions and accordingly no longer earn any performance fees or management fees.on june,mag petitioned the district court for an order compelling the new merlins to join the arbitration proceeding between mag and mbam.after a brief hearing,the district court granted mag petition apparently on the basis of either an estoppel theory or a theory.the district court noted there was no independent commercial basis for resignation of the old merlins and appointment of the new merlins by weisbrod and concluded that merlin biomed group llc and merlin biomed investment advisors llc having succeeded to the rights and obligations of the managerial responsibilities for these funds are bound by the original agreement to arbitrate.the new merlins appealed.
discussion 
we note,as an initial matter,that an appeal from an order to compel arbitration may be taken immediately where the suit to compel arbitration is independent that is,if the plaintiff seeks an order compelling or prohibiting arbitration and no party seeks any other relief.cpr usa spray,cir filanto,chilewich int l,cir.since the only issue between the parties in this suit is whether the new merlins should be compelled to join the arbitration proceeding involving mag and mbam,the suit is independent,and we have jurisdiction.t he determination that parties have contractually bound themselves to arbitrate determination involving interpretation of state a legal conclusion subject to our de novo review but the findings upon which that conclusion is based are factual and thus may not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.chelsea square textiles,bombay dyeing,cir.
there are five theories for binding nonsignatories to arbitration agreements incorporation by reference assumption agency ego and estoppel,am.arbitration ass n,cir.only the latter two theories are relevant here.
under the estoppel theory,a company knowingly exploiting an agreement with an arbitration clause can be estopped from avoiding arbitration despite having never signed the agreement.id.at.guided by o rdinary principles of contract and agency,we have concluded that where a company knowingly accepted the benefits of an agreement with an arbitration clause,even without signing the agreement,that company may be bound by the arbitration clause.deloitte noraudit deloitte haskins sells,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the benefits must be is to say,flowing directly from the agreement,at.deloitte,for example,concerned an agreement containing an arbitration clause which governed the terms of use of a trade name.a nonsignatory who had received a copy of the agreement,raised no objections to it and made use of that trade name pursuant to the agreement was estopped from arguing it was not bound by the arbitration clause in the agreement.deloitte,at.
by contrast,the benefit derived from an agreement is indirect where the nonsignatory exploits the contractual relation of parties to an agreement,but does not exploit and thereby assume the agreement itself,at.in,for example,two companies agreed to trade exclusively with each other.id.at.a competitor acquired one of the companies,apparently with the intent of squeezing the remaining company out of the market.id.the unacquired signatory was contractually bound to trade only with a company that was now a subsidiary to its competitor.id.thus,interest in trading waned.id.while the agreement was crucial to the benefit the third party gained by shutting its competitor out of the market,the agreement was not the direct source of the benefit.id.at.rather,the benefit flowed from the nonsignatory exploitation of the contractual relation created through the agreement by acquiring one of the signatories to the agreement.
