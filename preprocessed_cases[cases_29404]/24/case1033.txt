this case requires us to construe the scope of an arbitration clause in a commercial contract.before doing so,we must determine whether two factually distinct injuries pleaded in the same causes of action in a complaint constitute distinct controversies or claims whose arbitrability may be separately evaluated.we conclude that they do and hold that the complaint at issue includes two controversies or claims,one of which must be arbitrated.
chelsea family pharmacy chelsea is a local pharmacy serving retail customers.medco health solutions,medco is a third party prescription drug program administrator that manages pharmacy benefits programs contracts with local pharmacies,including chelsea,to fill program members prescriptions and facilitates insurance reimbursement to the pharmacies.the agreement between the parties provides for arbitration of disputes arising out of or relating to payments to chelsea by medco.medco contends,based on the language of the agreement,that separate injuries alleged in the complaint can not be treated separately for purposes of arbitration if they are styled as part of the same cause of action in the complaint.we disagree.to distinguish between various claims for purposes of the arbitration clause,we look to the substance of the factual allegations in the complaint rather than the legal labels the plaintiff applied to them.from the face of the complaint,we discern two distinct injuries constituting two distinct claims medco unlawfully reimburses chelsea at lower than the prevailing rate and medco operates a mail order prescription program in a manner that unlawfully harms chelsea competitiveness.
chelsea first claim,alleging inadequate reimbursement,relates to payments and thus must be arbitrated under the terms of the arbitration clause.unlike the inadequate reimbursement injury,however,medco operation of an allegedly anticompetitive mail order business can not be said to arise out of or relate to payments,and medco does not argue to the contrary.it instead argues that because both injuries are conflated within each of several causes of action in chelsea complaint,they must stand or fall together.we reject this reasoning.considering the claims independently,we conclude that the reimbursement claim is arbitrable but the mail order claim is not.exercising jurisdiction under a a,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
in order to become a part of medco network of pharmacies,chelsea signed a written agreement dictating the terms of the parties relationship.chelsea alleges this agreement unlawfully sets reimbursement rates below those prevailing in the marketplace.moreover,chelsea contends that the agreement illegally prevents chelsea from competing with medco mail order pharmacy.under the terms of the agreement,medco mail order service may offer more favorable dispensing rates than chelsea is permitted to offer,and medco is able to provide certain services that chelsea is contractually barred from providing.in sum,chelsea alleges that medco possesses undue bargaining power,which it uses to undermine chelsea ability to compete for the business of its own local customers.
chelsea filed suit on its own behalf and for a putative class of all pharmacies in oklahoma who have contractual agreements with medco effective during the three years preceding filing of the amended complaint.in the complaint,chelsea alleges the contract terms that set low reimbursement rates and prevent competition with medco mail order program constitute violations of the oklahoma third party prescription act.stat.tit,a breach of contract and unfair business practices.the complaint sets forth one cause of action under each of these three legal theories each addresses both reimbursement rates and the mail order program.
chelsea and medco agreement incorporates a pharmacy services manual and several additional schedules.those schedules set the payment rates governing reimbursement to chelsea for services it provides to individual members of the various pharmacy networks in which chelsea has agreed to participate.in the pharmacy services manual is an arbitration clause stating 
any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to payments to pharmacy by medco or audit issues,but not relating to termination of pharmacy agreement with medco or pharmacy termination from medco networks,that are not settled by the parties will be determined by arbitration involving three arbitrators,venued in bergen county,new jersey,in accordance with the rules of the american arbitration association,and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.any award of the arbitrators will include reasonable costs and reasonable attorney fees of the prevailing party.no award of the arbitrators will prohibit medco from exercising any rights medco may have pursuant to its agreement with pharmacy or pursuant to law.no party will have a claim in arbitration or otherwise against the other for punitive or consequential damages or for loss of profits.
emphasis added.based on that arbitration clause,medco moved to stay the case in the district court and to compel arbitration under the federal arbitration act faa,see,arguing that,based on congress intent to favor arbitration,the phrase relating to payments should be read broadly to encompass any claim that has payment as a component.medco further urged that the core of each of chelsea claims was medco alleged failure to reimburse at prevailing rates,and thus,each claim was related to payments by medco to chelsea.
in response to the motion to stay,chelsea countered that the gravamen of its complaint was that medco engaged in unfair and anticompetitive practices.it further argued that the arbitration provision was a narrow one and that the present dispute fell outside the scope of the clause.
on initial consideration,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation,concluded that chelsea claims were not arbitrable under the parties contract,and recommended that the district court deny a stay.the report and recommendation employed the framework for determining whether a dispute falls within the scope of an arbitration clause articulated in cummings fedex ground package system,cir.medco filed objections to the magistrate recommendation,and chelsea filed a response.
in its opinion and order,the district court also adhered to our cummings framework and found that the arbitration provision was narrow and included some disputes that could arise between the parties yet excluded others.in adopting the magistrate judge report and recommendation,the court found that the clause was intended solely to resolve disputes over specific payments.on that basis,it concluded that the entirety of this dispute fell outside the scope of the clause and was not arbitrable.
medco appeals,bringing to us the contention that this case should be stayed pending arbitration under the faa.because the agreement between chelsea and medco is a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce,the faa governs whether particular disputes thereunder are arbitrable.the sole issue presented is whether chelsea claims fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement.see we review de novo the district court decision to deny a stay pending arbitration.riley anchor glass container,cir.
in construing the scope of an arbitration agreement,we classify the particular clause as either broad or narrow.cummings,at quoting louis dreyfus negoce blystad shipping trading,cir.this distinction furthers freedom of contract so that parties are not required to submit to arbitration any dispute which they have not agreed so to submit.at t,commc ns workers of,d quoting united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf navigation,d cummings,at.to determine the breadth of an arbitration clause we ask if the parties clearly manifested an intent to narrowly limit arbitration to specific disputes that might arise between them.cummings,at.in cummings,we considered an arbitration clause that governed acts to terminate this agreement but no others.id.at.we held that by adopting the clause under analysis,the parties clearly manifested an intent to limit arbitration to disputes over termination.thus,the clause was narrow and distinguishable from the type of broad provision that refers all disputes arising out of a contract to arbitration.id.at quotation and alteration omitted.
in the present case,we are presented an arbitration clause similar to that in cummings.chelsea and medco have adopted an arbitration clause governing a ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to payments to chelsea by medco or audit issues,but not relating to termination of chelsea agreement with medco or chelsea termination from medco networks.we recognize that this arbitration clause does not explicitly exclude all other disputes from arbitration as did that in cummings.nevertheless,it does exclude matters such as termination of the agreement and limits itself to matters arising out of or relating to payments.such an explicit limitation of scope is analytically equivalent to an express exclusion of other issues.this differentiates the clause before us from the type of broad arbitration provision distinguished in cummings.we conclude that the parties clearly manifested an intent to narrowly limit arbitration to specific disputes,cummings,at,and consider the clause at issue to be narrow in scope.
under a narrow arbitration clause,a dispute is subject to arbitration only if it relates to an issue that is on its face within the purview of the clause id.a dispute is not subject to arbitration if it involves matters that are collateral to those covered by the clause.id.but even narrow arbitration clauses must be interpreted under the liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.mitsubishi motors soler,d quoting moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d cummings,at quotation omitted.we resolve doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues in favor of arbitration.united steelworkers,at.cummings,at.when considering narrow arbitration clauses,this liberal policy does not create a presumption of arbitrability because the policy favoring arbitration does not have the strong effect that it would have if we were construing a broad arbitration clause.cummings,at quotation omitted.with these principles in mind,we turn to whether the allegations in chelsea complaint fall within the scope of the narrow arbitration clause at issue.
chelsea raises three causes of action in its complaint violation of oklahoma third party prescription act,breach of contract,and unfair business practices.all allege the same two distinct harms all three causes of action allege that medco reimburses chelsea at less than the prevailing rates required by oklahoma law.all also allege that medco unlawfully restricts chelsea ability to compete with medco mail order pharmacy.
medco contends that each of these causes of action in the complaint is indivisible.although medco concedes that a court may determine that some claims in a complaint are arbitrable while others are not,it contends that such an approach is permissible only when applicability of the arbitration clause differs by cause of action in the complaint rather than by subject matter within each cause of action medco offers no citation for this proposition.
in order to determine whether a claim is arbitrable under the faa,we evaluate the factual underpinnings of the complaint rather than merely considering the labels attached to each of the causes of action it contains see p p,sutter,cir i n determining whether a particular claim falls within the scope of the parties arbitration agreement,we focus on the factual allegations in the complaint rather than the legal causes of action asserted.quoting genesco,kakiuchi,cir oldroyd elmira sav.bank,fsb,cir same am.recovery computerized thermal imaging,cir gregory,cir quoting genesco,at.if the allegations underlying the claims touch matters covered by the parties arbitration agreement,then those claims must be arbitrated,whatever the legal labels attached to them.p p,at quoting genesco,at quotation marks omitted oldroyd,at same 
while these authorities clearly require that we turn to the facts to determine which claims in a complaint must be arbitrated,they do not similarly insist that we do so in defining what claims the complaint alleges.to do otherwise,however,would undercut the policy of substance over form.focusing on the facts rather than on a choice of legal labels prevents a creative and artful pleader from drafting around an arbitration clause.see combined energies cci,cir the plaintiff can not avoid arbitration by dint of artful pleading alone.griffin beach club ii homeowners ass n,cir a party may not use artful pleading to avoid arbitration.this rationale applies with the same force to our initial discernment of a party claims as to the application of an arbitration clause to each claim.by relying on the factual allegations to determine what claims are asserted in the complaint,we make explicit what has previously been implicit.see coors brewing molson breweries,cir dividing allegations of a complaint into three categories according to their factual allegations before determining which were arbitrable see also becker davis,cir while it would be much easier to do so,we will not send clearly disputes to arbitration merely because a count,as pled,contains both arbitrable and disputes.
following the stated approach,we conclude that the various allegations in the complaint before us subdivide into distinct factual harms.it is of no moment that these distinct harms are not pleaded as separate causes of action in the complaint.
in examining the substance of chelsea pleadings,we discern but two distinct claims one relates to medco reimbursement rates the other to medco allegedly anticompetitive mail order business.we proceed to consider each,guided by the liberal policy favoring arbitration and the plain meaning of the contract.
as for the first claim,the inadequacy of medco reimbursement rates,we determine that it relates to an issue that is,on its face,within the purview of the arbitration clause.we acknowledge that although the clause has a narrow scope in the context of the overall agreement,it nonetheless is broadly inclusive when it comes to payments.the parties agreed to arbitrate a ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to payments to chelsea by medco.emphasis added.the ordinary meaning of the phrase relating to is broad morales trans world airlines,d coregis ins.am.health,cir see also prima paint flood conklin,d construing an arbitration clause with the language a ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement as a broad one.
because the arbitration clause sweeps broadly within the category of payment disputes,we disagree with the district court that this clause solely covers disputes over specific payments.we find no such limiting language on the face of the contract.unlike the district court,we decline to read the explicit exclusion of unrelated topics from the scope of arbitration as narrowing the scope of the language regarding payments.those exclusions influenced our first stage inquiry that this was a narrow agreement,but that conclusion does not trump our inquiry regarding the scope of the phrase arising out of or related to payments.
at bottom,chelsea claim contesting the contractual reimbursement rates is an allegation that medco is not paying chelsea enough money to comply with applicable law.contract terms governing reimbursement from medco to chelsea use the term payment rate.that chelsea uses the term reimbursement rate in its pleadings rather than payment rate does not mask the true nature of the alleged injury.payments is broad enough to include reimbursements.thus,based on the plain language of the contract and the policy favoring arbitration,the alleged harm of inadequate reimbursement rates relates to an issue that is on its face within the purview of the clause.see cummings,at.accordingly,we hold that chelsea allegations regarding inadequate reimbursement rates must be arbitrated.
we turn to the second alleged use of contractual restrictions that prevent chelsea from competing with medco mail order business.chelsea alleges that medco has violated the third party pr
