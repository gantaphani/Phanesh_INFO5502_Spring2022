in the litigation giving rise to this petition for a writ of mandamus,hundreds of purchasers of condominium units in a luxury condominium project brought several different civil actions against the developer and seller of the project,grand towers,llc,and several affiliates collectively,turnberry,raising a wide range of fraud and other claims,and seeking rescission of their purchase agreements or money damages.two separate lawsuits raising substantially identical claims,sussex et grand towers,llc et,cv,and abraham et grand towers,llc et,cv,were filed in district court,and were subsequently consolidated for purposes of the motion at issue here.a third action raising similar claims was filed in nevada state court,kjh rda investor group,llc et grand towers,llc et.
all of the plaintiffs had entered into the same form condominium purchase and sale agreement,in which they agreed to submit to arbitration any dispute related to the agreement and agreed that any arbitration would be conducted under the rules of the american arbitration association aaa.sussex and kih were submitted to arbitration in.
in february,the aaa appointed brendan hare,an attorney in private practice,to serve as arbitrator for sussex.he would eventually become the arbitrator for all three cases sussex,abraham and kih.the arbitration process in sussex commenced in february.around the same time,hare became involved in some business ventures to finance litigation for investment purposes.he founded bowdoin street capital,a firm that invests in,legal claims and litigations,including all manner of meritorious claims,and created a website to attract investors to the firm.a few months later,hare participated as a panelist in the litigation finance and investment summit in new york,on a panel entitled perspectives on investing in litigation and legal finance companies addressing the drivers for investing in litigation finance,including expected returns,assembling a portfolio,and risk mitigation.hare participated in a similar panel in march.in february,his online linkedin profile stated that he had recently refocused his practice to concentrate on the emerging field of litigation finance and funding.hare filled out a new conflicts disclosure form in february,but did not disclose these litigation financing activities.
after learning about hare creation of bowdoin and efforts in the field of litigation financing,turnberry made several requests to the aaa to disqualify hare and stay the arbitration.the aaa investigated turnberry charge that hare involvement with bowdoin created a conflict of interest.in response to the aaa inquiry,hare stated that bowdoin was an entity i created to explore the possibility of creating a fund to provide capital for litigation,but stated that he had raised no money,and made no investments and e xcept for a vestigial web presence the company was completely dormant.the aaa subsequently denied turnberry requests for hare disqualification.
while the aaa was considering these objections,turnberry moved to disqualify hare in the state case,kjh.after some litigation in state courts,the kjh plaintiffs agreed to proceed without hare.in september,turnberry then filed motions to disqualify hare in the sussex and abraham cases pending in district court.the district court granted an emergency request to stay the arbitration in the two consolidated cases.
in an order issued on december,the district court granted turnberry motion to disqualify hare.the district court ruled that it had the authority to intervene in the ongoing arbitration,citing aerojet general am.arbitration ass n,cir,for the proposition that intervention in ongoing arbitration proceedings was possible in extreme cases.the district court then determined that intervention was warranted in this case,in light of several factors.first,the consolidated arbitrations were large,involving the claims of plaintiffs.second,the proceedings were still in the early stages.discovery had not yet begun,and hare had issued only preliminary rulings.the district court also noted that the state case,kjh,would be proceeding with a new arbitrator.finally,the district court held that at the end of the arbitration,turnberry would be likely to prevail on a motion to vacate any award hare issued on the ground of evident partiality,a basis for vacating an arbitration award under the federal arbitration act,u.a the district court reasoned that the undisclosed facts regarding hare litigation financing activities suggested he had a financial interest in the outcome of the arbitration,because a victory and large financial award for sussex would help hare promote his company,which was designed to generate profits from funding large,potentially profitable litigations.according to the district court,hare business venture would create a reasonable impression of bias sufficient to meet the a standard.if the award were vacated,the parties would have to repeat the arbitration process,which would result in a waste of time and resources.accordingly,the district court entered an order removing hare from the federal cases.sussex filed a timely petition for writ of mandamus.

in determining whether a petitioner has carried the burden of establishing a clear and indisputable right to issuance of the writ,we examine the five factors set forth in bauman dist.court,cir
