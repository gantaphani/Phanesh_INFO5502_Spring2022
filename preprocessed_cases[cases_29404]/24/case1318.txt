we affirm the trial court determination that a patient waived her contractual right to arbitrate a medical malpractice dispute by waiting to pursue arbitration until the virtual eve of trial,long after discovery,including expert discovery,had been completed.
substantial evidence supports the trial court factual determination on waiver,based on our supreme court test in agnes medical center pacificare of california cal th.the physician suffered prejudice by losing whatever time and cost benefits could have been gained through arbitration,and by focusing his litigation efforts on a jury trial rather than an arbitration panel.audiences matter,and the factual record supports a finding of prejudice.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff kirsten burton consulted with defendant joseph cruise,a newport beach plastic surgeon,regarding a liposuction procedure.in a preprinted agreement,burton and cruise agreed to arbitrate any issue of medical malpractice capitalization omitted.the agreement provided that either party could submit an arbitration demand in writing.
in april,burton sued cruise for medical malpractice,alleging that he negligently perforated her viscus and small bowel during the liposuction,resulting in contamination of her abdominal wall despite the arbitration agreement,burton failed to request an order compelling arbitration or otherwise mention the parties right to arbitrate.
in early july,burton filed a case management statement requesting a jury trial,estimated to last days.while burton checked a box on the case management form regarding mediation,she failed to check a box on the same form regarding binding arbitration.
the trial court held a case management conference later that month.the court verified that all potential parties,including all potential defendants,were named and served.rather than seeking arbitration,burton requested a trial date,which the court set for april.
the parties engaged in discovery during the next six months,including propounding and responding to interrogatories and requests for production of documents and depositions.they exchanged their expert lists before the february deadline.
on february,burton counsel faxed a letter to defense counsel demanding arbitration under the arbitration agreement,but suggesting that a single,neutral arbitrator conduct the arbitration rather than a panel,as the agreement specified.defense counsel declined,arguing burton had waived arbitration.
burton counsel waited until march,to move ex parte for an order shortening time to hear a petition to compel arbitration.the court shortened the time for a hearing to march.
in opposition,cruise argued that burton waived her contractual right to arbitration.defense counsel declared that he designated expert witnesses very specifically with an eye towards presentation in a superior court trial as opposed to a binding arbitration.as a practical and strategic matter,that same panel of expert witnesses would not have been selected for this case had it been known that the case was proceeding in binding arbitration rather than superior court trial before a jury.
the trial court conducted a hearing on march,but took the matter under submission because it had not reviewed cruise opposition.at the hearing,the court expressed doubt that burton could demand arbitration after participating in the litigation process through the eve of trial i think if you availed yourself of the authority of the court in your action,it seems to me that you ca at the last minute say but now we want to arbitrate it.the court denied burton arbitration demand by minute order on march,and this appeal followed.see code civ,subd.a.
discussion 
governing principles and standard of review 
california law favors arbitrations as a relatively quick and means to resolve disputes.moncharsh heily blase cal th.there is a statutory exception where the right to compel arbitration has been waived by the moving party,subd.a.
although the statute speaks in terms of waiver,the term is used as a shorthand statement for the conclusion that a contractual right to arbitration has been lost.agnes,supra,cal th at,fn.this does not require a voluntary relinquishment of a known right to the contrary,a party may be said to have waived its right to arbitrate by an untimely demand,even without intending to give up the remedy.in this context,waiver is more like a forfeiture arising from the nonperformance of a required act.platt pacific,andelson cal th,see also zamora lehman th.
in agnes,our supreme court set forth a test to assess waiver claims.while waiver is not a mechanical process,and no one factor is predominant,the pertinent factors for this appeal are did the party seeking arbitration act inconsistently with the right to arbitrate or otherwise substantially invoke the litigation process are the parties well into preparation of the lawsuit is there an imminent trial date has the delay affected,misled,or prejudiced the opposing party see agnes,supra,cal th at.
burton dismisses the agnes test as nothing but words which are trumped by the rule that absent actual prejudice,none of these factors is sufficient on which to base or uphold a finding of waiver of the right to arbitrate.we disagree.
agnes cautions us to examine each case in context.n o single test delineates the nature of the conduct that will constitute a waiver of arbitration.agnes,supra,cal th at.true,the mere filing of a complaint,without more,does not constitute the forfeiture of a right to contractual arbitration in california,whether or not litigation results in prejudice also is critical in waiver determinations.id.at.
but does this mean that litigant may wait until trial is due to commence before demanding arbitration to the contrary,in wagner construction pacific mechanical cal th,the supreme court expressly observed that a party unreasonable delay in demanding or seeking arbitration,in and of itself,may constitute a waiver of a right to arbitrate.a party may not postpone arbitration indefinitely by delaying the demand when no time limit for demanding arbitration is specified,a party must still demand arbitration within a reasonable time.citation.w hat constitutes a reasonable time is a question of fact,depending upon the situation of the parties,the nature of the transaction,and the facts of the particular case.id.at.
and in adolph coastal auto sales,th,adolph,we recognized that a party could not blow by pursuing a strategy of courtroom litigation only to turn towards the arbitral forum at the last minute,thereby frustrating the goal of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution we are loathe to condone conduct by which a litigant repeatedly uses the court proceedings for its own purposes all the while not breathing a word about the existence of an arbitration agreement,or a desire to pursue arbitration id.at.
we recognize that waiver is not to be lightly inferred and the party seeking to establish it bears a heavy burden of proof,with all doubts resolved in favor of arbitration.agnes,supra,cal th at.like the clear and convincing standard of proof,these higher burdens guide the trial court determination,but do not alter the standard of review on appeal.it was the trial courts duty to determine whether the petitioners met their burden of proof it is our duty to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the trial courts findings that it did.in re noreen th,see patrick maryland casualty d.although the burden of proof is heavy on the party seeking to establish waiver,which should not lightly be inferred in light of public policy favoring arbitration,a determination by a trial court that the right to compel arbitration has been waived ordinarily involves a question of fact,which is binding on the appellate court if supported by substantial evidence.the appellate court may not reverse the trial court finding of waiver unless the record as a matter of law compels finding non
