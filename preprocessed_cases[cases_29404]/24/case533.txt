factual and procedural history 
this case evolved from a state court suit brought by the debtor,prior to her bankruptcy,challenging the specifics of asset liquidation of signtech usa,limited signtech.signtech was a texas limited partnership,formed in,that was in the business of making sign components and materials,printing sign faces and other large advertisements,and manufacturing and selling digital printers used in printing large advertising copy.when signtech was formed,debtor acquired a ownership in signtech as her sole and separate property.the remaining interest in signtech was owned by kartar gandy limited partnership kglp,as owned and controlled by kartar gandy,debtor,and by james gandy,debtor.on october,debtor entered into a agreement whereby debtor transferred her interest in signtech to a new limited partnership,hary gandy limited partnership hglp.hary gandy,debtor husband,was hglp general partner and owner,and debtor was a limited partner and owner.after the transfer,signtech ownership interests were distributed among hglp,james gandy,kglp,and gandy group.hglp,james gandy,and kglp were the limited partners and owners,while gandy group,was the general partner and owner.
debtor claims center on a series of transactions surrounding and following the transfer.debtor alleges that hary gandy,motivated by the possibility of an impending divorce from debtor,procured the transfer of debtor ownership interest in signtech to hglp in order to secure his control over signtech.debtor argues that this enabled hary gandy to continue to conceal from debtor the real value of her ownership interest after the transfer to hglp,hary gandy also obtained from debtor an increase from to of his ownership interest in hglp.according to debtor,hary gandy obtained the additional interest to forestall the invocation of a partnership clause permitting replacement of the general partner,with or without cause,upon a vote of of the ownership interests in the partnership.
as signtech increasingly lost business and fell in debt,it began to sell various of its business components.after these asset sales,signtech remaining assets were its building,its digital printer manufacturing business,and its accounts receivable.on april,james gandy,hary gandy on behalf of hglp,and kartar gandy on behalf of kglp signed a plan of liquidation for signtech and a series of assignments of signtech partnership interests in exchange for signtech assets.effective as of march,the plan of liquidation and the assignments transferred to hglp ownership of accounts receivable,and to james gandy and kglp and,respectively,of the remaining assets of signtech,except for signtech building debtor,in consultation with hary gandy,had agreed to receive signtech accounts receivable as hglp share of the distribution upon liquidation.debtor alleges that,unbeknownst to her,the accounts receivable consisted primarily of uncollectable foreign debts.in contrast,on april,four days before the signing of signtech liquidation plan,james gandy began negotiating with one of signtech competitors for the sale of signtech digital printer business.the competitor agreed to purchase the digital printer business for on april.
debtor then sued the individual members of the gandy family and the partnerships alleging causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty,negligence,fraud,constructive trust,and breach of contract.the gandys filed a motion to compel arbitration based on arbitration clauses in the parties partnership agreements on february,the state court granted the motion and stayed the lawsuit.debtor filed for bankruptcy that afternoon.the state court suit was subsequently removed to the bankruptcy court as an adversary proceeding.debtor also filed a new adversary action in bankruptcy court,and then moved to consolidate the second adversary with the previously removed state action.with the gandys consent,the bankruptcy court allowed the consolidation of debtor claims in the two adversaries into a single third amended complaint.the third amended complaint included causes of actions to avoid transfers pursuant to sections,and of the bankruptcy code,for civil rico conspiracy,for insider fraud,and to establish alter ego claims and require substantive consolidation.the gandys filed motions with the bankruptcy court to compel arbitration and for stay of the adversary proceeding pending arbitration.the bankruptcy court denied the motions after finding that debtor complaint essentially sought avoidance of fraudulent transfers.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court exercise of discretion,holding that debtor had raised actual core proceedings in her capacity as debtor in possession.back in the bankruptcy court,debtor,based on allegations that the gandys had transferred funds belonging to debtor estate to foreign trusts after she sought chapter protection,successfully obtained a temporary restraining order against the gandys,except for hary gandy and hglp,prohibiting them from further use of the funds the gandys now timely appeal to this court the denial of the motion to compel arbitration and for stay of the adversary proceeding pending arbitration.
discussion 
this court appellate jurisdiction to review the bankruptcy court refusal to stay an adversary proceeding pending arbitration is founded upon section a a of the federal arbitration act the faa,et referring to this subsection,this court in in re national gypsum,cir,stated that a bankruptcy court refusal to stay an adversary proceeding pending arbitration,though interlocutory in nature,is nevertheless appealable because of section of the federal arbitration act.see also hays merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir holding that a establishes rule of immediate appealability with respect to orders denying motions to compel and to stay arbitration.thus,under a a and national gypsum,this court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal from the order of the bankruptcy court refusing to stay debtor adversary proceeding pending arbitration.
on appeal,the gandys argue that the district court erred in refusing to compel debtor to arbitrate this case under the arbitration clauses of the partnership agreements for signtech and hglp.whether a bankruptcy court has discretion to deny a motion to stay a bankruptcy proceeding pending arbitration is a question of law that we review de novo.national gypsum,at.we also review de novo legal determinations of whether an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court is core under b.id.at.if we find that the bankruptcy court had discretion to assess whether arbitration would be consistent with the bankruptcy code,the exercise of that discretion is reviewable only for abuse.see in re united states lines,cir.
the gandys contend that debtor,as a party to the signtech and hglp partnership agreements,had agreed to be bound by the arbitration clauses that appear in identical form in the two agreements.the gandys contend that the faa embodies a strong federal policy in favor of arbitration and,therefore,compels the arbitration of this case.the gandys argue that debtor,in an effort to avoid arbitration,has her state law claims and artfully repled them as bankruptcy claims.the gandys further argue that,even if debtor could bring her bankruptcy claims,they lack merit.the bankruptcy and district courts considered and rejected these arguments.the bankruptcy court found,and the district court affirmed,that debtor adversary proceeding raised actual core bankruptcy issues including,inter alia,issues of avoidance of fraudulent transfers.
the gandys argument that the decision of the bankruptcy court contravenes the faa and the terms of the partnership agreements requires this court to reconcile two important federal statutes the federal arbitration act and the bankruptcy code.the faa provides that arbitration agreements shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.the faa directs courts rigorously to enforce agreements to arbitrate,even if a party opposing arbitration is asserting a statutory claim.express,mcmahon,d.a court must stay its proceedings if it is satisfied that an issue before it is arbitrable under the agreement.id.at.at.this statutory directive,however,may be overridden by a contrary congressional command.mcmahon,at.at.a party wishing to defeat application of the faa bears the burden of demonstrating that congress intended to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue.id.at.at.
while it is generally accepted that a bankruptcy court has no discretion to refuse to compel the arbitration of matters not involving core bankruptcy proceedings under b,this court has held that a bankruptcy court may decline to stay a proceeding whose underlying nature derives exclusively from the provisions of the bankruptcy code.national gypsum,at.in national gypsum,this court cited with approval the third circuit conclusion in hays that bankruptcy courts generally do not have discretion to decline to stay proceedings involving matters.id.at stating that hays makes eminent sense and is universally accepted with respect to,matters a bankruptcy court does possess discretion,however,to refuse to enforce an otherwise applicable arbitration agreement when the underlying nature of a proceeding derives exclusively from the provisions of the bankruptcy code and the arbitration of the proceeding conflicts with the purpose of the code.id.at noting mcmahon,at.at.
we reasoned in national gypsum that,at least where the cause of action at issue is not derivative from the debtor legal or equitable rights but rather is derived entirely from federal rights conferred by the bankruptcy code,a bankruptcy court retains significant discretion to refuse to stay the adversary proceeding and compel arbitration.at.such discretion permits the bankruptcy court to assess whether arbitration would be consistent with the purpose of the code,including the goal of centralized resolution of purely bankruptcy issues,the need to protect creditors and reorganizing debtors from piecemeal litigation,and the undisputed power of a bankruptcy court to enforce its own orders.id.we are persuaded that this reasoning governs the disputed issues in this case,and that bankruptcy court rather than arbitration is the appropriate forum.
debtor advances three causes of action that derive entirely from the federal rights conferred by the bankruptcy code.as a debtor in possession,she seeks to exercise a trustee strong arm powers under section of title to avoid any transfer that an unsecured creditor could have avoided under applicable state law.b.debtor also seeks relief under section to avoid any fraudulent transfer of an interest of the debtor that was made within one year of the filing of her bankruptcy petition.accordingly,she also claims the remedies available under section to recover such transferred property or interest,or the value thereof,from the transferees or their successors.a.all of these claims to avoid or recover transfers are core proceedings arising under title,pursuant to.these claims are created by the bankruptcy code and are of to debtor.see in re wood,cir stating that a proceeding is core under section if it invokes a substantive right provided by title or if it is a proceeding that,by its nature,could arise only in the context of a bankruptcy case see,hays,at claims asserted by the trustee under section b are not derivative of the bankrupt.they are creditor claims that the code authorizes the trustee to assert on their behalf.see,in re hamilton taft,noting that section of the bankruptcy code creates a federal cause of action for recovery of a fraudulent conveyance.
the gandys arguments to the contrary rely on trefny bear stearns securities.in trefny,a trustee appointed to oversee the liquidation of a firm brought an adversary proceeding against a securities firm that served as the debtor clearing broker.the trustee alleged causes of action under texas state law,federal civil causes of action based on violations of criminal statutes,and the bankruptcy code.id.at.the district court found that the trustee was bound by the arbitration agreement between the debtor and the clearing broker and between the debtor customers and the clearing broker to arbitrate the claims and the claims based on federal criminal statutes.id.at.with respect to the bankruptcy claims,the district court found that the trustee did not assert a turnover claim of the debtor liquidated or undisputed funds under,nor properly plead a fraudulent transfer claim under.id.at.the district court reversed the bankruptcy court order denying the clearing broker request for a stay pending arbitration.
the reliance by the gandys on trefny analysis of the general avoiding powers of a trustee is misplaced.in trefny,the trustee had not pleaded a proper section claim because he did not allege a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property when he sought to avoid transfers of property of the debtor customers.at.the district court concluded that the trustee was essentially pursuing tort claims of fraud and seeking to recover money or securities lost because of the alleged fraud.id.
in this case,conversely,debtor is seeking to avoid transfers of her own ownership interests in signtech or hglp that she made beginning in october.assuming the facts to be well pleaded and without evaluating the merits of any claim,we note that the potential avoidance of such transfers is governed by section b,subject to the limitations period for texas fraudulent transfer actions and by section.debtor also seeks to avoid transfers made upon the liquidation of signtech,a transaction made within one year before the commencement of debtor bankruptcy case for which section is also available through these causes of action provided by the bankruptcy code,debtor,as a debtor in possession in chapter,is exercising the trustee strong arm powers pursuant to a unlike the situation in trefny,the transactions alleged to be fraudulent in this case are not subject to the same kind of attack by debtor outside of bankruptcy.therefore,assuming the facts to be well pleaded,debtor asserts bankruptcy causes of actions under sections,and that are in essence created by the bankruptcy code for the benefit of creditors of the estate.see national gypsum,at citing with approval in re statewide realty,interpreting hays and distinguishing between actions derived from the debtor and actions created by the bankruptcy code.in this circumstance,the importance of the federal bankruptcy forum provided by the code is at its zenith.id.
while some of debtor remaining claims do involve her legal or equitable rights,the bankruptcy causes of action predominate.the heart of debtor complaint concerns the avoidance of fraudulent transfers and implicates contractual and tort issues in only the most peripheral manner.national gypsum,at.once debtor sought the relief afforded by chapter of the bankruptcy code,she became a debtor in possession vested with certain statutory rights that empower her by virtue of the bankruptcy code to deal with her contracts and property in a manner she could not have employed absent the bankruptcy filing.bildisco bildisco,d.
appellants own arguments reinforce the primacy of debtor bankruptcy causes of action.appellants contend that,even if debtor got far less than her fair share from singtech and hlgp,she is without remedy because she was represented by counsel and either knew or should have known how to protect her interests.since debtor failed so badly in looking out for herself,appellants seem to argue,she is now w
