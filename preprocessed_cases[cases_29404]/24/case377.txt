this appeal raises the question of how a party to an arbitration proceeding under the multiemployer pension plan amendments act of mppaa,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of and,can obtain review of the arbitration order,as provided in b.specifically,we must determine whether b and require the dissatisfied party to commence a civil action in a district court by filing a complaint,or whether b requires the dissatisfied party to file an application for review of the arbitration order by filing a motion,as provided in the federal arbitration act faa.the distinction between the two procedures is critical to the outcome of this appeal.
freight drivers and helpers local union pension fund the pension fund,a multiemployer pension plan,commenced this action under b by filing a complaint.the pension fund seeks to vacate or modify an arbitration order,entered pursuant to a,which rejected the pension fund assessment of withdrawal liability with respect to two participating employers.when the district court granted the participating employers motion to dismiss with leave to file an amended complaint,the pension fund filed an amended complaint,which,it argued,related back to the filing date of the original complaint under federal rule of civil procedure c.thereafter,however,the district court granted the employers second motion to dismiss,ruling that the pension fund could challenge the arbitration award only by filing a motion to vacate or modify,as provided under the faa,providing that a ny application to the court hereunder shall be made and heard in the manner provided by law for the making and hearing of motions.the court thereupon treated the pension fund amended complaint as a motion and dismissed it,concluding that it was untimely under b because,unlike an amended complaint,a motion can not relate back under rule.in addition,because the court treated the amended complaint as a motion,it found the motion deficient under district of maryland local rule,which requires a motion to be supported by a memorandum setting forth the reasoning and authorities for the motion.
on appeal,we conclude that commencing an action by filing a complaint is the appropriate procedure for seeking review of an arbitration award entered pursuant to a and that the amended complaint in this case related back to the filing date of the original complaint,thus rendering it timely.accordingly,we reverse the district court order of dismissal and remand for further proceedings as a civil action.
during the period from to,penske truck leasing,engaged in several transactions by which it ultimately transferred ownership of its subsidiary,leaseway motorcar transport company,to a third party,in which penske truck leasing apparently retained a minority ownership interest.as a result of the restructuring,penske truck leasing took the position that it and leaseway were no longer under common control,as that term is used in the employee retirement income security act of erisa,b.thereafter,leaseway ceased making contributions to the pension fund,and the fund responded by assessing withdrawal liability against penske truck leasing and the penske logistics group llc,an affiliated company,collectively the penske companies.when neither penske truck leasing nor penske logistics satisfied the pension fund requests for withdrawal liability,the parties submitted the dispute to arbitration,as mandated by a.
the parties to the arbitration proceeding were penske logistics llc and penske truck leasing,on the one side and freight drivers helpers local union pension fund on the other,and the arbitrator never suggested that the parties to the proceeding were not the appropriate parties.the arbitrator dismissed the pension fund claim for the imposition of withdrawal liability in an order dated july,concluding that the penske companies were not liable for withdrawal payments because the pension fund was exempt as a trucking industry fund as that term is described in d.
the pension fund,as the dissatisfied party to the arbitration proceeding,commenced this action on august,to vacate or modify the arbitrator order,alleging that the arbitrator erred as a matter of law in applying the trucking industry exemption.the pension fund captioned its complaint freight drivers and helpers local union pension fund,by its trustee,william alexander,versus penske logistics llc and penske truck leasing,
the penske companies filed a motion to dismiss the complaint,arguing that because the pension fund sued by its trustee,william alexander,instead of by its joint board of trustees consisting of four trustees,the pension fund did not have standing to sue under b.the district court granted the motion and gave the pension fund days within which to file an amended complaint to correct the deficiency.
it is significant that in reaching its decision,the district court analyzed the mppaa procedures for judicial review of an arbitration award as requiring the commencement of a civil action.explaining the procedures,the court stated that j udicial review of the arbitrator decision is available to any party thereto,as indicated by the title to b,by filing a civil action subsequent to arbitration award.quoting b.the court summarized,as indicated,an action under b must be brought in accordance with,titled civil actions.further on in its analysis,the court applied the rules applicable to complaints,indicating that a court may consider documents attached to the complaint,as well as those attached to the motion to dismiss,so long as they are integral to the complaint and authentic.quoting philips pitt cnty.mem l,cir.in determining who the proper party plaintiff would be in any such action,the court explained the relationship between b and.it stated,section pertains to the manner in which the b action is initiated,the how.in other words,b incorporates the procedural requirements set forth in,such as the provisions governing venue and service of process.see id.d,g.reiterating the policy for such a civil action,as described in board of trustees,sheet metal workers national pension fund bes services,cir,the district court related how congress intended to adopt a process that required arbitration,with judicial review.emphasis added.the court stated in conclusion,for the foregoing reasons,i will grant defendants motion to dismiss,without prejudice,and with leave to amend.specifically,plaintiff may amend the complaint provided that the board of trustees file suit on behalf of the fund.emphasis added.the court gave the pension fund days within which to file its amended complaint.
as authorized by the district court,the pension fund filed its amended complaint within days,naming as plaintiff freight drivers and helpers local union pension fund,by its plan sponsor,the joint board of trustees.
the penske companies again filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint,this time arguing that a party challenging an mppaa arbitration order must do so by filing a motion in accordance with the faa,rather than by filing a complaint.they argued further that if the district court were to treat the amended complaint as a motion,the motion would be untimely because it was not filed within days of the arbitration award and would be deficient for failing to comply with local rule,which requires an accompanying memorandum of reasoning and authorities.
the district court again granted the penske companies motion to dismiss by order dated february,and thus it ended the litigation.in doing so,the district court concluded first that the penske companies were correct that a party challenging an mppaa arbitration award must do so by filing a motion,as required by the faa,because,as they claimed,such a procedure was required by b.the court stated 
section b plainly provides that arbitration proceedings under erisa should be conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth in the faa,and the faa plainly provides that a party seeking to vacate an arbitration award must proceed by motion.
as a result,plaintiff amended complaint is an improper filing.
the court declined,however,to elevate form over substance and therefore treated the pension fund amended complaint as a motion to vacate.but in doing so,it noted that a motion,unlike a complaint,could not relate back under federal rule of civil procedure c,therefore rendering the motion untimely.moreover,in treating the amended complaint as a motion,the court also concluded that the motion should have been accompanied by a memorandum setting forth the reasoning and authorities in support of it,as required by local rule.
after the district court denied its motion for reconsideration,the pension fund filed this appeal,challenging the district court gateway procedural ruling that a party seeking review of an mppaa arbitration order must do so by filing a motion,as provided in the faa.
the pension fund contends that the district court erred in rejecting its filing of a complaint as the proper method by which to obtain review of an mppaa arbitration order.it argues that b and evince that the mechanism through which to bring an action to vacate or modify an arbitration award is by filing a complaint.
the penske companies contend,to the contrary,that the sole method to challenge an arbitration award is by filing a motion,so the amended complaint is not a proper method for the pension fund to challenge the arbitration award.they rely on b,which provides that a ny arbitration proceedings under this section shall,to the extent consistent with this subchapter,be conducted in the same manner,subject to the same limitations,carried out with the same powers and enforced in united states courts as an arbitration proceeding carried out under the faa.
the difference in the parties positions thus presents the narrow procedural question of whether a party who seeks to vacate or modify an arbitration award under the mppaa must commence an action by filing a complaint or must file an application by motion under the faa.we conclude that the mppaa requires the former.
the mppaa provides that after mandatory arbitration proceedings have been conducted pursuant to a,a party to the arbitration proceeding may bring an action in an appropriate united states district court to enforce,vacate,or modify the arbitrator award.b emphasis added.it also provides that the action must be brought in accordance with section of this title,which,in turn,requires that the complaint in any action under section of this title shall be served upon the pension benefit guaranty corporation by certified mail,id.g emphasis added.the plain meaning of these provisions can only lead to the conclusion that a party seeking review of an mppaa arbitration award must do so by commencing a civil action in a district court by filing a complaint to vacate or modify the award.while the titles of b and,explicitly referring to such review as a civil action,are not part of the substantive text,the text in no uncertain terms refers to a civil action,using the terms an action in a district court with respect to which the complaint must be served on the pension benefit guaranty corporation.indeed,this is the language of most federal statutes providing for civil actions in a district court.
this reading is confirmed by the statute identical provision for a civil action to collect withdrawal liability payments where no arbitration is involved.section b provides that i f no arbitration proceeding has been initiated,the amounts demanded for withdrawal liability shall be due and owing and the plan sponsor may bring an action for collection.emphasis added.the parties agree that this provision authorizes collection by means of a civil action commenced by the filing of a complaint in court.they can hardly deny that the exact same language used in b likewise authorizes review of an arbitration award by means of a civil action commenced by the filing of a complaint in court.see united states cleveland indians baseball,noting the general presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning quoting atl.cleaners dyers,united states.
finally,it is no accident that the mppaa uses the terms of art an action,civil action,in a district court,and complaint,which are precisely those used by the federal rules of civil procedure governing civil actions in district courts.rule provides that t here is one form of action the civil action,and rule provides that a civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the district court,emphasis added.
moreover,the house committee report explaining the mppaa leaves little doubt that judicial review authorized by b refers to review by a civil action commenced by the filing of a complaint.in describing enforcement of arbitration awards under the mppaa by a civil action,the report states 
in general,the district courts of the united states have exclusive jurisdiction for civil actions under the bill without regard to the amount in controversy.in the case of an action brought by a plan fiduciary to collect withdrawal liability,state courts of competent authority are also to have jurisdiction.
in addition,a copy of the complaint in any action brought under the bill is to be served on the pbgc by certified mail.the pbgc may intervene in any action brought under the bill.
in the case of an action under the bill,the court is permitted to award to the prevailing party all or a portion of costs and expenses in connection with the action,including reasonable attorneys fees.
the period of limitations for the commencement of an action under the bill is to expire six years after the date on which the cause of action arose.
pt,at,reprinted in u.
the penske companies rely exclusively on b in support of their position.that provision incorporates generally the faa procedures for a ny arbitration proceedings under the mppaa,which,they argue,includes the faa procedures for review of arbitration awards.see.
first,we note that if there were any tension between subsection b providing for use of faa procedures for arbitration proceedings and subsection b providing for civil actions to review arbitration awards,subsection b requires that subsection b govern,as subsection b expressly limits applicability of the faa to the extent consistent with this subchapter.b.but when the overall structure of the statute is considered and the statute is properly construed,there appears to be no such tension.subsection a requires that disputes over withdrawal liability be submitted to arbitration subsection b requires that the arbitration proceedings be conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth in the faa and subsection b and g require that review of arbitration awards be pursued by bringing a civil action in district court by filing a complaint and serving a copy on the pension benefit guaranty corporation.thus,the mechanisms for conducting arbitration proceedings are provided by the faa and the mechanisms for review of those proceedings are provided by the mppaa and the rules governing civil actions in district courts,beginning with the commencement of a civil action by the filing of a complaint.
the conclusion that the mppaa distinguishes procedures for arbitration proceedings from procedures for judicial review is further indicated by the scope of regulations promulgated by the pension benefit guaranty corporation regarding arbitration of disputes in multiemployer plans,pt.the stated purpose of those regulations is to establish procedures for arbitration,pursuant to,of withdrawal liability disputes.id.and in providing the procedures for arbitration proceedings under the mppaa,the regulations limit their scope to arbitration proceedings initiated pursuant to and then only to the extent that they are consistent with this part and adopted by the arbitrator in a particular proceeding.id.the regulations provide procedures for every stage of such an arbitration proceeding from its initiation to the award,id,but they provide no procedure for review of an award except the arbitrator reconsideration of an award,id.the absence of regulations pertaining to judicial review speaks volumes about the scope of b reference to the faa.
it is therefore not surprising that in mppaa arbitration cases,we have noted that the mppaa clear ly authoriz es judicial review of the
