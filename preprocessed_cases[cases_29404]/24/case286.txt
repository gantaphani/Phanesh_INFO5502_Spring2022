opinion of the court 
the union representing certain employees at akers national roll company the company appeals from a judgment entered on march,by the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania.the district court vacated an award issued by arbitrator richard sambuco the arbitrator,granted the company motion for summary judgment,and denied the union motion for summary judgment.
in,the union submitted three grievances on behalf of company employee and union member nelson lubik,alleging that the company violated a past practice by failing to schedule lubik,a maintenance clerk,for saturday overtime when the maintenance department was scheduled to work.after the arbitrator sustained the three grievances and ordered the company to pay lubik back wages for the missed overtime,the company sued to vacate the arbitrator award.the district court vacated the award because it concluded that the award did not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement the cba or agreement it reached this conclusion after determining that the plain language of the cba unambiguously gave the company the exclusive right to schedule its workforce.because we disagree with the district court reasoning and its conclusion,we will reverse the district court judgment and will order enforcement of the arbitrator award.
the company runs a manufacturing plant in avonmore,pennsylvania,and the union is the exclusive representative for clerical and technical employees at the plant.from september,through february,the company and the union were parties to a cba.the cba included a grievance resolution procedure to be used when the union and the company disagreed over interpretation or application of,or compliance with the provisions of the.under the cba,unresolved grievances were submitted to arbitration.
in february and march of,the union submitted three grievances on behalf of lubik,alleging that the company violated the cba by directing lubik not to work saturday shifts on february,february,and march,when employees of the maintenance department were scheduled to work.in the first grievance,the union stated that the nature of the grievance was past practice,the maintenance clerk has always worked when the maintenance department works whether full or partial crew.id.at.because lubik would have been eligible for overtime pay if he had worked on a saturday alongside maintenance department employees,the union alleged that the company should be liable to pay lubik at the overtime rate for the hours he was not scheduled to work.id.
per the grievance resolution procedure,the company submitted answers to the union allegations.regarding the first grievance,the company asserted that there was no violation of the cba because the company has the right to schedule under section of the labor agreement,because the cba does not recognize the existence of past practice in an y form,and because t he notion of a past practice can not undo or supersede clear contract language section is very clear.id.at.the company additionally asserted that section scope of the agreement states that any agreements must be put in writing and signed by the union designate and the company.id.
the company submitted answers to the second and third grievances as well,and its final answer stated that its position had not changed since its answer to the first grievance,cit ing section,section and all other relevant sections in support of its scheduling.id at.the final answer also referred to a section d c page in response to lubik grievance.the cba does not contain a section d c,though,and page contains portions of section,rates of pay,which does not appear to be relevant to the instant dispute.
the company and the union ultimately submitted the three grievances to arbitration per the cba.
because provisions of the cba command our attention in deciding this case,we set forth the following relevant sections thereof.
section of the cba,entitled management and referred to as the management rights clause,reads as follows 
the company retains the exclusive rights to manage the business and plant and to direct the working forces.the company,in the exercise of its rights,shall observe the provisions of this agreement.
the rights to manage the business and plant and to direct the working forces includes the right to hire,suspend or discharge for proper cause,or transfer,and the right to relieve employees from duty because of lack of work or for other legitimate reasons.
section of the cba is entitled hours of work.two provisions of that section are relevant to our analysis,sections a and b,which read as follows 
normal hours of work 
the normal workweek shall be hours per week,scheduled on five successive days,from monday through friday,inclusive.
scheduling 
if an employee is requested to report to work outside his regularly scheduled workweek and whether or not work is available he shall receive a minimum of hours reporting pay at the employee applicable rate of pay.
section is entitled scope of the agreement.within section is a paragraph referred to by the parties as a zipper clause,which reads as follows 
agreements for the plant will only be recognized if they are in writing and signed by the designate of the international,and the negotiating committee provided,however,that any such agreements may be terminated by either party upon days written notice to the other party.
on june,the union and the company participated in a hearing before the arbitrator,and they stipulated that the case being heard included three grievances,all involving the same issue.id.at.the union and the company presented their contentions and supporting evidence to the arbitrator.the arbitrator award contains a section that summarizes the positions of the parties as presented at the arbitration hearing.id.at.the thrust of the union argument was that a past practice had been established,and that a written,signed agreement was not required for its establishment.id.at.the union presented evidence in support of its argument,including the testimony of lubik as well as exhibits detailing the maintenance department work schedule from,along with payroll records for lubik.id.at.from this evidence,it was apparent that lubik had worked weekend shifts along with the maintenance department employees even on weekends when he had not been formally scheduled to work,and that he had been paid overtime for that work.this practice concluded in,leading to the union first grievance.
the company argued that there was no past practice in its agreement with the union,because its zipper clause,located at section of the cba,precluded a finding of past practice.it argued also that the cba section management rights clause included the right to schedule,that any modifying agreement would have to be in writing,and that the past practice agreement had never been reduced to writing.
in a decision that is now the subject of some dispute between the parties,the arbitrator determined that he had to decide the following issue 
did the parties to the agreement as alleged in grievance establish,by their actions in the year,an unwritten past practice and did the company violate this past practice if the answer is yes,what is the remedy 
on july,the arbitrator issued an award sustaining lubik grievances and awarding him in back wages,as well as the amounts lubik would have earned in profit sharing in and had he worked on weekends that the maintenance department was scheduled to work.the arbitrator cited several provisions of the cba,including section management rights clause.he did not cite to or refer to section,the hours of work section.he focused his analysis and discussion on whether a past practice had in fact been established,and whether section zipper clause prohibited a finding of past practice.
the arbitrator concluded that the zipper clause failed to prohibit a finding of past practice,because it does not acknowledge that the written contract constitutes the parties entire agreement,is not explicit with regard to a waiver of the right to bargain about other conditions,nor is it a specific affirmation that management rights are not limited by prior practices.id.at.the arbitrator determined also that the language of the zipper clause was ambiguous,because its language appeared to indicate that an agreement that would satisfy the zipper clause would only require signature by the union and not by the company.id.at.in addition,he described the characteristics of a binding past practice,including such factors as clarity,consistency,longevity,repetition,acceptability,underlying circumstances,and mutuality.id.at.
the arbitrator concluded that a binding past practice had been established when,in,lubik was permitted to work on weekends when his name did not appear in the work schedule.the arbitrator noted that this practice occurred under two different maintenance managers,prior to and after adoption of the cba.id.at.he noted also that the mutuality requirement was met because the parties,by virtue of their constant response to a recurring set of circumstances,resulted in a mutually accepted way of doing things that culminated into a past practice that carried over into the present collective bargaining agreement id.at.the arbitrator concluded that the union and the company did establish a past practice that the company violated when lubik was not allowed to work along with the maintenance department employees on weekends.accordingly,the arbitrator sustained lubik grievances and awarded him back wages and profit sharing.
the company then filed suit to vacate the arbitrator award,alleging that the award ignores the company exclusive and express right to direct the workforce and to schedule overtime and therefore fails to draw its essence from the cba.id.at.in addition to citing section management rights clause,the company cited to section,hours of work.id.at.the company alleged also that the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction under the cba by ignoring the cba clear provisions regarding the company right to direct the workforce and schedule overtime,and that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by issuing an award that impermissibly modifies the cba.id.at.
the company and the union filed for summary judgment.the district court granted the company motion,denied the union motion,and vacated the award.the union timely appealed.

a labor arbitrator award does draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement if the interpretation can in any rational way be derived from the agreement,viewed in the light of its language,its context,and any other indicia of the parties intention.

indeed,a reviewing court may disturb an arbitrator award only where there is a manifest disregard of the agreement,totally unsupported by principles of contract construction and the law of the shop.see also brentwood med.assocs.united mine workers of,cir major league umpires ass am.league of prof l baseball clubs,cir exxon shipping exxon seamen union,cir virgin islands nursing ass s bargaining unit schneider,cir.the supreme court has phrased the same idea in this fashion if an arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,the fact that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.major league baseball players ass garvey,d per curiam internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the garvey court stated that arbitration awards may be unenforceable only when the arbitrator strays from interpretation and application of the agreement and effectively dispense s his own brand of industrial justice.id.quoting enter.wheel,at.
the overarching question presented to us here is whether the arbitrator award draws its essence from the cba.the union insists that it does the company argues,in total agreement with the district court,that it does not.
the district court concluded that the arbitrator award did not draw its essence from the cba,after determining that the plain language of cba sections and gave the company the exclusive right to direct and schedule its workforce.in addition,the court concluded that because the arbitrator award did not draw its essence from the cba,the arbitrator exceeded his authority when he relied on the alleged past practice of the company.
we regret we must disagree with both of the district court conclusions.when parties knowingly and voluntarily bargain for arbitration to resolve disputes,they receive the benefits of fast results and reduced expenses.see major league umpires ass n,at.these benefits,however,do not come without risk,and the possibility of receiving inconsistent or incorrect rulings without meaningful appellate review of the merits is one of the risks such parties must accept when they choose arbitration over litigation.id.in short,i t is the arbitrator construction which was bargained for and so far as the arbitrator decision concerns construction of the contract,the courts have no business overruling him because their interpretation is different from his.enter.wheel,at.

as judge aldisert has observed,federal labor law elevates labor arbitrators to an exalted status.ludwig honold fletcher,cir a court may not overrule an arbitrator simply because it disagrees with the arbitrator construction of the contract,or because it believes its interpretation of the contract is better than that of the arbitrator.see grace local,international union of the united rubber workers,d.

here,the company accepted the risk of arbitration,and now seeks to avoid its result we will not permit it to do so.
the company contends that sections and of the cba unambiguously vested it with the exclusive right to schedule its employees.citing pennsylvania power,it argues that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the cba and ignored the plain language of sections and,such that the award failed to draw its essence from the cba.see.power,at.the district court agreed with the company contentions.
this raises a critical threshold issue for our consideration was the cba so unambiguous as to the company right to schedule its workforce such that the arbitrator award,in which he inquired into past practice,manifestly disregarded the cba this court has stated that extrinsic evidence of past practice could be admitted,if at all,only to resolve an ambiguity in the cba.quick,cir.in support of this statement,quick cited to local skinner engine,cir,which,quoting an opinion of the court of appeals for the seventh circuit,stated 
although extrinsic evidence is admissible to show that a written contract which looks clear is actually ambiguous,perhaps because the parties were using words in a special sense,there must be either contractual language on which to hang the label of ambiguous or some yawning void that cries out for an implied term.extrinsic evidence should not be used to add terms to a contract that is plausibly complete without them.

this court has also stated that i f the arbitrator award has deviated from the plain meaning of a labor contract provision,it must find support in the contract itself or in prior practices demonstrating relaxation of the literal language.nf m united steelworkers of,cir emphasis added citing porter united saw,file steel prods.workers of,cir.
