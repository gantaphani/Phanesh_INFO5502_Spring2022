the trial court vacated an arbitration award issued in favor of defendant united health centers of the san joaquin valley,uhc in a wrongful termination case brought against it by its former employee,plaintiff jennifer vradenburg haworth.the basis of the trial court action was that the neutral arbitrator failed to comply with the mandatory disclosure requirements of code of civil procedure section and the ethics standards for arbitrators.although uhc presented evidence from which the trial court could find that vradenburg haworth counsel forfeited the right to seek to have the award vacated on this basis,as that principle is explained in dornbirer kaiser foundation health plan,th dornbirer,the trial court determined that,pursuant to section,subdivision c hereafter c,an arbitrator mandatory disclosure obligations can not be waived,and refused to consider dornbirer.the question before us is whether the forfeiture principles stated in dornbirer remain viable after the enactment of section c.we conclude that they do.accordingly,we grant uhc petition for writ of mandate and reverse the trial court order vacating the arbitration award.
factual and procedural background 
uhc hired jennifer vradenburg haworth as a physician in.after uhc terminated her employment in september,she filed an action against uhc for retaliation and wrongful termination in violation of public policy.uhc moved to compel arbitration pursuant to an arbitration provision in vradenburg haworth employment contract.the trial court granted the motion on april,
uhc counsel,russell ryan,recommended to vradenburg haworth counsel,michael smith,that they select either retired judge howard broadman or retired justice nickolas dibiaso as the arbitrator.ryan further advised smith that he had used both arbitrators on a number of occasions and asked smith to let him know if he would agree to either one,or if he proposed an alternative.eventually,smith agreed to have judge broadman arbitrate the case,and a stipulation and order was filed in which the parties agreed to refer the matter to him.
the arbitration hearing was held before judge broadman from october to october.the parties submitted briefs.on december,judge broadman issued written findings and judgment in uhc favor.judge broadman found that uhc terminated vradenburg haworth position due to the company financial distress,the impracticality of employing physicians,and personnel issues within the clinic where she worked,and her termination was proper because she was an employee.he found there was no basis for her claims of retaliation and wrongful termination in violation of public policy.
uhc filed a petition to confirm the arbitration award on january.in response,vradenburg haworth asked the trial court to vacate the arbitration award pursuant to section,on the ground that judge broadman failed to comply with the mandatory disclosure requirements of sections and.she also asked the trial court to vacate the award pursuant to section,subdivision a,on the ground judge broadman exceeded his powers when he made clear legal errors in his decision.
in smith declaration in support of the request to vacate,he stated that before selecting judge broadman as the arbitrator,he knew judge broadman as a mediator and judge broadman was once agreed upon as an arbitrator in another case which settled without a hearing.smith declared that after judge broadman appointment on may,he did not receive any disclosure from him as required by sections et.smith trusted judge broadman because of his experience as a judge and our experience using him as a mediator.smith further declared we have used him as a mediator,occasionally.when i did not receive any ccp disclosure from him,i trusted that this meant he had nothing to disclose.
smith explained that after he received judge broadman award,he felt his client was not given a fair hearing.he then went looking for any disclosure from broadman.none existed in our file.we have a very diligent file maintenance clerk in our office,who keeps all correspondence in all our cases filed carefully.she searched as well.smith associate john migliazzo,who has worked on this case from its beginning,also searched.no such letter was received in our office.neither smith nor migliazzo found any disclosure from judge broadman,or his office,in their inboxes,and no faxed disclosure was received in the office.
migliazzo asked judge broadman,in a december letter and,for a complete disclosure of any prior engagements judge broadman may have had with uhc or ryan,as smith office had not received a disclosure.as of january,smith and migliazzo had not received a disclosure letter from judge broadman.they did have an exchange with him,in which judge broadman asked if they wanted a conference call,but smith responded that he only wanted a complete and accurate disclosure.
after receiving copies of smith and migliazzo correspondence to judge broadman,ryan sent smith and judge broadman an advising that judge broadman submitted a disclosure form in a june letter,which ryan supplemented with a july letter,both of which were submitted to smith office.ryan attached copies of both letters to the.ryan also advised that during the two years before judge broadman appointment as arbitrator in this case,judge broadman served as a mediator in two cases in which ryan was involved,and more than two years before,both smith and he had selected judge broadman as a mediator in another case,and judge broadman served as a special master in consolidated cases in which ryan represented one of the parties.
judge broadman three page letter of june,which is addressed to both smith and ryan,was characterized as a disclosure statement intended to comply with sections and,the disclosure requirements for arbitrators mandated by standard of the ethics standards for arbitrators found in the appendix to the california rules of court,and any other statutes,rules and standards that may require disclosures or disqualifications by arbitrators in proceedings such as the one at issue.judge broadman stated that he had not served as an arbiter in any matters involving smith or his office,or either of the parties.he had,however,served as an arbiter in two matters involving ryan or his law firm.for these two matters,judge broadman identified the case name,the attorney for each plaintiff and defendant,and the outcome,whether he ruled in favor of the plaintiff or defendant.for one matter,judge broadman stated the date was n ot recorded,but the other matter took place in july.ryan law firm represented the prevailing party in each arbitration.the disclosures did not include the amount of monetary damages awarded as required by section instead,judge broadman explained he does not disclose the exact amount of any awards due to his perceived duty to maintain confidentiality,and invited the attorneys to contact either or both sides of the dispute for that information.
due to a previous failure on his part to maintain appropriate records,judge broadman asked the parties to advise him if they knew of any cases in which he had served as an arbitrator so he could amend the disclosure.he also stated the disclosure did not include mediations which may have been conducted with the parties attorneys because his system did not easily afford this information.he was willing,however,to try to locate the mediated cases if either party requested a complete disclosure of them if no request was made any further disclosure was waived.the letter further advised that although judge broadman did not have current arrangements with any party concerning prospective employment,he would entertain offers from the parties and their counsel while the arbitration was pending for employment as a dispute resolution neutral in other cases.he was not participating in,and had not participated in within the last two years,discussions regarding prospective employment or service with a party.
ryan july letter informed broadman and smith that he had received judge broadman june correspondence constituting his disclosure statement in the case.ryan advised them that judge broadman had served as an arbitrator in one case in which ryan was involved,which settled prior to the arbitration hearing although judge broadman denied a summary judgment motion brought by ryan client,and had been appointed the arbitrator in another case scheduled for arbitration in september,in which ryan represented the plaintiff,which settled on the first day of the arbitration with judge broadman assistance.
in smith declaration in support of the request to vacate,he stated that judge broadman should have disclosed the four matters ryan revealed in his july letter and january.smith also was aware of one engagement in which we retained judge broadman as an arbitrator,which settled before a hearing,and one mediation where we hired him as a mediator,which had to be rescheduled.smith further declared that we did not receive information that might well have caused us to disqualify judge broadman as an arbitrator,and they still did not know how many mediations judge broadman had conducted for ryan or his law firm in the two years before his appointment in the present case,the amount of monetary awards involved,or whether they had discussed new or additional work while this matter was pending.
vradenburg haworth argued the award must be vacated pursuant to section,subdivision a because judge broadman refused to follow the mandatory disclosure requirements of the judicial council ethic standards for arbitrators,which are nonnegotiable and can not be waived,and failed to serve her attorney with a disclosure.she asserted judge broadman purported june disclosure was grossly inadequate as judge broadman admitted he does not keep accurate or appropriate records,he attempted to waive his statutory compliance obligation,the disclosure did not include the four matters ryan revealed or the two matters of which smith was aware,which were required to be disclosed,and it did not disclose any discussions of prospective employment.
in reply,uhc argued vradenburg haworth could not in good faith argue the award should be vacated due to judge broadman purported failure to make the disclosures required by section because she never served a notice of disqualification based on judge broadman failure to serve a timely disclosure,as provided by section judge broadman made the disclosure required by section and,even if smith did not receive the disclosure statement,he was put on notice such a statement existed via ryan july letter which specifically referenced the statement and disclosed the existence of two prior arbitrations involving judge broadman the disclosure statement substantially complied with section and made no material representations or omissions that would warrant disqualification and smith knew of judge broadman prior engagements with uhc counsel,yet chose not to serve a notice of disqualification.uhc further argued judge broadman did not commit legal error in deciding in its favor.
in support of it opposition,uhc submitted the declaration of judge broadman assistant,karen kimball,in which she stated she mailed the disclosure statement to counsel for the parties at their respective addresses on june,and on or after july,judge broadman gave her a copy of ryan july letter to file.ryan stated in his declaration accompanying the opposition that,to his best recollection,judge broadman was advised he was appointed the arbitrator sometime in.ryan further stated he received judge broadman june disclosure statement within a day or two of its date and he then prepared his july letter,which was sent by and regular mail to both judge broadman and smith.according to ryan,at the time the disclosure statement was served there were no current arrangement s concerning prospective employment or other compensated service as a dispute resolution neutral between judge broadman and himself or his firm,or any other matter that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be able to be impartial.
ryan was surprised to see migliazzo december correspondence because he knew judge broadman had mailed a disclosure statement in june.he followed up with his january,attaching a copy of the disclosure statement and his july correspondence.ryan reviewed his files to see if any information was missing and noted there were two mediations he was involved in within the past two years with judge broadman,which he revealed in his to smith.
after oral argument on the petitions,the trial court took the matter under submission.on june,it issued a written ruling granting the motion to vacate and denying the petition to confirm.the trial court found that the omission of information in judge broadman disclosure statement,including his admissions that he would not disclose arbitration awards and could not readily disclose mediations,required the award be vacated because the statement fell short of what was legally required.
in so finding,the trial court rejected uhc contention that any right to vacate the award had been waived since smith was aware of the relationship between judge broadman and ryan and his firm before the arbitration hearing,yet did nothing until after the award was made.the trial court refused to follow the case uhc relied on,dornbirer,supra,th,in which the appellate court held that the statutory scheme does not require an arbitration award be vacated when the arbitrator has disclosed the grounds for disqualification generally,but has not provided all of the specific details required by section,and the parties nevertheless agreed to proceed with the arbitration.dornbirer,supra,th at.the trial court determined the dornbirer decision violated the rules of statutory construction and was contrary to section,subdivision c,which provides that the ethics requirements and standards applicable to arbitrators are nonnegotiable and shall not be waived.the trial court did not make any factual findings and declined to address the other issues presented by the parties as they were moot.
uhc petitioned this court for a writ of mandate.we issued an alternative writ directing the trial court to either vacate its order granting the petition to vacate the arbitration award and issue an order denying the petition,or show cause why the required relief should not issue.the superior court reviewed and reconsidered its ruling,but declined to vacate or reverse it.
discussion 
uhc contends the trial court erred in finding that judge broadman failure to comply with the statutory disclosure requirements compelled vacatur of the arbitration award because an arbitrator failure to comply does not automatically require vacating the arbitration award.instead,uhc argues,the court must consider whether the party seeking to vacate the award was aware of,or knew about,the deficiencies in the arbitrator disclosure,but waited to inquire further or challenge the arbitrator until after the award was issued.uhc contends that in this case smith knew ryan and his firm had prior engagements with judge broadman before the arbitration was held,yet did nothing,and smith failure to act precludes vacation of the award on the ground of nondisclosure.
review by petition for writ of mandate is appropriate 
as a threshold matter,we begin with vradenburg haworth contention that writ relief should be denied because uhc has failed to show irreparable harm or that it does not have any other adequate remedy at law,as the expense of the case is not a sufficient basis to claim inadequacy for purposes of writ review.while it is true that writ review is deemed extraordinary and appellate courts normally are reluctant to grant it,writ review is appropriate where either the party seeking the writ lacks an adequate means,such as direct appeal,to obtain relief,the petitioner will suffer harm or prejudice which can not be corrected on appeal,or where the petition presents an issue of first impression that is of general interest to the bench and bar.baeza superior court th.

disclosure requirements 
in seeking to ensure that a neutral arbitrator serves as an impartial decision maker,the statutory scheme requires the arbitrator to disclose to the parties any ground for disqualification.haworth,supra,cal th at.within days of receiving notice of his or her nomination to serve as a neutral arbitrator,the proposed arbitrator is required to disclose all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be able to be impartial,subd.a,b haworth,supra,cal th at.based on these disclosures,or if no disclosure is made,the parties have the opportunity to disqualify the proposed neutral arbitrator,subds.a,b d cal.rules of court,ethics stds.for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitration ethics standards,std.a haworth,supra,cal th at.once an arbitration award is made,section,subdivision a a provides that vacation of the award is required if the arbitrator failed to disclose within the time required for disclosure a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was then aware.
section,subdivision a provides a list of potentially disqualifying information to which the parties are entitled.for example,the arbitrator must disclose any ground specified in section for disqualification of a judge,as well as matters required to be disclosed by the ethics standards for neutral arbitrators adopted by the judicial council pursuant to this chapter,subd.a,see ethics standards,std.d.
the proposed arbitrator initial disclosure must include t he names of the parties to all prior or pending noncollective bargaining cases in which the proposed neutral arbitrator served or is serving as a party arbitrator for any party to the arbitration proceeding or for a lawyer for a party and the results of each case arbitrated to conclusion,including the date of the arbitration award,identification of the prevailing party,the names of the parties attorneys and the amount of monetary damages awarded,if any,subd.a.the same information is required for all such cases in which the proposed arbitrator has served or is serving as a neutral arbitrator for any of the parties or their attorneys,subd.a.

forfeiture of failures to disclose 
here,vradenburg haworth asserts judge broadman failure to disclose the amount of the arbitration awards and any mediations he conducted with the parties attorneys,along with his statement that further disclosure of mediations is waived if a party does not request complete disclosure,rendered the june disclosure statutorily deficient.she asserts that,as a result,she did not have access to sufficient information to have been able to discern that judge broadman had an incentive to rule in uhc favor.uhc acknowledges judge broadman disclosure did not comply entirely with the statutory requirements,but contends the incomplete disclosure does not provide sufficient grounds to vacate the award.
not every omission of information that is required to be disclosed pursuant to section constitutes a ground for disqualification within the meaning of section,subdivision.a a.dornbirer,supra,th at.instead,a ground for disqualification exists when the arbitrator failed to disclose the existence and nature of any relationship between the arbitrator and the parties or the parties attorneys.ibid.
in dornbirer,the arbitrator in a dispute between a patient and her medical provider kaiser disclosed his prior participation in several matters involving kaiser and its legal counsel.the disclosure statement omitted multiple pieces of information required under section,including the number of times the arbitrator had presided over arbitrations in which kaiser was a party,as well as the dates,results,and names of all attorneys involved in those arbitrations.the patient did not make further inquiry into these omissions,nor did she serve a disqualification notice or demand pursuant to section.dornbirer,supra,th at.
after the arbitrator ruled in kaiser favor,the patient petitioned the superior court to vacate the award pursuant to section.on appeal from the denial of her petition,the patient argued that any information required to be disclosed pursuant to section constitutes a ground for disqualification which the arbitrator must disclose in order to avoid mandatory vacatur under section,subdivision a a.dornbirer,supra,th at.kaiser responded that this interpretation of the law would have absurd results,in that a party could successfully move to have any arbitration award vacated if an arbitrator failed to disclose the amount of a single prior award or failed to provide the name of a single attorney involved in a prior arbitration.ibid.the appellate court agreed with kaiser.
the appellate court concluded that not every item of information that is required to be disclosed under section constitutes a ground for disqualification as the term is used in section.rather,the most reasonable interpretation of the statutory scheme is that the words failed to disclose within the time required for disclosure a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was then aware in section refer to a failure to disclose the existence and nature of any relationship between the arbitrator and the parties or the parties attorneys,not the specifics of each such relationship.dornbirer,supra,th at.although the arbitrator has a duty to comply with section,the disclosure of past or present relationships constitutes inquiry notice of the potential for bias.dornbirer,supra,at.the statutory scheme does not require an arbitration award to be vacated when the arbitrator has generally disclosed the grounds for disqualification,his or her relationships and prior interactions with the parties to the arbitration their attorneys,but has not provided all of the specific details required under section,and despite the omissions,the parties agreed to go forward with the arbitration.id.at.
in so holding,the appellate court observed that its interpretation of the statute gave effect to section,subdivision c,which states that a party waives the right to disqualify a proposed neutral arbitrator if that party fails to meet the time requirements set forth in that section.the exception to this waiver applies only if the proposed arbitrator made a material omission or material misrepresentation in his or her disclosure,subd.c.interpreting section to permit a party to vacate an arbitration award at the conclusion of the arbitration based on an arbitrator failure to disclose details such as the dates of prior arbitrations or the awards in prior arbitrations when that party knew about those prior arbitrations and did not request additional information or move to disqualify the arbitrator would undermine the purpose of the times limitations imposed in subdivision c of section.the waiver provision would have no effect because a party could simply wait until the arbitration is over and then move to vacate the award,despite having failed to move to disqualify the proposed arbitrator before the arbitration commenced.dornbirer,supra,th at.
the court concluded that because the patient consented to proceed with the arbitration despite being aware of the deficiencies in the arbitrator disclosure,pursuant to subdivision c of section she waived her right to disqualify the arbitrator and could not challenge the arbitration award on the ground his failure to provide the dates,outcomes and names of other attorneys involved in his prior kaiser arbitrations constitutes a ground for disqualification.dornbirer,supra,th at.as the court explained,b y failing to raise this issue earlier,the patient waived the right to disqualify the arbitrator based on an inadequate disclosure that did not amount to a material omission or misrepresentation.ibid.
based on dornbirer,uhc asserts the trial court erred in vacating the arbitration award because the evidence presented below showed that,before the arbitration began,smith knew that he himself had prior engagements with judge broadman,and knew and was put on notice of prior engagements judge broadman had with uhc counsel,yet did not make further inquiry or disqualify judge broadman instead,he chose to wait and see how the arbitration turned out,then challenge the award.the trial court,however,did not decide this factual issue.instead,while the trial court recognized that dornbirer supported uhc position,it refused to follow the case on the ground it was wrongly decided and contrary to section c,which states,the ethics requirements and standards of this chapter chapter,enforcement of arbitration agreements are nonnegotiable and shall not be waived.
in this proceeding,vradenburg haworth contends that dornbirer has been overruled by section c,which was added to section in by assembly bill,after dornbirer was decided.stats,ch,assem.bill,eff.she asserts that section c and subsequent case law unequivocally eliminated any possibility of waiver.the resolution of this issue turns on the type of waiver prohibited by section c,which is an issue of statutory construction.
section c does not define the term waived.in determining the statute meaning,o ur task is to discern the legislature intent.the statutory language itself is the most reliable indicator,so we start with the statute words,assigning them their usual and ordinary meanings,and construing them in context.if the words themselves are not ambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the statute plain meaning governs.on the other hand,if the language allows more than one reasonable construction,we may look to such aids as the legislative history of the measure and maxims of statutory construction.in cases of uncertain meaning,we may also consider the consequences of a particular interpretation,including its impact on public policy.wells learning foundation cal th,people smith cal th.moreover,r eviewing courts may turn to the legislative history behind even unambiguous statutes when it confirms or bolsters their interpretation.in re gilbert th.
to resolve an ambiguity,we rely upon rules.the meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence the words must be construed in context,and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.citation.literal construction should not prevail if it is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute an interpretation that renders related provisions nugatory must be avoided citation each sentence must be read not in isolation but in light of the statutory scheme citation and if a statute is amenable to two alternative interpretations,the one that leads to the more reasonable result will be followed citation.citations.people shabazz cal th,see also robert superior court cal th,statutory language should not be interpreted in isolation,but must be construed in the context of the entire statute of which it is a part,in order to achieve harmony among the parts.we must interpret a statute in accord with its legislative intent and where the legislature expressly declares its intent,we must accept that declaration.tyrone kelley cal d.absurd or unjust results will never be ascribed to the legislature,and a literal construction of a statute will not be followed if it is opposed to its legislative intent.webster superior court cal d,lungren deukmejian cal d.in re th.
the term waiver can have multiple meanings.as our supreme court has explained generally,waiver denotes the voluntary relinquishment of a known right.but it can also mean the loss of an opportunity or a right as a result of a party failure to perform an act it is required to perform,regardless of the party intent to abandon or relinquish the right.citations.the term waiver has also been used as a shorthand statement for the conclusion that a contractual right to arbitration has been lost.platt pacific,andelson cal th.in some cases,such as those which hold that a party may waive its right to arbitrate by failing to timely demand arbitration,the use of the word waiver connotes the loss or forfeiture of a right resulting from failure to perform a required act.ibid.
the dornbirer case used the word waiver in the sense of a forfeiture of a right resulting from failure to perform an act.as we have explained,the court held that,by consenting to proceed with the arbitration despite being aware of the deficiencies in the arbitrator disclosure,the patient waived her right to disqualify the arbitrator on the basis of the inadequate disclosure.dornbirer,supra,th at.thus,the court determined that by failing to perform certain acts permitted by statute,namely by failing to serve a notice of disqualification pursuant to section after becoming aware of the deficient disclosure statement,the patient lost her right to vacate the arbitration award based on the deficient statement.
the legislative history of section c,however,reflects that the term waived in that subdivision is used in a different way,as the subdivision was enacted to prohibit contractual waivers of the statutory right to disqualify an arbitrator,not forfeitures of rights resulting from the failure to perform an act a report of the assembly committee on judiciary states that,according to the bill author,t he bill amends the code of civil procedure to prohibit arbitration providers and arbitrators from contracting out of california ethical standards.assem.comm.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess,as introduced,hearing date may.the report explains although it should be clear that the ethics standards were established primarily for the purpose of public protection and therefore should not be subject to negotiation or waiver,there have been reported instances of private judging companies imposing and attempting to defend contractual waivers of these obligations,and there have no doubt been unreported instances as well,azteca construction,adr consulting,th azteca jevne superior court,cal th.this bill would settle any doubt on the matter by declaring expressly that arbitrator ethics rules are not subject to negotiation or waiver.assem.comm.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess,as introduced,hearing date may.
