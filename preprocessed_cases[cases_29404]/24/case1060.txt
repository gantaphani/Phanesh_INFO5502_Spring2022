defendant amoco pipeline company appeals from the district court confirmation of an arbitration award.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm.
background 
in,ernest bowen noticed an oily sheen in flag branch creek,which is located on his property.after investigating the matter,the oklahoma corporate commission occ concluded remediation of the creek would be more detrimental than beneficial.in,however,bowen again observed a sheen in the creek,after which he notified the pollution control division of the occ,as well as amoco pipeline company amoco and koch gathering systems,koch.both amoco and koch own oil pipelines that cross the creek koch owns two idled lines and amoco owns two idled lines and two active lines.after being notified by bowen,amoco retained geosearch environmental to determine the source of the sheen.although geosearch found hydrocarbon contamination near the creek,it concluded the source was an upstream historic release of oil,rather than a leak from amoco pipelines.contrary to amoco conclusions,research conducted by bowen expert,fox hollow consultants,suggested that a leak in amoco lines may be the source of contamination.under fox hollow theory,oil had leaked from amoco lines,migrated downward to the water table about nine feet below,and then floated on the water table to the creek.
in a memorandum dated september,the occ summarized the information available regarding the contamination in flag branch creek and reached some conclusions.in evaluating potential sources of the contamination,the occ dismissed oil wells and old documented pipeline leaks.no oil well was close enough to the creek to be the source,and the two nearby documented leaks from koch pipelines could not have contaminated flag branch creek because they were contained within their immediate spill areas.because wells and documented leaks were not the source,the occ concluded the source of the hydrocarbon contamination must be an undocumented leak from one of the six pipelines.through deductive reasoning,the occ arrived at a theory similar to that proposed by fox hollow consultants oil from one of the lines leaked into the porous sandy alluvial deposits,migrated downward to the water table approximately nine to ten feet below the surface,and floated on the water table to the creek.in order to determine the source,the occ recommended koch and amoco uncover their lines in order to expose any visual evidence of historic or current leaks.
despite amoco repeated assertions of its good corporate citizenship and willingness to follow all rules and regulations,it refused to follow the occ recommendation and uncover its pipelines,arguing uncovering the lines would be unnecessary and jeopardize the lines safety.after performing some trenching around its lines and finding no hydrocarbons,amoco continued to deny any responsibility for the contamination but emphasized that,were amoco the responsible party,it would clean up the pollution.in april,koch concluded its investigation.the following month,the occ sent amoco a letter explaining that koch information indicated amoco pipeline on the east side of the creek may be the source of contamination.despite this information,amoco continued its refusal to strip the lines,offering instead to do some soil borings and recommending the oklahoma energy resources board oerb become involved.
displeased with amoco continued denial of any responsibility,and bowen filed a lawsuit in may in federal district court,asserting a cause of action for damages to real property,nuisance,trespass,unjust enrichment,breach of contract,and exemplary damages.in july,amoco asked the district court to stay the proceeding and order the dispute to arbitration pursuant to an enforceable arbitration agreement in arguing their motion to compel arbitration,amoco contended the arbitration panel would have the power to decide all claims,an assertion they now refute.the bowens objected to arbitration,challenging the arbitration agreement as unenforceable.in october,the district court granted amoco motion and entered an order compelling arbitration.
in july,amoco responded to the bowens interrogatories,continuing to deny its lines were the source of hydrocarbon contamination in the creek.in addition,amoco explicitly denied that any leaks or spills attributable to its pipeline operation had occurred on the bowens property and even denied the existence of pollution in the soil.the following month,fred hesser,a district environmental health and safety coordinator for amoco,stated in his deposition that from to january he encountered no evidence indicating amoco might be the source of the contamination.in october,however,amoco tests confirmed the presence of hydrocarbons in the soil under its lines but found no contamination in the groundwater.
in june and july of,three years after the occ recommended that amoco uncover its pipelines,amoco exposed limited portions of its lines on the bowens property and admitted the existence of contaminants next to the lines.significantly,the stripping of the lines revealed a pipeline replacement in the contaminated area.less than two months before the arbitration hearing,the bowens discovered that amoco had replaced approximately feet of pipeline on the east side of the creek.according to the bowens expert,the feet of replaced pipeline corresponds almost exactly with the contaminated creek area.although amoco had not explicitly disclosed the line replacement and had repeatedly denied any link to the contamination,it claimed to have provided the bowens with a line sheet showing the replacement.amoco did not,however,explain the information contained in the line sheet,which was technical and difficult to read,until the arbitration hearing when its employee testified that approximately feet of pipeline was replaced in.
other than the line sheet,amoco claimed it could find no other records detailing the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the line some testimony that it was corporate practice to keep such records although amoco employees and experts argued the line replacement could have been a preventative measure,they admitted a leak in the line would be one explanation for the line replacement and for the concentration of crude oil in the soil in that exact location.moreover,after years of denying any connection to the contaminated soil,dennis beckman,fred hesser replacement,finally testified that the soil under the replaced pipelines was probably from amoco line.testing by amoco own expert confirmed the oil around the replaced well as the oil in the at least twenty years old,further evidence that the more recent leaks from koch pipelines were not the source.another amoco employee also testified that,in,amoco routinely left oil in the soil around a pipeline after fixing a leak.occasionally,amoco would excavate the contaminated soil,replace it with clean soil,and then spread land farm or deposit the contaminated somewhere else on the property.given this practice,the bowens argued a contaminated area of soil away from the replaced line was the location where amoco deposited excavated soil after the replacement.
although amoco changed its initial theory and admitted its lines might be the source of contamination in the soil,it continued to claim no responsibility for the hydrocarbon contamination in the creek.admitting a small leak may have occurred in,amoco continued to deny any connection to the contamination in the creek.amoco contended that,despite the contamination in the soil around its pipelines,the hydrocarbon levels in the groundwater did not exceed epa standards,and because the pollution in the soil was not reaching the water table,it was not reaching the creek.in addition,amoco continued to refute the bowens assertion that soil excavated from around the replaced line in was deposited in another location although the record contains various characterizations of this site,amoco appears to argue it is an old drilling site or the site of a historic pit used by others.
ii.the arbitration 
the bowens case was tried to a panel of three arbitrators in august.the parties agreed to use the rules for non administered arbitration of business disputes nabd,but they also agreed to modify these rules to expand the scope of judicial review.specifically,the parties agreed that both would have the right to appeal any arbitration award to the district court within thirty days on the grounds that the award is not supported by the evidence.they also agreed that the district court ruling shall be final.
on october,the arbitration panel granted the following relief to be deposited in an escrow fund for the use and benefit of a special master responsible for supervising the abatement of the contamination on the bowens property for the diminution in property value for annoyance,inconvenience,and aggravation in punitive damages and for the costs of investigation and mitigation.one panel member dissented,objecting to the escrow fund for abatement and punitive damages award.under the federal arbitration act faa,the bowens then filed a motion for confirmation of the arbitration award in district court.amoco responded by filing an objection to the confirmation and a motion to vacate the award.in addition,amoco filed a notice of appeal of the arbitration award pursuant to the modified arbitration rules.limiting its review to that provided under the faa,the district court did not apply the parties expanded judicial standard of review and declined to vacate the award.the court granted the bowens motion to confirm the award and affirmed the arbitrators order awarding the bowens attorneys fees,costs,and arbitrators fees.amoco appeals the district court order,urging us to vacate the entire award and remand for a new arbitration,or alternatively to vacate the remediation award and remand the case to district court for review based on the expanded standard of review.
ii.jurisdiction plaintiffs motion to dismiss appeal 
we must first address the bowens motion to dismiss for lack of appellate jurisdiction.the bowens contend the parties agreement that the district court ruling shall be final forecloses any appellate review.we disagree and deny the motion.
under of the faa,parties must express their intentions regarding judicial confirmation of an arbitration award in their arbitration agreements.the statute contemplates judicial confirmation of arbitration awards only when the parties in their agreement have agreed that a judgment of the court shall be entered upon the award made pursuant to the arbitration.id.we have held that this requires some language manifesting the parties intent either explicitly or implicitly to have judgment entered on the award.ok.city assocs.stores,cir accord smiga dean witter reynolds,cir.we have also observed that some courts have found that a finality clause is enough to constitute an agreement to have judgment entered by a federal court under because this would be the only way to fulfill the parties intent to make the award final and binding.ok.city,at.in this case,the parties agreement that the district court ruling be final may be construed as nothing more than a finality clause expressing their intent to have the district court enter judgment on the arbitration award.indeed,because the rules chosen by the parties do not include a provision regarding judicial confirmation,the parties had to supplement the rules to ensure judgment be entered on the award under the faa.
in addition,although parties to an arbitration agreement may eliminate judicial review by contract,their intention to do so must be clear and unequivocal.see dep t of air force fed.labor relations,cir holding parties did not completely waive right to appeal when agreement specified further rights of appeal are hereby waived except that all articles must be in conformance with law and executive order.am.arbitration ass n,cir while it has been held that parties to an arbitration can agree to eliminate all court review of the proceedings,the intention to do so must clearly appear.citations omitted.the language in the parties agreement does not clearly evince their intent to waive appellate review.in fact,the very statute from which we derive our jurisdiction,grants appellate courts jurisdiction from all final decisions of the district courts.hence,by agreeing that the district court ruling shall be final,the parties have merely reinforced the appellate jurisdiction conferred by.the bowens best argument is that the word final is ambiguous,but courts have long recognized the common law rule that ambiguous language be construed against the drafter of that language.mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,d.having suggested the modified language,the bowens may not now claim the benefit of the doubt.id.at.
iii.standard of review 
in reviewing a district court decision concerning a motion to vacate an arbitration award,we review questions of law de novo.denver rio grande union pac,cir arw exploration aguirre,cir.if the district court makes any findings of fact in ruling on the motion,we review its factual findings for clear error.denver rio grande,at.our review of the arbitration panel decision under the faa and the few judicially created exceptions is,however,far more limited.
although the faa does not create independent federal jurisdiction,the supreme court has held that the act creates a body of substantive federal law governing arbitration agreements within its coverage.terminix dobson,d moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d accord foster turley,cir.moreover,the act creates no new rights except a remedy to enforce an arbitration agreement.dean witter reynolds,byrd,d quoting legislative history.the act applies to a written arbitration clause in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce,a requirement broadly interpreted to correspond with congress power under the commerce clause.allied bruce terminix,at.foster,at.the district court ordered the arbitration in the case before us pursuant to a agreement,a transaction involving pipelines for the interstate transportation of crude oil.the faa therefore applies to the parties dispute.
our review of the arbitration panel decision under the faa is strictly limited this highly deferential standard has been described as among the narrowest known to the law.arw exploration,at internal quotation marks omitted.in consenting to arbitration,a party trades the procedures and opportunity for review of the courtroom for the simplicity,informality,and expedition of arbitration.brown coleman,cir quoting gilmer lane,d.we employ this limited standard of review and exercise caution in setting aside arbitration awards because one purpose behind arbitration agreements is to avoid the expense and delay of court proceedings.foster,at.a court may not,therefore,independently judge an arbitration award.ormsbee dev.grace,cir.
mindful of the strong federal policy favoring arbitration,a court may grant a motion to vacate an arbitration award only in the limited circumstances provided in of the faa,or in accordance with a few judicially created exceptions,denver rio grande,at.under the faa,vacation is proper in certain instances of fraud or corruption,arbitrator misconduct,or w here the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.a.although amoco does not allege fraud or misconduct,it does argue that the arbitrators exceeded their powers.in addition,amoco argues the arbitration panel decision is in manifest disregard of the law,a judicially crafted exception to the general rule that arbitrators erroneous interpretations or applications of law are not reversible.arw exploration,at citing wilko swan,overruled on other grounds,quijas.express,d.we have interpreted manifest disregard of the law to mean willful inattentiveness to the governing law.arw exploration,at internal quotation marks omitted.requiring more than error or misunderstanding of the law,a finding of manifest disregard means the record will show the arbitrators knew the law and explicitly disregarded it,tanner,cir.under traditional standards of review,we would,therefore,review amoco claims to determine whether the arbitrators exceeded their powers or rendered a decision in manifest disregard of the law 
amoco argues,however,that the parties in this case contracted for expanded judicial review in agreeing that the arbitration award would be appealable if not supported by the evidence.the district court did not apply this expanded standard,deciding instead that parties may not alter the traditional standards of review by contract.emphasizing the policies behind the faa,amoco argues the district court erred and we should apply the contractually created standard.although amoco presents a difficult question,we conclude the purposes behind the faa,as well as the principles announced in various supreme cases,do not support a rule allowing parties to alter the judicial process by private contract.
the only two circuits to definitively decide this issue have,however,held that private parties may agree to expand the judicial standard of review lapine tech.kyocera,cir gateway,mci telecomms,cir.both the fifth and the ninth circuits were persuaded by language in supreme court decisions emphasizing,in particular,the faa purpose of ensuring that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their terms.lapine,at quoting volt info.sciences bd.of trustees,d accord gateway,at describing the faa judicial review standard as a default standard of review.although,as the ninth circuit acknowledged,agreeing to the judicial standard of review is not the same as agreeing to the rules governing the scope of arbitration,the court concluded the two are inexorably intertwined and could find no sufficient reason to pay less respect to the review provision than to the myriad of other agreements which the parties have been pleased to make.lapine,at.in a splintered decision,the court decided the opposite result would be contrary to congress intent in enacting the faa under the guise of deference to the arbitration concept.id.
in resolving conflicts among the faa,state law,and parties agreements,the supreme court has repeatedly acknowledged that congress intent in enacting the faa was to ensure judicial enforcement of private arbitration agreements.see,mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,d c ourts are bound to interpret contracts in accordance with the expressed intentions of the parties volt info.sciences,bd.of trustees,d just as parties may limit by contract the issues which they will arbitrate,so too may they specify by contract the rules under which the arbitration will be conducted.citation omitted dean witter reynolds,at.observing the faa legislative history makes clear that its purpose was to place an arbitration agreement upon the same footing as other contracts,where it belongs,and to overrule the judiciary longstanding refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate citation and internal quotation marks omitted.when congress passed the act in,it did so with the primary goal of changing the judiciary refusal to enforce arbitration clauses in private contracts.terminix,at.with the passage of the faa,congress intended to make arbitration agreements as enforceable as other contracts,but not more so.prima paint flood conklin,d.
guided by the faa underlying purpose and the essentially contractual nature of arbitration,the court has held,for example,that parties may agree to conduct arbitration under procedural rules different from the faa.volt info.sciences,at.the court has also held district courts must compel arbitration even if arbitrable and nonarbitrable claims are pleaded in the same complaint despite the potential negative effects on efficient dispute resolution.dean witter reynolds,at.parties may even agree to submit questions concerning arbitrability to the arbitrators.first options of chicago,kaplan,d.the contractual nature of arbitration is,therefore,well established.parties are free to structure their arbitration agreements as they wish,and our decision today must further the faa primary policy ensuring judicial enforcement of private agreements to arbitrate.
we disagree,however,with the fifth and ninth circuits conclusion that the supreme court precedent emphasizing the faa primary purpose compels enforcement of contractual modifications of judicial review.although the court has emphasized that parties may specify by contract the rules under which arbitration will be conducted,volt info.sciences,at,it has never said parties are free to interfere with the judicial process.as both the concurring and dissenting opinions in lapine acknowledge,parties may determine by contract what issues to arbitrate and what rules will govern arbitration,but no authority clearly allows private parties to determine how federal courts review arbitration awards.at kozinski,concurring and mayer,dissenting.to the contrary,through the faa congress has provided explicit guidance regarding judicial standards of review of arbitration awards.prima paint,at.moreover,if parties desire broader appellate review,they can contract for an appellate arbitration panel to review the arbitrator award.chicago typographical union chicago,cir.the decisions directing courts to honor parties agreements and to resolve close questions in favor of arbitration simply do not dictate that courts submit to varying standards of review imposed by private contract.
even volt,the case often cited in support of contractually created standards of review,does not dictate this result.in determining whether the faa a state procedural rule,to which the parties had agreed by contract,the court focused on whether the state rule conflicted with the federal policies and objectives of the faa.at.the court held parties may agree that procedural rules outside the faa will govern arbitration proceedings because the federal policy favoring arbitration does not favor arbitration under a particular set of procedural rules.id.at.enforcing the parties contract therefore gave effect to the contractual rights and expectations of the parties without doing violence to the policies behind the faa.id.at.emphasis added.conversely,the faa state rules that contravene the policies behind the faa.see,southland keating,d holding faa state laws that require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration.the court analysis therefore suggests that the faa is more than a collection of default rules,which parties may alter with complete discretion.the key question is whether the alternate rule conflicts with federal policies furthered by the faa.
unlike the contract clause at issue in volt,the contract clause in this case threatens to undermine the policies behind the faa.we would reach an illogical result if we concluded that the faa policy of ensuring judicial enforcement of arbitration agreements is well served by allowing for expansive judicial review after the matter is arbitrated.the faa limited review ensures judicial respect for the arbitration process and prevents courts from enforcing parties agreements to arbitrate only to refuse to respect the results of the arbitration.these limited standards manifest a legislative intent to further the federal policy favoring arbitration by preserving the independence of the arbitration process.unlike of the faa,which allows parties to petition a federal court for an order compelling arbitration in the manner provided for in the agreement,the provisions governing judicial review of awards,contain no language requiring district courts to follow parties agreements.
not surprisingly,the faa narrow standards reflect the supreme court view of the relationship between arbitration and judicial review b y agreeing to arbitrate,a party trades the procedures and opportunity for review of the courtroom for the simplicity,informality,and expedition of arbitration.gilmer lane,d quoting mitsubishi motors soler,d see also first options of chicago,at.noting parties have the right to a judicial decision on the merits but where the party has agreed to arbitrate,he or she,in effect,has relinquished much of that right practical value contractually expanded standards,particularly those that allow for factual review,clearly threaten to undermine the independence of the arbitration process and dilute the finality of arbitration awards because,in order for arbitration awards to be effective,courts must not only enforce the agreements to arbitrate but also enforce the resulting arbitration awards.
moreover,expanded judicial review places federal courts in the awkward position of reviewing proceedings conducted under potentially unfamiliar rules and procedures under either expanded legal or expanded factual standards,the reviewing court would be engaging in work different from what it would do if it had simply heard the case itself.lapine,at kozinski,concurring.the eighth circuit has also recognized this potential problem we have served notice that where arbitration is contemplated the courts are not equipped to provide the same judicial review given to structured judgments defined by procedural rules and legal principles.parties should be aware that they get what they bargain for and that arbitration is far different from adjudication.uhc mgmt.computer sciences,cir internal quotation marks omitted.because parties may not force reviewing courts to apply unfamiliar rules and procedures,see,dick,cir,expanded judicial review would threaten the independence of arbitration and weaken the distinction between arbitration and adjudication.arbitrators are chosen for their specialized experience and knowledge,which enable them to fashion creative remedies and solutions that courts may be less likely to endorse expanded judicial review therefore places a court in the position of reviewing that which it would not do and reduces arbitrators willingness to create particularized solutions for fear the decision will be vacated by a reviewing court.see hans smit,contractual modification of the scope of judicial review of arbitral awards,am.int l arb.
although we are the first circuit to hold that parties may not contract for an expanded standard of review,two circuits have indicated they too would reject contractually expanded standards.in dicta,both the seventh and eighth circuits have expressed disapproval of contractually expanded standards of review,acknowledging the independence of the arbitration process and noting parties may contract for an appellate arbitration panel should they desire more review uhc mgmt,at chicago typographical union,at.we agree and hold that parties may not contract for expanded judicial review of arbitration awards.we therefore proceed to review the arbitration award in the case before us under the faa and manifest disregard of justice standards.
iv.arbitration panel jurisdiction to order abatement 
under oklahoma statutes,the oklahoma corporation commission occ is vested with exclusive jurisdiction over many activities and properties affected by oil and gas,including construction and operation of pipelines and associated and related site remediation.stat.ann.tit,a h a.stat.ann.tit,b.amoco argues that this statute abrogates the arbitration panel jurisdiction over the bowens equitable request for abatement of the hydrocarbon contamination.amoco argues that,because the arbitration panel did not have jurisdiction to order cleanup,they exceeded their powers and acted in manifest disregard of the law.
we have recognized the rule that any doubt about the arbitrability of an issue should be resolved in favor of arbitration and that arbitrators have broad authority in fashioning remedies parties who agree to submit matters to arbitration are presumed to agree that everything,both as to law and fact,necessary to render an ultimate decision is included in the authority of the arbitrators.ormsbee dev.grace,cir see also continental materials gaddis mining,cir t he jurisdiction to make arbitration awards is derived from the agreement of submission.the arbitrators power to award equitable relief is also well established.gilmer,at.accord brown coleman,cir.in response to the bowens objection to amoco motion to compel arbitration of all issues,amoco the district court the arbitration panel could grant injunctive relief and remediation,a position amoco advocated throughout the arbitration and only now wishes to abandon.
furthermore,what exclusive jurisdiction means under the oklahoma statutes is not entirely clear.the language is the product of several amendments and no case squarely addresses its meaning.the bowens argue that exclusive jurisdiction only refers to the occ jurisdiction relative to other agencies,not courts.case law prior to provides some support for this argument.prior to,the oklahoma supreme court held that the occ exclusive jurisdiction over certain oil and gas activities was implicit in the statute and precluded other agency review.matador pipelines.water res.in addition,the state appellate court has concluded that a district court exercise of jurisdiction over a nuisance claim does not prevent the occ from proceeding to abate existing contamination.union texas petroleum jackson,emphasis added under pre statutes.
but oklahoma courts have not yet decided that a district court lacks all jurisdiction to order a cleanup when the occ has not yet exercised its jurisdiction.the case cited by amoco,schneberger apache,does not support the conclusion that courts lack jurisdiction the schneberger court merely mentioned in recounting the facts of the case that the occ had exercised its exclusive jurisdiction on pollution matters and ordered a cleanup.id.at.such a passing reference is not a statement that oklahoma courts would conclude the statutory language forecloses their jurisdiction.
furthermore,the oklahoma supreme court has applied the doctrine as articulated by the supreme court in determining how to apportion jurisdiction between the occ and the district courts.tenneco oil el paso natural gas.under the doctrine,congress may commit matters arising between the government and persons subject to its authority to nonjudicial executive bodies but p disputes lie at the core of the historically recognized judicial power.id.quoting northern pipeline constr.marathon pipe line,d.in tenneco,the oklahoma court recognized that the liability of one individual to another under the law is a private right and held that tenneco sought equitable relief for a private right,which was not an attack upon the public rights function of the occ to regulate and administer the conservational laws and policies of the sovereign state.id.
citing tenneco,we have held that an action under oklahoma law to recover damages to property and water caused by the drilling of an oil well is a private rights dispute properly within the jurisdiction of the district court.marshall el paso natural gas,cir analyzing the question of primary jurisdiction.although these cases do not consider the amendment to the oklahoma statute,they are persuasive evidence that the meaning of the occ exclusive jurisdiction is far from clear.furthermore,the rules under which the arbitration was conducted clearly provide that the arbitrators have the power to decide challenges to their jurisdiction.nabd.despite this provision,amoco chose not to challenge their jurisdiction to order abatement before or during arbitration.we therefore hold the arbitration panel did not exceed its powers or act in manifest disregard of the law in ordering cleanup of the bowens property.
double recovery damages and abatement 
even if the arbitration panel had jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief,amoco argues the escrow fund is in manifest disregard of oklahoma law,which prohibits double recovery for the same injury and limits monetary damages to the diminished value of the land.see schneberger,at.although a nuisance action may include claims for both permanent and temporary damages,double recovery for the same damage is not allowed.houck hold oil,tort action for recovery of damage caused by drilling oil wells briscoe harper oil,private nuisance action.if a plaintiff alleges both kinds of damage,a defendant can in no event be held liable for more than the total diminution in reasonable market value assuming the temporary injuries were left standing or unrestored.houck,at.
