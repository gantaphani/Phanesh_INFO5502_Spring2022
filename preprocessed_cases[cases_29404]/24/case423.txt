plaintiff base metal trading,base metal,a guernsey,channel island corporation brought the present action to confirm a foreign arbitration award against defendant ojsc novokuznetsky aluminum factory nkaz,a russian corporation.the district court dismissed the case for lack of personal jurisdiction over nkaz.because the mere presence of seized property in maryland provides no basis for asserting jurisdiction when there is no relationship between the property and the action,we affirm.
from to,plaintiff base metal,a guernsey,channel islands corporation engaged in trading in raw materials associated with the aluminum industry,had various business dealings with defendant nkaz,a russian corporation engaged in the manufacture and sale of aluminum.a dispute arose between the two parties and in,they agreed to arbitrate the dispute in the private commercial arbitration court of the moscow chamber of commerce and industry.on december,the commercial arbitration court issued an arbitration award in favor of base metal in the amount of approximately.however,base metal was unable to collect the award at that time.
on june,base metal filed a verified complaint to confirm a foreign arbitration award in maryland district court,pursuant to the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards the convention,implemented by et.on that same day,base metal filed a motion seeking seizure or attachment of an aluminum shipment alleged to belong to nkaz that had arrived in baltimore harbor on june.see.the attachment motion was granted by the district court and the property was taken into custody by the marshal.shortly thereafter,mg metal commodity and mg metal commodity,collectively mg claimed ownership of the seized aluminum and moved to vacate the attachment.on july,the district court issued an order vacating the attachment,giving custody and control over the aluminum to mg,and providing for the placement into an escrow account of any funds derived from the sale of the aluminum 
on september,base metal filed an affidavit stating that on august,a copy of the summons and complaint was sent to nkaz.however,nkaz did not respond on january,base metal moved for a default judgment against nkaz.the district court granted the motion and entered a default judgment against nkaz in the amount of.upon learning of the default judgment,nkaz moved to vacate it and to have the case dismissed for,inter alia,lack of personal jurisdiction.
on april,the district court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.the court noted that nkaz contacts with maryland related exclusively to the fact that aluminum manufactured by nkaz in russia was unloaded in baltimore harbor.and the court held that,by no stretch could the single shipment,or even several such shipments,constitute continuous and systematic contacts with maryland so as to justify general jurisdiction over nkaz.
base metal filed a motion for reconsideration seeking to have the court exercise jurisdiction pursuant to rule k of the federal rules of civil procedure which provides that a district court may exercise jurisdiction over a defendant if the plaintiff claim arise s under federal law the defendant is not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of general jurisdiction of any state and the court exercise of jurisdiction is consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states.k.the court determined that in order to exercise jurisdiction under rule k it had to find that no other state court had jurisdiction over nkaz.and in light of cases pending in other courts in which base metal was arguing strenuously that nkaz had sufficient contacts to warrant the exercise of personal jurisdiction,such a finding would be difficult and would usurp the opportunity for sister federal courts to exercise jurisdiction which they may decide they have.therefore,the court declined to apply rule k.base metal appeals.
base metal argues that the presence of nkaz property in maryland confers jurisdiction over nkaz for the purpose of confirming and enforcing the foreign arbitration award.
as a preliminary matter,the convention and its implementing legislation,et,give federal district courts original jurisdiction over actions to compel or confirm foreign arbitration awards.see.however,while the convention confers subject matter jurisdiction over actions brought pursuant to the convention,it does not confer personal jurisdiction when it would not otherwise exist.in other words,a plaintiff still must demonstrate that personal jurisdiction is proper under the constitution.see transatl.bulk shipping,saudi chartering.
the personal jurisdiction inquiry is a one.determining whether jurisdiction is proper is normally a two step process determining if the state statute confers jurisdiction and whether the exercise of jurisdiction,if authorized,is consistent with the due process requirements of the fourteenth amendment.since maryland statute expands the exercise of personal jurisdiction to the limits allowed by the due process clause,the analysis merges in this case and the question is simply whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction would be consistent with due process.see ellicott mach.john holland party,cir yangming marine transp.revon prods.due process requires only that a defendant have certain minimum contacts with the forum such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe washington.quoting milliken meyer.for these minimum contacts to exist,there must be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.hanson denckla,d see also burger king rudzewicz,d.
in examining whether the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable,a distinction is made between specific and general jurisdiction.when the cause of action arises out of the defendant contacts with the forum,a court may seek to exercise specific jurisdiction.see helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d.however,when the cause of action does not arise out of the defendant contacts with the forum,general jurisdiction may be exercised upon a showing that the defendant contacts are of a continuous and systematic nature.id.at.see also goodyear tire rubber ruby.
this basic analysis is not altered when the defendant property is found in the forum state.the supreme court decision in shaffer heitner,d,eliminated all doubt that the minimum contacts standard in international shoe governs in rem and quasi in rem actions as well as in personam actions.shaffer,at.the court held that in order to justify an exercise of jurisdiction in rem,the basis for jurisdiction must be sufficient to justify exercising jurisdiction over the interests of persons in a thing.id.at.internal quotations omitted.and t he standard for determining whether an exercise of jurisdiction over the interests of persons is consistent with the due process clause is the standard elucidated in international shoe.id.
of course,the presence of property in a state may have an impact on the personal jurisdiction inquiry.indeed,when claims to the property itself are the source of the underlying controversy between the plaintiff and the defendant,it would be unusual for the state where the property is located not to have jurisdiction.id.yet,when the property which serves as the basis for jurisdiction is completely unrelated to the plaintiff cause of action,the presence of property alone will not support jurisdiction.id.at.while,the presence of the defendant property in a state might suggest the existence of other ties among the defendant,the state,and the litigation,when those other ties do not exist,jurisdiction is not reasonable.id.
overall,courts must consider the burden on the defendant,the interests of the forum state,and the plaintiff interest in obtaining relief when determining whether the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable in any given case.asahi metal indus.superior court,d.and t he unique burdens placed upon one who must defend oneself in a foreign legal system should have significant weight in assessing the reas
