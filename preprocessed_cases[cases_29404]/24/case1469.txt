an arbitrator who issued an award in an initial dispute between the parties did not exceed his powers when,upon one party demand for a second arbitration,the arbitrator construed the arbitration agreement as authorizing him to act as the arbitrator for subsequent disputes between the parties.we therefore affirm the trial court judgment confirming the second arbitration award.
factual and procedural background 
bergamot station,appeals from a judgment confirming an arbitration award in favor of thomas patchett and denying its to vacate the award.the arbitration award at issue occurred in the second arbitration between the parties july award.bergamot station contends the arbitrator,retired judge robert thomas,exceeded his powers because bergamot station did not agree to judge thomas appointment as the arbitrator for the second arbitration,which was initiated shortly after the issuance of his award in the first arbitration june award.
patchett and wayne blank were partners in bergamot station galleries in santa monica.disputes arose between them,a lawsuit was filed,and a settlement was reached in.under the settlement,blank purchased patchett interest in the bergamot station property.patchett was permitted to occupy a portion of the premises,but was responsible for paying common area maintenance cam charges.the settlement provided that disputes of any nature arising from the settlement,including the arbitrability of any claim,would be settled by one arbitrator,who shall be a retired judge of the california superior or appellate courts.
in february,patchett served a demand for arbitration of two issues his right to hold private events at the premises he occupied,and his right to receive an accounting from blank of cam charges levied upon tenants.the parties selected judge thomas as the arbitrator.at the arbitration,patchett sought a declaration he could hold private events on the property and an award of damages for lost events,and an accounting and the return of cam charges in excess of per month.judge thomas issued an award on june.he found patchett was entitled to hold private events,but an award of monetary damages was not justified.he further found patchett failed to meet his burden of proving his cam charges were not commensurate with those of other tenants,and denied patchett request for an accounting of cam charges without prejudice.the arbitrator explained 
this does not mean that the arbitrator has determined that blank is entitled to charge tenants for his salary as manager,his assistant manager salary,worker salaries,payroll charges,payroll taxes,insurance and property management fees.blank testified that he was advised by his accountants that he could pass on these charges.the arbitrator has just determined that the proof was insufficient in this arbitration to establish patchett right to the relief requested.this also is an issue that may have to be determined on another day.
on july,patchett served another demand for arbitration,styled claimant renewed demand for arbitration following arbitration award.patchett renewed his demand for an accounting.he specifically requested,among other things,a determination his obligation to pay cam charges was defined by his sublease a determination he had no obligation to pay cam charges,or if he was obligated,certain categories of expenses were excluded and reimbursement of all improper amounts collected.in letters to the arbitrator dated july and august,bergamot station objected to the of the cam charges and asserted it would not agree to judge thomas serving as the arbitrator in any new arbitration proceeding.
on august,the arbitrator granted patchett motion for renewed arbitration,and denied bergamot station objection to his serving as the arbitrator.the arbitrator ruling stated that the june award denied patchett request for an accounting of cam charges without prejudice,and by its terms did not preclude a further determination of the cam charges issues.the ruling also stated judge thomas was mutually selected by the parties under the settlement agreement,which does not state that a different arbitrator is to be mutually selected to hear each new set of claims.thereafter 
on september,bergamot station objected to judge thomas jurisdiction over it in connection with the new arbitration.
on november,patchett petitioned to compel arbitration and to compel arbitration before judge robert thomas,ret.
on december,patchett petitioned to confirm the first arbitration award.this petition was later consolidated with his petition to compel the second arbitration.bergamot station to correct the june award,to state the cam charges claim was denied with prejudice,and to confirm the award as corrected.the also sought dismissal of patchett petition to compel arbitration before judge thomas.
on august,the trial court judge fumiko wasserman granted patchett petition to confirm the june award that patchett has the right to hold private events the trial court also granted patchett petition for renewed arbitration on the issue of an accounting,as well as his petition to compel the renewed arbitration before judge thomas.
bergamot station later petition to the court of appeal for a writ of prohibition or writ of mandate to set aside the trial court order was denied.
bergamot station appealed on october.thirteen months later,on october,bergamot station appeal was dismissed p ursuant to stipulation 
the second arbitration was held in may and june.in july,the arbitrator found that bergamot station could not patchett sublease to include the substantially broader definition of cam charges that appeared in the leases of other tenants.as a result,bergamot station increase in cam charges to patchett from per month to per month was not justified.the july award set cam charges for patchett at per month awarded patchett as excessive cam charges and further awarded patchett attorney fees of and costs of.
patchett petitioned to confirm the july award,and bergamot station to vacate the award.on march,the trial court william fahey confirmed the award.the court found the arbitrator had jurisdiction of the controversy and did not exceed his authority 
judgment was entered confirming the award on april,and bergamot station filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
bergamot station contends the arbitrator july award exceeded his powers.in essence,it argues the arbitrator had no authority to act because bergamot station did not agree to his reappointment for the second arbitration.we find no merit in this claim 
preliminarily,patchett demand for the second arbitration was styled a renewed demand for arbitration,and bergamot station contends that renewed arbitration is a procedure heretofore unknown in the statutes and is therefore improper.we discern no legal significance in the term renewed.while use of the term renewed was imprecise and inaccurate,its use can not affect the underlying facts,which are these 
patchett demanded a second arbitration.
the arbitrator before whom the demand was filed determined he was authorized to arbitrate the matter.
when bergamot station refused,judge wasserman ordered it to arbitrate before judge thomas.
bergamot station appealed judge wasserman order.
after the appeal was pending for more than a year and was briefed by both parties,the parties requested a dismissal.the court of appeal dismissed the appeal and issued a remittitur.
under these facts,we discern no basis for concluding the arbitrator was without authority to act in the second arbitration.this is so for both procedural and substantive reasons.
first,the procedural reason the arbitrator determined he was authorized to act judge wasserman concluded the arbitrator had the authority to act bergamot station appealed judge wasserman order and months later,bergamot station changed course and stipulated to dismissal of the appeal.at this late date,we can not permit bergamot station to assert that judge wasserman order was,after all,not appealable,and therefore it may now,for a second time,challenge her order on appeal.judge wasserman order may well not be appealable.atlas plastering,superior court d.an order directing parties to arbitrate is nona
