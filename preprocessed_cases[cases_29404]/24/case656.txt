after illinois bell telephone company company refused to arbitrate a grievance,the international brotherhood of electrical workers,local union filed a motion to compel arbitration in federal district court.under the terms of the parties collective bargaining agreement cba,the district court found the grievance arbitrable and granted the motion.we affirm.
background 
the parties cba has been in effect since june.in late,the company informed the union that it planned to implement new consumer performance management guidelines.in the past,employees were evaluated on a work flow system.essentially,employees were required to perform specific tasks in response to actions taken by the customers with whom they dealt.the new guidelines would replace the work flow system with a sales evaluation system,wherein employees would be evaluated based on actual sales made.if an employee should fail to meet his sales requirements,he could be disciplined and eventually fired.
upon notice of the company plans,the union filed a grievance challenging the implementation of the guidelines.the parties engaged in a series of discussions regarding the guidelines,and the company made some changes to the program.in the end,however,the parties could not resolve their dispute.the union requested that the grievance be submitted to arbitration,but the company refused,asserting that the grievance was not arbitrable under the terms of the cba.the union then filed its motion to compel arbitration in federal court pursuant to the federal arbitration act.
the arbitration clause,of the cba,defines what topics are arbitrable 
the right to invoke arbitration shall extend only to matters which involve 
a the interpretation or application of any of the terms or provisions of this agreement,unless excluded by specific provisions of this agreement.
b the discipline of an employee with six or more months of net credited service.
to invoke the arbitration clause,the union points to several provisions of the cba,the interpretation or application of which may be involved in this dispute.first,the recognition clause,of the cba,states the company recognizes the union as the exclusive bargaining agent for the employees of the company second,requires mutual responsibility and respect and a fair application of the cba in accord with its intent and meaning and consistent with the union status as exclusive bargaining representative.third,the cba includes a no strike provision,strictly prohibiting the union from striking under any circumstance.none of the above provisions have been explicitly excluded from arbitration,and nothing in the cba specifically pertains to the implementation of performance guidelines.
ii.analysis 
we review the district court ruling to compel arbitration de novo.american united logistics,catellus dev,cir citing harter iowa grain,cir.a rbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.at t,commc ns workers of,d quoting united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf navigation,d int l med.group,am.arbitration ass n,cir.the arbitrator derives his authority to resolve the parties dispute from their agreement to allow him to do so.int l med.group,at.unless the parties clearly provide otherwise,the question of arbitrability is properly decided by a court,not the arbitrator.id.
when resolving arbitrability disputes,a court must bear in mind the liberal federal policy in favor of arbitration agreements.james mcdonald,cir see.w here the contract contains an arbitration clause,there is a presumption of arbitrability in the sense that a n order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.at t,at.quoting warrior gulf,at.see continental cas.american nat.ins,cir.
when determining whether the parties have agreed to arbitration,a court must be careful not to consider the merits of the underlying claim.at t,at.if the dispute falls within the scope of the parties arbitration agreement,even a seemingly frivolous claim must be submitted to arbitration.see zurich am.ins.watts,cir.however,the arbitrator jurisdiction remains limited by the terms of the cba.am.postal workers union,milwaukee local runyon,cir.thus,under the terms of a of the cba,an arbitrator authority is limited to resolving disputes that involve the interpretation or application of a term of the cba.
the parties have spent much time debating whether the arbitration clause in the cba is broad or narrow.while the utility of such categorization,without context,is dubious at best,the clause does appear to be in line with those that have been considered broad.see at t,at.finding arbitration clause broad where applied to differences arising with respect to the interpretation of this contract or the performance of any obligation hereunder int l union of operating eng rs,local union indiana constr,cir finding arbitration clause broad where applied to any dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the terms of this contract,plus a specific exclusion for jurisdictional disputes certified grocers of illinois,produce,fresh frozen fruits vegetables,fish,butter,eggs,cheese,poultry,florist,nursery,landscape allied employees,drivers,chauffeurs,warehousemen helpers union,chicago and vicinity,illinois,local,cir finding arbitration clause broad where applied to any difference between the employer and the union concerning any interpretation or application of any of the provisions of this agreement.
in order to determine whether the parties have agreed to submit this particular dispute to arbitration,we must turn to the specific language of the arbitration clause.when interpreting a contract,we look first to the plain meaning of the provision,and strive to avoid absurd results.see county of mchenry ins.of the west,cir.on its face,the arbitration clause in this case applies to any dispute that would require the adjudicator to interpret or apply any term or provision of the cba,so long as another provision of the cba does not specifically exclude that topic from arbitration.
the district court based its finding of arbitrability upon,the mutual respect and responsibility clause.the union has also argued that this dispute involves the interpretation and application of the recognition clause,and thus requires the company to submit the dispute to arbitration.we prefer to begin our analysis with the recognition clause.
an arbitrator could interpret the recognition clause,which obligates the company to recognize the union as the employees sole bargaining representative,to require only that the company refrain from dealing with other labor organizations.alternatively,an arbitrator could interpret the recognition clause to prohibit the company from making significant changes in the terms and conditions of employment without the consent of the union.the recognition clause is susceptible to any number of interpretations that may impose duties of notice and negotiation upon the company.the point is that such interpretation is the province of the of this court.so long as the recognition clause is susceptible to an interpretation wherein the company actions have breached its duties,and the recognition clause is encompassed by the arbitration provision,we must compel arbitration.see at t,at.citing warrior gulf,at.
the company has argued that the recognition clause can not support arbitrability,and points to this court opinion in indep.petroleum workers of,american oil,in support.cir,aff mem.by an equally divided court,d.independent petroleum workers involved a labor dispute that arose when a company subcontracted work that was formerly performed by union workers.id.at.the union attempted to support arbitrability with the recognition clause,where the arbitration clause provided for mandatory arbitration of q uestions directly involving or arising from applications,interpretations or alleged violations of the terms of this agreement.id.at.
in response to the union argument in indep.petroleum workers,this court stated this position,if accepted,means that either party by alleging a refusal of the other to bargain with respect to any conceivable issue or controversy would become subject to arbitration.plaintiff position is devoid of logic.id.at.the circumstances of the indep.petroleum workers case,however,were very different than the case at hand.first,the union in that case for many years had sought the inclusion of a clause in the collective bargaining agreement specifically prohibiting or limiting the right at issue.id.at.thus,the issue of subcontracting had already been negotiated during the regular course of bargaining.this court found that point both relevant and significant.id.
second,the cba in indep.petroleum workers contained a rather unique provision which suspended the clause when the company refused to arbitrate a grievance.id.at.arbitration provisions are generally considered reciprocity for provisions.int l of teamsters,chauffeurs,warehousemen and helpers of,local union logistics support group,cir.a recognition clause very well might take on a different meaning in a cba that contains a strict provision,because a refusal of the company to arbitrate would otherwise leave the union without options.if the company can unilaterally change the conditions of employment,refuse to arbitrate,and still prohibit the union from striking,then the purposes of the recognition clause and the union itself are significantly undermined.this makes the case before us readily distinguishable from indep.petroleum workers.
finally,our decision in indep.petroleum workers was not based solely on the merits.we also held that,because the union had already attempted to compel arbitration of the same issue in a previous suit,collateral estoppel precluded relitigation of the issue.at.thus,a determination on the merits was not essential to the disposition of the case.
indep.petroleum workers predates the supreme court opinion in at t,which reaffirmed the strong presumption in favor of arbitration set forth in the steelworkers trilogy,d see united steelworkers of am.american,d united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf navigation,d united steelworkers of am.enterprise wheel car,d.supreme court precedent constrains a broad reading of indep.petroleum workers,which centered around parties with a unique bargaining history and cba.see mobil oil local,oil,chemical atomic workers int l union,cir the court reasoning on the first issue,even if treated as more than dicta to its collateral estoppel holding,is not pertinent to this case.the arbitration clause in the instant dispute does not involve a voluntary arbitration provision humble oil refining indep.indus.workers union,cir.indeed,a number of our sister circuits have found that allegations that a cba recognition clause has been violated can validly support arbitrability.oil,chemical atomic workers int l union phillips,cir diagnostic,local,int l of teamsters,chauffeurs,warehousemen and helpers of,cir local,int l ass of machinists united states potash,cir.
while an equally divided supreme court affirmed indep.petroleum workers without discussion,the supreme court has instructed that summary affirmances have considerably less precedential value than an opinion on the merits,and such value can extend no farther than the precise issues presented and necessarily decided by those actions.illinois state bd.of elections socialist workers party,d see also boggs boggs,d washington confederated bands and tribes of yakima indian nation,d.from the supreme court equally divided summary affirmance in indep.petroleum workers,we can infer no comment on its approval or disapproval of the use of recognition clauses to support arbitrability.
given the significant differences between the cba and bargaining history in this case and that in indep.petroleum workers,we conclude that indep.petroleum workers is not controlling in this case.additionally,the supreme court summary affirmance sheds no light on the viability of the union arguments because the decision may very well have rested upon the collateral estoppel holding.
the union in this case alleges that the company actions constitute a breach of the recognition clause of the cba.up until the proposed implementation of the new performance guidelines,employees were evaluated based upon the tasks they performed.if they performed the tasks that the company told them to at the appropriate times,they received a favorable evaluation and no discipline resulted.the proposed guidelines would require the employees to deliver results.if the employees do not meet their sales quotas,they will be disciplined and possibly discharged.at the time that the current cba was bargained over,the union had no indication that such a change was on the horizon.attempts at bargaining between the company and the union prior to implementation of the guidelines reached impasse,and the union has alleged that this bargaining was not in good faith.without the ability to strike or compel arbitration,the union has no recourse.
we can not say with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation wherein a good faith allegation that the recognition clause of the cba has been violated binds the company to mandatory arbitration.see at t,at.the parties could have exempted the recognition clause from arbitration,but chose not to.the union has alleged that the company did not bargain in good faith prior to implementation of the guidelines and has submitted employee statements alleging that unilateral implementation of the performance guidelines threatens the continued relationship between the parties.given the presumption in favor of arbitrability,the union has met its burden.we hold that the recognition clause is an adequate basis for arbitration in this case,and therefore need not address the union other arguments.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
i respectfully dissent.the presence of an arbitration clause in a contract creates a presumption in favor of arbitration,but this means only that doubts about whether a particular dispute is covered are resolved in favor of coverage arbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf navigation,d at t,commc ns workers of,d int l ass of machinists aerospace workers,progressive lodge,cir.the presumption of arbitrability is overcome when it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.warrior gulf navigation,at.at t,at.

the cba contains no terms or provisions whatsoever relating to performance guidelines or standards,and this dispute concerns the performance guidelines policy itself,not the discipline of a employee pursuant to it.nonetheless,the majority concludes that the dispute is arbitrable because it could involve the interpretation of the recognition clause of the cba.majority op.at.that provision,of the cba,states as follows the company recognizes the union local as the exclusive bargaining agent for those employees of the company in the state of illinois and lake and porter county sic,indiana.
