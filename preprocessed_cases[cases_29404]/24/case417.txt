this appeal arises from the commencement of arbitration proceedings by appellees james aune and other investors collectively the investors against appellant brokerage firm washington square securities,washington square.washington square sought a declaratory judgment in district court halting the arbitration.applying north carolina contract and agency principles,the district court determined that washington square was bound to arbitrate by virtue of its membership in the national association of securities dealers,nasd,and dismissed the action.albeit on different reasoning,we affirm.
appellees invested in ets payphone equipment,and worldwide growth partners.series security ets and evergreen at various times from late through.during that time,richard white,the investment broker for each of these transactions,was acting as an associated person of nasd member washington square.as such,white was employed and authorized by washington square to sell securities on its behalf,but white was free to participate in other business opportunities unrelated to washington square.washington square did not authorize or have knowledge of the ets and evergreen investment transactions.as a result of their investments in ets and evergreen,the investors collectively sustained losses in excess of.
on march,the investors filed an arbitration claim before the nasd,seeking to hold washington square responsible for white sale of allegedly fraudulent ets and evergreen investments,on grounds that washington square acted through white as his employer and otherwise failed to take adequate steps to supervise white.the investors sought damages against washington square based upon north carolina securities laws,breach of contract,common law fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,negligence,and gross negligence.
washington square filed two separate in the western district of north carolina on july,seeking a declaratory judgment that there was no valid agreement to arbitrate between washington square and the investors,and seeking injunctive relief staying the arbitration before the nasd.upon the investors motion to compel arbitration,the court dismissed washington square complaint seeking declaratory judgment and denied washington square motion for preliminary injunction.
in reaching its decision,the court first determined that there was no presumption in favor of arbitration,given that washington square and the investors never entered into an agreement to arbitrate.nonetheless,based on the plain language of rule of the nasd code,white representative agreement with washington square form,and the circumstances surrounding the ets investment transaction,the court concluded that the investors were entitled to arbitrate under north carolina law as beneficiaries of the nasd code.
the district court declined to consider washington square extrinsic evidence bearing upon the meaning of the term customer in the nasd arbitration provision,reasoning that consideration of such evidence was unnecessary because the language of the nasd arbitration code provisions is not ambiguous.moreover,the court reasoned that the extrinsic evidence offered by washington square was not dispositive of the meaning of the language in the nasd code.
as an alternative basis for its decision,the district court determined that north carolina agency principles were sufficient to compel arbitration.without allowing discovery,and based on allegations by the investors as to representations made by white at the time of the ets transactions,the court found ample evidence that white acted with apparent authority from washington square.ii.accordingly,the district court held that the investors were entitled to compel arbitration in their dispute with washington square.
washington square raises several issues on appeal.in particular,it contends that the district court erred by applying rule of the nasd code without looking to additional language in rule,which states the eligibility requirements for arbitrable disputes.washington square also argues that there exists a latent ambiguity in the language of the nasd arbitration rules,and that the district court should have resolved this ambiguity by resort to its extrinsic evidence of the parties intent.finally,washington square challenges the district court denial of discovery on the issue of whether white was acting as an agent of washington square.these are issues of first impression in this circuit,and,as the district court noted,federal courts are divided over arbitrability of disputes between a nasd member and investors who conduct transactions through an associated person of the member.compare john hancock life ins.wilson,cir finding that the nasd code unambiguously requires arbitration in such circumstances,and vestax secs.mcwood,cir same,and california fina group,herrin,cir same,with investors capital brown,d,holding that investors status as customer under the nasd code turns on the factual issue of whether the investors attempted to have an informal business relationship with the member.

ii.the nasd code constitutes an agreement in writing under the federal arbitration act,which binds washington square,as an nasd member,to submit an eligible dispute to arbitration upon a customer demand.see kidder,peabody,zinsmeyer trusts,cir.because this arbitration agreement binds washington square,the remaining issue is whether the investors are customers whose dispute falls within its scope.
