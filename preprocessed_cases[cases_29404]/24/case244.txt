in these consolidated appeals,we are confronted with the issue of whether a foreign arbitration award can be confirmed and enforced against a sovereign nation where the arbitration agreement was signed by an organ of that nation central government and where that not the nation in the underlying arbitration proceedings.specifically,compagnie noga et noga sought to confirm and enforce a swedish arbitration award against russian federation.the russian federation opposed confirmation principally on the ground that it was a party to neither the arbitration agreement nor the swedish arbitration proceedings.instead,it argued that the proper party to these proceedings should be the government of russia the government,a political organ of the russian central government.the united states district court for the southern district of new york pauley,accepted the russian federation argument and denied noga motion to confirm.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that,for the purposes of these proceedings,the russian federation and the government are the same party,and accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court.furthermore,we remand for further proceedings with respect to,among other things,i whether noga assignments of its arbitration proceeds to certain of its creditors deprived it of standing to seek confirmation of the arbitral award and ii whether the creditors to whom noga assigned the arbitration proceeds must be joined as necessary and indispensable parties under.
background 
loans that were the subject of the underlying arbitration 
in december,noga entered into supply contracts to provide million worth of food and consumer goods to foreign trade agencies of both the union of soviet socialist republics ussr,the predecessor to the russian federation,and the federative socialist soviet republic of russia rsfsr,a constituent republic of the ussr.when anticipated financing for these supply contracts did not materialize,noga agreed to finance them in part.
in april,noga entered into a million loan agreement loan agreement with the government of the rsfsr,which was represented by its council of ministers and defined in the agreement as the borrower.the stated purpose of the loan agreement was to finance noga existing supply contracts with the agencies and enterprises of the rsfsr.as consideration for the loan agreement,the borrower agreed to cause the oil company to deliver crude oil products to noga pursuant to a schedule extending into september.moreover,the borrower represented that it had obtained all the required licenses,approvals and consents from the appropriate authorities of the to provide this consideration.as contemplated in the loan agreement,noga and the rsfsr state oil company entered into a separate agreement for the delivery of crude oil products.in anticipation of receiving the crude oil products on schedule,noga advanced cash and credit to finance rsfsr imports of food and consumer goods and the development of a baby food factory and a television station in the rsfsr 
in january,noga and the government of the russian federation entered into a million loan agreement loan agreement,which defined the term borrower as the government of the russian federation,acting for and on its own behalf and responsibility sic.the loan agreement provided that half of the million loan would be used to finance supply contracts executed between noga and another agency of the russian federation for the import of products and that the other half would be used to discharge state debt to foreign suppliers for deliveries of similar products to the rsfsr during the period.the promised consideration for the loan agreement was the delivery of crude oil from an agency of the russian federation under a separate contract with that agency and pursuant to a delivery schedule extending through the end of.in anticipation of these deliveries and pursuant to the loan agreement,noga financed imports of products into the russian federation 
both the loan agreement and the loan agreement provided for i binding arbitration of any disputes between the parties and their successors in the chamber of commerce of stockholm,sweden ii the choice of swiss law to resolve those disputes iii the waiver of immunity with respect to the enforcement of any arbitration award and iv consent to suit in the state and federal courts of,inter alia,new york.
ii.swedish arbitration proceedings 
disputes eventually arose between noga and the government regarding performance of the loan agreements.in december,noga declared the government to be in default,claiming that it owed noga million in principal and interest.in april,noga terminated the agreements and accelerated payment on the loans.in june,noga filed a request for arbitration with the stockholm chamber of commerce,seeking over million for unpaid balances,plus consequential damages.noga arbitration request identified the russian federation as the respondent and explained that its decision to do so was based on the facts that i b oth the buying and the selling agencies were the russian federation,under the russian federation control ii a ll contracts between noga and the agencies made express reference to the contracts entered into by noga and the russian federation,since such contracts represent ed the performance of the loan agreements and iii t he russian federation guaranteed performance by the selling agencies for repayment of the loans.
the russian federation made no response to the arbitration request.instead,attorneys representing the government objected to noga naming the russian federation as the respondent and requested that the arbitrators require noga to amend its arbitration request to name the government and the state agencies that had signed the contracts as the proper respondents.in response,noga argued that the arbitrators should overrule the government objection on the ground that the russian federation and the government were the same legal person and thus the government acts were directly attributable to the russian federation.the arbitrators never ruled on the government objection,and noga never sought judicial intervention to compel the russian federation to participate in the arbitration.
eight years of arbitration proceedings followed.the arbitration was conducted in two phases.phase i related to liability and damages,except for consequential damages phase ii related to consequential damages.throughout the arbitration proceedings,the not the russian and arbitrated with noga.
at the conclusion of phase i,the arbitrators issued two awards,both of which are the subject of this appeal.in the first award,dated february,the tribunal determined that noga had been justified in both declaring a default and in accelerating the remaining oil deliveries.the arbitrators awarded noga approximately million in damages,plus accrued interest from april until the date of payment.on may,the tribunal issued a supplemental award,which increased the amount of the earlier award by approximately million for management fees that noga had alleged were omitted from the first award.together,the two awards collectively,the phase i award totaled approximately million,including interest through may.the caption of the arbitration awards refers to the respondent as the government of the russian federation russia throughout the awards,however,the arbitrators refer interchangeably to the government of the russian federation,the russian federation,and russia.
the government appealed the supplemental award to the district court of stockholm,which dismissed the appeal and awarded attorneys fees and costs to noga.the caption contained in the swedish court decision identified the russian federation,the ministry of finance as the plaintiff.the court decision repeatedly refers to the plaintiff as the russian federation,although the issue of which entity was the proper party was not before it,and it was not being asked to confirm the phase i award.the stockholm district court decision was affirmed by the svea court of appeal,which also referred to the russian federation in both the caption and text of its decision and awarded noga additional attorneys fees and costs neither the russian federation nor the government has paid the phase i award.
on march,while the actions giving rise to this appeal were pending,the arbitrators issued an award finding that noga was entitled to approximately million in consequential damages,plus interest that had accrued during the eight years since the arbitration request had been filed.as of the date the briefs in this appeal were filed,an appeal of the phase ii award was still pending in the swedish courts,and noga had not yet sought to confirm or enforce this award.
iii.noga financial problems and assignments of its arbitration claims to its creditor banks 
a.the assignments 
in and,noga assigned portions of the expected proceeds from both the phase i and phase ii arbitration awards to four swiss banks the assignee banks,which had financed noga performance of the and loan agreements.three of these assignments which were originally written in french and subsequently translated into english stated that they served as guarantees of noga debts to the respective banks.the first assignment,to banque nationale de paris suisse,assigned million swiss francs for every million noga received in the arbitration,not to exceed million swiss francs.the second assignment,to credit lyonnais suisse,assigned million for the first million received in the arbitration,and million for each collection exceeding million,with the caveat that,if the arbitration proceeds were less than million,the payment would be effected pro rata to the sum received.the third assignment,to united overseas bank,assigned the lesser of fifteen percent of the arbitration proceeds or million.the fourth assignment,to caisse de geneve ceg,assigned million for every million noga received in the arbitration,not to exceed million.ceg,in turn,reassign ed to noga in a fiduciary capacity and for collection purposes ceg portion of the arbitration proceeds.
b.the concordat 
in june,one month after the arbitrators issued the phase i award,noga obtained from the court of justice of the republic and state of geneva a stay of any attempt to place noga into bankruptcy,so that noga could propose a composition plan similar to an american chapter reorganization plan to its creditors.the swiss court subsequently approved noga plan,referred to as a concordat.under the terms of the concordat,noga was permitted to discharge its debts incurred prior to june other than debts owed to certain preferred creditors,including the assignee banks by paying a dividend equal to about twelve percent of the accepted value of its creditors claims 
in the concordat,the assignee banks agreed to receive their portions of noga collection of its arbitration claims subject to certain conditions.first,noga would pursue,in its own name,both for itself and for the assignee banks,all steps necessary to obtain i payment of the phase i award ii acknowledgment by the russian federation of the remaining balance owed to noga and iii payment of that balance through arbitral proceedings,judicial proceedings,enforcement proceedings,or amicable negotiations.second,noga agreed to keep the assignee banks informed regarding its attempts to obtain these payments and the results of those attempts,and to consider the assignee banks advice,recommendations,and suggestions.finally,the assignee banks reserved the right to enforce directly against the russian federation their assigned portions of noga claim,following notice to noga.to date,none of the assignee banks has exercised this right.
the concordat also established the following priority for application of any payment of noga arbitration claims i full payment of the arbitration costs collection of those costs as defined in a swiss court judgment ii payments to the assignee banks according to the terms of their assignment agreements iii a refund to one jean rouch of funds advanced to noga for payment of its expenses during the moratorium and his payments to creditors in the first and second classes,if any,and to creditors in the third class and iv the balance to noga.
iv.proceedings in the district court 
on january,noga filed an action against the russian federation in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky the kentucky action,seeking confirmation and enforcement of the phase i award and domestication of the swedish court judgments under kentucky law the next day,a similar action the new york action was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the district court.in june,the russian federation moved to dismiss the new york action on the ground of improper service.in september,the kentucky action was transferred to the district court,where it was subsequently consolidated with the new york action.during the last week of september,the russian federation withdrew its motion to dismiss for improper service,and noga filed a consolidated complaint in the district court for the two actions,seeking confirmation and enforcement of the phase i award and recognition and enforcement of the swedish court judgments.
in october,the russian federation filed its answer,asserting four affirmative defenses i that the complaint failed to state a cause of action ii that the russian federation was not a proper party to the action because it was not a party to the swedish arbitration iii that noga lacked standing to pursue some or all of the claims by virtue of the assignments of its arbitration claims to the assignee banks iv that noga was not the real party in interest by virtue of the prior assignments and v that noga failed to join the assignee banks,which were necessary parties.
in august,noga moved to confirm and enforce the phase i award and to recognize and enforce the swedish court judgments.the russian federation opposed the motion on the same grounds as those raised in the affirmative defenses contained in its answer.in a,unpublished memorandum decision and order dated september,the district court denied noga motion,finding that the russian federation was a separate entity from the government and that the russian federation had not been a party to the arbitration and did not intend to arbitrate the submitted dispute.the district court further found that,because the russian federation had objected to being named in the arbitration,the tribunal phase i award had been issued only against the government.according to the district court,a could not be bound by an arbitration award unless it clearly and unambiguously demonstrate d an intent to arbitrate the submitted dispute.
although it did not need to reach the issue,the district court also interpreted the concordat and the assignments as suggest ing that the assignee banks were real parties in interest to this action and that the russian federation could be subject to multiple litigations and judgments,implying that these entities were necessary parties whose joinder was required by.a final judgment was entered in the new york action on september,and in the kentucky action on september.noga timely appealed from both judgments,and we subsequently consolidated the appeals.
discussion 
can the phase i award be confirmed against the russian.framework for confirming international arbitration awards 
because noga is seeking to enforce an arbitration award rendered in a foreign state,the confirmation of the phase i award is governed by the framework set forth in the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,june,convention,as implemented by,and reprinted in,the federal arbitration act faa.under the convention,a district court role in reviewing a foreign arbitral award is strictly limited and the showing required to avoid summary confirmance is high.yusuf ahmed alghanim sons,toys r us,cir internal quotation marks omitted.specifically,the faa provides that,upon the application of a party to an arbitration award made pursuant to the convention,a district court shall enter an order confirming the award as against any other party to the arbitration,unless the court finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the convention.as the party opposing confirmation,the russian federation bore the burden of establishing that the phase i award should not have been honored.see ministry of def.of the islamic republic of iran gould,cir citing la societe nationale pour la recherche shaheen natural res,aff,cir per curiam.this burden is imposed because the public policy in favor of international arbitration is strong.fotochrome,copal,cir.
the district court declined to confirm the phase i award on the grounds that i the russian federation was not a party to the swedish arbitration proceedings and ii this case did not fall under one of the limited exceptions in which we have held that an arbitration award can be enforced against a nonparty.see monegasque de reassurances monde re nak naftogaz of,cir listing five theories for binding nonsignatories to arbitration agreements incorporation by reference,assumption,agency,ego,and estoppel see also bridas gov t of turkmenistan,cir.consequently,the district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to confirm the award against the russian federation.for the reasons that follow,we disagree with the district court conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction to confirm the phase i award against the russian federation.
choice of law 
on appeal,noga principally challenges the district court legal conclusion that the russian federation and the government are not the same entities for the purpose of confirming the phase i award,and urges that we apply principles of federal common law or public international law to reach this conclusion.the russian federation counters that i this case should be decided under principles of private international law,which dictate that russian law be applied in determining whether the russian federation and the government are the same entities and ii under russian law,the russian federation and the government are separate entities 
in making their respective arguments,both parties rely on the supreme court decision in first national city bank banco para el comercio exterior de cuba,d bancec.there,the republic of cuba established a trade bank with full juridical capacity of its own.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.this trade bank sued to collect on a letter of credit issued by an american bank.the american bank counterclaimed,asserting a right to set off the value of its assets in cuba that had been nationalized by the cuban government.id.at.the cuban trade bank claimed immunity from this counterclaim under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,et.
the supreme court concluded that the fsia did not control the determination of whether the seized cuban assets could be set off against the claim of the cuban trade bank.instead,the court held that principles of public international law and federal common than cuban domestic be applied to determine the effect to be given to the cuban trade bank separate juridical status.id.at.according to the court,t o give conclusive effect to the law of the chartering state in determining whether the separate juridical status of its instrumentality should be respected would permit the state to violate with impunity the rights of third parties under international law while effectively insulating itself from liability in foreign courts.id.at.on the other hand,the court cautioned that f reely ignoring the separate status of government instrumentalities would result in substantial uncertainty over whether an instrumentality assets would be diverted to satisfy a claim against the sovereign,and might thereby cause third parties to hesitate before extending credit to a government instrumentality without the government guarantee.id.at.consequently,the efforts of sovereign nations to structure their governmental activities in a manner deemed necessary to promote economic development and efficient administration would surely be frustrated.id.thus,d ue respect for the actions taken by foreign sovereigns and for principles of comity between nations led the court to conclude that government instrumentalities established as juridical entities distinct and independent from their sovereign should normally be treated as such.id.at.
as the principal issue in this appeal is whether the government is an instrumentality established as a juridical entity distinct and independent from the russian federation,the bancec decision is of little help to us here.in any event,because we conclude that the answer to this question is the same regardless which of the bodies of law advocated by the parties is applied here,we need not cut the gordian knot presented to us by the parties,blake comm r,cir declining to decide whether to apply federal common law or state law where the result would be the same under either analysis.
russian law 
we turn first to the constitution of the russian federation in determining whether the government and the russian federation should be treated as separate parties for the purposes of this confirmation proceeding.that charter provides a detailed discussion of the relationship between these two entities.the russian constitution provides for a bicameral federal executive consisting of the president of the russian federation,who is described as being the head of s tate,konst.rf,and the government,which shall exercise e xecutive power in the russian federation,id.the government consists of the chairman of the government who is appointed by the president,subject to consent of the state duma,the federal legislature,and the deputy chairman of the government and the federal ministers who are appointed by the president in consultation with the chairman of the government.id.a,e.
the russian constitution also enumerates the responsibilities of the government,which include,among other things i submitting a federal budget to the state duma ii ensur ing the implementation of a uniform financial,credit,and monetary policy and iii exercis ing any other powers vested in the government by the constitution of the russian federation,russian federal laws,and decrees of the president of the russian federation.id.a,b,g.to carry out these responsibilities,the government is empowered to issue decrees and orders,which shall be binding throughout the russian federation.id.finally,the members of the government serve at the pleasure of the president they must resign upon the election of a new president,id.they may resign only with the consent of the president,id.art and the president also can require them to resign at any time,id.
plainly,in light of the description of the government in the russian charter,that entity is not a sovereign,corporation,or instrumentality separate from the russian federation.rather,the government is a political organ of the russian federation,analogous to the cabinet of the american president.most significantly,in the words of one scholar,the government is not a juridical person and enjoys no autonomous legal capacity.william butler,russian law ed.indeed,given the supreme court bancec decision,had either the government or the russian federation wanted to shield the latter entity from being the subject of these confirmation proceedings,either could have designated a state corporation or instrumentality as the entity to contract with noga.at bottom,the government was performing a quintessential governmental function financing the purchase of massive quantities of basic necessities and infrastructure improvements to provide for the russian people and paying for those necessities and improvements with the country natural resources.
finally,the russian federation has not satisfied its burden of proving that the government is a separate juridical entity that can sue and be sued in russian courts for obligations that are analogous to the ones set forth in the loan agreements or,indeed,for any legal obligations.for example,the russian federation could have presented docket entries or court filings from russian courts indicating that the government had sued or been sued in this capacity.no such evidence was presented to the district court,however.accordingly,we find that,under russian law,the government and the russian federation should be treated as the same party for the purpose of this confirmation proceeding.
federal common law 
the question of whether a federal court will confirm a foreign arbitration award against a sovereign nation,where one of the sovereign political organs was a party to the arbitration,appears to be one of first impression.federal courts have been asked to confirm such awards against a corporation owned or operated by a foreign sovereign under such theories as alter ego,piercing the corporate veil,or agency.see,monde re,see generally carolyn lamm jocelyn aqua,defining the is a proper party in an international arbitration before the american arbitration association and other international institutions,geo.int l econ.discussing when courts will deem a foreign state to have consented to arbitration based on the acts of an instrumentality or entity.the fifth circuit recent decision in bridas government of turkmenistan,is illustrative.
there,an argentinian corporation bridas entered into a joint venture agreement with a production association formed and owned by the government of turkmenistan,which was not itself a party to the agreement.bridas subsequently initiated an arbitration proceeding against both the production association and the government of turkmenistan,alleging breach of the agreement.id.at.the arbitrators expressly rejected the argument of the government of turkmenistan that it was not a proper party to the arbitration because it had not signed the agreement.id.at.the arbitrators subsequently issued an award in favor of bridas,which successfully brought an action in the southern district of texas to confirm the award.on appeal,the fifth circuit declined to confirm the arbitration award against the government of turkmenistan under theories of agency,estoppel,and third party beneficiary.id.at.nevertheless,the court remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings with respect to whether the production association was the alter ego of the government of turkmenistan,instructing the district court to consider,inter alia,the factors used by the fifth circuit in determining whether a state agency is the alter ego of a state for eleventh amendment sovereign immunity purposes.id.at.
likewise,this court has been asked to confirm domestic arbitration awards under similar theories against nonparties to an arbitration proceeding or agreement it is this latter line of cases that both the district court and the russian federation cite in support of their conclusions that the phase i award should not be enforceable against the russian federation.but,as we noted above,analogizing the relationship between the russian federation and the government to the relationship between a corporate parent and a subsidiary belies the reality of the political relationship between the russian federation and the government and is thus inapposite.analogies,as cardozo warned of metaphors,in law are to be narrowly watched,for starting as devices to liberate thought,they end often by enslaving it.berkey third ry.
while the issue of the nature of the relationship between a foreign sovereign and one of its political organs has not been presented in the context of the enforcement and confirmation of an arbitration award,this issue has come up in other contexts,and in each of those contexts the fact of an internal separation of some sort between the sovereign and one or more of its organs has been found to be of no legal significance.the most developed area of federal common law concerning this issue relates to whether,in the context of the fsia,a ministry or other political subdivision of a foreign sovereign should be treated either as the foreign state itself or a political subdivision of it in which case it would be immune from suit,or as an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state in which case it would be subject to suit under a.for example,in machinery americana,cir,we found that the istituto per la ricostruzione industriale,a public financial entity which coordinate d the management of the commercial enterprises of the italian government,was a political subdivision of italy because it was a governmental unit beneath the central italian government.
ten years later,in transaero,la fuerza aerea boliviana,the district of columbia circuit held that the bolivian air force was a foreign state rather than an agency or instrumentality of bolivia because the air force core functions were predominantly governmental.according to the court,the armed forces are as a rule so closely bound up with the structure of the state that they must in all cases be considered as the foreign state itself,rather than a separate agency or instrumentality of the state.id.at.indeed,a ny government of reasonable complexity must act through men organized into offices and departments.id consequently,n umerous other courts have assumed without discussion that governmental departments or ministries including ministries of the russian federation and the former soviet union qualify as political subdivisions of a foreign state under the fsia.garb republic of poland,d,vacated and remanded on other grounds,fed.appx.cir moreover,a similar conclusion was apparently reached by the supreme court in bancec,when in the course of reinstating the district court opinion,the court quoted that opinion statement that t he cuban ministry of foreign trade is no different than the government of cuba of which its minister is a member.at.quoting banco nacional de cuba chase manhattan bank.
notably,as the district court in garb recognized,the united states adopted an analogous position in an amicus brief submitted in transaero.there,the united states took the view that if a judgment would essentially be one against the state and an entity assets are not separate from those of the state,then the entity is not a legal person separate from the state even if,in a formalistic sense,that entity can enter into contracts in its own name,and sue or be sued in its own name.see brief of amicus curiae united states at,transaero,quoted in garb,d at.the legal standard articulated in the transaero amicus brief is the same standard that has been adopted by the supreme court in determining whether an agency or instrumentality of a state is entitled to eleventh amendment immunity.see hess port auth,d.indeed,it is black letter eleventh amendment law that the political agencies and departments of states are entitled to the same sovereign immunity as the state.see,pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d jones state div.of military naval affairs,cir.significantly,in the case at bar,it is clear from both the record and statements made by counsel for the russian federation during oral argument before this court that the government owns no assets that could be attached to satisfy a judgment confirming the phase i award and,moreover,that all such assets are owned by the russian federation.
finally,we note that an issue similar to the one before us has arisen in the federal common law of bankruptcy and set off.specifically,when monies are owed to an individual by one federal agency and that individual owes a debt to another federal agency,the two federal agencies may set off the debts owned by one of them against the claims of the other.in other words,the agencies are treated as constituent parts of a unitary entity.see,a citizens bank of strumpf,d turner small bus.admin.in re turner,cir en banc.
in sum,under the federal principles articulated above,no meaningful legal distinction can be drawn between a sovereign and one of its political organs.accordingly,the russian federation has failed to overcome the presumption in favor of confirming the phase i award,and it has failed to demonstrate that the government should be treated as a separate party from the russian federation in this context under federal common law.
international law 
the distinction made by the district court between the acts of a sovereign and the acts of one of its governmental organs also finds no basis in international law.an axiomatic principle of international law is that t he conduct of any state organ shall be considered an act of that state under international law,whether the organ exercises legislative,executive,judicial or any other functions,whatever position it holds in the organization of the state,and whatever its character as an organ of the central government or of a territorial unit of the state.draft articles on responsibilities of states for internationally wrongful acts draft articles,reprinted in report of the international law commission on the work of its session,gaor,supp,at,doc.ilc report,available at http as the commentary to this provision of the draft articles explains,t he replies by governments to the preparatory committee for the conference for the codification of international law were unanimously of the view that the actions or omissions of organs of the state must be attributed to it.id.cmt.footnote omitted,reprinted in ilc report at.the third committee of the conference adopted unanimously on first reading an article,which provided that international responsibility shall be incurred by a state as a consequence of any failure on the part of its organs to carry out the international obligations of the state.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the maxim that the acts of an organ of a sovereign government are attributable to the sovereign have also been regularly applied in international courts and arbitrations.see lamm aqua,supra,at.for example,in texaco overseas petroleum government of the libyan arab republic,the arbitrator rejected the libyan government objections to the tribunal jurisdiction to arbitrate claims arising out of libya nationalization of its oil industry.one of those objections was that the contracts in question had been entered into by the libyan minister of petroleum and thus libya,a sovereign state,was not a party to these contracts.id.at.citing to the draft of the as yet unfinished draft articles,the arbitrator overruled this objection,concluding that it was incontestable and uncontested that,if the ministry of petroleum or any other qualified organ of the libyan government ha d entered into deeds of concession,such organ acted as the organ duly qualified and authorized to do so by the libyan government.id.at.thus,it was the libyan arab republic and that state ha d become bound by the acts performed by its own organs.id 
in sum,we hold that regardless of whether principles of russian law,federal common law,or international law are applied,the russian federation and the government are not separate parties for the purposes of confirming and enforcing an arbitral award under the convention.accordingly,the judgment of the district court denying noga motion to confirm is vacated.
ii.what effect does noga assignments of its arbitration claims to its creditors have on these proceedings 
as noted above,the russian federation also sought dismissal of noga complaint on the grounds that noga was not the real party in interest by virtue of noga prior assignments to the assignee banks and its subsequent failure to join them as parties in either the new york or kentucky actions.because the district court dismissed noga complaint on the ground that the phase i award could not be enforced against the russian federation,the court did not reach these alternative bases for dismissal.however,judge pauley opined in a footnote that the condordat,together with the claim assignments themselves,suggests that the assignee banks are real parties in interest to this action and that the russian federation could be subject to multiple litigations and judgments.judge pauley further opined in this same footnote that the assignee banks absence from this action appeared to compromise their ability to protect their interests in the award.
on appeal,noga invites us to exercise our power to consider these issues sua sponte to preempt possible error on remand.given the complexities of the legal issues presented and the lack of a sufficiently developed factual record to decide them,we decline to accept this invitation and remand the case to the able district court for further development of the record and specific resolution of these remaining issues,as well as the other defenses raised by the russian federation in its answer.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i concur in the result reached in the majority opinion and subscribe to the discussion in parts,and part ii.i write separately on the choice of law issue and certain aspects of federal common law to explain by what route i arrive at the same place as the majority.
compagnie noga et noga appeals from the district court refusal to confirm a swedish arbitration award against the russian federation the federation pursuant to the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,june,the convention.congress adopted the convention in and implemented it through amendment to the federal arbitration act faa.see.as the supreme court noted soon after implementation 
the goal of the convention,and the principal purpose underlying american adoption and implementation of it,was to encourage the recognition and enforcement of commercial arbitration agreements in international contracts and to unify the standards by which agreements to arbitrate are observed and arbitral awards are enforced in the signatory countries.
scherk,d.section of the faa says who may confirm against whom 
within three years after an arbitral award falling under the convention is made,any party to the arbitration may apply to any court having jurisdiction under this chapter for an order confirming the award as against any other party to the arbitration.the court shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said convention.
emphasis added.the dispositive question on this appeal is thus whether the federation was a party to the arbitration proceedings that resulted in the award noga seeks to confirm.the federation says that it was the government of the russian federation the government,and not the federation itself,that participated in the swedish arbitration proceedings.noga counters that there is no legal or factual difference between the federation and the government,and that both entities are fully liable on noga arbitration award.
as the majority opinion explains,the first thing is to determine which body of substantive law should be applied to resolve the status of the federation the government.see op.at.the parties offer three sources of law private international law which the federation maintains mandates application of russian law,federal common law,and public international law.the majority opinion deems it unnecessary to cut this gordian knot because all three sources of law yield the same result.on that basis,that the choices of law present a false conflict,the majority opinion decides that the federation and the government are not separate juridical entities for the purposes of a confirmation proceeding under.id.at.
i think that the law is sufficiently clear that there is no reason to sidestep the choice of law question disputed by the parties.the supreme court interpretation of the faa requires the application of federal common law to determine who is a proper party to a confirmation proceeding brought pursuant to.this result is consistent with the precedent of this court,see victrix steamship,salen dry cargo,cir,and the federal interests advanced by the faa.
section of the faa requires that an agreement to arbitrate shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.this congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements create s a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability,applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the act.moses cone mem.hosp.mercury constr,d emphasis added.a t least since this nation accession in to the convention,and the implementation of the convention in the same year by amendment of the federal arbitration act,the federal policy in favor of arbitration applies with special force in the field of international commerce.mitsubishi motors soler,d citation omitted.
the loan agreements between noga and the contain the parties agreement to subject to the convention,and thus come within the coverage of the faa,as does noga claim to confirm the swedish arbitration awards at issue cause of action created by.the question whether the federation is a proper party to a action is thus properly decided under federal common law.
this result is consistent with the supreme court interpretation of the faa and serves the important federal policy favoring international arbitration agreements.resort to federal common law is disfavored in most contexts,but it is favored where the application of foreign law as the federation advocates conflicts with an important federal policy.see atherton fdic,d.when it comes to the enforcement of an arbitral award pursuant to,concerns of international comity,respect for the capacities of foreign and transnational tribunals,and sensitivity to the need of the international commercial system for predictability in the resolution of disputes come into play,mitsubishi motors,at,and militate in favor of using federal common law to ascertain whether the requirements of the statute have been met.the majority opinion commits no error,and i think that the choices of law advanced by the parties present a false conflict,but i think it is a more natural development of the analysis to identify the proper source of law and apply it.doing so provides guidance to parties considering where they may seek to enforce an arbitration agreement or to confirm an award under the convention.many bodies of law are potentially implicated in complex,international commercial agreements in this case,the candidates are swiss law,russian law,the federal law of the united states,and international law.parties seeking to enforce a commitment to arbitrate or an arbitration award should know that if they choose the relief afforded by congress under the faa,the viability of their cause of action will be adjudicated under federal law.
the majority opinion considers several bodies of federal common the foreign sovereign immunities act,the eleventh amendment,and the bankruptcy conclude that the russian government is not a juridical entity separate from the russian federation in the context of a confirmation proceeding.op.at.among other things,the majority observes that it is black letter eleventh amendment law that the political agencies and departments of states are entitled to the same sovereign immunity as the state.id.at.i respectfully submit that this characterization overstates the reach of the eleventh amendment and allocates insufficient weight to the presumption that government instrumentalities established as juridical entities distinct and independent from their sovereign should normally be treated as such.first national city bank banco para el comercio exterior de cuba,d bancec see generally,id.at.
the court in bancec recognized that separate juridical status ought to be respected in most cases,but nonetheless allowed citibank to take an offset for assets expropriated by cuba against the proceeds of a letter of credit presented to citibank by a bank created and operated by the cuban government.id.at.the court applied principles of federal common law and international than cuban resolve the issue of the bank status the cuban government,because to give conclusive effect to cuban law in determining whether the separate juridical status of its bank should be respected would permit the state to violate with impunity the rights of third parties under international law while effectively insulating itself from liability in foreign courts.id.at.in this case,therefore,even though the federation may be interpos ing its separate juridical status id.at.to defeat a legitimate claim for arbitral confirmation,bancec requires that we start with a robust presumption that the government and the federation are separate juridical entities.
i agree with the majority opinion that the russian government would share in any hypothetical eleventh amendment immunity the russian federation would enjoy under federal law,but i do not think the government immunity is a forgone conclusion.t he supreme court has consistently refused to construe the eleventh amendment to afford protection to political subdivisions even though such entities exercise a slice of state power.lake tahoe country estates,tahoe regional planning agency,d.it is only when a entity functions as a arm of the state that it takes on the state eleventh amendment immunity.thus,if the russian government would share in the federation hypothetical immunity under the eleventh amendment,the federation is a proper party to noga confirmation proceeding.
this court revamped its application of the doctrine in mancuso new york state thruway authority,cir.in the first of two steps,we examine the six factors derived from lake tahoe 
how the entity is referred to in the documents that created it how the governing members of the entity are appointed how the entity is funded whether the entity function is traditionally one of local or state government whether the state has a veto power over the entity actions and whether the entity obligations are binding upon the state.
mancuso,at.if these factors point in different directions,we ask a will allowing the entity to be sued in federal court threaten the integrity of the state and b does it expose the state treasury to risk accord hess port auth,d.
applying the lake tahoe factors to this case,it is clear enough that the russian government is an arm of the russian federation.
creating documents.the government is given life through the constitution of the russian federation.under article,state power in the russian federation is exercised on the basis of the separation of the legislative,executive and judiciary branches,konst.rf it is exercised by the president of the russian federation,the federal assembly council of the federation and state duma,the government of the russian federation and courts of the russian federation.id.emphasis added.the government role as an executor of state power is reiterated in article t he president of the russian federation and the government of the russian federation shall,under the constitution of the russian federation,exercise the authority of federal state power throughout the territory of the russian federation.id.emphasis added.
chapter of the russian constitution deals specifically with the government and its objects.under article 
executive power in the russian federation shall be exercised by the government of the russian federation.
the government of the russian federation shall consist of the chairman of the government of the russian federation,deputy chairmen of the government and federal ministers.
id.at.taken together,the constitutional description of the government as a repository and designated executor of state power weighs in favor of immunity.
appointment of governing members.the president of the federation himself an executor of state power appoints the chairman of the government with the consent of the state duma.id.a.the president also has the right to preside over meetings of the government and can decide on resignation of the government.id.b,c.moreover,the president has plenary power to appoint and dismiss deputy chairmen of the government and federal ministers as proposed by the chairman of the government id.e.these provisions suggest that the members of the government serve entirely at the pleasure of the president,who is a separate and by implication,hierarchically superior executor of state power.these circumstances militate in favor of immunity.compare lake tahoe,at.finding no immunity and noting that six of ten governing members of the tahoe regional planning agency trpa are appointed by counties and cities only four are appointed by nevada and california mancuso,at this factor favors a finding of immunity all three board members are appointed by the governor of new york with the advice and consent of the state senate.
funding the record on this factor is not voluminous.still,the federation own expert adduces facts th
