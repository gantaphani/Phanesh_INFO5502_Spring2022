this case involves an attorney fees dispute.in alternative systems,carey th,d alternative systems,the court held the mandatory fee arbitration act mfaa bus,et,which for public policy reasons entitles clients to nonbinding arbitration and trial de novo,supersedes a retainer agreement binding arbitration clause when the client opts for the mfaa procedure.under the mfaa,a client may commit to binding arbitration only after a fee dispute arises.alternative systems,supra,at,d.
the issue here is whether alternative systems remains good law in light of the supreme court opinion in aguilar lerner cal th,d,aguilar.in a concurring opinion in aguilar,justice chin submitted that the majority opinion effectively overruled alternative systems.aguilar,supra,at,d,con.opn.of chin.justice chin concluded the mfaa complements,rather than supersedes the california arbitration act caa,and after nonbinding arbitration under the mfaa there is no right to trial de novo if the parties had a preexisting agreement for binding arbitration.in that instance,a second arbitration resolves the matter.id.at,d.
we respectfully disagree with justice chin analysis and conclude aguilar did not impliedly overrule alternative systems,and it was correctly decided.we affirm the order denying the motion of defendant allen matkins leck gamble mallory allen matkins to compel binding arbitration following nonbinding arbitration under the mfaa and plaintiff richard schatz,request for trial de novo.
factual and procedural background 
in a february agreement schatz retained allen matkins to represent him in a dispute with a and palmaz concerning the assignment of income from a partnership.the agreement stated it would also pertain to any additional matters we handle on your behalf or at your direction.the agreement contained an arbitration section,which provided if you do not agree to arbitrate disputes with us,simply line out this section.arbitration is not a precondition to us representing you.by signing this letter without deleting this section,you agree that,in the event of any dispute arising out of or relating to this agreement,our relationship,or the services performed including but not limited to disputes regarding attorneys fees or costs,such dispute shall be resolved by submission to binding arbitration in san diego county,california,before a retired judge or justice schatz signed the agreement without lining out the arbitration section.
in february,without entering into another agreement,schatz retained allen matkins to represent him in an easement dispute with a different party or parties affecting the rear access road to his rancho santa fe home.schatz paid allen matkins in fees and costs incurred in the matter,but approximately two months before trial he stopped making payments.allen matkins proceeded to trial despite nonpayment,and in an april letter to schatz,it demanded in outstanding fees and costs so arbitration will not be necessary.
schatz did not respond,and allen matkins apparently did nothing for some time.in a january letter to him,allen matkins invoked the arbitration clause of the agreement in the palmaz matter.in a written response,schatz asserted his fee dispute concerned undisclosed conflicts of interest in the easement matter.schatz claimed the agreement arbitration provision was inapplicable because it did not refer to the easement litigation and its reference to additional matters was not highlighted or otherwise emphasized.alternatively,schatz claimed the arbitration provision was illegal under alternative systems,supra,th,d.schatz advised he wished to exercise his statutory rights to nonbinding fee arbitration,and,if he so elects,trial de novo before a jury.
allen matkins advised schatz it believed the arbitration provision was applicable,but it agreed to nonbinding arbitration under the mfaa through the san diego county bar association bar association.allen matkins provided schatz with an application for the arbitration along with rules and instructions on the procedure.allen matkins requested that schatz notify it within days if he elected nonbinding arbitration.
at schatz insistence,allen matkins then provided him with a statutory notice of client right to arbitration.the notice provides a client has days from the date of its receipt to apply for arbitration.
the matter was arbitrated in april through the bar association,and the following month the arbitrators ruled in favor of allen matkins.schatz then filed a complaint seeking a trial de novo,declaratory relief and refund of attorney fees.in response,allen matkins petitioned to compel binding arbitration under the preexisting agreement.in his opposition,schatz argued alternative systems invalidates the binding arbitration provision,and in reply,allen matkins argued that in aguilar the supreme court impliedly abrogated the holding in alternative systems,and binding contractual arbitration would satisfy the mfaa de novo trial requirement.the court agreed with schatz and denied the petition to compel arbitration.
discussion 
ioverview of arbitration proceedings 
in standard arbitration under the caa,both parties must agree to arbitrate.benasra marciano th,d.the caa represents a comprehensive statutory scheme regulating private arbitration in this state.citation.through this detailed statutory scheme,the legislature has expressed a strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution.citation.the statutes set forth procedures for the enforcement of agreements to arbitrate citations,establish rules for the conduct of arbitration proceedings except as the parties otherwise agree citations,describe the circumstances in which arbitrators awards may be judicially vacated,corrected,confirmed,and enforced citations,and specify where,when,and how court proceedings relating to arbitration matters shall occur citations.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.
in contrast to the caa,which is governed by the code of civil procedure,the mfaa has its own rules and limitations,as set forth in the business and professions code.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.under the mfaa,the board of governors of the california state bar is required to adopt rules for the arbitration of attorney fees disputes through the sponsorship of local bar associations,subds.a,d.arbitrators in such proceedings may take and hear evidence,administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents,subd.g.
the mfaa is legislation based on public policy.through the measure,the legislature intended to alleviate the disparity in bargaining power in attorney fee matters which favors the attorney by providing an effective,inexpensive remedy to a client which does not necessitate the hiring of a second attorney.manatt,phelps,rothenberg tunney lawrence d.corell law firm of fox and fox th,d mfaa arbitration subserves a legislative and public purpose to apply the relatively informal and inexpensive arbitral process to a class of disputes whose nature merits such facility.
under the mfaa,the obligation to arbitrate arises from statutory mandate rather than the parties agreement.the mfaa favors the client by making arbitration voluntary for the client,but mandatory for the attorney on the client request,subd.c.the voluntary aspect is inapplicable,however,when the client agrees in writing to arbitration under the mfaa.ibid.moreover,the mfa a affords the client double protection,with a right to trial after arbitration.alternative systems,supra,th at,d.under the mfaa,the parties may commit in writing to binding arbitration,but only after the attorney fees dispute arises,subd.a.
further,the mfaa provides the client with certain procedural safeguards.before or when an attorney serves a summons in an action against the any other proceeding to resolve a fee attorney must give the client written notice of the right to nonbinding arbitration under the mfaa,subd.a.the failure to give the notice is deemed so egregious it is a ground for dismissal of the action or other proceeding.ibid.a client entitled to nonbinding arbitration under the mfaa may obtain a stay of a court action or any other proceedin
