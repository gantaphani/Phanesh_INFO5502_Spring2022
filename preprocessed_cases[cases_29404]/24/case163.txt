the primary question presented on this appeal is whether the failure of two arbitrators to disclose their concurrent service as arbitrators in another,arguably similar,arbitration constitutes evident partiality within the meaning of the federal arbitration act the faa,a.respondents saint paul fire and marine insurance company paul reinsurance company,limited and paul re limited collectively,appeal from a decision of the united states district court for the southern district of new york shira scheindlin,judge granting a petition by scandinavian reinsurance company limited scandinavian to vacate an arbitral award rendered in paul favor and denying a by paul to confirm the same award.paul had initiated the arbitration the paul arbitration to resolve a dispute concerning the interpretation of the parties reinsurance contract.
in deciding that vacatur was warranted on evident partiality grounds,the district court relied principally on the fact that two of the three members of the arbitral panel in the paul arbitration paul dassenko and peter gentile had failed to disclose that they were simultaneously serving as panel members in another arbitration proceeding the platinum arbitration.the court observed that the platinum arbitration overlapped in time,shared similar issues,involved related parties,and included a common witness.scandinavian reins.paul fire marine ins,d,scandinavian footnotes omitted.the district court determined that these factors indicate that dassenko and gentile simultaneous service as arbitrators in both proceedings constituted a material conflict of interest.id.at.the court then concluded that the arbitrators failure to disclose this conflict of interest required vacatur of the arbitral award.
we disagree.evident partiality may be found only where a reasonable person would have to conclude that an arbitrator was partial to one party to the arbitration.applied indus.materials ovalar makine ticaret ve sanayi,cir internal quotation mark omitted quoting morelite constr.dist.council carpenters benefits funds,cir.we conclude that,under the circumstances of this case,the fact of dassenko and gentile overlapping service as arbitrators in both the platinum arbitration and the paul arbitration does not,in itself,suggest that they were predisposed to rule in any particular way in the paul arbitration.as a result,their failure to disclose that concurrent service is not indicative of evident partiality.we therefore reverse and remand with instructions to the district court to confirm the award.
background 
the facts are recited at length in the district court opinion,see scandinavian,d at,and we borrow freely from that description here.the facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted.
the reinsurance contracts 
on august,scandinavian and paul both reinsurance companies entered into a specialized type of reinsurance contract known as a retrocessional agreement see retrocessional casualty aggregate stop loss agreement ar the agreement.under the agreement,paul ceded to scandinavian some of the reinsurance liabilities that paul had assumed from other insurance companies under reinsurance business that had been,or would be,written by paul between january,and december.
in exchange for scandinavian assumption of these liabilities,paul became obligated to pay premiums to scandinavian.but the agreement contemplated that instead of paying the premiums to scandinavian directly,paul would provisionally retain those funds within an experience account,where the funds would accumulate interest.any amounts that scandinavian became obligated to pay paul based on the assumed liabilities would first be paid out of that account.only if the experience account became fully depleted would scandinavian have to pay paul out of its own funds.
the agreement contained a clause providing for binding arbitration of any dispute arising out of the interpretation,performance or breach of this agreement,including the formation or validity thereof.agreement at.it required that such disputes be submitted for decision to a panel of three arbitrators two arbitrators and an umpire all of whom would be disinterested active or former executive officers of insurance or reinsurance companies or underwriters at lloyd,london.id.
emergence of the parties dispute 
in january,scandinavian entered into,thereby ceasing to underwrite new business.paul also entered into later the same year.
after paul requested that scandinavian indemnify it for much of its loss,two disputes emerged between the parties concerning the agreement interpretation.first,the parties could not agree on whether they had intended the agreement to limit the volume of liability assumed by scandinavian.scandinavian argued that the parties had intended the agreement to be finite,and that the maximum possible loss to scandinavian that the parties had contemplated was about million paul contended,however,that the agreement contained no express limitation on the extent of risk that scandinavian had assumed and that no such limitation should be read into the agreement.paul ultimately sought to charge scandinavian with losses of approximately million.
second,the parties could not agree on whether the agreement provided for a single experience account,or instead three separate experience accounts,one for each year covered by the agreement.scandinavian argued that the agreement provided for one,while paul argued that there were three separate accounts.
the arbitrators and their disclosures 
to resolve these disputes,in september,paul demanded arbitration.in accordance with the terms of the agreement,the parties proceeded to select the three members of the arbitral panel.scandinavian appointed jonathan rosen,and paul appointed peter gentile.paul dassenko was selected to serve as umpire the parties accepted dassenko appointment on november,following their receipt of his responses to a disclosure questionnaire.
although the agreement did not require the arbitrators to be affiliated with any particular arbitral association,all three arbitrators were certified by the aida reinsurance and insurance arbitration society arias.arias has promulgated ethical guidelines for certified arbitrators,including canon iv,which instructs arbitrators to disclose any interest or relationship likely to affect their judgment and to resolve any doubt about whether to disclose in favor of disclosure.arias,code of conduct canon iv,last visited.in accordance with those guidelines,each of the arbitrators made initial disclosures to the parties.the form of those disclosures differed.
dassenko,the umpire,responded in writing to a questionnaire jointly submitted by the parties see umpire questionnaire.in addition to disclosing his past employment at several firms affiliated with either paul or scandinavian dassenko noted that it was likely that he had transacted or sought to transact business with most of the entities listed by the parties on the questionnaire,including paul and scandinavian themselves.id.c.dassenko represented,however,that he had never had any involvement with the subject matter of the dispute,nor did he have any significant professional or personal relationship with any officers,directors,or employees of the parties dassenko also indicated that he had previously served as an arbitrator in more than insurance or reinsurance arbitrations,including two arbitrations in which rosen had also been an arbitrator.at the prompting of paul counsel,dassenko made additional disclosures by email on november,with respect to certain matters that he had forgotten to include in responding to the questionnaire.
the two arbitrators made their initial disclosures orally at an organizational meeting held on february.both rosen,the arbitrator,and gentile,the arbitrator,made a variety of disclosures about past and present employment,their relationships to the parties or their law firms,and their participation as witnesses or arbitrators in other proceedings involving the same parties,their affiliates,their law firms,or the same arbitrators 
after rosen and gentile made their respective disclosures,dassenko speaking on behalf of the panel urge d the parties to determine whether there anything else that deserves more attention in terms of disclosures on behalf of this p anel.tr.at.dassenko also acknowledged,on behalf of the panel,the arbitrators ongoing responsibility to make disclosure if and when they become aware of relationships or situations that require additional disclosure.id.the parties agreed to accept the panel as constituted.they did not ask any other questions relating to the arbitrators disclosures at that time.
as the paul arbitration progressed,the arbitrators made various additional disclosures.on july,gentile informed the parties that during the time he worked at a specified firm,other staff members at that firm might have reviewed the same contract that was at issue in the paul arbitration.during a motion hearing held on may,he and rosen disclosed that they had known scandinavian expert witness professionally and personally for many years.and on june,gentile told the parties that he had met one of scandinavian witnesses,bart hedges,a few times in the past,mainly in bermuda.tr.at june.
the umpire,dassenko,made further disclosures on march,june,and july.for example,dassenko explained that his private equity firm had been retained to assist with the of an insurer that had a potential dispute with paul parent company,and that he had prior business contacts with a paul underwriter whose name had been mentioned during the evidentiary hearing.
the arbitral award 
the arbitration proceedings addressed the question whether the parties had agreed to limit scandinavian total financial exposure under the agreement.paul argued that the agreement was valid and that its express terms which contained no explicit limit should be enforced.scandinavian sought rescission of the agreement on the grounds of misrepresentation,or in the alternative,for rescission or reformation based on unilateral or mutual mistake.
during the final evidentiary hearing,held between june,and july,fourteen witnesses testified.among them was bart hedges,who then served as president and ceo of scandinavian and who had been an employee of scandinavian at the time the agreement was executed.
the arbitral panel issued their award the award on august.a majority of the concluded that the agreement was valid and should be enforced according to its terms,thereby exposing scandinavian to an aggregate limit of approximately million in liability.with respect to several other matters,including the question of whether the agreement had created one experience account or three,the panel ruled unanimously in favor of paul.
the platinum arbitration and its non disclosure 
while proceedings in the paul arbitration were ongoing,another reinsurance arbitration the platinum arbitration began.it involved a reinsurance dispute between pma capital insurance company and several of its affiliates collectively,pma and platinum underwriters bermuda,platinum.platinum was pma.in june about three months after the organizational meeting was held in the paul arbitration platinum demanded arbitration against pma in order to interpret a reinsurance contract between those two parties.
two of the arbitrators from the paul arbitration gentile,paul arbitrator,and dassenko,the umpire were subsequently selected to serve on the panel in the platinum arbitration.platinum selected gentile as its arbitrator,and dassenko,there too,was chosen to serve as umpire.those appointments occurred sometime between early june and late september.the organizational meeting for the platinum arbitration was held on september.the evidentiary hearing was held in three sessions in march through may.the platinum arbitration ended with the issuance of an award on may,about four weeks before the start of the evidentiary hearing in the paul arbitration the platinum arbitration was therefore concurrent with the paul arbitration,as the paul arbitration began prior to,and ended after,the platinum arbitration.
despite the many disclosures made by dassenko and gentile during the paul arbitration including disclosures about the specific matter of their participation in other arbitrations involving the same arbitrators it is undisputed that neither dassenko nor gentile ever disclosed to the parties the fact of their concurrent service in the platinum arbitration.see scandinavian,d at.and although dassenko and gentile each disclosed to platinum and pma that they were then serving together as arbitrators in another matter the arbitration at issue here neither of them specifically identified paul or scandinavian as the parties involved in it id.at.
similarities between the platinum arbitration and the paul arbitration 
as described by the district court,the platinum arbitration appeared to resemble the paul arbitration in several ways.
first,as noted above,gentile served as the arbitrator for the claimant in both proceedings,and dassenko presided as umpire over each panel.see id.at.
second,although paul was not itself a party to the platinum arbitration,paul business was related in several ways to platinum.see id.at.most importantly,after paul contributed its rights to renew its existing reinsurance contracts to platinum parent in,platinum succeeded paul as pma reinsurer.moreover,the core of platinum claim in the platinum arbitration was that,in calculating the balance of the experience account created by the platinum pma contract,platinum was entitled to carry forward certain losses that had been incurred by paul under paul previous reinsurance contract with pma see id.at pma capital ins.d at noting that the interpretation of the contract deficit carry forward provision was the gravamen of the parties dispute in the platinum arbitration.paul asserts,however,that the district court mischaracterized the facts and that platinum is not truly related to it in any meaningful way.appellants br.at.
third,hedges a past employee of both scandinavian and platinum testified in both proceedings.see scandinavian,d at nn.hedges testimony in each proceeding related to two distinct periods of past employment.nonetheless,the district court posited that dassenko and gentile could have concluded that hedges testified inconsistently and therefore lacked credibility insofar as,in the platinum arbitration,hedges testified in favor of interpreting the platinum pma agreement as written,while in the paul arbitration,hedges testified in favor of interpreting the scandinavian paul agreement in light of scandinavian intent at the time it entered into the agreement.id.at emphasis in original.paul,for its part,argues that the involvement of hedges as a witness in the two unrelated arbitrations is irrelevant.appellants br.at.
fourth,the district court determined that the two arbitrations shared similar legal issues.id.at.
b oth arbitrations required the arbitrators to consider whether a finite retrocessional agreement should be enforced according to the express terms of the agreement or whether the agreement should be interpreted in light of the parties intentions at the formation of the agreement and interpret contract language regarding the creation of experience accounts.
id.at.again,however,paul criticizes the district court assessment of similarity,arguing that it is couched at an overly broad level of generality.appellants br.at.
the district court proceedings 
scandinavian represents that it first became aware that dassenko and gentile had served together on the platinum arbitration two months after the award was issued on november,scandinavian filed a petition to vacate the award in the united states district court for the southern district of new york pursuant to the faa on grounds of evident partiality.see a.scandinavian asserted that the fact that dassenko and gentile had failed to disclose their concurrent service in the platinum arbitration a proceeding that,scandinavian contended,involved a common witness,similar disputed issues and contract terms,and the company that succeeded to the business of paul,am.pet.to vacate arbitration award at,at reflected bias by those arbitrators in paul favor.
on december,paul opposed scandinavian petition and filed a to confirm the arbitration award under.paul did not dispute that dassenko and gentile had failed to disclose their concurrent service in the platinum arbitration,arguing instead that there was no basis upon which to conclude that nondisclosure was indicative of bias.
on february,the district court granted scandinavian petition and denied paul,concluding that the arbitrators failure to disclose their concurrent service in the platinum arbitration constituted evident partiality.see scandinavian,d at.the court observed that the two arbitrations were presided over by two common arbitrators,overlapped in time,shared similar issues,involved related parties,and included hedges as a common witness.id.at footnotes omitted.the court further reasoned 
by participating in both the paul arbitration and the platinum arbitration,dassenko and gentile placed themselves in a position where they could receive ex parte information about the kind of reinsurance business at issue in the paul arbitration,be influenced by recent credibility determinations they made as a result of hedges testimony in the platinum arbitration,and influence each other thinking on issues relevant to the paul arbitration.by failing to disclose their participation in the platinum a rbitration,dassenko and gentile deprived scandinavian of an opportunity to object to their service on both arbitration panels adjust their arbitration strategy.
id.at footnote omitted.
the court also contrasted dassenko and gentile failure to disclose their concurrent service in the platinum arbitration with the many other less significant or temporally remote relationships that dassenko and gentile considered important enough to disclose,id.at,and suggested that that comparison strengthened the court conclusion that dassenko and gentile should have informed the parties of their simultaneous service,id.
the district court concluded that t aken together,these factors indicate that dassenko and gentile simultaneous service as arbitrators in the two proceedings constituted a material conflict of interest.id.at.and because that conflict had not been disclosed,the court decided,the nondisclosure met this circuit test for evident partiality.id.at citing applied industrial,at.the court vacated the award and remanded the matter for arbitration before a new arbitral panel.id.

ii.evident partiality 
governing law 
the faa provides that district courts may vacate an arbitral award where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,or either of them.a.in this circuit,evident partiality within the meaning of will be found where a reasonable person would have to conclude that an arbitrator was partial to one party to the arbitration.morelite,at internal quotation marks omitted.unlike a judge,who can be disqualified in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned,applied industrial,at emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted,an arbitrator is disqualified only when a reasonable person,considering all the circumstances,would have to conclude that an arbitrator was partial to one side,id.emphasis in original internal quotation marks omitted.proof of actual bias is not required,however.see united states int l of teamsters,cir.a conclusion of partiality can be inferred from objective facts inconsistent with impartiality.pitta hotel ass of,cir.of course,a showing of evident partiality may not be based simply on speculation.int l of teamsters,at see also three s,dataquick info,cir noting that the asserted bias may not be remote,uncertain or speculative internal quotation marks omitted.

among the circumstances under which the standard is likely to be met are those in which an arbitrator fails to disclose a relationship or interest that is strongly suggestive of bias in favor of one of the parties.see,applied industrial,at.but we have repeatedly cautioned that we are not quick to set aside the results of an arbitration because of an arbitrator alleged failure to disclose information.lucent techs,at internal quotation mark omitted.we have concluded in various factual settings that the standard was not satisfied because the undisclosed relationship at issue was too insubstantial to warrant vacating the award.id.at internal quotation mark omitted see also,id.at no evident partiality where arbitrator failed to disclose either his past work as an expert witness for one of the parties or his past of an airplane with another arbitrator andros compania maritima,at,no evident partiality where umpire failed to disclose his past joint service on nineteen arbitral panels with the president of a firm that acted as one party agent.most recently,in applied industrial,we considered the standard for obtaining vacatur based upon nondisclosure.there,we reaffirmed the principle that where a n arbitrator knows of a material relationship with a party but fails to disclose it,a reasonable person would have to conclude that the arbitrator who failed to disclose under such circumstances was partial to one side.applied industrial,at see also,lucent techs,at recognizing same principle 
the district court in the case before us concluded that dassenko and gentile simultaneous service in the platinum arbitration constituted a material conflict of interest requiring disclosure to the parties.scandinavian,d at.relying upon our decisions in morelite and applied industrial,the court then decided that dassenko and gentile failure to disclose that simultaneous service warranted vacatur on grounds.we disagree.
the standard is,at its core,directed to the question of bias.because it was not the purpose of congress to authorize litigants to submit their cases and controversies to arbitrators who are biased against one litigant and favorable to another,commonwealth coatings,at black,plurality opinion,the faa provides for vacatur of arbitral awards whenever it is evident that an arbitrator was partial to one of the litigating parties.a.it follows that where an undisclosed matter is not suggestive of bias,vacatur based upon that nondisclosure can not be warranted under an theory.see,credit suisse sec.usa llc,cir recognizing in dicta that the evident partiality decisions address only facts bearing on partiality emphasis in original lagstein certain underwriter at lloyd,london,cir emphasizing that an arbitrator is required to disclose only facts indicating that he might reasonably be thought biased against one litigant and favorable to another emphasis in original internal quotation marks omitted.
several courts have identified a variety of factors for use in guiding a district court in the application of the test in cases where a party seeks vacatur of an arbitration award because of an arbitrator nondisclosure.we find those adopted by the fourth circuit helpful 
to determine if a party has established evident partiality,a court should assess four factors the extent and character of the personal interest,pecuniary or otherwise,of the arbitrator in the proceedings the directness of the relationship between the arbitrator and the party he is alleged to favor the connection of that relationship to the arbitrator and the proximity in time between the relationship and the arbitration proceeding.
three s,at quoting anr coal cogentrix of,cir,cert.denied.while those factors are useful,we do not view them as mandatory,exclusive or dispositive 
we conclude that scandinavian has not met its burden of establishing that dassenko and gentile service in the platinum arbitration was indicative of bias in these proceedings so as to constitute a nontrivial conflict of interest therefore,the arbitrators failure to disclose their concurrent service does not require vacatur.
first,as a general matter,we do not think that the fact that two arbitrators served together in one arbitration at the same time that they served together in another is,without more,evidence that they were predisposed to favor one party over another in either arbitration.the undisclosed matter here was overlapping arbitral service,not a material relationship with a party,applied industrial,at,such as a family connection or ongoing business arrangement with a party or its law firm circumstances in which a reasonable person could reasonably infer a connection between the undisclosed outside relationship and the possibility of bias for or against a particular arbitrating party.we agree with paul that the mere fact of such overlapping arbitral service suggests nothing inherently negative about the impartiality of the arbitrators.appellants reply br.at.and despite the overlap,there is no indication here that either of the arbitrators was predisposed to rule any particular way in the scandinavian arbitration as a result of the platinum arbitration.
scandinavian,in arguing to the contrary,appears to ask us to infer partiality from the arbitrators overlapping service because the award in the paul arbitration was rendered in paul favor.but the fact that one party loses at arbitration does not,without more,tend to prove that an arbitrator failure to disclose some perhaps disclosable information should be interpreted as showing bias against the losing party.we have repeatedly said that adverse rulings alone rarely evidence partiality,whether those adverse rulings are made by arbitrators,see,thomas baer,architectural ornamental iron workers local union,cir,or by judges,see,chen chen qualified settlement fund,cir per curiam citing liteky united states.
nor do we consider any of the identified similarities between the paul arbitration and the platinum arbitration to suggest bias.the district court was correct in observing that the same witness,hedges,testified in both proceedings that the interpretation of reinsurance agreements containing experience account features was at issue in both and that past and ongoing business relationships existed between platinum and its affiliates and paul and its affiliates.see scandinavian,d at.but the fact that one arbitration resembles another in some respects does not suggest to us that an arbitrator presiding in both is somehow therefore likely to be biased in favor of or against any party.liteky,at kennedy,concurring observing that the fact that same judge presides over related cases ordinarily does not suggest that judge is biased.
to be sure,as scandinavian points out,material conflicts of interest need not be direct relationships between arbitrators and parties to the arbitration.as the district court put it,a reasonable person concludes that an arbitrator is partial to one side because the undisclosed relationship is material,not because the material relationship is with a party.id.at.but,in ascertaining whether a relationship is material or,to use the terminology of applied industrial,whether it is nontrivial we think that a court must focus on the question of how strongly that relationship tends to indicate the possibility of bias in favor of or against one party,and not on how closely that relationship appears to relate to the facts of the arbitration.see morelite,at e vident partiality will be found where a reasonable person would have to conclude that an arbitrator was partial to one party to the arbitration.internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,even if a particular relationship might be thought to be relevant to the arbitration at issue,scandinavian,d at,that relationship will nevertheless not constitute a material conflict of interest if it does not itself tend to show that the arbitrator might be predisposed in favor of one or more of the parties.as we put it in applied industrial,for a relationship to be material,and therefore require disclosure,it must be such that a reasonable person would have to conclude that an arbitrator who failed to disclose it was partial to one side.applied industrial,at.
we understand,of course,that gentile was a arbitrator in each arbitration,and that he represented the respective claimants paul and platinum in each we also acknowledge the district court factual findings that platinum and its affiliates and paul and its affiliates had various past and ongoing business relationships.see scandinavian,d at.but there is no indication in the record that gentile was appointed by platinum at the recommendation of paul,or that gentile or dassenko had any special financial or professional interest in ruling in paul favor as a result of their participation in the platinum arbitration.
scandinavian asserts that vacatur is nonetheless warranted because it was misled by dassenko and gentile repeated assurances to the parties that they understood themselves obligated to make thorough and ongoing disclosures.in light of those assurances and the many opportunities during the paul arbitration when the arbitrators concurrent service in the platinum arbitration might have come to mind,scandinavian argues,b oth arbitrators simply could not have continually failed to see what was right in front of their eyes for so long.appellee br.at.the district court,apparently crediting this argument,indicated that in ordering vacatur it relied on the fact that dassenko and gentile had informed the parties of many other less significant or temporally remote relationships.scandinavian,d at.
we conclude that vacatur was not called for.in the first place,we do not think it appropriate to vacate an award solely because an arbitrator fails to consistently live up to his or her announced standards for disclosure,or to conform in every instance to the parties respective expectations regarding disclosure the nondisclosure does not by itself constitute evident partiality.the question is whether the facts that were not disclosed suggest a material conflict of interest.an approach that examined why an arbitrator failed to disclose a relationship would interject added uncertainty and subjectivity into our analysis.see int l of teamsters,at describing the test for evident partiality as being whether an objective,disinterested observer would conclude that the arbitrator was biased emphasis added.such an approach might,moreover,have perverse effects because if it were the rule that vacatur would be warranted for an arbitrator failure to live up to his or her own particularly punctilious standards of disclosure,arbitrators would have less of an incentive to set a high standard for their disclosures in the first place.
secondly,we reject scandinavian assertion that the nondisclosure can only be explained by bias in favor of paul.the record does not indicate why the information was not disclosed,but we do not find it implausible that dassenko and gentile labored under the false impression that they had made a disclosure which in fact they had failed to make,particularly in light of the fact that they did disclose although not by name the existence of the scandinavian arbitration in the pma proceeding.paul suggests that the nondisclosure may have occurred because of sheer inadvertence,a mistaken belief that they had already disclosed it,or.appellants reply br.at.indeed,peter gentile seems to have operated under just such a false impression with respect to another matter which he failed to disclose until late in the arbitration.in any event,the arbitrators conduct is not such that a reasonable person would have to conclude that an arbitrator was partial to paul.morelite,at emphasis added.
we also reject scandinavian argument that vacatur is required because the presentation of its arbitration case was disadvantaged by dassenko and gentile nondisclosure.see,appellee br.at if scandinavian had known that dassenko and gentile had recently heard hedges defend a contrary position in the other arbitration,it could have prepared for and presented hedges testimony in the paul a rbitration differently,or not called him as a witness at all.see also scandinavian,d at concluding that the nondisclosure deprived scandinavian of an opportunity to adjust its arbitration strategy,id.at.the faa does not bestow on a party the right to receive information about every matter that it might consider important or useful in presenting its case.a party is not entitled to the complete and unexpurgated business biograph ies of the arbitrators whom the parties have selected.applied industrial,at quoting commonwealth coatings,at white,concurring.
finally,we are not persuaded that other reasons given by the district court for vacating the award require us to conclude that the arbitrators were evident ly partial.the district court noted,dassenko and gentile could have receive d ex parte information in the platinum arbitration about matters at issue in the paul arbitration,scandinavian,d at and might have been influenced by the credibility determinations they made about hedges,and could have influence d each other thinking on issues relevant to the paul arbitration,id.but these possibilities do not establish bias.see trustmark ins.john hancock life ins,cir arbitrators not disqualified merely because they acquired relevant knowledge in a previous arbitration,cert.denied.int l of teamsters,at evident partiality may not be based simply on speculation.neither do they distinguish this case from any number of others successfully presided over by arbitrators or by judges for that matter.
to be sure,in this case unlike in applied industrial dassenko and gentile plainly had actual knowledge of their concurrent service in the platinum arbitration.scandinavian,d at.although it would have been far better for them to have disclosed that fact,we do not think disclosure was required to avoid a vacatur of the award in light of the fact that the relationship did not significantly tend to establish partiality.
we do not in any way wish to demean the importance of timely and full disclosure by arbitrators.disclosure not only enhances the actual and apparent fairness of the arbitral process,but it helps to ensure that that process will be final,rather than extended by proceedings like this one.we again reiterate justice white observation that it is far better for a potential conflict of interest to be disclosed at the outset than for it to come to light after the arbitration,when a suspicious or disgruntled party can seize on it as a pretext for invalidating the award.commonwealth coatings,at white,concurring accord applied industrial,at lucent,at andros compania maritima,at.but the better course is not necessarily the only permissible one.
because we agree with paul that the district court erred in vacating the award in this case,we need not consider its alternative argument on appeal that the district court should not have vacated the arbitrators interim rulings.
iii.confirmation of the award 
under section of the faa,a court must confirm an arbitration award unless it is vacated,modified or corrected as prescribed in and.hall,mattel.and for petitions brought under the new york convention,t he court shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said convention.see also telenor mobile commc ns as storm llc,cir same,citing section.
scandinavian has identified no basis other than the asserted evident partiality for vacating the award under the faa or new york convention.because we conclude that evident partiality was absent,paul to confirm the award must be granted.
conclusion 
the judgment of the district court is reversed,and the case is remanded with instructions to the district court to deny scandinavian petition to vacate the award,to grant paul to confirm it,and to enter an amended judgment accordingly.
the district court explained reinsurance is insurance for insurance companies.t he ceding company transfers or cedes all or part of the risk it underwrites to the reinsurer another insurance company that is willing to assume that risk.in a retrocessional agreement,a reinsurer cedes a portion of its risk to another reinsurer.a retrocessional agreement is effectively reinsurance for,d at citation omitted see generally unigard sec.ins.river ins,cir describing the reinsurance business.
although termed an account,the experience account is a purely notional bookkeeping concept.
according to the parties,a reinsurer is said to be in status when it ceases to write new reinsurance contracts but continues to administer its existing obligations under previously issued contracts.it is essentially an orderly of the company reinsurance business.delta holdings,distillers chem,cir,cert.denied.
scandinavian also contends that,conversely,the maximum possible gain to scandinavian that the parties had contemplated was million.
the parties descriptions regarding who was responsible for selecting dassenko appear to be inconsistent.paul states that each party proposed five possible candidates for umpire,and that dassenko was jointly selected by the parties because he had been included on each party list.scandinavian states,instead,that the two arbitrators,rosen and gentile,were the ones responsible for selecting dassenko.the district court,without noting this inconsistency,accepted scandinavian representation that rosen and gentile selected paul dassenko to be the umpire.scandinavian,d at.there is no need to inquire further into this matter,however,because it does not affect the outcome on appeal.
the questionnaire appears to have been modeled on a sample disclosure form prepared and disseminated by arias.see arias u,questionnaire,last visited.
the parties questionnaire identified some entities within the travelers group of insurance companies,to which paul
