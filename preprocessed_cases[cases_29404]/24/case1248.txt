several years after she was hired,lourdes tiri signed an agreement with her employer,lucky chances,requiring disputes between them to be resolved by arbitration.in one of the provisions,the parties agreed to delegate questions about the enforceability of the agreement to the arbitrator,instead of a court.tiri was subsequently fired,and she filed a complaint in superior court for wrongful discharge.lucky chances petitioned to compel arbitration,but the trial court denied the petition on the basis that the arbitration agreement was unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.
lucky chances appeals the court order denying arbitration.we hold that the trial court lacked the authority to rule on the enforceability of the agreement because the parties delegation of this authority to the arbitrator was clear and is not revocable under state law.accordingly,we reverse.
factual and proceduralbackground 
more than three years after she was hired as a cook by lucky chances,a casino and restaurant in colma,tiri was asked and agreed to sign a mutual agreement to arbitrate claims the agreement.five years later,tiri was fired,allegedly while on medical leave after undergoing heart surgery.tiri brought this action for wrongful discharge,and this appeal turns on whether the agreement precluded the trial court from considering the validity of both the agreement and her underlying legal claims.
the parties dispute the circumstances surrounding tiri signing the agreement.according to tiri,she was called to the department and given the agreement right there and then to sign immediately.she contends that the terms of the agreement were not explained,and that she was not told that the terms were negotiable,that her signature was optional,or that she could take the agreement and review it before signing.she felt she had to sign it as a condition of continued employment with lucky chances,and she believed that she would be fired if she did not sign it.according to lucky chances manager,tiri was never told that the agreement was nonnegotiable,and tiri never asked to change the agreement or to negotiate its terms.still,lucky chances does not specifically deny that tiri was told to sign the agreement immediately and was never informed that the terms could be negotiated.
the agreement is a,document that is entitled,in blocked,bold lettering,mutual agreement to arbitrate claims.it relates solely to resolving claims between tiri and lucky chances and provides that any and all differences legal disputes except those related to workers compensation and benefits will be resolved through the process of final and binding arbitration.the agreement further provides that any arbitration shall be in accordance with the current aaa american arbitration association employment rules.a copy of those rules was not attached to the agreement,although the agreement identified a website where the rules could be found.
the agreement also includes an explicit provision that delegates to the arbitrator issues regarding the agreement enforceability the arbitrator,and not any federal,state,or local court or agency,shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation,applicability,enforceability,or formation of this agreement,including,but not limited to,any claim that all or any part of this agreement is void or voidable.this provision is central to the issues in this appeal,and we will refer to it as the delegation clause.
after tiri filed her complaint,lucky chances filed a petition to compel arbitration arguing that the enforceability of the arbitration agreement is a question for the arbitrator,not a court,under the express terms of the delegation clause.tiri opposed the petition.she argued that the arbitration agreement was unconscionable and that its unconscionability was an issue properly resolved by the trial court.
the trial court issued a tentative ruling denying lucky chances petition,but the ruling did not address the delegation clause.at the hearing on the petition,lucky chances attorney argued that it was important for the court to rule on the threshold issue of the delegation clause and that recent case law required the trial court to delegate to the arbitrator the question whether the arbitration agreement was unconscionable.the court asked about the presence of contractual consideration when an employer asks a current employee to sign an arbitration agreement,and lucky chances attorney insisted that the adequacy of consideration in this case was an issue for the arbitrator to decide,an argument the court considered rather circular.
at the close of the hearing,the trial court adopted its tentative ruling and denied the petition to compel arbitration.in doing so,it focused on the fact that the arbitration agreement stated it would be governed by aaa rules but failed to attach those rules,citing two cases that declined to enforce arbitration agreements under similar circumstances zullo superior court th and fitz ncr th.the court found that the arbitration agreement is both substantively and procedurally unconscionable and therefore unenforceable because lucky chances presented the agreement to plaintiff on a take it or leave it basis and lucky chances failed to attach the aaa employment dispute resolution rules to the arbitration agreement.lucky chances timely appealed.
discussion 
in this appeal,we must decide whether the trial court properly denied lucky chances petition to compel arbitration in light of the delegation clause,which gives the arbitrator the authority to decide whether the arbitration agreement is enforceable.the answer turns on whether the delegation clause is valid under unconscionability principles.we conclude that the trial court ruling must be reversed because,although its implied finding that the delegation clause was procedurally unconscionable was correct,its implied finding that the delegation clause was substantively unconscionable was incorrect.as a result of our conclusion that the delegation clause is valid,we leave to the arbitrator the question whether the arbitration agreement as a whole,or any of its other severable provisions,is unconscionable.

under both federal and state law,arbitration agreements are valid and enforceable,unless they are revocable for reasons under state law that would render any contract revocable.code civ,armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,armendariz.reasons that would render any contract revocable under state law include fraud,duress,and unconscionability.sonic calabasas a,moreno cal th,sonic ii armendariz,at stirlen supercuts,th.

b.the applicability of the federal arbitration act is immaterial.
the parties dispute at length the applicability of the faa,which governs only arbitration agreements that are part of written contracts affecting interstate commerce.but we conclude that the faa applicability is immaterial because our decision in this case would be the same under either the faa or the caa.
in most important respects,the california statutory scheme on enforcement of private arbitration agreements is similar to the faa the similarity is not surprising,as the two share origins in the earlier statutes of new york and new jersey.rosenthal,supra,cal th at.in similar language,both the faa and the caa provide that predispute arbitration agreements are valid,enforceable,and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.ibid.thus,enforcing valid arbitration agreements is favored under both state and federal law.armendariz,supra,cal th at.

in rent a center,west,jackson,rent a center,the united states supreme court extended a rule established in prima paint flood conklin,prima paint.under prima paint,a party challenge to an employment contract that contains a severable arbitration clause does not invalidate the arbitration agreement,and therefore the arbitrator,and not a court,must consider any challenge to the employment contract as a whole.rent a center,at.rent a center extended this rule to situations,like the one here,where the contract at issue is itself an arbitration agreement instead of a broader employment contract as in prima paint that contains a delegation clause.the court held that in such a case,a party challenge to the arbitration agreement does not invalidate the delegation clause,and therefore the arbitrator,and not a court,must consider any challenge to the arbitration agreement as a whole.rent a center,at.stated another way,rent a center acknowledges that while courts may consider enforceability challenges specific to delegation clauses,the arbitrator is to consider challenges to the arbitration agreement as a whole.id.at.
although rent a center was decided under the faa,we agree with lucky chances that its holding applies under the caa as well.sonic calabasas,moreno cal th,fn.sonic i not necessary to decide whether rent a center holding applies to actions brought in state courts,overruled on another ground by sonic ii,supra,cal th at knight et,cal.practice guide alternative dispute resolution the rutter group,unclear whether california courts will apply rent a center.in extending prima paint holding,rent a center relied on section federal counterpart,section of the faa.at,citing buckeye check cashing,cardegna,prima paint,supra.and prima paint severability analysis is already applied in cases governed by the caa.ericksen,arbuthnot,mccarthy,kearney walsh,oak street cal d.
because section and section of the faa are interpreted the same under controlling precedent,it makes no difference to the outcome of this case if one but not the other applies.thus,we need not resolve the parties dispute whether the agreement sufficiently affects interstate commerce to support the application of the faa.
clauses in arbitration agreements that delegate enforcement issues to an arbitrator are effective when they are clear and not revocable under state law.
parties to an arbitration agreement may agree to delegate to the arbitrator,instead of a court,questions regarding the enforceability of the agreement.freeman state farm mut.auto.ins.cal d.they can agree to arbitrate almost any dispute even a dispute over whether the underlying dispute is subject to arbitration.bruni didion th,bruni.the delegation clause here was such an agreement,and we turn to consider its validity 
there are two prerequisites for a delegation clause to be effective.first,the language of the clause must be clear and unmistakable.rent a center,supra,at,fn.second,the delegation must not be revocable under state contract defenses such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability.id.at sonic ii,supra,cal th at.we examine both of these prerequisites in connection with the delegation clause here.
the requirement that the language of the delegation clause be clear is straightforward.the law presumes that a delegation to an arbitrator of enforceability issues is ineffective absent clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties intended such a delegation.first options of chicago,kaplan,first options ontiveros,supra,th at.in first options,the court observed that the question of who should determine such a challenge is rather arcane,and a party often might not focus upon that question or upon the significance of having arbitrators decide the scope of their own powers.first options,at.accordingly,the court determined that a party seeking to enforce a delegation clause must show that it was clear and unmistakable,and silence or ambiguity will be deemed insufficient.id.at see also rent a center,supra,at,fn.
lucky chances has demonstrated that the delegation clause here is clear and unmistakable.the clause states unambiguously that t he arbitrator,and not any federal,state,or local court or agency,shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation,applicability,enforceability,or formation of this agreement this language indicates an intent to delegate all issues to an arbitrator,including issues of enforceability,and tiri concedes as much.rent a center,supra,at,fn.party challenging an identically worded delegation clause conceded language was clear see also gilbert street developers,llc la quinta homes,llc,supra,th at an easy case establishing delegation is obviously when there is explicit language in the actual signed document to that effect.we see no reason to disagree with the parties tacit understanding that the delegation clause here was clear 
the second requirement for a delegation clause to be effective is that it can not be revocable on grounds such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability.sonic ii,supra,cal th at.here,the only ground the trial court relied upon in determining that the arbitration agreement,and impliedly the delegation clause,was unenforceable was its finding of unconscionability.in reviewing a finding of unconscionability,we apply a de novo standard of review when,as here,there is no disputed extrinsic evidence.bruni,supra,th at.
t he core concern of unconscionability doctrine is the absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party.sonic ii,supra,cal th at.the doctrine is meant to ensure that contracts,particularly contracts of adhesion,do not impose terms that are overly harsh,unduly oppressive,so as to shock the conscience,or unfairly ibid.
the analysis begins with an inquiry into whether the contract is one of adhesion.citation.the term contract of adhesion signifies a standardized contract,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.citation.if the contract is adhesive,the court must then determine whether other factors are present which,under established legal rules legislative or judicial operate to render it unenforceable.armendariz,supra,cal th at.u nconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element,the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,the latter on overly harsh or results.citation.the prevailing view is that procedural and substantive unconscionability must both be present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability.citation.but they need not be present in the same degree t he more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.id.at.b y the use of a sliding scale,a greater showing of procedural or substantive unconscionability will require less of a showing of the other to invalidate the claim.ajamian,supra,th at.the party opposing arbitration has the burden of proving unconscionability.szetela discover bank th.
rent a center involved an employment arbitration agreement delegation clause that was worded identically to the one here.rent a center,supra,at.although the court declined to rule squarely on the conscionability of the clause it provided a framework for considering the question.it explained that while there must be clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties intended to delegate arbitrability issues to an arbitrator,there is no requirement that conscionability also be clear and unmistakable.id.at,fn.importantly,it further explained that any claim of unconscionability must be specific to the delegation clause.id.at.in providing an example of such a claim,the court stated that the employee contention that a discovery limitation in the arbitration agreement was substantively unconscionable would have had to be specifically directed at the delegation clause.in the court words,the employee would have had to argue that the limitation upon the number of depositions causes the arbitration of his claim that the agreement is unenforceable to be unconscionable.ibid.the court acknowledged that this would be,of course,a much more difficult argument to sustain than the argument that the same limitation renders arbitration of the employee factbound claim unconscionable.ibid.
with this framework in mind,we apply state conscionability principles to examine whether tiri sustained her burden of establishing that the delegation clause is unconscionable.
the delegation clause is part of a contract of adhesion.
tiri contends,as she did below,that the delegation clause is part of a contract of adhesion.murphy check n go of california,th,murphy.we agree.the delegation clause was drafted by lucky chances and presented to tiri on a basis,and tiri stated that she was worried she would lose her job if she refused to sign it.bruni,supra,th at.in the employment context,the economic pressure exerted by employers on all but the most employees may be particularly acute,for the arbitration agreement stands between the employee and necessary employment,and few employees are in a position to refuse a job because of an arbitration requirement.armendariz,supra,cal th at.
the statements by lucky chances manager that tiri was never told that the agreement was nonnegotiable and that tiri never proposed changes fell far short of demonstrating an bargaining transaction.tellingly,the manager did not say that the agreement was actually negotiable,that lucky chances offered to negotiate,or that lucky chances would have considered proposed changes.under these circumstances,we have no difficulty concluding that the arbitration agreement was a contract of adhesion.murphy,supra,th at.
the delegation clause is procedurally unconscionable.
the procedural element of unconscionability,as mentioned above,focuses on two factors oppression and surprise.zullo superior court,supra,th at.oppression arises from an inequality of bargaining power which results in no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice.citations.surprise involves the extent to which the supposedly terms of the bargain are hidden in the prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce the disputed terms.ibid.
for the same reasons that we conclude the delegation clause is part of a contract of adhesion,we agree with the trial court implied finding that the delegation clause is procedurally unconscionable.again,the clause was presented along with the rest of the agreement on a basis.ajamian,supra,th at,fn.delegation clause procedurally unconscionable where presented on basis.although,as we have already determined,the delegation clause was clear and unmistakable,the issue of delegating arbitrability questions to an arbitrator is a rather arcane issue upon which parties likely do not focus.first options,supra,at.tiri was an unsophisticated party who was presented with the agreement containing the clause years after being hired by lucky chances,and was given little time to review it.the arcane nature of the clause,tiri lack of sophistication,and the failure of lucky chances to provide adequate time to review the agreement all add to the oppression and surprise of the delegation clause in this case 
the delegation clause is not substantively unconscionable.
although we conclude that the delegation clause is a contract of adhesion and procedurally unconscionable,we conclude that it is nonetheless valid because it is not substantively unconscionable.the delegation clause is not overly harsh,and does not sanction results.armendariz,supra,cal th at.a n arbitration agreement imposed in an adhesive context lacks basic fairness and mutuality if it requires one party,but not the other,to arbitrate all claims arising out of the same transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences.id.at.the delegation clause here does not lack mutuality because tiri and lucky chances are bound by it equally.
in denying tiri petition to compel arbitration,the trial court relied on zullo superior court,supra,th and fitz ncr,supra,th in finding that the arbitration agreement as a whole was unconscionable.but neither of these cases provides a persuasive basis for concluding that the delegation clause is substantively unconscionable.both zullo and fitz reviewed employment arbitration agreements and concluded that they were substantively unconscionable because they lacked mutuality.in zullo,the court found that the agreement lacked mutuality in two ways.first,the agreement applied to any dispute arising out of a termination.zullo,supra,at.according to the zullo court,this unfairly favored the employer because termination disputes are virtually certain to be filed against,not by the employer,but the agreement included no corresponding provision requiring the employer to arbitrate the types of claims that it might bring against the employee.ibid.mutuality was lacking,in other words,because arbitration was required for disputes that the employee was likely to initiate but not for disputes that the employer was likely to initiate.second,the agreement unfairly favored the employer because it required the employee,but not the employer,to respond to any communications about arbitration proceedings within days or forfeit the claim id.at.in fitz,the court found that the agreement lacked mutuality because it imposed a limit on the employee but not the employer in claims and,as with the agreement in zullo,it failed to require the employer to arbitrate other types of disputes.fitz,supra,at.thus,in both cases the agreement left the employee more bound by arbitration than the employer.
in contrast,the delegation clause here does not lack mutuality because tiri and lucky chances are bound by it equally.the agreement requires arbitration for any and all differences legal disputes whether by or against the employee or employer.this mutuality is nearly unqualified,and it is far more than the modicum of bilaterality required by our state supreme court in employment arbitration agreements.armendariz,supra,cal th at.we can find nothing in the delegation clause upon which to conclude that it lacks mutuality or is otherwise unreasonably favorable to lucky chances.
tiri argues at length that various provisions of the arbitration agreement are substantively unconscionable,but her arguments are not specific to the delegation clause as required under rent a center.rent a center,supra,at.for example,she argues that the agreement confidentiality clause is substantively unconscionable because it could give lucky chances an advantage on her underlying claims for wrongful discharge by preventing her from contacting other employees and accessing information that is available to lucky chances.davis myers cir,davis.but she does not assert and demonstrate that the confidentiality clause as applied to the delegation clause renders that clause unconscionable by impeding her ability to arbitrate whether the arbitration agreement as a whole is unconscionable.rent a center,supra,at.
we are mindful that two decisions from this district,ontiveros and murphy,declined to enforce delegation clauses in employment arbitration contracts of adhesion on unconscionability grounds even though,like the delegation clause here,the clauses were explicit and clear.ontiveros,supra,th murphy,supra,th.but these holdings have been undermined by the more recent united states supreme court decisions in rent a center and at t mobility llc concepcion.concepcion.rent a center held that delegation clauses are valid absent a challenge specific to the del
