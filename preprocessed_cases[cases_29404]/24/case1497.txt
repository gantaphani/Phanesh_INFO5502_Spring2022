the big valley band of pomo indians tribe operates a casino.five casino employees employees who had been terminated from employment sued the tribe for breach of contract,alleging it failed to provide adequate severance pay.the tribe enjoys sovereign immunity from a breach of contract suit.that enjoyment is not undermined by the presence of an arbitration clause in its contracts.the trial court is directed to sustain the tribe demurrer.
factual and procedural background 
the federally recognized pomo indian tribe owns and operates the konocti vista casino.gregory sexton was hired as general manager of the casino pursuant to a written employment contract signed by the tribal chairman.under the contract,if sexton were terminated without cause he would be entitled to severance pay equal to four months compensation.the contract also contains an arbitration clause providing that all disputes arising out of the contract or for its breach shall be submitted to arbitration.
sexton allegedly signed employment contracts with the other plaintiffs on behalf of the tribe.the contracts contain the same arbitration and termination provisions that appear in sexton agreement,and also include severance pay provisions.the complaint alleges each employment contract was ratified and approved by the tribe.
the employees were allegedly dismissed without cause and given two weeks severance pay.the employees demanded the additional severance pay provided in their contracts and threatened to initiate arbitration proceedings if payment was not made.the tribe did not respond.the employees then sent formal demand letters threatening legal action if payment was not forthcoming within days.the tribe neither responded nor paid.
employees sued for breach of contract.they urged that the tribe waived its sovereign immunity from suit by including arbitration clauses in each contract,and further,that the tribe impliedly waived the arbitration requirement by failing to respond to their arbitration demands.
the tribe demurred,claiming the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the tribe had not waived its sovereign immunity.more specifically,regarding the contracts sexton signed as general manager,the tribe contended that judicially noticeable facts conclusively demonstrated the contracts were not ratified by the tribe and thus did not waive the tribe immunity.the tribe also argued that,to the extent it had waived immunity,a breach of contract cause of action falls outside the scope of the waiver,which is limited to actions to compel arbitration or to seek entry of a judgment on an arbitration award.
employees opposed the demurrer,contending the court must disregard the evidentiary material the tribe sought to introduce by way of requests for judicial notice and must assume that all facts alleged in the complaint are true for purposes of the demurrer.employees relied on the united states supreme court opinion in c l enterprises,citizen band potawatomi tribe of,d c l enterprises,and a decision of division one of this court,smith hopland band of pomo indians th,d smith.
the court overruled the demurrer,citing to smith,supra,th,d.it did not rule on the tribe request for judicial notice.
the tribe sought a writ of mandate prohibition here and sought a stay of the action below.we granted a stay,requested opposition,and subsequently issued an order to show cause.
while this matter was pending,sexton and the tribe settled their dispute and a voluntary dismissal was entered.accordingly,we dismissed the petition as to sexton.
discussion 
propriety and scope of review.
ordinarily a demurrer ruling is nonappealable and is reviewed following a judgment after trial.county of santa barbara superior court,supra,d at.writ review of demurrer rulings is rarely granted unless a significant issue of law is raised or resolution of the issue would result in a final disposition as to the petitioner.see casterson superior court th,d.
tribal sovereign immunity confers not just immunity from liability,but immunity from suit.santa clara pueblo martinez,d great western casinos,morongo band of mission indians th,d great western casinos.an immunity defense is effectively lost if an immune party is forced to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation.mitchell forsyth,d.tribal sovereign immunity would be rendered meaningless if a suit against a tribe asserting its immunity were allowed to proceed to trial.tamiami partners miccosukee tribe of indians cir,tamiami partners.thus,interlocutory writ review is appropriate here.
the standard of review for an order overruling a demurrer is de novo.the reviewing court accepts as true all facts properly pleaded in the complaint in order to determine whether the demurrer should be overruled.citation.casterson superior court,supra,th at,d.we must also consider matters that are properly the subject of judicial notice.schifando city of los angeles cal th,d.it is well settled that evidentiary matters outside the complaint may not be considered upon such a review.yamaha motor paseman d,fn.
however,several california courts have adopted the federal reasoning that,when faced with a conflict over a sovereign immunity waiver,it is necessary and appropriate to go beyond the pleadings and contract language to consider the testimonial and documentary evidence.great western casinos,supra,th at,d,citing jungquist sheikh sultan bin khalifa al nahyan,see also smith,supra,th at,fn,d.in great western casinos and smith,the courts considered additional evidence in assessing an immunity defense.the moving parties there had characterized their request for relief,at least in the alternative,as a motion to dismiss.great western casinos,supra,th at,d smith,supra,th at,fn,d see also code civ,subd.a.this characterization is critical.in both great western casinos and smith,the courts emphasized it would not be proper to consider evidence outside the complaint if the defendants had simply demurred 
here,the tribe styled its motion solely as a demurrer.instead of submitting evidence to the trial court,affording their opponents an opportunity to challenge that evidence and to present their own,the tribe relied upon requests for judicial notice.as discussed below,these requests were in many cases improper and would have introduced evidentiary matters beyond the complaint.
under these circumstances,we decline to construe the tribe demurrer as a motion to dismiss or to consider matters outside the complaint,except as to those matters properly subject to judicial notice.to hold otherwise would be fundamentally unfair to the employees,who responded to the tribe demurrer subject to the rules governing such motions.
the complaint adequately alleges the tribe waived its sovereign immunity.
as a matter of federal law,an indian tribe is subject to suit only where congress has authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its immunity.citations.kiowa tribe of manufacturing technologies,d.this immunity extends to a tribe commercial activities.id.at.
when a tribe consents to arbitration it makes a limited waiver of its sovereign immunity.see c l enterprises,supra,at.a waiver is ineffective if the person purportedly waiving immunity lacks authority to do so.superior court th,d.however,an otherwise ineffective waiver may become binding if it is later ratified by the tribe governing body.see smith,supra,th at,d.
in the complaint,employees allege the tribe ratified each employment contract at issue.the tribe disputes the allegation,contending it is belied by judicially noticeable facts.the tribe relies on the principle that,although facts alleged in a complaint are generally deemed to be true on demurrer,the court will not close its eyes to situations where a complaint contains allegations contrary to facts which are judicially noticed.citations.del webb structural materials d.
the general principle is unavailing here,however,because the facts offered to contradict key allegations are not properly the subject of judicial notice.in del webb structural materials,supra,on which the tribe relies,the court held it may be appropriate for a court to take judicial notice of a plaintiffs affidavits and
