phillip hill sued ricoh americas corporation in the united states district court for the district of kansas,alleging that he was terminated from his position at ricoh in violation of the act sox,see,and kansas common law prohibiting retaliatory discharge five months after suit was filed,ricoh moved to stay the case and compel arbitration under the arbitration clause in its employment agreement with hill.the district court denied the motion on the ground that ricoh delay in demanding arbitration after engaging in the judicial proceedings had constituted a waiver of its right to arbitrate.ricoh appeals.we have jurisdiction under a permitting immediate appeal of denial of motions to compel arbitration and to stay proceedings pending arbitration.we reverse the district court order,and remand with instructions to grant ricoh motion to compel arbitration.
background 
on september,hill and lanier worldwide,which later merged into ricoh executed an employment agreement the employment agreement.an arbitration clause in the agreement was separately initialed by both parties there is no dispute that ricoh assumed lanier rights and duties under the employment agreement.when lanier merged into ricoh,hill and ricoh entered into a retention bonus agreement on march.under that agreement,which contained no arbitration provision,hill was to be paid a bonus if he maintained his employment with ricoh through september,and satisfied other specified conditions.
ricoh terminated hill on october.on december he filed a complaint with the occupational safety and health administration osha,alleging that he had been fired in retaliation for reporting evidence of fraud.osha dismissed the action.although ruling that hill had engaged in activities that were protected under sox and that ricoh had known of the activities,it found that the activities had not been a factor in his termination.
on november,hill filed suit alleging that his termination violated sox and kansas common law.ricoh answered on december.the court set trial for march,and set summer deadlines for completion of alternate dispute resolution adr and completion of discovery.on april,a week after hill had provided ricoh with his initial disclosures under.a and had served ricoh with his first request for production,ricoh moved to stay the case and compel arbitration.
hill responded that arbitration was inappropriate on several grounds,including the employment agreement had been superseded by the retention bonus agreement,the arbitration clause did not guarantee that his rights under sox would be vindicated in arbitration,and ricoh had waived its right to arbitrate by its conduct in the dispute,including its failure to raise arbitration as an affirmative defense in its answer.the district court rejected hill supersession argument but ruled that ricoh had waived its right to arbitration.it did not address hill sox argument.
on appeal ricoh argues that the district court erred in holding that it had waived its right to arbitrate.hill contends that the district court waiver decision was correct and alternatively he argues that the court decision can be affirmed on the following grounds that ricoh waived its right to arbitration by failing to raise the issue as an affirmative defense,as required by.c that the employment agreement was superseded by the retention bonus agreement and that arbitration may not vindicate his rights under sox.after some preliminary remarks on the federal arbitration act,we address waiver and then turn to hill supersession and sox arguments.
ii.discussion 
a.the federal arbitration act faa 
the faa provides that contractual agreements to arbitrate disputes shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.the purpose of the act is to place an arbitration agreement upon the same footing as other contracts and to overturn the judiciary longstanding refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate.glass kidder peabody,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the faa is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.section of the act,obliges courts to stay litigation on matters that the parties have agreed to arbitrate and section,authorizes a federal district court to compel arbitration when it would have jurisdiction over a suit on the underlying dispute.see generally moses cone,at discussing scope and operation of faa.
the district court ruled that ricoh had waived its right to arbitration by its delay in demanding arbitration until after it had participated in the court litigation for several months.hill argues that we should affirm this ruling,and alternatively he argues that ricoh waived its right to arbitration by not raising that claimed right in its answer to the complaint.we quickly dispose of this alternative argument and then address the district court ruling.
failure to raise arbitration in answer 
hill contends that ricoh forfeited its right to demand arbitration by not asserting that right as an affirmative defense in its answer to his complaint.he relies on.c,which states in responding to a pleading,a party must affirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense,including arbitration and award.
hill argument is based on a misunderstanding of the term arbitration and award.the defense set forth in rule c is not that the claim should be arbitrated rather than adjudicated in court it is that the claim has already been resolved by an award in arbitration.see forms,am.standard,party seeking arbitration did not waive its right to arbitrate by not raising it as a defense in its answer,aff,cir unpublished table decision mapes chevron usa prods.a div.of chevron,d,same lee grandcor med,same charles wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure at ed provision in rule c applies only if the dispute has already been resolved by an arbitration and award.thus,ricoh was not required by rule c to demand arbitration in its answer.
waiver by delay in demanding arbitration 
we now address the ground on which the district court denied ricoh motion to compel arbitration.hill argues that ricoh waived its right to arbitration by participating in the court litigation for several months after answering the complaint.the historical facts are not disputed.therefore we review de novo the district court denial of ricoh motion,applying the same legal standard that the district court should apply.see midamerica fed.sav.loan ass.express,cir.we summarize the events in the litigation,then turn to the governing law,and conclude with our application of the law to the facts before us.
court proceedings 
hill filed suit on november.ricoh answered on december.on january,a magistrate judge set a scheduling conference for march,and ordered the following 
pursuant to.f,no later than march,the parties,in person through counsel,shall confer to discuss the nature and basis of their claims and defenses,to discuss the use of mediation or other methods of alternative dispute resolution adr,to develop a proposed discovery plan,and to make or arrange for the disclosures required by.a.
aplee.at initial order regarding planning and scheduling at,hill ricoh.on march the court issued a scheduling order setting the deadline for completion of adr at june,the deadline for completion of discovery at september,and the trial for march.the order also instructed each party to make a effort to settle and to provide the court by april,with a report summarizing the party settlement efforts.
on march,hill served a request for production of documents and both parties served their initial disclosures under.a.a week later,on april,ricoh moved to stay the case and compel arbitration.the district court denied the motions.
waiver of arbitration in general 
this circuit leading opinion on waiver of the right to arbitrate is reid burton construction,carpenters district council of southern colorado,cir.on a prior appeal in that case,we had held that a party,because of conduct before the court,may be deemed to be prevented on the basis of some equitable principle from asserting a right to arbitration,reid burton,carpenters dist.council of,cir and we had remanded to the district court to determine whether the carpenters district council the union had waived its arbitration rights.the district court found waiver and the union appealed.affirming the decision below,we stated that the right to arbitration,like any other contract right,can be waived.reid burton,at.but,we continued,t here is no set rule as to what constitutes a waiver or abandonment of the arbitration agreement the question depends upon the facts of each case id.we noted several factors useful in making the assessment.these were later summarized as follows in peterson express,cir 
whether the party actions are inconsistent with the right to arbitrate whether the litigation machinery has been substantially invoked and the parties were well into preparation of a lawsuit before the party notified the opposing party of an intent to arbitrate whether a party either requested arbitration enforcement close to the trial date or delayed for a long period before seeking a stay whether a defendant seeking arbitration filed a counterclaim without asking for a stay of the proceedings whether important intervening steps,taking advantage of judicial discovery procedures not available in arbitration had taken place and whether the delay affected,misled,or prejudiced the opposing party.
quoting reid burton,at brackets in original.of course,our listing these we will call the peterson not intended to suggest a mechanical process in which each factor is assessed and the side with the greater number of favorable factors prevails.nor were we even suggesting that the list of factors is exclusive.rather,these factors reflect certain principles that should guide courts in determining whether it is appropriate to deem that a party has waived its right to demand arbitration.a review of those principles will assist in resolving this case.
to begin with,a party should not be permitted to demand arbitration when it has previously waived its right to arbitrate in the narrow sense of waiver typically used in the context,where a waiver is an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.united states olano,d internal quotation marks omitted.a party conduct may evince such an intentional relinquishment.consider the facts alleged in brown dillard,cir.after dillard fired brown,she filed a notice of intent to arbitrate a claim and paid her share of the filing fee.dillard did not reply to multiple requests from the american arbitration association aaa for information.see id.at.for more than two months brown attempted to contact dillard about its silence but dillard refused to arbitrate.brown then filed suit in court,at which point dillard moved to compel arbitration.see id.at.in our view,one could reasonably conclude that dillard had waived its right to arbitrate in the narrow sense of waiver.expressing this in terms of the first peterson factor,dillard actions were so inconsistent with the right to arbitrate,peterson,at,that they showed that it had intentionally relinquished its contractual right to arbitration.peterson factor filing a counterclaim without seeking a stay for also indicate an intentional relinquishment of the right to arbitration.
but reid burton and peterson hardly limit the concept of waiver to intentional relinquishment of a known right.indeed,reid burton affirmed the determination of waiver in that case even though the district court had explicitly stated that it could not tell whether the conduct at issue was intentional or negligent.see reid burton,at.
an important consideration in assessing waiver is whether the party now seeking arbitration is improperly manipulating the judicial process.an instructive example is hooper advance america,cash advance centers of missouri,cir,which concerned agreements containing mandatory arbitration clauses.the plaintiffs complaint included one count asking the court to declare the arbitration clauses invalid because they were unconscionable and six counts challenging advance america various lending practices.advance america moved to dismiss the complaint on several grounds.see id.in the last sentence of its brief,advance america purported to reserve the right to enforce the arbitration clauses in plaintiffs loan agreements,if the court denied its motion to dismiss.id.after the district court rejected the motion to dismiss with respect to five of the counts,advance america moved to stay the case and compel arbitration.see id.at.the district court dismissed the motion,and advance america appealed.noting that advance america,in seeking a decision on the merits on each count,had sought an immediate and total victory in the parties dispute,the eighth circuit said that advance america wanted to see how the case was going in federal district court before deciding whether it would be better off there or in arbitration.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.it agreed with the district court that want ing to play heads i win,tails you lose is the worst possible reason for a party failing to move for arbitration sooner than it did.id.thus,although advance america had not intentionally relinquished its right to arbitration,to send the case to arbitration would allow manipulation of the judicial process.
khan parsons global services,is a similar case.in response to khan complaint,parsons filed a single motion to dismiss or,alternatively,for summary judgment or to compel arbitration.id.at.the district court granted summary judgment,and the circuit reversed.see id.on return to the district court parsons successfully moved to compel arbitration.see id.the circuit again reversed.it stated that a summary judgment motion by its nature goes to the merits of the case,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,and that parsons thus had made a conscious decision to have the substance of the khans claims decided by a court,id.at ellipses,brackets,and internal quotation marks omitted.the appellate court did not wish to encourage parties to attempt repeat litigation of merits issues not resolved to their satisfaction,undermining the policy that arbitration may not be used as a strategy to manipulate the legal process.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
a court may look to several of the peterson factors in finding waiver on the ground that ordering arbitration would permit a party to manipulate the judicial example,by allowing it to take a mulligan if the court proceeding is progressing unfavorably or by allowing it to use the courts to obtain discovery unavailable in arbitration.evidence of manipulation could include a delay in suggesting arbitration until substantial discovery has been completed which may be considered under peterson factors and or until the eve of trial factor.
another important consideration is maintenance of the combined efficiency of the public and private systems.see menorah ins,inx reinsurance,cir n either efficiency nor economy would be served by allowing party to invoke its right to arbitrate after refusing to arbitrate,permitting default judgment to be rendered against it in a foreign jurisdiction,and invoking its arbitration agreement only when judgment holder sought judicial enforcement of the foreign judgment cabinetree of,kraftmaid cabinetry,cir selection of a forum in which to resolve a legal dispute should be made at the earliest possible opportunity in order to economize on the resources,both public and private,consumed in dispute resolution.three of the peterson factors substantial progress in the litigation,an imminent trial,and substantial use of discovery be significant in deciding whether the court should find waiver because of the inefficiencies that would result from ordering arbitration.
the final consideration in waiver analysis is prejudice to the party opposing sixth peterson factor.see peterson,at.other circuits agree on the importance of showing prejudice as an element of waiver.see,brown,at t he delay and costs incurred by brown are prejudicial for the purpose of waiver analysis.assocs.computer assocs,cir t he contractual right to arbitration has been waived because of the prejudice the opposing parties have suffered as a result of the defendants delay in seeking arbitration.stone hutton,cir,party waived right to arbitrate because s ignificant prejudice to plaintiff legal position may be inferred from the extent of discovery conducted in this case see also ian macneil,richard speidel,thomas stipanowich,federal arbitration law agreements,awards,and remedies under the federal arbitration act at describing prejudice as the key to waiver.
the burden of persuasion lies with the party claiming that the right to demand arbitration has been waived.see peterson,at a party asserting a waiver of arbitration has a heavy burden of proof.and in assessing whether that burden has been met,we give substantial weight to the strong federal policy encouraging the expeditious and inexpensive resolution of disputes through arbitration.metz merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir see moses cone,at questions of arbitrability must be addressed with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration.
application to this case 
assessing the specifics of the case before us,we hold that there was no waiver.true,ricoh did not demand arbitration until four months after answering the complaint.but that length of time in itself does not establish waiver.this circuit has no published opinion ruling that there was waiver because of the delay in making a demand for arbitration when the delay was four months or less after the answer.metz,at defendant moved to compel arbitration three weeks after complaint was filed,but it waived the right to arbitrate certain claims by its later conduct in the litigation.other circuits have held that there was no waiver despite delays of four months or more after answering the complaint.see,patten grading paving,skanska usa,cir delay delay after party learned of arbitration agreement j s const,travelers indem,cir delay after suit filed.
the critical question is what was happening in this litigation during the four months between the answer to the complaint and the demand for arbitration.the answer is,very little.the most important activity shown by the record was the magistrate judge setting the schedule for the litigation.when ricoh requested an order compelling arbitration,the trial was not to take place for another months,discovery could continue for another months,and the deadline for completing adr was still more than two months ahead.the only discovery that had been initiated consisted of hill request for production of documents and the parties disclosures under rule a hill asserts that he disclosed his witnesses,exhibits,and itemization of damages both hill request and his disclosure were only a week before ricoh demand.
hill has failed to show any substantial prejudice from ricoh delay in seeking arbitration.to be sure,he may benefit from timely resolution of his claims,and arbitration proceedings could have begun four months earlier if ricoh had requested arbitration when it answered the complaint.but one would expect and hill has not suggested otherwise that the dispute would still have been resolved in arbitration before the date set for trial had hill not opposed arbitration.nor has he shown that he has been burdened by discovery significantly more than he would have been if the dispute had gone to arbitration at the outset.we note that the arbitration rules applicable at the time of ricoh demand would allow the arbitrator to order discovery.see aaa,employment arbitration rules and mediation procedures,rule the arbitrator shall have the authority to order such discovery,by way of deposition,interrogatory,document production,or otherwise,as the arbitrator considers necessary to a full and fair exploration of the issues in dispute,consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration.and those rules also require the parties to attend an arbitration management conference at which they must consider the exchange of stipulations and declarations regarding facts,exhibits,witnesses,and other issues.id.rule e.hill has not satisfied his burden to show that the contents of his initial disclosures under rule would not likewise have to be disclosed in arbitration proceedings.
in patten grading,at,the fourth circuit held that there had been no waiver despite more discovery than occurred in this case.the parties exchanged written discovery,including interrogatories and requests for production of documents.id.at.they also participated in mediation.patten then received permission to add another claim,and discovery was reopened for another month.only at that point did the opposing party,skanska,move to stay the proceedings and compel arbitration.see id.the fourth circuit characterized the conduct of discovery as minimal and noted that there was no evidence that such discovery was unavailable in arbitration,or that skanska had gained a strategic advantage through its discovery requests.id.at.see also williams cigna fin.advisors,cir the parties had exchanged rule discovery gabriel wilner,domke on commercial arbitration at ed conducting discovery prior to seeking to compel arbitration does not constitute prejudice where the documents produced by discovery are also discoverable in arbitration 
we recognize that the prior conduct of discovery was a factor in finding waiver in our decision in midamerica but discovery had actually been completed and a number of other factors including completion of one trial also supported waiver.see midamerica,at.
the minimal litigation activity before ricoh demanded arbitration also compels the conclusion that granting ricoh demand would lead to minimal inefficiency from duplication of effort in court and in arbitration and would not result in any improper manipulation of the judicial process by ricoh.and there is no evidence in the record that ricoh intentionally and knowingly relinquished its right to demand arbitration.
thus,the circumstances of this case,particularly in light of the federal policy favoring arbitration,convince us that the district court should not have found waiver and should have ordered arbitration and stayed judicial proceedings.
supersession by retention bonus agreement 
hill first argument for affirmance other than waiver is that the arbitration provision in the employment agreement is not enforceable because that agreement was superseded by the retention bonus agreement,which has no arbitration provision although the faa strongly favors enforcement of agreements to arbitrate,a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which it has not agreed so to submit.united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf navigavtion,d.whether there is an enforceable contract to arbitrate is a matter of contract law to be decided by the court.see howsam dean witter reynolds,d.state law governs.see first options of chicago,kaplan,d when deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter,courts generally should apply ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts.perry thomas,d.the district court and the parties have relied on kansas law in addressing the issues before us and we have no reason to believe that any other state law is applicable.see mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,d.
under kansas law a written contract may be varied,modified,waived,annulled,or wholly set aside by any subsequent executed contract.owens city of bartlett,labette county.if two successive contracts are in conflict,the later supersedes the earlier one.see fleetwood,coleman,d.the parties do not dispute the historical facts.therefore,we review de novo the district court decision that the retention bonus agreement did not supersede the employment agreement.see isaac temex energy,in re amarex,cir.
in our view,the arbitration clause of the employment agreement survived the execution of the retention bonus agreement on march.the retention bonus agreement had a limited encourage lanier employees to remain with ricoh during a transition period.it was not a transition employment agreement,but a supplement to the already effective employment agreement.a comparison of the terms of the two agreements makes this clear.
the retention bonus agreement required hill to remain with ricoh until sep
