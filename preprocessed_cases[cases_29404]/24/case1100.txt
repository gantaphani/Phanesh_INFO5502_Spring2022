this appeal arises in the context of class action securities litigation,settlements,and bar orders.
facts and procedural background 
just for feet jff,a shoe retailer,sold million in corporate notes the notes on april.jff had recently borrowed million,and the offering was intended to reduce that debt.soon,however,jff began reporting very poor financial news.on november,it filed for bankruptcy protection.
two purchasers of the notes,aal high yield bond fund and delaware delchester fund plaintiffs or,filed a class action suit against haines and ruttenberg,officers of jff the officers banc of america securities,the underwriter of the note offering bas and deloitte touche,jff independent outside auditor deloitte plaintiffs declined to name jff as a defendant because it had filed for bankruptcy protection.plaintiffs alleged four violations of federal securities law and one violation of alabama law 
plaintiffs and the officers agreed to settle on may,the district court preliminarily approved the settlement,and after hearing and overruling the objections to the settlement discussed immediately below,it entered an order certifying the class and approving the settlement.
blue ridge investments,atlantic equity collectively,the objectors,and defendant bas objected to the proposed settlement,arguing they should have been included in the plaintiff class.each had purchased notes,albeit not in the initial note offering,and collectively possess of the total notes.allege that bas and the objectors only purchased notes as part of a mitigation effort when jff began to falter.bas and the objectors have the same corporate parent,bank of america and,again,bas underwrote the note offering.
the district court excluded from the class any underwriter who participated in the jff notes offering and divisions,affiliates,and subsidiaries of jff,defendant deloitte touche llp deloitte,defendant banc of america securities.thus,bas was excluded from the plaintiff class by name and as an underwriter of the notes offering.the objectors were excluded because they are affiliates of bas.
this case contains some curious wrinkles.despite having underwritten the note offering and being a defendant in this litigation,bas argued to the district court that it should have been included in the plaintiff class because it was a purchaser of notes.it has declined to renew that argument on appeal,and the argument is deemed abandoned as to bas.the objectors,in contrast,persist on appeal in attempting to join the plaintiff class despite being affiliates of defendant bas,sharing counsel with bas,and referring to themselves and bas as a single entity at least once in court submissions.the objectors argue that the district court overruled their objections to the class settlement on clearly erroneous grounds because it believed they were subsidiaries of defendant bas when,in fact,the objectors and bas are all subsidiaries of a fourth corporation,bank of america.
additionally,bas and deloitte appeal a provision in the final judgment and order of dismissal with prejudice approving the officers settlement which bars all present and future claims by deloitte and bas against the officers and others.
this appeal presents two issues the objectors present the issue of whether the objectors,who were excluded from the class before certification and settlement,may appeal the denial of their objections to the certification and settlement without first moving to intervene in the action and bas and deloitte present the issue of whether the bar order in the settlement agreement is impermissibly broad.
we hold that the objectors,nonparties,are not permitted to appeal,and we vacate and remand the bar order.
discussion 
are the objectors parties for the purposes of this appeal 
argue that the objectors may not appeal the settlement because they are not class members and have not moved to intervene.we agree.because the objectors are not a party to this action and have not moved to intervene,we can not not hear their appeal.
the rule that only parties to a lawsuit,or those that properly become parties,may appeal an adverse judgment,is well settled.marino ortiz,d.the objectors here are not parties.thus,they could only appeal the denial of their objections to the class settlement if they had intervened in the action the objectors argue that the supreme court recent decision in devlin scardelletti,d,requires a different result.we disagree.
devlin held that nonnamed members of class actions who have timely objected to a class settlement may appeal the denial of their objections without first moving to intervene.id.at.at.the supreme court framed the issue not as a jurisdictional question but rather as a matter of determining whether the class member qualified as a party for purposes of fed.c.id.citing marino,at.at.nonnamed class members who timely object to binding settlements qualify as parties,the court held,primarily because they are bound by the judgments they seek to challenge 
what is most important to this case is that nonnamed class members are parties to the proceedings in the sense of being bound by the settlement particularly in light of the fact that petitioner had no ability to opt out of the settlement,appealing the approval of the settlement is petitioner only means of protecting himself from being bound by a disposition of his rights he finds unacceptable and that a reviewing court might find legally inadequate.
id.at.at citation omitted see also id.at.at the district court approval of the binds petitioner as a member of the to a final decision of petitioner right or claim sufficient to trigger his right to appeal.
the objectors first argue that devlin permits their appeal because they could have or should have been included in the plaintiff class the argument misses the point of devlin,which was to allow appeals by parties who are actually bound by a judgment,not parties who merely could have been bound by the judgment id.at.persons who are not class members are not bound at all.
second,the objectors argue that they are effectively bound by the judgment because it leaves the defendant officers.that,the objectors argue,renders their own claims futile.for support,the objectors cite karaha bodas perusahaan pertambangan minyak dan gas bumi negara,cir,and plain murphy family farms,cir.
neither case helps the objectors because each considered very different facts.in karaha bodas,the republic of indonesia was permitted to appeal a judgment that allowed someone to execute against property that the republic of indonesia alleged it owned.at.in plain,a decedent heirs were permitted to appeal the division of damages from the wrongful death action resulting from decedent death,in which the decedent estate representative litigated on behalf of the heirs as well as herself.at in each case,a nonnamed party appealed a binding judgment disposing of property to which the nonnamed party had a putative legal right.it is perhaps no accident that in each case the nonnamed party likely met the requirements for intervention as of right under.a the supreme court hinted in devlin that those instances may be precisely where the appellate courts should consider allowing nonnamed parties to appeal.see at.at noting that it is difficult to see the value of requiring nonnamed objecting class members to intervene because they would easily meet the requirements of.a anyway no such circumstances exist here.the objectors do not seek to protect their own property,their allotment from an award or settlement,or any other cognizable legal right or interest.they are simply potential plaintiffs who have yet to litigate any claims.brennan city bd.of,cir stating that to intervene as of right under.a,a nonparty must have a direct,substantial,and legally protectable interest in the action rather than a merely speculative or contingent interest.
because the objectors would not qualify as parties even under the most permissive possible reading of devlin,we decline to determine whether and when devlin may apply outside of the mandatory class action context or to pass judgment on karaha bodas and plain.there is no reason to permit the objectors to di
