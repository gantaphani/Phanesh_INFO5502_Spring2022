on may,all the shareholders in the corporation entered into a shareholders agreement the agreement.the agreement provides for general restrictions on share transfers,a right of first refusal for shareholders,and the redemption of each shareholder stock upon termination of that person employment with the corporation or upon that person death.the agreement also includes a very broad arbitration clause that provides,

at.the agreement further provides that it supersedes any and all prior agreements that pertain to its subject matter.at.
long claims that the shareholders threatened to terminate his employment if he did not sign the agreement,and that on may,silver sent long a letter informing him that if long signed the agreement,silver would maintain long as an employee until he reached the age of.despite this promise,approximately six months after long signed the agreement,silver fired long.
on january,long filed this civil action in the general court of justice for the state of north carolina,superior court division alleging nine claims arising from his shareholder and employment relationship with the corporation frustration of reasonable expectation breach of fiduciary duties breach of contract failure to distribute profits proportionately fraud civil conspiracy unfair and deceptive trade practices punitive damages and a shareholder derivative action.specifically,long alleged that silver diverted funds properly belonging to the corporation for silver personal use and that the other shareholders,who became shareholders in,breached their fiduciary duties to the corporation and to long by contributing to silver schemes to divert funds.
on february,regency removed the action to the united states district court for the western district of north carolina pursuant to diversity jurisdiction under west supp.on march,regency moved to stay the litigation and to compel arbitration based upon the arbitration clauses in the and agreements.on april,the magistrate judge entered an order denying regency motion.on may,regency filed a notice of appeal with this court.
before turning to the merits of regency appeal,we first must determine whether diversity jurisdiction is proper although the magistrate judge noted that removal appears to be proper,and jurisdiction has not been challenged by long,at,long alleges in his complaint that regency home fashions principal place of business is north carolina.if this assertion is true,we are bound to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because long also is a citizen of north carolina.see c providing that a corporation is a citizen of any state by which it has been incorporated and of the state where it has its principal place of business.
in mullins beatrice pocahontas,cir per curiam,we noted that two divergent approaches exist for purposes of ascertaining the principal place of business of a corporation under c.one approach makes the home office,or place where the corporation officers direct,control,and coordinate its activities,determinative.the other looks to the place where the bulk of corporate activity takes place.see id.at internal quotation marks omitted see also peterson cooley,cir noting that we have adopted neither test to the exclusion of the other.
the facts that are determinative of the corporation principal place of business are not in dispute.regency home fashion corporate headquarters,sales,and financial offices are located in new york.in addition,the corporation president,ceo,and other top officers are all residents of new york.it has one manufacturing plant in north carolina.the corporation has no other presence in north carolina.
regardless of whether the nerve center or the place of operations test applies,we hold that regency home fashions principal place of business is new york because the undisputed facts establish that the bulk of the corporate activity takes place in new york and that the corporation home office is located in new york.see peterson,at noting that when a corporation has multiple centers of manufacturing,purchasing,or sales,we focus on the place where the bulk of corporate activity takes place as opposed to the corporation home office internal quotation marks omitted.
we note that the nature of a corporation presence in a particular state is determined on a case by case basis.see athena automotive,digregorio,cir.long,however,has declined to present any factors to the district court or to this court that support a finding that the bulk of regency home fashions activities takes place in north carolina rather than in new york.indeed,when questioned at oral argument,counsel for long represented that long never intended to argue that diversity jurisdiction was improper absent some other factors pointing to the substantial character of the corporation activities in north carolina,the fact that one manufacturing facility is located in north carolina does not detract from our finding that the bulk of the corporation activities takes place in new york,in which all of the corporation financial and sales offices are located,as well as its headquarters and chief officers.accordingly,we find no basis in the record to conclude that north carolina,rather than new york,is regency home fashions principal place of business.thus,diversity jurisdiction is proper.
turning to the merits,regency contends that the magistrate judge erred by denying its motion to compel arbitration and to stay proceedings pending arbitration.we review de novo the magistrate judge conclusions regarding the arbitrability of the disputes between regency and long.see united states bankers ins,cir.although we have previously articulated the governing standard for resolving the arbitrability of disputes,see american recovery computerized thermal imaging,cir,the magistrate judge ignored this controlling precedent and instead applied a legal standard that has been rejected by this circuit.after reviewing the arbitrability of long claims under the proper legal standard,we find that each of regency claims falls within the scope of the arbitration clauses of the and agreements.
the federal arbitration act applies to contracts evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract.west.the parties do not dispute that the faa applies to the arbitration clauses contained in the and agreements.the supreme court has announced its healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration and has explained that the federal arbitration act establishes that,as a matter of federal law,any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver,delay,or a like defense to arbitrability.moses cone memorial hosp.mercury constr,d.to that end,the heavy presumption of arbitrability requires that when the scope of the arbitration clause is open to question,a court must decide the question in favor of arbitration.peoples sec.life ins.monumental life ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.thus,we may not deny a party request to arbitrate an issue unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.united steelworkers of america warrior gulf navigation,d.having established our principles for review,we turn to regency arguments.
regency first argues that the magistrate judge erred by failing to apply the proper legal standard to determine the arbitrability of long claims against regency.in american recovery,we held that a arbitration clause applies to disputes that do not arise under the governing contract when a significant relationship exists between the asserted claims and the contract in which the arbitration clause is contained.see american recovery,at.the arbitration clauses contained in the and agreements are worded in the same broad manner as the arbitration clause at issue in american recovery.see id.holding that an arbitration clause that provided arbitration for any dispute that ar ose out of or related to the agreement was a broad clause,capable of expansive reach.the agreement states that it applies to a ny and all disputes arising out of or in connection with this agreement.at.similarly,the agreement states that it applies to any dispute arising out of or relating to this agreement.at prima paint flood conklin,d labeling as broad a clause that required arbitration of a ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement ryan sons,rhone poulenc textile,cir declaring that the scope of a clause providing for the arbitration of a ll disputes arising in connection with a contract was identical to that of a clause providing for the arbitrability of disputes that may arise out of or in relation to an agreement and construing the arbitration clause to encompass a broad scope of arbitrable issues.thus,the governing standard for determining the arbitrability of long claim is whether long claims have a significant relationship to the or agreements.
instead of applying the significant relationship test articulated in american recovery,the magistrate judge relied upon cases decided under the standard enunciated in mediterranean enterprises ssangyong corporation,cir,despite our explicit,unambiguous rejection of mediterranean enterprises in american recovery when dealing with a arbitration clause similar to those in the and agreements.see american recovery,at we agree with cti that the standard in mediterranean enterprises was an improper foundation for the district court decision.the magistrate judge further concluded that the and agreements were narrow in scope,indicating that the parties could not have possibly intended to bind themselves to arbitration of the claims raised.at.as we noted in american recovery,however,although the intention of the parties is relevant,the intentions of parties to an arbitration agreement are generously construed in favor of arbitrability.see american recovery,at.here,as in american recovery,the parties explicitly agreed on arbitration clauses that by their plain language ha ve a broad scope.see id.thus,it is not inconsistent with the intentions of the parties to give the arbitration clauses broad effect.see id.accordingly,we agree with regency that the magistrate judge erred by refusing to apply american recovery to determine the arbitrability of long claims.
applying american recovery significant relationship test and bearing in mind the strong federal policy favoring arbitration,we examine each of long claims seriatim 
in his first claim against regency,long contends that regency shareholders frustrated his reasonable expectations as a shareholder and an employee of the corporation.in his complaint,long bases his frustration of reasonable expectations claim on three types of expectations an expectation of continued employment an expectation of meaningful participation in the management and affairs of the corporation and an expectation of a reasonable payout for his shares.
we agree with regency that all of long expectations derive from the and agreements thus,long frustration of reasonable expectations claim is significantly related to both agreements and is arbitrable.long expectation of continued employment for so long as long was a shareholder arises directly from the agreement,which states that long would have continued employment for so long as he remained a shareholder.long expectation of meaningful participation in the management and affairs of the corporation also arises directly from the agreement,which states that long would be employed in an executive capacity during his time as a shareholder.at.finally,long expectation of a reasonable payout for his shares derives directly from the agreement,which superseded the agreement share redemption provisions.the value of long shares is based upon the redemption provisions set forth in the agreement.accordingly,proof of each aspect of long reasonable expectations claim depends on the terms and existence of the and agreements.thus,the magistrate judge erred by finding this claim not to be arbitrable.
in his second claim against regency,long argues that silver and the other shareholders breached their fiduciary duties to long as a shareholder in the corporation.long breach of fiduciary duty claim arises only by virtue of long status as a shareholder,and the agreement creates long status as a shareholder.because long would not have a valid breach of fiduciary duty claim but for the existence of the agreement creating his status as a shareholder in the corporation,we hold that long breach of fiduciary duty claim is properly referable to arbitration.harter iowa grain,cir affirming the district court submission of a breach of fiduciary duty claim to arbitration.
long third claim is for breach of contract arising from regency termination of long.long contends that his termination breached the portion of the agreement that provides that long was entitled to continued employment for so long as he was a shareholder.because this breach of contract claim arises directly under the agreement,it is clearly arbitrable.see ryan sons,at noting that claims involving the literal terms or performance of the contract fall within the scope of even the most limited arbitration clauses.
long fourth claim is for failure to distribute profits proportionately.in support of this claim,long alleges that the corporation improperly redeemed shares from david silver and that shares were transferred between shareholders without au
