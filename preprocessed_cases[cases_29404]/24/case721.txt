the plaintiff in this racial discrimination case appeals from the grant of summary judgment to the defendant,a local of the electrical workers union.two plaintiffs are listed,but one is a sole proprietorship and the other the proprietor,so they are one,not two,in the eyes of the law with an irrelevant exception for cases in which an individual is charged under rico with using for nefarious ends an enterprise consisting of a sole proprietorship,mccullough suter,cir,and the one is the proprietor,ronald smart,not the proprietorship.troelstrup index futures group,cir bartlett heibl,cir vega national life ins.services,cir en banc.
smart,an electrical contractor who is white,hired robert thompson,who is black,to work for him as an electrician thompson was and is smart only employee.smart had not signed on to the collective bargaining agreement that the ibew local had signed with the area other electrical contractors.deciding to do so,he went to the union office and signed a letter of assent to the agreement.with him on this visit he took thompson so that the latter could join the union.at the office smart learned that the union had a program for subsidizing union contractors to enable them to compete more effectively with nonunion contractors,and he requested the application form.that was in july.by october,the union had neither furnished the form nor arranged to swear in thompson as a member of the union.smart complained to the union and thompson was sworn in but still the form did not arrive.between october and march,smart called the union officer with whom he had been dealing,jim nolen,times requesting the form and also requesting that thompson be enrolled in a union training program.he never got through to nolen and the messages he left were never returned.meanwhile in january smart union dues had been tripled,and two months later smart wrote nolen that he was terminating his relation with the union.nolen promptly called him and asked him why.smart explained that it was because of the delay in thompson swearing in and enrollment in the training program,the failure to send smart the application form for the subsidy,and the tripling of his dues.nolen said that smart dues had been raised because he was working with the tools the union charges higher dues to a union contractor who is not merely engaged in management and supervision but is actually working as an electrician.as for the enrollment of thompson in the training program,nolen said that if smart wanted the little bastard in school,he nolen would get him there.
smart was not satisfied,and so his termination as a union contractor stood.the union,however,filed a grievance against him pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement because he had failed to make required contributions to the union welfare fringe benefits fund.the grievance was arbitrated,and the arbitrators found smart guilty of of fringes as required.further,the parties are encouraged to meet as soon as possible to resolve the current delinquencies.but the arbitrators did not specify the dollar amount that he owed the union.
smart suit challenges the arbitrators award as invalid primarily because of lack of finality,and also claims that the union discriminated against him,because of his employing a black person,in violation of and title vii of the civil rights act of.smart lays great stress on the fact that thompson is also his the implication is that the union real objection to smart is not that he has a black employee,because the union has other black members,but that his daughter married one.there is,however,no evidence that this was the union real objection.
insofar as the suit challenges the arbitrators award,it is founded both on section of the act,which creates a federal judicial remedy for breach of a collective bargaining agreement,pursuant to which the award was issued,and the federal arbitration act title of the united states code,which creates federal judicial remedies for disputes arising from certain agreements to arbitrate,including collective bargaining and other employment agreements,with an irrelevant exception for employment agreements involving transportation workers.see circuit city stores,adams,d pryner tractor supply,cir.section is of course more than a jurisdictional and procedural statute the supreme court has held that it is a directive to the courts to create a federal common law of collective bargaining contracts.the federal arbitration act has no particular reference to such contracts and so if there were a conflict between the two statutes we would resolve it in favor of section.see bottling of new york,soft drink brewery workers union local,cir.where there is no conflict,however,and the faa provides a procedure or remedy not found in section but does not step on section toes,then,as in pryner,we apply the federal arbitration act.we doubt that there was such a conflict in the case either,though the court there thought there was but that doubt does have to be resolved in this case.
the act requires the court to vacate an arbitrator award,so far as bears on this case,where the arbitrators so imperfectly executed their powers that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.a.smart seems to think that this means that an arbitration award must be vacated if the award,were it a district court judgment,would be unappealable under because it was not a final judgment.that is incorrect.it is apparent from the wording of section a that it is not a jurisdictional provision.rather,it assumes that the award is properly before the court,and establishes a ground for vacating it.the purpose of the section is merely to render unenforceable an arbitration award that is either incomplete in the sense that the arbitrators did not complete their assignment though they thought they had or so badly drafted that the party against whom the award runs does know how to comply with it.ids life ins.royal alliance associates,cir conntech development university of connecticut education properties,cir michaels mariforum shipping,cir.
there can be a jurisdictional question in cases challenging or seeking enforcement of arbitration awards,for although no statute corresponding to section tells the courts when an arbitration award is ripe for judicial enforcement or review,the courts are naturally reluctant to invite a judicial proceeding every time the arbitrator sneezes.but beyond that,generalization is difficult.in ids life ins.royal alliance associates,supra,at,we expressed skepticism about the propriety of engrafting.b onto the arbitration statute and might have been understood to be implying a jurisdictional standard similar to that of section.that seems to be the position of the second circuit as well.see michaels mariforum shipping,supra,at.but an earlier panel of our court had said that a ruling on a discrete,issue may be final and ripe for confirmation even though other claims remain to be addressed by arbitrators,and this sounds rule b ish.publicis communication true north communications,cir.the first circuit is even more hospitable to what amount to interlocutory appeals of arbitral the extent of allowing review of the arbitrator liability determination before he has made an award of damages,see providence journal providence newspaper guild,cir hart surgical,ultracision,cir,which rule b does not permit,liberty mutual ins.wetzel,d mercer magnant,cir general motors new chevrolet,cir,though later we shall note a minor exception to the rule that a judgment in a case seeking damages is not final and appealable under section until the amount of the damages has been computed and incorporated into the judgment.
