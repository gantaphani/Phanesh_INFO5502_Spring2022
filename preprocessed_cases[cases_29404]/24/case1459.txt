defendants,playboy entertainment group,the group and playboy enterprises,purport to appeal from a june,order on motion to compel arbitration.defendants expressly limited their motion to compel arbitration to the question whether it was for the court or the arbitrators to decide the arbitrability of the claims of plaintiffs,vivid video,and vivid video international.defendants did not ask the trial court to decide whether any one or more of the causes of action in the complaint were subject to arbitration.defendants argued the arbitrators,not the court,were to decide any question of arbitrability.in other words,defendants only sought an order compelling arbitration of the arbitrability question.the order under review does not resolve the issue of whether some or all of the claims in plaintiffs complaint were to be arbitrated.we conclude that because the issue of whether any claims are to be arbitrated remains unresolved,no appealable final judgment within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,subdivision c has been entered.hence,we dismiss the appeal.
on july,plaintiffs and the group entered into two written agreements.first,plaintiffs and the group entered into an amendment to current output agreements and new output agreement the output agreement.second,plaintiffs and the group entered into a trademark license agreement the license agreement.the agreements concerned motion pictures,videos,and similar matter licensed to the group.
the output agreement includes an arbitration clause.article of the output agreement provides in pertinent part alternate dispute resolution.any dispute arising out of or relating to this agreement will be resolved in accordance with the procedures specified in this article,which will be the sole and exclusive procedures for the resolution of any such disputes,except this article will not apply to the following disputes,which will be litigated in a court of law any dispute concerning the validity,ownership or control of the vivid marks arbitration.except as otherwise expressly provided in sections and concerning the availability of equitable relief of this agreement,any controversy,dispute or claim under,arising out of,in connection with or in relation to this agreement,including the negotiation,execution,interpretation,construction,coverage,scope,performance,breach,termination,validity or enforceability of this agreement will be settled,at the request of either party,by arbitration conducted in accordance with this article and the then existing rules for commercial arbitration of the american arbitration association the arbitration will be governed by the federal arbitration act.the arbitration of such issues,including the determination of any amount of damages suffered by any party hereto by reason of the acts or omissions of either party,will be final and binding upon the parties to the maximum extent permitted by law.we refer to the foregoing arbitration provisions as article.
similarly,article of the license agreement provides in relevant part alternate dispute resolution.any dispute arising out of or relating to this agreement will be resolved in accordance with the procedures specified in this article,which will be the sole and exclusive procedures for the resolution of any such disputes,except this article will not apply to the following disputes,which will be litigated in a court of law a any dispute concerning the validity,ownership or control of the vivid marks the american arbitration association commercial arbitration rules,which are referenced in article above,include provisions governing an arbitrator jurisdiction.rule states in part a the arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction,including any objections with respect to the existence,scope or validity of the arbitration agreement.american arbitration association,commercial arbitration rules and mediation procedures,rule,as amended and effective september.
section of the output agreement,which plaintiffs assert is controlling in terms of the merits of this appeal,states remedies.upon the occurrence of an event of default,vivid may,in its sole discretion,but upon delivering not less than business days written notice to the group,exercise any or all of the following rights a notwithstanding the provisions of article,file suit and obtain judgment to collect all amounts owing from the group d terminate the trademark license agreement.plaintiffs argue that the immediately foregoing provisions of section create an exception to the article arbitration provisions.event of default for purposes of section is defined as follows event of default means any of the following events that remain uncured at the time vivid exercise remedies with respect to such events a the group fails to make any cash payment due to vivid under the terms of this agreement within days following the date the cash payment is due 
on april,steven hirsch,the president of vivid video,notified defendants as follows this letter is the exercise of certain rights under and pursuant to section of the output agreement,based upon the occurrence of an event of default that remains uncured,in that the group has failed to make cash payments due to vivid under the terms of the output agreement within days following the date the cash payments were due.this letter shall constitute the business days written notice required under section and the certain rights hereby exercised shall become effective on april,or business days from the delivery of this letter,whichever is later.the certain rights vivid hereby exercises under and pursuant to section of the agreement are the following a to file suit and obtain judgment to collect all amounts owing from the group c to terminate the trademark license agreement 
on april,louis meisinger,on behalf of the group,responded to hirsch letter by filing a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association.the group also mailed a letter to the various attorneys for plaintiffs stating,among other things,that the group denied an event of default had occurred.the group tendered a million check in satisfaction of any inadvertent deficiency along with meisinger letter.
four days later,on may,plaintiffs filed the present action.plaintiffs allege the group breached the output agreement by failing to make payments due and breached a good faith and fair dealing implied covenant.plaintiffs also seek an accounting and a declaration the license agreement has been terminated.specifically,plaintiffs allege the group agreed in the output agreement to make certain cash payments to vivid based upon gross receipts and retail receipts for sales keep an accurate set of books and records showing such gross receipts and retail receipts allow plaintiffs to audit and inspect those books and records pay interest on late payments and,under certain circumstances,to reimburse plaintiffs for their costs incurred to conduct the inspection and audit further,the complaint alleges the group failed to make the payments,many of which are more than days past due and plaintiffs exercised their right to file suit to collect the amounts owed and to terminate the license agreement.
defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration.defendants argued that under article and rule a,arbitrability was for the arbitrators to determine.documentary evidence of the controversy between the parties was submitted in support of the motion.plaintiffs opposed the motion and relied on section of the output agreement.
as noted above,defendants motion to compel arbitration of the arbitrability issue only was denied.on june,the trial court ruled d efendants have not sufficiently established the existence of an agreement to arbitrate the issues here in dispute.plaintiffs have filed suit under the conditions set forth in section of the output agreement,and this right to file suit is unequivocally provided n otwithstanding the provisions of article.webster third new international dictionary page defines notwithstanding as without prevention or obstruction from or by,and when applying this definition here,the plain language of the output agreement clearly circumscribes the arbitrator otherwise broad authority to resolve disputes concerning interpretation,construction,coverage,and scope of the agreement.t he output agreement expressly provides for the right to file suit under section without any obstruction from any provision articulated in article,including the provision that consigns the arbitrator the authority to resolve disputes concerning the application and interpretation of the agreement.if defendants position were to be accepted,the court would be forced to effectively read section out of the agreement altogether.this is not the general rule governing judicial interpretation and construction of contracts.see.as such,the court can not conclude that the parties clearly and unmistakably agreed to arbitrate the issue of arbitrability with respect to the claims at issue here.as noted,the june,order does not direct the arbitration of any cause of action raised in plaintiffs complaint.nor does it deny the arbitrability of any claim.the trial court simply held that it and not the arbitrators will decide arbitrability.
preliminarily,we must consider the application of the united states arbitration act.as noted above,the parties expressly agreed,the arbitration will be governed by the federal arbitration act.notwithstanding that contractual provision,state procedural rules govern the determination of defendants motion to compel arbitration.southland keating,fn,d rosenthal great western fin.securities cal th,d.
the question before us then is whether the trial court ruling as to who decides arbitrability is a final determination giving rise to a right to appeal.it bears emphasis this issue arises in the context of where the trial court will decide in the future which,if any,of plaintiffs causes of action are to be arbitrated.subject to certain narrow limitations,there is no constitutional right to appeal.lindsey normet,d leone medical board cal th,d,powers city of richmond cal th,d,lead opn.of kennard trede superior court cal d.the california supreme court has repeatedly held that the right to appeal is wholly statutory.powers city of richmond,supra,cal th at,d,agricultural labor relations bd.land management,cal d,people chi ko wong cal d,disapproved on another point in people green cal d.a proper notice of appeal from an appealable order is jurisdictional.griset fair political practices com.cal th,d,jennings marralle cal th,d.the parties can not create appellate jurisdiction by consent,waiver,or estoppel.hollister convalescent,rico cal d,estate of hanley cal d.
pursuant to statute,the right to appeal is generally from a final judgment or order.as we have explained normally,in civil cases,there can only be an appeal from a final judgment.the california supreme court has noted an appeal from a judgment that is not final violates the one final judgment rule and must therefore be dismissed,mather mather cal d,cobb university of california th,d sullivan delta air lines,cal th,d.the nature of the one final judgment rule was described in sullivan by the supreme court as follows in its most fundamental sense,finality is an attribute of every judgment at the moment it is rendered indeed,if a judicial determination is not immediately final in this sense it is not a judgment,no matter what it is denominated.the legislature has incorporated this meaning of finality into the very definition of a judgment a judgment is the final determination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding.code civ,italics added.and we have explained the meaning as follows a judgment is final when it terminates the litigation between the parties on the merits of the case and leaves nothing to be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined.doudell shoo cal,accord,lyon goss cal d,olson cory cal d,finality in this sense not only makes a judicial determination a judgment,it also makes that judgment appealable.as we recently observed,a judgment that leaves no issue to be determined except the fact of compliance with its terms is appealable.california of psychology providers rank cal d,indeed,recognizing that this meaning of finality is so fundamental that it is essentially redundant to speak of a final judgment in this sense,the legislature no longer provides in the basic statute authorizing appeals from the superior court that such an appeal may be taken from a final judgment entered in an action,or special proceeding former,subd,italics added the statute now provides simply that an appeal may be taken from a judgment,subd.a.the meaning is the same.sullivan delta air lines,supra,cal th at,d,original italics.in determining whether a judgment is final,its substance governs,not its label or form.daar yellow cab cal d,joyce black d.rubin western mutual ins.th,d.
the right to appeal in a civil action is governed by section.under section,subdivision a,an appeal lies,from a judgment,except an interlocutory judgment appeals in arbitration matters are governed by section an aggrieved party may appeal from a an order dismissing or denying a petition to compel arbitration.b an order dismissing a petition to confirm,correct or vacate an award.c an order vacating an award unless a rehearing in arbitration is ordered.d a judgment entered pursuant to this title.e a special order after final judgment.
under section,appealable arbitration orders require finality.the court of appeal has held it is quite obvious that the legislature philosophy and intent in drafting section was that there should be no appellate consideration of intermediate rulings in arbitration disputes if the superior court was of the view that there should be initial or further proceedings in arbitration.thus,most significantly,an order compelling arbitration is not appealable.lesser towers,constr.d.similarly the legislature expressly excepted orders vacating awards but directing rehearings in arbitration from a roster of appealable rulings in section.long beach iron works,international molders of north america,local d.an intermediate ruling in an arbitration dispute that contemplates further proceedings in arbitration is not appealable,subd.c long beach iron works,international molders of north america,local,supra,d at.order vacating award and resubmitting controversy to different arbitrator nonappealable see also marcus millichap real estate investment brokerage woodman investment group th,d order vacating arbitration award without directing a rehearing was final for purposes of appealability sy first family.partnership cheung th,d order denying petition to confirm initial arbitration award constituted an interlocutory rather than a final ruling because the court remanded for further arbitration proceedings.requiring finality in appealable arbitration orders is consistent both with the language of section and the general prohibition of appeals from interlocutory nonfinal judgments in section,subdivision a.see sjoberg hastorf cal d,discussing finality in arbitration context state farm fire casualty hardin d.order compelling arbitration is nonappealable because it does not resolve all of the issues in controversy see also green tree financial randolph,d order compelling arbitration and dismissing underlying claims was final appealable decision within meaning of united states arbitration act,a.this finality reasoning likewise applies to bar an appeal from an arbitration ruling that,as here,contemplates further proceedings in the trial court.the present order merely determines who decides arbitrability for purposes of further proceedings in the trial court as to what issues are arbitrable.it leaves the arbitrability of the causes of action in the complaint for future determination in the trial court.the order does not finally determine all issues before the trial court.the order is not sufficiently final to give rise to a right to appeal.
further,our holding is consistent with the policy reasons underlying the one final judgment rule.in morehart county of santa barbara cal th,footnote,d,our supreme court identified the justifications for the one final judgment rule there are sound reasons for the one final judgment rule.as explained in kinoshita horio d,t hese include the obvious fact that piecemeal disposition and multiple appeals tend to be oppressive and costly.citing,inter alia,knodel knodel cal d.interlocutory appeals burden the courts and impede the judicial process in a number of ways they tend to clog the appellate courts with a multiplicity of appeals early resort to the appellate courts tends to produce uncertainty and delay in the trial court until a final judgment is rendered the trial court may completely obviate an appeal by altering the rulings from which an appeal would otherwise have been taken.citations.later actions by the trial court may provide a more complete record which dispels the appearance of error or establishes that it was harmless.having the benefit of a complete adjudication will assist the reviewing court to remedy error if any by giving specific directions rather than remanding for another round of proceedings.d at.see associates th,d s trong policy reasons support the one final judgment rule in the arbitration appeal context.under defendants analysis,if we were to conclude that the arbitrability issue was to be decided solely by the trial court,upon issuance of our remittitur,a new round of litigation would proceed in which the trial court would decide whether all or some of plaintiffs causes of action were to be arbitrated.under these potential circumstances,after we ruled in this appeal,defendants would file another petition to compel arbitration.in fact,during oral argument,defense counsel candidly explained if we concluded the arbitrability issue was to be decided by the trial court,another petition to compel arbitration would be filed.and defendants papers filed in the trial court expressly state that if the arbitrability issue is to be decided by the trial court,they will seek to litigate whether the merits of all or some of plaintiffs claims are to be arbitrated.
defendants view of the law could result in two appeals on the issue of whether the dispute is to be arbitrated,which is inconsistent with the policies underlying the one final judgment rule our supreme court identified in morehart.the analysis proposed by defendants creates two possible appeals,which ultimately address the same their dispute,or parts of it,be arbitrated also,this appeal has caused delay in the trial court.further,the ultimate this dispute be arbitrated in whole or in yet to be decided.and it is entirely possible that a final judgment will obviate the ultimate issue of whether the dispute will be arbitrated partially or in its entirety.additionally,once the entire record of the parties expectations is available,it is possible we will be able to assess the issues with greater thoroughness.our point is that the purposes of the one final judgment rule identified in morehart are satisfied by our holding.
two final points warrant comment.to begin with,at oral argument,defense counsel argued that his clients right to arbitrator determination of the arbitrability issue would be frustrated if the trial court proceeded to decide what causes of actions must be arbitrated.in this regard,defense counsel adverts to the speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution provided by arbitration.see agnes medical center pacificare of california cal th,d,moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.however,even if defendants can not appeal at present,they could have filed a mandate petition challenging the trial court ruling.they would have thereby secured prompt appellate review of the trial court ruling.we would have given serious and judicious attention to such a mandate petition.and they remain free even now to file such a mandate petition,which will be promptly and earnestly reviewed.see state farm mutual automobile ins.superior court th,d nonappealable order compelling arbitration reviewed via writ petition eisenberg,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group.finally,nothing in our opinion should be construed as a statement of views as to how the trial court should resolve defendants petition to compel arbitration which will ensue upon issuance of our remittitur.we leave this matter in the good hands of the trial court and the attorneys litigating this matter.
the appeal is dismissed.the parties are to bear their own costs on appeal.
i respectfully dissent.
in article of their agreement,the parties agreed to arbitrate any controversy,dispute or claim under,arising out of,in connection with or in relation to this agreement,including disputes relating to the interpretation,construction,coverage,or scope of that agreement.the parties incorporated into their agreement to arbitrate the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association aaa,which provide in rule a that t he arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction,including any objections with respect to the existence,scope or validity of the arbitration agreement.the parties also specified that the federal arbitration act faa et would govern their arbitration agreement.because these proceedings are in a california state court,generally california procedural law,including state law governing appealability,applies.muao grosvenor properties th,d.
plaintiff filed an action against defendants in the los angeles superior court.defendants then commenced an arbitration and moved in the trial court to compel arbitration of the limited issue of the arbitrability of the dispute and to stay the action pending resolution of the arbitrability issue.code civ.plaintiff contended that a provision in section of the agreement,which excepts certain issues from arbitration the carve out provision,precluded arbitration of the issue of arbitrability.plaintiff argued that the parties had not agreed clearly and unmistakably to have the arbitrator decide arbitrability,and therefore the trial court,rather than the arbitrator,should determine arbitrability.first options of chicago,kaplan,d courts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is clea r and unmistakabl e evidence that they did so.defendants asserted that,by incorporating the aaa commercial arbitration rules into the arbitration provision,the parties evidenced their clear and unmistakable agreement that the arbitrator should decide arbitrability.see contec remote solution,cir,under faa,when parties explicitly incorporate arbitration rules that empower an arbitrator to decide issues of arbitrability,the incorporation serves as clear and unmistakable evidence of the parties intent to delegate such issues to an arbitrator.
the trial court denied defendants motion to compel arbitration of the issue of arbitrability,concluding that defendants had not sufficiently established the existence of an agreement to arbitrate the issues here in dispute.the trial court reasoned that plaintiff had filed suit under the conditions set forth in the carve out provision,section.because a suit under section could proceed without any obstruction from the arbitration provision in article,the parties had not clearly and unmistakably agreed to arbitrate the issue of arbitrability with respect to the claims at issue here.
to reach that decision,the trial court necessarily interpreted,construed and determined the scope of the arbitration provision.defendants contend that by doing so,the trial court erred,for the parties agreed that the arbitrator was to interpret,construe,and determine the scope of the agreement,including the arbitration clause.regardless of the ultimate merit of defendants position,it is based on a reasonable interpretation of the parties agreement.the trial court order thus denied defendants petition to compel arbitration of an issue that defendants reasonably contended was subject to the parties arbitration agreement.
the trial court order is appealable.section,subdivision a provides that a n order dismissing or denying a petition to compel arbitration is appealable section does not specify that only a final order dismissing or denying a petition to compel arbitration is appealable,nor does it state that only an order dismissing or denying a petition to compel arbitration of all potentially arbitrable claims is appealable.the plain lang
