these appeals by related parties are from an order confirming an arbitration award and a subsequent order awarding and interest.jurisdiction in the district court was based on diversity of citizenship.this court jurisdiction is based on 
appellants are the majority shareholders of the closely held corporation,american nutrition,ani,and ani itself.the majority shareholders are the members of the behnken and nancy behnken and their three adult children,william,sandi,and john behnken the behnken siblings.the behnkens,directly or through other completely controlled corporate entities,own about of the stock of ani.the appellees are four of the five minority shareholders of ani.
the primary underlying dispute between the majority and minority shareholders of ani involves allegations that the majority usurped ani corporate opportunities and transferred ani assets to the detriment of the minority.other companies owned by the mountain milling company,solar engineering,and behnken involved in this dispute because they were the beneficiaries of the transactions that allegedly diminished the value of ani and thus of the minority shares 
in the early,all of ani real property was transferred to behnken properties and then leased back to ani.the minority shareholders have alleged that they approved this transfer,which benefitted the behnkens,only because they were promised a day of fairness,by which they apparently meant that they were promised that they would be compensated for the diminution in value of their shares caused by this arrangement.but that never happened.moreover,jack behnken allegedly caused ani to pay higher lease rates to behnken properties than had been disclosed and approved.
also in the,ani equipment was transferred to another behnken family entity,solar engineering,and leased back.allegedly ani received less than the real value of the equipment in the sale,and the was at inflated rates.the low sales price and high costs were allegedly concealed from the minority shareholders.
ani makes dry pet food.in and,jack behnken allegedly caused profitable product lines canned pet food and treats,primarily to be transferred from ani to yet another behnken family entity,rocky mountain milling.the minority shareholders alleged that in six years,this transfer of product lines resulted in rocky mountain milling distributing over million in profits to the behnken family.
in an earlier effort to resolve this dispute,the parties agreed to mediation.after a day of efforts,they entered into a memorandum of understanding in which they agreed to a mechanism for valuing ani and the minority interest.the parties agreed that the fair market enterprise value of ani would include rocky mountain milling and solar engineering.they also agreed to continue mediation and to go to arbitration if mediation was unsuccessful.the memorandum of understanding recited that after an agreement was reached as to the value of the minority interest,their stock would be bought at that price by the majority.
the behnken parties terminated the memorandum of understanding before further settlement efforts,however.this led to the filing of the instant lawsuit in the district court,which was first filed by the minority shareholders as an action to enforce the memorandum of understanding and compel mediation or arbitration.the district court ruled,however,that the mediation had been properly terminated.
the parties then entered into the may,arbitration agreement under which the arbitration award now at issue was eventually made.like the memorandum of understanding,the arbitration agreement contemplated an eventual buyout of the minority after the value of the minority interest would have been determined.john heald,who had been a director of ani for some years,was named arbitrator,with all parties waiving any objection that he did not meet the american arbitration association definition of a neutral arbitrator because of his history with the company and the parties.proceedings in the district court were stayed on joint motion of the parties to permit the arbitration to go forward.
there were other disputes between the parties,or some of them at least,that were not directly related to ani.jack youngs,the first named,had other business dealings with jack behnken,and the agreement recites that controversies have also developed between them regarding these other dealings,which may include but not be limited to investment by each of them in entities or properties owned or controlled by the other.these other disputes are called the controversy in the arbitration agreement,which recites that jack youngs and jack behnken desire to resolve those matters in the arbitration procedure.
one of the issues raised on appeal by the majority shareholders is that the arbitrator failed to resolve the controversy.thus,it is surprising that the majority brief has nothing whatsoever to say about the content of the controversy.our study of the record on the matter has not been very enlightening,a point to which we shall return.for now,we note only that appellants appendix,which appears to contain all relevant material from the district court record,shows only a single document that was provided to the arbitrator that appears to relate to the controversy.it is a message from jack behnken to jack youngs,a copy of which was submitted to the arbitrator.iv.this document purports to summarize the outcome of the investments each of the two men made in ventures of the other.the document purports to show that three of five of behnken investments in youngs ventures resulted in losses to behnken the losses being substantially greater than the gains on the two profitable ventures,while youngs investments in behnken ventures all resulted in gains to youngs.these matters date back to,according to the document,with behnken largest reported loss some coming on an investment dated.the document also purports to show that behnken lost about in an investment in the years,and another that was invested in the years,and.the record reveals nothing as to the nature of behnken potential claims against youngs arising from these investment losses.
the arbitrator ultimately set a value of just over million for the minority interest in ani.the arbitrator gave a brief written explanation for the method of valuation.he stated that ani and rocky mountain milling were inseparable in all respects and that he had therefore included the average of the full earnings of both companies in his calculations.he also included the average rental income of behnken properties in order to recognize the value associated with the transfer of property and plant to behnken p roperties.
the parties filed competing motions in the district court,the minority moving to confirm the award and the majority moving to vacate it.the district court granted the motion to confirm,but with one necessary modification of the arbitrator award in a later order,the court granted and interest to the plaintiff minority shareholders.
in the arbitration agreement,the parties stipulated to application of utah law.on appeal,both parties cite to utah law regarding the standard of review that this court should apply.we have found no significant differences between utah law and federal law on the issues involved in this appeal.we thus have no occasion to grapple with questions about which law to apply,and we will cite to both state and federal authorities herein,assuming without deciding in each instance that it would make no difference if we were to consult state instead of federal law or we note in this regard that the utah supreme court looks to federal caselaw for guidance because of the nearly identical provisions of the federal arbitration act,while reserving the option to adopt a different construction.buzas baseball,salt lake trappers,utah.
under utah law judicial review of arbitration awards should not be pervasive in scope but should be limited to the statutory grounds and procedures for review.buzas baseball,at quoting de vore ihc hospitals,utah.in general,a trial court should not disturb an arbitration award because the court does not agree with the award as long as the proceeding was fair and honest and the substantial rights of the parties were respected.id.
this is an extremely deferential standard.but very limited grounds for modifying or vacating arbitration awards are recognized by the courts and embodied in the utah arbitration act.id as possibly relevant here,a court may vacate an arbitration award under the utah arbitration act only if it appears that misconduct by an arbitrator prejudiced the rights of a party to the proceeding,that the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or that the arbitrators otherwise conducted the hearing to the substantial prejudice of the rights of a party.utah code ann.b,c,d an arbitrator exceeds his powers if the award is without foundation in reason or fact.buzas baseball,at quoting brotherhood of trainmen central of,cir.
the burden is on the party seeking to vacate an arbitration award,which in this case is the majority shareholders,to show that one of the limited statutory grounds exists for setting aside the arbitration result.see ormsbee development grace,cir.that burden is very great.federated department stores industries,cir.
as for appellate review of the district court ruling confirming the arbitration award and denying the motion to vacate the award,we apply no special standard but review the trial court findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard and its conclusions of law de novo.buzas baseball,at.
the majority shareholders contend that the award should have been vacated because the arbitrator failed to resolve the controversy.the statutory ground relied on here is that the arbitrator exceeded his authority for a reviewing court to conclude that the arbitrator exceeded his authority,the court must determine that the award covers areas not contemplated by the submission agreement or determine that the award is without foundation in reason or fact.buzas baseball,at.we ordinarily would review de novo the question whether the agreement required the arbitrator to resolve the controversy because this issue turns on interpretation of the arbitration agreement.we need not decide this issue,however.we will assume,for purposes of our analysis,that the agreement did require the arbitrator to resolve the controversy.
as noted,the majority shareholders,as the parties seeking to vacate the arbitration result,have the burden of sustaining such an attack.ormsbee development grace,cir.we conclude that the majority shareholders have fallen short of carrying the burden of persuasion on the issue.
first,it is not certain that the arbitrator did in fact fail to resolve the controversy the agreement provides that the decision on the claims included in the controversy could be factored into the price to be paid by ani for the stock held by the minority shareholders either as an addition or an offset to the amount that may otherwise be payable from ani to youngs.given the presumption of validity accorded to arbitration awards,and the heavy burden of proof on a party seeking to vacate an award,we are not persuaded that the majority shareholders have established even the first premise of their argument.although we do not know under what legal theories behnken believed that he could still recoup the losses on his superannuated investments,based on the extremely limited information in this record,it certainly would not have been irrational for the arbitrator to have concluded that those claims had no value.because the arbitration agreement did not require that the arbitrator make specific findings,we will not draw the inference that he failed to decide the controversy from the mere absence of mention of his decision in the award.
moreover,even if we were to assume that the arbitrator did not decide the controversy,we would still hold that the majority shareholders have failed to carry their burden of proof that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by failing to decide that matter.although we assume that the agreement gave the majority the right to have the controversy resolved by the arbitrator,a party may waive the contractual right.see,ormsbee development,at.there is no set rule as to what constitutes a waiver or abandonment of the arbitration agreement the question depends upon the facts of each case and usually calls for a finding by the trier of the facts.id.at.if the majority shareholders did not provide any evidence to the arbitrator to support their claims regarding the controversy,then they waived their arbitration rights.
the majority shareholders have not even asserted on did they in the district court as far as we have any evidence was presented to the arbitrator to enable him to resolve the controversy.certainly our record,and apparently that of the district court,is completely devoid of any indication that any evidence was produced,or that even any attempt was made to explain to the arbitrator why behnken thought he should recoup his losses.in their brief,the majority shareholders assert that the court must consider the evidence produced to the arbitrator.yet there is no indication where that might be found.
our record does not include the arbitration record,and it does not appear that the district court record included it.we note that it is uncertain whether an arbitration record even exists in this case.it appears that there was no formal hearing,just the submission of documents and one or more meetings of some of the parties.nevertheless,it was the burden of the majority shareholders to provide the district court with the evidence to support their arguments for vacating the arbitrator award,whether or not that evidence had been formally compiled as an arbitration record 
in sum,the majority shareholders have failed to meet the heavy burden of showing that the arbitration award must be set aside.drawing all inferences in favor of the award and finding no evidence to support the majority assertions,we are unable to conclude that the arbitrator breached his duties under the agreement by allegedly failing to resolve the controversy.
the arbitration agreement called for the arbitrator to decide the dispute,which was defined to include two clusters of issues.one group of issues,which we have just discussed,was the controversy.the other group of issues was defined in the agreement by reference to the pleadings in the litigation in the district court,proceedings which had commenced before the parties entered into the arbitration agreement as noted supra.thus,the agreement recited that the parties wished to resolve the disputed issues described in the pleadings and other documents that had been filed in the district court.
the majority shareholders contend that the arbitrator failed to resolve the disputed issues described in the pleadings that have been filed in the underlying lawsuit.they assert that the arbitrator did not address the contested issues in his award but only assessed the value of the minority interest in ani.accordingly,they argue,the award lacked foundation in reason or fact and was in excess of the arbitrator authority 
of the issues referred to in the agreement,the disputed issues described in the pleadings,the appellants discuss only one in their brief.this concerns the real property formerly owned by ani which was transferred in to behnken properties and then leased back to ani.in the award,the arbitrator noted that his calculations included the average rental income for behnken properties and that all of this rent had been paid by ani and rocky mountain milling which,the arbitrator had earlier stated,was inseparable in all respects from ani.the award further explained that the rental income of behnken properties was included in the calculation to include recognition to the minority shareholders of the value associated with the transfer of property and plant to behnken properties.appellants protest that no claim had been raised in the pleadings relating to the transfer of property to behnken properties instead,they say,there were only allegations that the lease rates charged to ani were inflated.
the majority shareholders assert that the issue raised in the pleadings concerning behnken properties was the allegedly inflated lease rates charged to
