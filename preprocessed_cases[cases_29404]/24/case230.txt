this case raises questions regarding the scope of federal court review of a decision issued by an arbitral panel.we resolve the case through the application of the familiar principle that the scope of such review is highly constrained.this is especially true with regard to an arbitral panel assessment of whether the documentary and testimonial evidence presented to it is sufficient to satisfy a particular legal claim.federal district judges are,of course,highly skilled in matters of weighing evidence.as illustrated by the result we reach here,however,district judges must put these skills aside when faced with the question of whether a decision issued by an arbitral panel should be confirmed.
a.the buttars claim.
daljit and paramjit buttar,who are husband and wife,are residents of raleigh,north carolina.daljit buttar hereafter buttar is a physician specializing in neurology,and is currently in solo practice.
buttar has assumed sole responsibility for managing his family finances.in,he happened to meet vivek verma,a stockbroker based in new york city,at a social event in north carolina.at this event,and in a series of subsequent telephone calls,buttar and verma discussed the buttar family current investments and future investment goals.in july,verma persuaded buttar to open the first of a series of investment accounts at the firm for which he worked,montrose capital management montrose.the application signed by buttar when he opened this account contains the following provision 
all controversies which may arise between us concerning any transaction,or the construction,performance or breach of this or any other agreement between us,whether entered into prior,on,or subsequent to the date hereof,shall be determined by arbitration in accordance with the federal arbitration act to the fullest extent permitted by law.the arbitration shall be determined only before and in accordance with the rules then in effect of either the new york stock exchange,or the national association of securities dealers,or any other exchange or organization of which montrose is a member as i may elect.the award of the arbitrators,or of the majority of them,shall be final 
we note that,immediately preceding the arbitration clause,the application sets forth the following understanding in bold lettering the arbitrator award is not required to include factual findings or legal reasoning and any party right to appeal or to seek modification of rulings by arbitrators is strictly limited.
soon after opening this initial account,buttar also began to discuss his investments with robert winston.winston actual responsibilities at montrose are not entirely clear from the record,but buttar testified that winston talked to me like he was the owner of the firm.verma himself testified that while he worked at montrose he was under the impression that winston ran the firm.
verma and winston successfully urged buttar to make substantial investments in the securities of two firms skynet holdings,skynet and cnf technologies cnf.buttar was also persuaded to provide a bridge loan to cnf in the amount of.eventually,buttar alleges,montrose had invested virtually all of his liquid assets in cnf and skynet.it is undisputed that buttar suffered substantial losses as a result.
b.the arbitration proceeding.
on september,the buttars instituted an arbitration proceeding by filing a statement of claim with the national association of securities dealers,nasd,which names montrose and winston as respondents.the statement of claim alleges that winston and verma made numerous false statements to buttar regarding the wisdom of investing in skynet and cnf.these included characterizing skynet as a safe investment when it was in fact a thinly traded bulletin board stock,falsely representing that skynet immediate prospects were particularly favorable because it was in the process of a buyout by federal express,and assuring buttar that the principal amount of his loan to cnf would be returned to him plus ten percent within two months,guaranteed.the buttars sought compensatory damages in the amount of and an unspecified amount of punitive damages.
the buttars filed an amended statement of claim with the nasd on march,which repeats the factual allegations of their original pleading,but which names michael wallace,david jacaruso and joseph scotti as respondents in addition to montrose and winston.liability as to wallace,jacaruso,and scotti is set forth in the following allegation 
respondents wallace,jacaruso and scotti are liable as control persons of respondents montrose,winston and verma.see a north carolina general statute a c 
respondents possessed the power to control and supervise the operations of montrose,winston and verma and knew or should have known that montrose,winston and verma were handling claimants accounts in an unsuitable manner,making unauthorized trades and were making misrepresentations to claimants.respondents,as control persons,failed to properly superivse the activities of montrose,winston and verma,but benefitted from the improper and illegal activities conducted by montrose,winston and verma.
respondents montrose,wallace,jacaruso and scotti are responsible for the wrongdoing of its registered representatives due to the doctrine of respondeat superior,for failing in all respects to supervise the account activity.respondents wallace,jacaruso and scotti are liable as control persons.the conduct of respondents violated the federal securities laws,state statutory and common law,and the rules and regulations of the national association of securities dealers,and the securities industry.
the buttars claim was assigned to a arbitration panel the panel.none of the panel members is an attorney,but they are all seasoned business executives with substantial experience as arbitrators.on may,the panel granted winston motion,which was joined by wallace,jacaruso,and scotti,to assert a claim against verma.
the panel conducted a hearing on the buttars claim in november.although they were all represented by counsel at the hearing,winston,jacaruso,and scotti chose not to appear in person and did not give any testimony.wallace was also represented by counsel and testified very briefly by telephone.
a central issue on this appeal is whether the panel could conclude that wallace,jacaruso,and scotti are liable to the buttars as control persons of montrose.during his opening statement to the panel,counsel for wallace,jacaruso,and scotti denied that the three men could be found liable as control persons and alerted the panel to his intention to move for dismissal on this ground at the close of evidence.this motion was in fact made,but the panel declined to rule on it until all of the various written pleadings and memoranda have been reviewed.the buttars submitted a memorandum to the panel which sets forth the basic principles of control person liability under north carolina and federal law.counsel for wallace,jacaruso,and scotti,however,submitted a memorandum which is notable for its use of invective,but which is almost completely devoid of legal discussion of any type.it devotes slightly more than of a page to the law of control person liability,and does not discuss north carolina law at all.the buttars and wallace,jacaruso,and scotti also submitted reply memoranda to the panel regarding the common law issues of laches and respondeat superior.
the evidence before the panel regarding the status of wallace,jacaruso,and scotti as control persons was neither nor overwhelming.in the first place,documents filed by montrose with the securities and exchange commission tend to support a finding of control person status.on a form bd a uniform application for by montrose in may,wallace is identified as the firm president.on the same form,jacaruso and scotti are identified as directors who each owned a share of montrose,but only wallace is actually identified as a control person.on an amended form bd,however,dated november,jacaruso and scotti are listed as each owning a to interest in montrose and each,along with wallace,is listed as a control person.two subsequent form bd amendments,dated december,and december,repeat this listing.
the panel also heard the testimony of michael kavanagh,a stockbroker who came to work at montrose upon a promise that he would be given a ownership interest in the firm.kavanagh testified that upon his arrival at montrose,winston urged him to buy skynet and cnf securities for the accounts of the clients he had brought with him to the firm.upon meeting with representatives of both companies,however,kavanagh decided that he was too impressed with either one of them.
as time went on,kavanagh became increasingly concerned that other brokers at montrose were being forced by winston to buy securit ies that they did want to buy for their customers.kavanagh testified that he eventually brought his complaints about winston conduct to jacaruso,whom he identified as the chairman of montrose.kavanagh recalled that jacaruso made an agreement with me that he was going to deal with this robert winston issue and that jacaruso told him j ust do pay any attention to robert antics,and i take care of it.kavanagh also averred that winston misconduct was the topic of numerous conversations on my part in the partners meetings,and that such meetings were really never held without all the partners there.nowhere in his testimony does kavanagh state that his complaints about winston were ever acted upon.kavanagh eventually left the firm,testifying that he did so because montrose is a criminal activity.it a pump and dump operation.it a fraud.it a scam 
buttar himself testified that,prior to filing the arbitration claim,he had never heard of wallace,jacaruso,or scotti.the buttars also offered the testimony of william collison as an expert witness in securities investing.with respect to the responsibility of jacaruso and scotti for the losses suffered by the buttars,collison testified that they are directors of the firm.they are on the form bd as the owners of the firm and responsibility for what goes on in that firm ultimately rests with them.collison further declared that jacaruso and scotti as owners of the firm acquiesced,approved,sanctioned,use whatever term pleases you,the activities of winston collison also testified,however,that he had no basis for concluding that jacaruso and scotti had actual knowledge of the trades being made in the buttars particular accounts.
as already noted,jacaruso and scotti did not testify before the panel.wallace,however,testified that he was in control of everyone performing their functions at montrose.wallace also acknowledged that he signed the securities and exchange commission documents which name him,jacaruso,and scotti as control persons of montrose and that he believed that this information was true,accurate and complete.kavanagh,however,characterized wallace as being closer in power to the janitor than the president of montrose,and that he believed a lot of things that happened at the firm were done without mike wallace knowledge.
c.the panel award.
the nasd served all parties with a copy of the panel determination of the buttars claim the award on march.on december,the district court for the southern district of new york had issued a stay of all legal proceedings against montrose pursuant to a of the bankruptcy code,a.accordingly,the award states that the panel made no determination with respect to the claims asserted against montrose,but that the stay does not apply to respondents winston,wallace,scotti and jacaruso.
the award contains no factual findings beyond briefly outlining the terms of the parties claims and defenses.the determination of liability is set forth in relevant part as follows 
the panel finds respondent winston liable for misrepresentation unauthorized,unsuitable and trading in skynet and cnf technologies and fraud.the panel finds respondents wallace,scotti and jacaruso liable for fraud and also as control persons.see a north carolina general statute a c.
respondents winston,wallace,scotti and jacaruso are jointly and severally liable and shall pay to claimants compensatory damages in the amount of,plus interest from june,through january,in the amount of.interest shall accrue in accordance with rule h of the nasd code of arbitration procedure.
respondents winston,wallace,scotti and jacaruso are jointly and severally liable and shall pay to claimants punitive damages in the amount of.the panel finds respondent winston liable for punitive damages based upon the panel finding of fraud.the panel finds the control persons,respondents wallace,scotti and jacaruso,liable for punitive damages based upon the panel finding of fraud.see hunt miller,cir.an employer is liable for an agent fraud when committed within the scope of the agent apparent authority,even when the principal did not know or authorize the commission of the fraudulent acts.also,a master is liable for punitive damages awarded when the servant or agent causing the injury was acting in the course and scope of the master business.see also black law dictionary,ed.interest shall accrue in accordance with rule h of the nasd code of arbitration procedure.
d.the district court decision.
the buttars filed an action on june,in the district court for the eastern district of north carolina seeking confirmation of the award.four days later,wallace,jacaruso,and scotti filed actions to vacate the award in the district court for the southern district of new york.the buttars thereupon voluntarily dismissed the north carolina action,and for confirmation of the award in the new york action.winston filed no action to vacate the award and has not filed any opposition the buttars to confirm the award.
the district court granted the motions to vacate the award,and consequently denied the to confirm the award.see wallace buttar,d.the district court took it to be undisputed that winston,a broker employed by montrose,committed a primary violation of the securities laws,that jacaruso and scotti were directors and shareholders of montrose and wallace was its president.id.at.the question then became whether the panel could have properly found wallace,jacaruso,or scotti in any way liable for winston acts.
the district court held that,in addition to the grounds for vacating an arbitration award set forth in the federal arbitration act faa,see,the second circuit recognize s two additional bases for vacating arbitration awards manifest disregard of the law and manifest disregard of the facts.wallace,d at.in the district court view,the panel could not have found wallace,jacaruso,or scotti liable for the buttars losses without engaging in both sorts of disregard.first,secondary liability pursuant to the doctrine of respondeat superior could not lie because the doctrine imposes liability on the employer of those committing fraud in their employment.the entity that could have been held liable for winston fraud under the doctrine was montrose,winston employer.id.at.second,wallace,jacaruso,and scotti could not be found liable as in winston scheme to defraud the buttars because i n order to commit fraud,one must act with intent to defraud.id.the district court held that no evidence put before the panel could serve as the basis of a finding of such intent on the part of wallace,jacaruso,or scotti 
the totality of the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that wallace never dealt with the buttars,lacked awareness of all wrongdoing in respondents account,and had no duty nor reason to educate himself of the activity in the buttars accounts there was no evidence of any action taken by jacaruso and scotti in connection with the transactions in which winston defrauded the buttars.
clearly the arbitrators could not have found that wallace,jacaruso and scotti possessed the requisite intention to defraud the buttars without manifestly disregarding this evidence,or lack of evidence.
finally,the district court held that the panel manifestly disregarded the law and the evidence by holding wallace,jacaruso,and scotti liable as control persons because t he buttars rely solely on wallace status as president and jacaruso and scotti designation as a control person of montrose.id.at.the district court observed,however,that status alone does not suffice to make one liable as a control person.rather,the control person must additionally possess the necessary mental culpability by either knowing,or failing to know due to their sic own recklessness or negligence,of the alleged wrongdoing.id.at.upon its review of the evidentiary record,the district court found n o evidence had been adduced that the petitioners were involved in the allegedly unsuitable and unauthorized transactions in the buttars accounts.id.at.therefore,a finding of intent as to wallace,jacaruso,and scotti could only be the panel invention,made in disregard of the evidentiary record before it.
discussion 
when a party challenges the district court review of an arbitral award under the manifest disregard standard,we review the district court application of the standard de novo.the gms group,llc benderson,cir citing greenberg bear,stearns,cir.
a.the scope of federal court review of an arbitration award.
a motion to vacate filed in a federal court is not an occasion for de novo review of an arbitral award.it is well established that courts must grant an arbitration panel decision great deference.a party petitioning a federal court to vacate an arbitral award bears the heavy burden of showing that the award falls within a very narrow set of circumstances delineated by statute and case law.duferco int l steel trading klaveness shipping,cir.the faa sets forth certain grounds upon which a federal court may vacate an arbitral award,but all of these involve corruption,fraud,or some other impropriety on the part of the arbitrators.see a.the district court did not hold,nor did it in any way imply,that the award is the result of an act of corruption or unseemliness on the part of the panel.we therefore immediately proceed to a consideration of the cases within our circuit which have recognized grounds for vacating an arbitral award other than outright perfidy on the part of arbitrators.we conclude that the district court took too broad a view of these grounds for vacatur.
manifest disregard of the law.
our circuit has long held that a n arbitration award may be vacated if it exhibits a manifest disregard of the law.goldman architectural iron,cir quoting dirussa dean witter reynolds,cir.but we have also been quick to add that manifest disregard of law as applied to review of an arbitral award is a severely limited doctrine.gov t of india cargill,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.indeed,we have recently described it as a doctrine of last use is limited only to those exceedingly rare instances where some egregious impropriety on the part of the arbitrators is apparent,but where none of the provisions of the faa apply.duferco,at.accordingly,we have said that the doctrine gives extreme deference to arbitrators.dirussa,at.
an arbitral award may be vacated for manifest disregard of the law only if a reviewing court find s both that the arbitrators knew of a governing legal principle yet refused to apply it or ignored it altogether,and the law ignored by the arbitrators was well defined,explicit,and clearly applicable to the case.banco de seguros del estado mutual marine office,cir quoting greenberg,at.we have emphasized that an arbitral panel refusal or neglect to apply a governing legal principle clearly means more than error or misunderstanding with respect to the law.hoeft mvl group,cir quoting merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,bobker,cir.a federal court can not vacate an arbitral award merely because it is convinced that the arbitration panel made the wrong call on the law.on the contrary,the award should be enforced,despite a court disagreement with it on the merits,if there is a barely colorable justification for the outcome reached.banco de seguros del estado,at emphasis added citation and quotation marks omitted see also hoeft,at confirming award and stating that it is of no consequence that arbitrator decision did not apply the clear majority view of a certain principle of accounting law westerbeke daihatsu motor,cir award would be confirmed regardless of the court serious reservations about the soundness of the arbitrator reading of the contract at issue mary home,service employees int l union,dist,cir internal inconsistencies in the arbitrator opinion are not grounds to vacate the award notwithstanding the movant plausible argument that the arbitrator decision was misguided or our own concerns regarding the arbitrator conclusion.
in sum,a court reviewing an arbitral award can not presume that the arbitrator is capable of understanding and applying legal principles with the sophistication of a highly skilled attorney.indeed,this is so far from being the case that an arbitrator under the test of manifest disregard is ordinarily assumed to be a blank slate unless educated in the law by the parties.goldman,at.there is certainly no requirement under the faa that arbitrators be members of the bar and we have recognized that arbitrators often are chosen for reasons other than their knowledge of applicable law.duferco,at.further,arbitrators are not required to provide an explanation for their decision.willemijn houdstermaatschappij,bv standard microsystems,cir.as already noted,the arbitration clause in this case explicitly informed the parties that they should not expect the award to be accompanied by any explanation of the panel reasoning.see supra.
our cases demonstrate that we have used the manifest disregard of law doctrine to vacate arbitral awards only in the most egregious instances of misapplication of legal principles.in new york telephone communications workers of america local,cir per curiam,an arbitral award cited precedent from two of our sister circuits,and expressly declined to apply contrary precedent from this circuit.the award justified its conclusion as follows as for the argument that the law of the circuit is different and controlling,that can be tested,if needs be,by this decision.the second circuit decision at issue was decided years ago perhaps it is time for a new court decision.id.at alteration in original.we held that this explicit rejection of controlling precedent constituted manifest disregard of the law.id.at.
in hardy walsh manning securities,cir,an arbitral panel found the manager of a brokerage firm skelly liable for fraudulent securities transactions undertaken by an employee of the firm based upon the principles of respondeat superior.id.at.we noted that as a matter of definition respondeat superior is a form of secondary liability that can not be imposed upon the fellow employee of a wrongdoer.id.at.this made the arbitral award highly problematic because of the undisputed fact that skelly is an employee,not an officer,of the brokerage firm.id.at.we were thus faced with an award which contained an actual logical impossibility the imposition of respondeat superior liability upon a fellow employee of a wrongdoer.even though we held that this constituted manifest disregard of the law,we noted our reluctan ce to announce that the award is void outright as written,id.at,and remanded it to the arbitration panel for clarification of the basis of skelly liability.
finally,we note that raw numbers demonstrate the rarity with which we have vacated an arbitral award pursuant to the manifest disregard of law doctrine.in duferco,decided in,it was calculated that since this court has vacated some part or all of an arbitral award for manifest disregard in four out of at least cases where we applied the standard.at.to say the least,these are sobering odds 
manifest disregard of the evidence.
citing halligan piper jaffray,cir,the district court held that an arbitral award may be may be vacated on the ground of m anifest disregard of the facts when the award runs contrary to strong evidence favoring the party bringing the motion to vacate.wallace,d at we note that a number of other district courts in our circuit,directly relying on halligan or on district court authority purporting to rely on that case,have asserted the same principle.see,hakala deutsche bank ag,civ,wl at may,gwynn clubine,d,ono pharmaceutical,cortech,civ,wl at,tripi prudential securities,d raiola union bank of switzerland llc,d,gfi securities llc labandeira,civ,wl at march,mcdaniel bear stearns,d.such reliance is mistaken.
in halligan,we reviewed a district court confirmation of an arbitration award which rejected an employment discrimination claim.we reversed,finding that the award had been made in the face of overwhelming evidence that discriminatory conduct had occurred.at.this evidence included the employer admission that the claimant performance was not so unsatisfactory as to justify his discharge,and considerable circumstantial evidence that we found to be consistent only with a finding that the claimant was pushed out of his job by discriminatory animus.id.further,the arbitration panel issued no explanation for its rejection of the claim,and we concluded that any explanation it could have given would have strained credulity.id.at.we held that the district court had erred in confirming the award because the evidence in the claimant favor was so strong as to engender the firm belief that the arbitrators here manifestly disregarded the law or the evidence or both.id.
our later cases,however,have cautioned against an reading of halligan.in gms group,we noted that halligan confronted the unique concerns at issue with employment discrimination claims.at.these concerns included whether the composition of panels were to the nature of the claims,and whether employees were receiving due process in the course of arbitration.id.we concluded,however,that t hese concerns do not translate to the claims at issue in this case.id.gms group dealt with a securities fraud claim,as does the instant case.
further,in westerbeke we explicitly characterized halligan suggestion that arbitral awards may be vacated on the ground of manifest disregard of evidence as dicta.at.we explained this conclusion in the following way 
halligan presented the special circumstance in which the arbitration tribunal did not issue a written explanation of its factual findings.the reviewing court was therefore placed in the situation of attempting to discern what possible findings the arbitrators could have made that would justify their disposition of the case.unable to come up with any findings that would not strain credulity,the court concluded that the tribunal must have manifestly disregarded the law or the evidence or both.halligan,at.halligan does not stand for the proposition that factual findings put on the record by the arbitrator are subject to an independent judicial review,however.
id.first emphasis in original second emphasis added.
moreover,if a federal court is convinced that an arbitral panel has reached a merely incorrect legal is based upon an irrational application of a controlling legal court should not conduct an independent review of the factual record presented to the arbitral panel in order to achieve the correct result.in hardy,as set forth above,an arbitral panel,which had provided no explanation of its award,found an employee,skelly,to be secondarily liable based upon the principles of respondeat superior,for primary acts of securities fraud committed by his fellow employee.at.the district court,as did this court,found this to be a patently illogical holding that could not be confirmed.the district court,however,conducted its own review of the evidentiary record and concluded that a permissible view of the evidence supported the conclusion that skelly could be held primarily liable for securities fraud based upon his own conduct.id.at quotation marks omitted.we held that the district court should not have undertaken such an assessment of the evidence 
the district court correctly found that a court must confirm an arbitrator award if it is able to discern any colorable justification for the arbitrator judgment,even if that reasoning would be based on an error of fact or law.westerbeke,at.there may indeed be more than enough evidence in the record to find that skelly should have been found primarily liable.but that is not what the arbitrator judgment is in the instant case.the arbitrator judgment is that skelly was liable upon the principles of respondeat superior,and no one points us to any evidence in the record that provides a colorable justification for this conclusion.
in sum,the second circuit does not recognize manifest disregard of the evidence as proper ground for vacating an arbitrator award.success,maddy petroleum,d.we recognize only the doctrine of manifest disregard of the law,which doctrine holds that an arbitral panel legal conclusions will be confirmed in all but those instances where there is no colorable justification for a conclusion.to the extent that a federal court may look upon the evidentiary record of an arbitration proceeding at all,it may do so only for the purpose of discerning whether a colorable basis exists for the panel award so as to assure that the award can not be said to be the result of the panel manifest disregard of the law.a federal court may not conduct a reassessment of the evidentiary record,as did the district court here,upon the principle that an arbitral award may be vacated when it runs contrary to strong evidence favoring the party bringing the motion to vacate the award.wallace,d at quoting halligan,at.instead,whatever the weight of the evidence considered as a whole,i f a ground for the arbitrator decision can be inferred from the facts of the case,the award should be confirmed.fahnestock,waltman,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.only this approach to the evidentiary record is consistent with the great deference which must be paid to arbitral panels by federal courts.duferco,at.
is the award supported by a colorable justification 
control person liability.
the buttars alleged before the panel that wallace,jacaruso,and scotti were liable as control persons under both federal and north carolina law.the district court acknowledged this,d at,but it made no finding as to whether the buttars claim under north carolina law,at least as such law was presented to the panel,provides a colorable justification for the award.we find that it does and that the award should therefore be confirmed.having found that state law provides a colorable justification of liability,we express no opinion as to whether federal law does as well.
section of the federal securities and exchange act of provides for control person liability as follows 
every person who,directly or indirectly,controls any person liable under any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such controlled person to any person to whom such controlled person is liable,unless the controlled person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or cause of action.
north carolina securities regulation statutes contain an analogous provision 
every person who directly or indirectly controls a person liable under subsection a,b or of this section,every partner,officer,or director of the person,every person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions,and every dealer or salesman who materially aids in the sale is also liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as the person,unless able to sustain the burden of proof that the person did not know,and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known,of the existence of the facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist.
in their brief to the panel,the buttars,citing our opinion in sec first jersey securities,cir,stated that a prima facie case of control person liability under federal law requires a showing of a primary violation by the controlled person,control of the primary violator by the targeted defendant,and that the controlling person was in some meaningful sense a culpable participant in the fraud perpetrated by the controlled person.the buttars argued,however,that north carolina law is broader than federal law.while it may by the case under federal law that,as the district court put it,the power to direct the management and policies of a person must be a real,de facto power and not just de jure,wallace,d at,the buttars argued before the panel that this is not true unde
