introduction 
advantage medical services,llc ams,glenn weissman,elliot lander,and scott yun collectively plaintiffs and deborah hoffman and detech medical project management,llc collectively defendants claims against each other were referred to binding arbitration through the american arbitration association aaa and a hearing was held.the arbitrator issued an interim award in favor of plaintiffs.
shortly thereafter,hoffman learned that the arbitrator and his law firm represented several protection and indemnity clubs p i clubs which provided insurance and other business services to shipowners and others involved in the maritime industry.the p i clubs procured reinsurance support from syndicates of lloyd of london lloyd.ams was insured through lloyd syndicates,and a representative from lloyd was present throughout the arbitration.
the aaa rejected hoffman requests to disqualify the arbitrator.hoffman filed a petition in trial court seeking an order disqualifying the arbitrator for his failure to disclose his and his law firm ties to lloyd,and vacating the interim award,under provisions of the california arbitration act the act,codified at code of civil procedure section et.all further statutory references are to the code of civil procedure.the trial court granted the petition.
first,we hold substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that disclosure of the arbitrator and his law firm ties to ams insurer could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be able to be impartial within the meaning of section,subdivision a.the trial court therefore did not err by vacating the interim award under section.
second,we also hold the statutory right to petition a trial court to vacate an arbitration award based on an arbitrator failure to make required disclosures can not be waived by the aaa rule stating its determinations regarding disqualification are conclusive.our holding is consistent with the decision by the third district court of appeal in azteca construction,adr consulting,th,d azteca.
we modify the portion of the trial court order to delete any reference to disqualification of the arbitrator under section,subdivision a because the act does not provide for the disqualification of an arbitrator after the arbitrator has ruled on an issue of contested fact.here,the arbitrator had issued the interim award before defendants discovered the arbitrator failure to make disclosures required by the act.
we otherwise affirm the order vacating the interim award.
background 
claims against plaintiffs 
in may,hoffman demanded arbitration under the employment arbitration rules of the aaa regarding her claims against plaintiffs.she claimed,inter alia,ams failed to pay her accrued wages of plus interest and penalties,retaliated against her for asserting a wage claim and other public policy violations,breached an operating agreement,breached fiduciary responsibilities,and inflicted emotional distress.hoffman sought an accounting of books and records of ams,declaratory relief,attorney fees,indemnity,and exemplary damages.
plaintiffs claims against defendants 
in june,ams filed a complaint in orange county superior court against hoffman.the complaint alleged hoffman was a founding member of ams,a limited liability company in the business of providing high technology surgical equipment and technicians services.the complaint further alleged that for over a period,hoffman intentionally misappropriated assets of ams and the services of ams personnel.the complaint contained claims for breach of a written contract,breach of fiduciary duty,conversion,money had and received,unjust enrichment,intentional fraud and deceit,accounting,and imposition of construction trust.ams filed a first amended complaint in which it alleged the same claims,but added as an additional defendant detech medical project management,llc detech,which ams alleged was owned and controlled by hoffman.
the parties submit claims to binding arbitration before the aaa 
the trial court referred ams claims against defendants to binding arbitration before the aaa pursuant to an arbitration provision contained in the parties operating agreement.after the parties were unable to agree on the appointment of an arbitrator from the list provided by the aaa,the aaa designated william tucker of the san diego law firm,kaye,rose partners,llp kaye rose,as arbitrator the aaa distributed tucker resume and additional disclosures to the parties counsel.
arbitration proceeding 
before the arbitration began,ams counsel asked defendants counsel whether defendants would object to the presence of a representative of ams insurer at the arbitration.defendants counsel refused to agree to the presence of such a representative without first knowing the insurer identity,including the representative name,the name of the insurer,the policy number,the named insureds,and the mailing address of the insurer.ams counsel sent a letter to tucker requesting that he permit the attendance of a representative of ams insurer who is not identified in the letter to attend the arbitration.
following a hearing,tucker ruled that c overage counsel for ams insurer may attend the hearing on the motion for summary judgment and the arbitration.he also ruled,ams need not provide defendants counsel with the information relating to ams insurer which he requested of ams as a precondition to such attendance.
at the hearing before tucker on ams motion for summary judgment which tucker denied,cynthia mitchell appeared as ams insurer representative.she introduced herself as coverage counsel for lloyds of london.mitchell also attended each of the nine days of evidentiary hearing.
tucker did not inquire into the identity of the lloyd syndicates mitchell was representing,and he made no disclosures regarding any past or present ties he or kaye rose had with mitchell firm or with lloyd.
interim award 
following the arbitration,tucker issued the interim award of arbitrator the interim award in april.in the interim award,tucker rejected each of hoffman claims.he found in favor of ams on its claims for breach of the operating agreement,breach of fiduciary duty,conversion,money had and received,unjust enrichment,fraud and deceit,and accounting.he awarded ams damages in the amount of against hoffman and against detech.tucker also awarded ams its attorney fees pursuant to the attorney fees provision in the operating agreement and punitive damages that were to be determined in subsequent proceedings.
rebecca callahan is retained by hoffman callahan discovers a connection between tucker,his law firm and lloyd aaa twice denies defendants request to disqualify tucker 
defendants consulted with a bankruptcy attorney,rebecca callahan,in early may,and notified plaintiffs that callahan was associated in as counsel for defendants.callahan undertook a review of the aaa action,beginning with the relationship,if any,between tucker,the arbitration participants and their counsel.upon learning that coverage counsel representing ams insurer,lloyd,was present throughout the arbitration,callahan look ed into any relationship the arbitrator or his law firm might have,directly or indirectly,with lloyds of london.she learned that kaye rose and tucker represented major marine insurers.she also learned that tucker himself is extremely involved in the defense aspects of his law firm practice by acting as correspondent counsel for p i clubs that serve as the vehicle for providing insurance and other services to various types of shipowners.the p i clubs are directly tied to lloyd through maritime syndicates that provide the bulk of the insurance and reinsurance for shipowners around the world.
callahan alerted the aaa to the apparent disclosure problem through a notice letter calling for tucker disqualification.in a letter addressed to the aaa,dated may,tucker refused to disqualify himself from the case because he did not believe a conflict existed.in his letter,tucker stated kaye rose has represented some maritime clients who may have been insured by one or more syndicates who occupy space within the lloyds of london building,who underwrite maritime risks.he added,no syndicate at lloyds has ever been a client of kaye rose or of any firm with which i have ever been associated.on may,the aaa confirmed tucker appointment.
on june,callahan sent a second notice to the aaa seeking tucker disqualification.on june,callahan sent a letter to tucker requesting that he provide disclosures related to his and kaye rose connections to lloyd.on june,callahan sent tucker a letter requesting information regarding his and kaye rose correspondent counsel relationship with certain p i clubs.tucker did not respond to callahan inquiries.on july,the aaa reaffirmed tucker as the arbitrator in the case.
a petition is filed in the trial court,seeking an order disqualifying the arbitrator and vacating the interim award 
hoffman filed a petition for an order disqualifying the arbitrator under section,subdivision a and,and vacating the interim award under sections and,subdivision a the petition 
in support of the petition,defendants submitted,inter alia,the declaration of george biehl,an expert in the insurance and reinsurance industry.biehl declaration provided a detailed explanation of the relationship of lloyd to ams,the p i clubs,and to tucker and provided the foundation for the court order vacating the interim award.we quote biehl explanation of these relationships in detail because it provides the principal substantial evidence warranting affirmance of the trial court order vacating the interim award.
in his declaration,biehl explained that lloyd is an insurance and reinsurance market and also a legal entity that essentially markets its tradename and franchises its memberships.he further stated,lloyds is like a club in the sense that it has members who provide capital dues that is used to finance the underwriting of insurance risk in many forms.many members also act as the syndicates who actually insure and reinsure risk t here are active syndicates writing business in territories m any of those are involved in underwriting insurance and reinsurance to p i clubs and the international group an organization comprised of p i clubs,including hiscox and syndicates who underwrote of the risk insured under ams policy.
biehl further stated,w hile p i clubs offer insurance and related services to their members,they are not just an insurance company.rather,they operate as a mixture of an insurance company,a law firm and a loss adjuster.this means that the p i clubs try to assist their shipowner members with every aspect of a claim from finding experts and contractors to dealing with the immediate claim through assisting them in obtaining competent legal representation in defending against claims.the p i clubs have access to a high quality network of technical advisors,including but not limited to maritime lawyers kaye rose and william tucker and other local expert correspondents around the world.five p i clubs are listed as representative clients of kaye rose per its martindale hubbell listing and p i clubs show tucker as being their correspondent counsel in san diego,california,the person their members should call for legal services.
biehl opined,c learly tucker and kaye rose have a significant commercial and public relationships with the aforementioned p i clubs and the international group and are heavily involved with major marine insurers in the lloyds market.he added,lloyds is the major support for the p i clubs.he explained the international group of p i clubs is comprised of p i clubs as its members,eight of which have relationships with tucker and kaye rose the p i clubs provide the basic layer of insurance currently,and above that layer the p i clubs formed the international group have set up an insurance pool to cover claims in layers above that.this insurance pool covers liability between and.for liabilities above,the international group has one of the world largest reinsurance contracts and it is placed with lloyds.citing the lloyd annual report,biehl asserted the international group is a significant portion of lloyds marine business.
biehl further opined,t here is a meaningful and significant business relationship between tucker and kaye rose,on the one hand,and lloyds by virtue of their correspondent and client relationships with the p i clubs and the international group that is because the p i clubs are reinsured by various lloyds the two syndicates who are named in the ams policy for employment practices liability insurance,hiscox and brit.the international group is also deeply involved with lloyds through its significant reinsurance relationship which is one of the largest reinsurance contracts currently in place in the world reinsurance market.he stated,in addition to providing insurance for their members,the p i clubs arrange for adjustment of claims and legal counsel.correspondent counsel for a p i club is legal counsel that the clubs or their shipowner members can engage for representation in a potential loss matter.pursuant to their duty to cooperate in the defense of an insured claim,shipowner members are expected to engage correspondent counsel approved by that p i club.as discussed above,the website for kaye rose advertises that it is approved correspondent counsel for several p i clubs and the websites for several of the p i clubs reveal that tucker is the contact person at the firm for matters in the san diego area.
finally,biehl stated,f or participants in the maritime industry,which include vessel owners,cruise lines,brokers,underwriters and correspondent counsel,they are all very much aware of each other,of their respective ties to marine insurers and the predominant role lloyds and its syndicates play with respect to loss prevention and indemnification.it would be incompatible for anyone approved as a correspondent for a p i club to take actions contrary to other participants to do so would most certainly put at risk their status as approved correspondent counsel or otherwise.
plaintiffs submitted mitchell declaration in opposition to the petition.in her declaration,mitchell,who attended the arbitration,stated,a s part of my practice,i represent insurers who provide coverage through lloyd of london,commonly referred to as underwriters or syndicate members.she stated there are three syndicates that severally subscribe to the ams employment practices liability policy through lloyd the hiscox syndicate percent,the brit syndicate percent,and the harrington syndicate percent.defendants produced evidence that none of these three syndicates ever retained kaye rose legal services on any matter.
the trial court grants the petition plaintiffs appeal 
the trial court issued the following tentative ruling on the petition,stating in relevant part motion to disqualify arbitrator and vacate interim arbitration award is granted the arbitrator had a duty under ethics standard of the ethics standards for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitration and section to disclose his and his firm professional relationship with lloyds syndicates or underwriters once mitchell appeared at the arbitration hearing and advised the parties that she represented insurers who provided coverage through lloyds and that she was there in that capacity because ams had made a claim for coverage.at this point it was incumbent on the arbitrator to inquire of mitchell concerning the identities of the insurers that she represented so that he could make a determination of the possible need for further disclosure.because of the arbitrator and his firm involvement with lloyd and the fact that ams is insured through several lloyd s syndicates or underwriters and a representative of several of those firms was present at all time s during the arbitration,a person aware of these facts could reasonably entertain a doubt that the arbitrator would be able to be impartial.
following argument on the tentative ruling,the trial court made the tentative ruling its final ruling.the court also ruled on the parties various evidentiary objections 
plaintiffs appealed from the order under section,subdivision c.hoffman filed a motion to dismiss the appeal,and plaintiffs filed a writ petition as a protective measure from the order vacating the interim award,just in case this court were to grant the motion to dismiss.this court denied hoffman motion,and dismissed plaintiffs writ petition as moot.
discussion 
record supports the trial court decision to vacate the interim of review 
t he issue whether the arbitrators had a duty to disclose information which might indicate bias,is a question of fact.our review as to that issue is deferential.citation.citations.guseinov burns th,d see michael aetna life casualty ins.th,d the trier of fact determines the factual question whether a particular relationship requires disclosure in each case.citations.this court reviews the trial court factual findings relating to its vacation of the award according to the substantial evidence rule.
relevant provisions of the act and the ethics standards 
we begin our consideration of the trial court order granting the petition by reviewing the relevant provisions of the act.
section,subdivision a states in relevant part in any arbitration pursuant to an arbitration agreement,when a person is to serve as a neutral arbitrator,the proposed neutral arbitrator shall disclose all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be able to be impartial,including all of the following any matters required to be disclosed by the ethics standards for neutral arbitrators adopted by the judicial council pursuant to this chapter.any professional or significant personal relationship the proposed neutral arbitrator has or has had with any party to the arbitration proceeding or lawyer for a party.
standard d a of the california rules of court,ethics standards for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitration standards referenced in section,subdivision a,requires a person who is appointed as an arbitrator to disclose any matter even if it is not specifically enumerated in the standard,if it m ight cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the arbitrator would be able to be impartial.pursuant to standard f,the arbitrator duty to disclose is a continuing duty,applying from service of the notice of the arbitrator proposed nomination or appointment until the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding.
with regard to the disqualification of an arbitrator,section,subdivision a provides,a proposed neutral arbitrator shall be disqualified if he or she fails to comply with section and any party entitled to receive the disclosure serves a notice of disqualification within calendar days after the proposed nominee or appointee fails to comply with section.as to the vacatur of an arbitrator award,under section,subdivision a,the court shall vacate an arbitrator award if the court determines the arbitrator failed to disclose within the time required for disclosure a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was then aware.see ovitz schulman th,d on its face,the statute leaves no room for discretion.if a statutory ground for vacating the award exists,the trial court must vacate the award.
substantial evidence supports the trial court order vacating the interim award 
with the standard of review and these authorities in mind,we analyze the key issue presented in this substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that tucker had a duty to disclose his and his firm ties to lloyd upon learning ams was insured through syndicates of lloyd.for the reasons we explain,post,we hold substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that a person aware of the circumstances could reasonably entertain a doubt tucker would be able to be impartial within the meaning of section,subdivision a and standards,standard d.
we begin our explanation by highlighting the unusual and striking circumstances triggering defendants argument tucker violated his disclosure obligations.the record shows tucker granted ams request to permit a representative of its insurer to attend the arbitration without requiring ams to disclose to defendants,or apparently even to the arbitrator,the identity of such representative or the insurer itself.tucker ruled defendants were not entitled to any specific information regarding ams insurer after defendants refused to agree to the presence of the insurer representative without their first being provided identifying information.then,at the hearing on ams motion for summary judgment,mitchell stated her appearance as coverage counsel for lloyd.standard a of the standards clearly states a person who is nominated or appointed as an arbitrator must make a reasonable effort to inform himself or herself of matters that must be disclosed under standards and.nevertheless,the record shows absolutely no inquiry by tucker about the identity of the lloyd syndicates being represented by mitchell.conspicuously absent from the record is evidence of any disclosure by tucker regarding his or kaye rose involvement with lloyd in representing p i club clients.
callahan research led her to the conclusion that tucker and kaye rose represented major marine insurers and that tucker himself is extremely involved in the defense aspects of his law firm practice by acting as correspondent counsel for p i clubs that serve as the vehicle for providing insurance and other services to various types of shipowners.she concluded,s ince lloyds of london is the premiere marine insurer,it was inconceivable that an attorney and firm with such a robust maritime practice could not have ties of some sort to lloyds.
callahan wrote letters to the aaa to request tucker disqualification based on his failure to disclose his and kaye rose connections to lloyd.in tucker may,letter responding to callahan initial request for disqualification,he stated his belief that no conflict existed,and denied that he or kaye rose ever represented a syndicate of lloyd.he did not address whether he or kaye rose had any other business relationship with or connection to lloyd members or syndicates outside the context of an relationship.in june,callahan twice wrote letters to tucker requesting that he provide affirmative disclosures relating to what callahan had discovered.tucker did not respond to those letters.
with regard to tucker and kaye rose involvement with lloyd,substantial evidence was produced,principally in the biehl declaration,showing two syndicates of lloyd,hiscox and brit,underwrote percent of the ams employment practices liability insurance policy mitchell,who described herself as coverage counsel for lloyd,represented,inter alia,hiscox and brit interests in attending the arbitration hiscox and brit are involved in underwriting insurance and reinsurance to the p i clubs and the international group eight of the p i clubs that comprise the international group have a relationship with tucker and kaye rose the international group remains a significant portion of lloyds marine business and is deeply involved with lloyds through its significant reinsurance relationship which is one of the largest reinsurance contracts currently in place in the world reinsurance market kaye rose advertises that it is approved correspondent counsel for several p i clubs and tucker is the contact person for matters in the san diego area participants in the maritime industry are all very much aware of each other,of their respective ties to marine insurers and the predominant role lloyds and its syndicates play with respect to loss prevention and indemnification and i t would be incompatible for anyone approved as a correspondent for a p i club to take actions contrary to other participants to do so would most certainly put at risk their status as approved correspondent counsel or otherwise.
the record shows none of the above important information was disclosed by tucker at any time.significantly,none of the information was disclosed by him despite specific requests to identify mitchell and tucker duty of inquiry mandated by section,subdivision a,through its incorporation of standard a of the standards discussed,ante.because the substantial evidence catalogued,ante,could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that tucker would be able t
