section arbitration provision 
generally,an insurance carrier owes a duty to defend its insured against third party claims covered under an indemnity policy.buss superior court cal th,d,montrose chemical superior court cal th,d.this includes the duty to provide competent defense counsel and to pay all reasonable legal fees and costs.transport indemnity cal th,d,gray cary ware freidenrich vigilant ins.th,d gray cary.where an insurer provides a defense under a reservation of rights,however,a conflict of interest may arise between the insurer and its insured.cumis,supra,d at.in such a case,the insurer has a duty to provide its insured with independent counsel of the insured choosing cumis counsel.id.at.
in,the legislature codified the cumis decision by enacting section.stats,ch.subdivision c of the statute includes a provision concerning the arbitration of attorney fees disputes 
when the insured has selected independent counsel to represent him or her,the insurer may exercise its right to require that the counsel selected by the insured possess certain minimum qualifications which may include that the selected counsel have at least five years of civil litigation practice which includes substantial defense experience in the subject at issue in the litigation,and errors and omissions coverage.the insurer obligation to pay fees to the independent counsel selected by the insured is limited to the rates which are actually paid by the insurer to attorneys retained by it in the ordinary course of business in the defense of similar actions in the community where the claim arose or is being defended.this subdivision does not invalidate other different or additional policy provisions pertaining to attorney fees or providing for methods of settlement of disputes concerning those fees.any dispute concerning attorney fees not resolved by these methods shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration by a single neutral arbitrator selected by the parties to the dispute,subd.c,italics added.
ii.standard of review 
this appeal raises the issue of whether section,subdivision c requires arbitration of any of the claims or issues set forth in compulink complaint against paul.the trial court denied paul petition to compel arbitration based on its interpretation of the scope of section mandatory arbitration provision.the proper interpretation of a statute,and its application to undisputed facts,presents a question of law that is subject to de novo review.see gray cary,supra,th at,d applying de novo review to issue of whether section,subdivision c encompasses disputes over legal expenses handy first interstate bank th,d handy applying de novo review to question of whether section,subdivision c requires arbitration of disputes over an insurer duty to defend.
the rules governing statutory interpretation are.we begin with the fundamental principle that t he objective of statutory construction is to determine the intent of the enacting body so that the law may receive the interpretation that best effectuates that intent.citation.fitch select products cal th,d.to ascertain that intent,we turn first to the words of the statute,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.citations.nolan city of anaheim cal th,d.the statute every word and clause should be given effect so that no part or provision is rendered meaningless or inoperative.manufacturers life ins.superior court cal th,d,dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.moreover,a statute is not to be read in isolation,but construed in context and with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect.citations.landrum superior court cal d.if the statutory language is unambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citations.people toney cal th,cal th,d,where the statute is clear,courts will not interpret away clear language in favor of an ambiguity that does not exist.citation.
iii.section,subdivision c requires arbitration of any issues concerning the amount of cumis fees owed by paul.
paul relies primarily on the plain language of the statute in arguing that section,subdivision c requires the parties to arbitrate the issue of the attorney fees allegedly owed for compulink defense by independent cumis counsel.compulink,on the other hand,asserts that the case law interpreting section,subdivision c is controlling and holds that arbitration is required only in cases where the sole issue is independent counsel billing rate or hours.we turn first to the language of the statute.
section,subdivision c provides,in pertinent part,that a ny dispute concerning attorney fees not resolved by an alternative dispute resolution procedure set forth in the policy shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration by a single neutral arbitrator selected by the parties to the dispute.the language of the statute is clear.it requires arbitration of any and all cumis fee disputes unless the parties insurance policy provides for an alternative dispute resolution procedure.on its face,section does not contain an exception for fee disputes in cases where other claims or issues also are alleged.it accordingly does not exempt from arbitration cumis fee disputes that are coupled with additional bad faith claims.as this division has recognized with respect to section,the california legislature has spoken.it has decided that within the california courts these cumis fee issues are to be decided in an arbitration forum,not the state judicial forum.caiafa,th at,d,italics in original.
we recently affirmed this principle in long century indemnity th,d long.in long,an insured cumis counsel sued the insurer for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing based on the insurer failure to pay the attorney full hourly rate for his independent representation of the insured.id.at,d.we held that section arbitration provision applied to the parties fee dispute notwithstanding the insurer decision to forgo retention of counsel to represent its own interests in the third party suit.id.at,d.in so doing,we noted that cumis counsel appropriate remedy was to file a petition to compel arbitration because section,subdivision c does not confer jurisdiction on the courts to hear disputes over cumis fees.id.at,d.rather,based on the plain language of the statute,a ny dispute concerning attorney fees to be paid cumis counsel must be submitted to arbitration unless an alternative dispute resolution procedure is required by the insurance policy,subd.c.id.at,d.
compulink contends that requiring arbitration of any part of its dispute with paul would be contrary to the holdings in younesi,supra,th,d,and caiafa,supra,th,d.in younesi,an insurer filed a state court action against its insured cumis counsel,asserting claims for fraud,malpractice,and conversion.younesi,supra,th at,d.the gravamen of the complaint was that cumis counsel had engaged in a scheme of fraudulent billing practices.ibid.the trial court denied cumis counsel motion to compel arbitration under section,subdivision c,and division four of this district affirmed.id.at,d.the appellate court acknowledged that attorney fees were a central issue in the case,but reasoned that this is not merely a dispute about billing rates because the complaint also included allegations of malpractice and fraud.id.at,d.the court then concluded that the language of civil code section can only be interpreted to limit the scope of arbitrable disputes to those in which only the amount of legal fees or the hourly billing rates are at issue.id.at,d.because the complaint alleged claims beyond a mere attorney fees dispute,the court held that section arbitration provision did not apply to the action at all.ibid.
in reaching its holding about the scope of section,subdivision c,the court of appeal in younesi relied on this division decision in caiafa,supra,th,d.in caiafa,an insurer brought a federal action against its insured cumis counsel for fraud.id.at,d.it alleged that cumis counsel violated the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico by submitting fraudulent billings and undertaking unnecessary legal work.ibid.while the federal action was pending,cumis counsel filed a petition in state court to compel arbitration of its unpaid attorney fees.id.at,d.the insurer opposed the petition,arguing that the state court proceeding should be stayed pending resolution of the federal rico action.id.at,d.the trial court denied the petition and granted the stay,and we affirmed.ibid.
the issue before us in caiafa was whether the trial court abused its discretion in staying a state court action in favor of a pending federal court action between substantially identical parties affecting the same subject matter.because the case directly concerned the relationship between state and federal courts,we rejected cumis counsel argument that the issue on appeal was the same as whether the trial court could stay this mandatory arbitration in favor of some other state court proceeding,which proceeding sought to resolve the same issue through some means other than arbitration.caiafa,supra,th at,d.we explained that i f the only issue in dispute truly was the amount of cumis counsel fees the insurance company owed,it would be improper,in most circumstances at least,for a trial court to stay the arbitration proceeding mandated under section in order to allow a judicial proceeding in the california courts to decide that issue and that issue alone.but this is an entirely different issue than the propriety of staying a section arbitration while a federal court decides a case involving those same cumis counsel fees.ibid.
we then addressed the distinction between cumis fee disputes filed in state court and those filed in federal court.we recognized that section requirement that such fee disputes be resolved in arbitration is binding only on california courts.as such,within the california courts these cumis fee issues are to be decided in an arbitration forum,not the state judicial forum.caiafa,supra,th at,d.federal actions involving cumis fee issues,on the other hand,are not subject to section arbitration procedure.instead,federal courts retain the power to decide these and any other issues,when properly before them,through any dispute resolution method the federal statutes and rules provide.id.at,d.applying these principles to the trial court stay order,we noted that the federal action was filed prior to the state action and raised issues much broader than the amount of cumis counsel fees.id.at,d.we therefore held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the federal fraud trial is a better forum for deciding the full range of issues bearing on this subject matter than would a section hearing before a single arbitrator.id.at,d.
the younesi court appeared to read caiafa as holding that a fraud trial,whether held in state or federal court,is a better forum for deciding cumis fee disputes that are pursued in an action that also asserts fraud claims.younesi,supra,th at,d.we disagree.the decision in caiafa was based on principles of comity between state and federal courts,not whether a trial court is a better forum than arbitration for resolving disputes over cumis fees.indeed,we expressly noted in caiafa that the fact the subject matter of this dispute,if decided in the state court,would necessarily be resolved through mandatory arbitration is entirely irrelevant in answering the question of the state cou
