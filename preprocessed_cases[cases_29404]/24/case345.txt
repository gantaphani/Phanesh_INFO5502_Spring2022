opinion of the court 
this appeal by an employee from a district court order compelling arbitration of her employment discrimination claims requires us to determine whether the entire arbitration agreement between her and her employer was vitiated when the court voided the agreement attorney fees and arbitration costs provision for offending federal statutes and ruling case law.after making the excisions,the court ordered the discrimination issues to arbitration.we affirm.

the essence of the disputed contract is an agreement to settle employment disputes through binding arbitration.gannon circuit city stores,cir.accordingly,we agree with the district court that t he provisions regarding payment of arbitration costs and attorney fees represent only a part of the agreement and can be severed without disturbing the primary intent of the parties to arbitrate their disputes.spinetti serv.int l,d opinion and order of court hereinafter op.quoting gannon,at.you do cut down the trunk of a tree because some of its branches are sickly.
appellant maryann spinetti began working for service corporation international sci as a sales counselor on april.on may,sci presented spinetti with a document described as a new personnel policy,but labeled principles of employment agreement.the employer told spinetti to sign the agreement in order to acknowledge receipt.after a cursory review,she signed the document,and both parties became bound by it.
her employment was terminated on or about october.the circumstances underlying the termination are irrelevant to the issue on appeal,but essentially involve allegations that spinetti engaged in inappropriate conduct including treating staff abusively,throwing an object at a and using vulgar language.she subsequently filed this lawsuit alleging that sci terminated her employment because of her age and gender in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et,and the adea,et.sci moved to dismiss the complaint and compel arbitration.
before the district court,spinetti contended that the arbitration agreement was not enforceable because it prevented her from fully and effectively vindicating her adea and title vii rights.she grounded this argument in the legal provision of the arbitration agreement which required that each party pay its own costs and attorney fees,regardless of the outcome of the arbitration and that each party pay of the compensation to be paid to the arbitrator s,as well as of any other costs relating to the administration of the arbitration proceeding.agreeing with spinetti that these requirements offended ruling case law and federal statutes,the district court severed the attorney fee and costs provision from the arbitration agreement.however,the district court also granted sci motion to dismiss,and compelled the parties to proceed to an arbitration which was to be governed by the remaining provisions of the agreement,relevant case law and the statutory guidelines of title vii and adea.spinetti appeals the district court determination and argues that inasmuch as the attorney fees and costs provision is deemed contrary to law,the court should have voided the entire arbitration agreement instead of merely trimming its offensive portions.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to,and converted the appellee motion to dismiss and compel arbitration into a motion for summary judgment.it granted appellee motion,ordered the parties to proceed with arbitration and instructed the court clerk to mark the case closed.this decision is final within the meaning of faa,a,and we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.green tree,at.holding that an order compelling arbitration and dismissing all other claims is final and immediately appealable blair scott specialty gases,cir same.appellant filed a timely appeal.we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.id.at.
the agreement was designed to resolve disputes between sci and its employees through arbitration rather than courtroom litigation.with limited exclusions,not applicable here,the agreement stated that all disputes relating to any aspect of employee employment with the company shall be resolved by binding arbitration,including claims brought by the employee against sci and claims by sci against the employee.agreement from sci central region on principals of employment,form.the agreement directs that an arbitrator shall apply the statutes,rules or regulations governing arbitrations in the state in which the employee is or most recently was employed by sci in this case,pennsylvania.absent such guidance,the agreement provided,the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the employment arbitration rules of the american arbitration association.in the event of any inconsistency between the agreement and the statutes,rules or regulations to be applied,the terms of the agreement shall apply.id.at.
most notably,the agreement contains the following provision relating to legal fees and arbitration costs 
each party may retain legal counsel and shall pay its own costs and attorney fees,regardless of the outcome of the arbitration.each party shall pay of the compensation to be paid to the arbitrator s,as well as of any other costs relating to the administration of the arbitration proceeding,room rental,court reporter.
id.at.the agreement has no severability clause and provides that no provision pertaining to arbitration may be modified except by a written agreement signed by both employee and the company.
the district court properly determined that the proviso requiring each party to pay its own attorney fees regardless of the outcome of the arbitration runs counter to statutory provisions under title vii and adea that permit an award of attorney fees and costs to a prevailing party.k b,b see also christiansburg garment eeoc,d holding that under title vii it is clear that a prevailing plaintiff ordinarily is to be awarded attorney fees in all but special circumstances.it is well established that arbitration is merely a choice of dispute resolution and does not infringe upon statutory protections.mitsubishi motors soler,d.therefore,i f arbitration is to offer claimants the full scope of remedies available under title vii,arbitrators in title vii cases,just like courts,must be guided by christiansburg and must ordinarily grant attorney fees to prevailing claimants rather than be restricted by private contractual language.morrison circuit city stores,cir 
the court then embarked on a inquiry into whether the arbitration costs facing spinetti offended the policy mandating that t he arbitration of statutory claims be accessible to potential litigants as well as adequate to protect the rights in question so that arbitration,like the judicial resolution of disputes,will further broader social purposes.morrison,at,quoting gilmer lane,d.we are satisfied that the district court analysis properly followed the teachings of green tree on how to decide if a provision in an arbitration agreement denies potential litigants the opportunity to vindicate their statutory rights.
a party seeking to invalidate an arbitration agreement because arbitration would be prohibitively expensive bears the burden of showing this likelihood.green tree,at.although green tree does not provide us with a standard for how detailed the showing of prohibitive expenses must be to support the conclusion that the provision,at minimum,is unenforceable,several courts have taken a stab at outlining the proper formula.morrison,at quotation omitted holding that potential litigants must be given the opportunity to demonstrate that potential costs are great enough to deter them and similarly situated individuals from seeking to vindicate their federal statutory rights see also bradford rockwell semiconductor,cir stating that the appropriate inquiry is one that focuses on the claimant ability to pay the arbitration fees and costs and whether these are substantial enough to deter the bringing of claims.we conclude that the district court adequately determined that spinetti met her burden.
spinetti was required to pay an initial,filing fee of to the american arbitration association,an additional filing fee of,a fee of,an additional charge of for each day of the hearing and half the cost of an arbitrator.evidence disclosed that a arbitrator in western pennsylvania charges approximately an hour with a minimum.
although spinetti was earning a year when employed by sci,she was unemployed for six months following her termination.when she found new employment she says she was earning less than per week while her monthly expenses for food and rent totaled approximately.to cover the deficit between income and expenses,spinetti had taken cash advances from her credit cards.on the basis of this record,the district court determined that spinetti has adequately demonstrated that the costs associated with arbitrating her claims are prohibitive.op.at.
we make clear what was implicit in the district court order to compel arbitration,the court intended that the employer pay all costs of arbitration and final responsibility for attorney fees should be governed by the appropriate statute be it either title vii or adea.logically,within the rubric of a disjunctive proposition,no other alternative can be inferred.the disjuncts are that the employer or employee or both,must pay.because the court ruled out the employee on the basis that she could not afford to pay,ergo,the employer must.see,giordano pep,moe jack,wl,holding that,because the plaintiff could not,the defendant was to bear the costs of arbitration in addition to the filing fees in excess of the cost of filing a complaint in federal court our analysis must now turn to the federal policy favoring arbitration.
congress enacted the faa to reverse the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration agreements and to place arbitration agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.gilmer,at.section specifically provides that a written provision in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.the act has been interpreted to possess the primary purpose of enforcing private contractual agreements to arbitrate.see,mitsubishi,at.dean witter reynolds,byrd,d.to that end,the act provides that where a party to an arbitration agreement fails,neglects,or refuses to submit a matter to arbitration,the other party may seek to compel arbitration.
in gilmer,the court upheld an arbitration agreement of a claim under the adea and stated that the statutory substantive rights are unaffected by the choice of dispute resolution.at.the court further noted that s o long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate his or her statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum,the statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function.id.at.quoting mitsubishi,at.

finally,in circuit city stores,adams,d,the court resolved any lingering question concerning the faa applicability to arbitration agreements in the employment context.it held that with a limited exception not applicable here,arbitration agreements covering claims fall within the faa provisions.id.at.holding that in the employment context only contracts of employment of transportation workers are exempted from the faa coverage.
it is against this backdrop of federal arbitration policy that we continue our analysis.
under the faa,federal arbitration policy must be implemented in with a determination of contract validity under state law.first options,at.we therefore turn to whether,under pennsylvania contract law,the stricken portions of the arbitration agreement can be considered the essential part of the bargain.deibler,at.we have no difficulty in concluding that the primary purpose of the arbitration bargain entered into by spinetti and sci was not to regulate costs or attorney fees.instead,it was designed to provide a mechanism to resolve disputes 
w e recognize that disputes may arise from time to time,which must be resolved in a fair and efficient manner.in order to ensure equitable,efficient and resolution of these matters,disputes will be resolved by arbitration 
having decided that the satellite issues of costs and attorney fees may not be the tail wagging the dog,we must now ascertain the policy of pennsylvania courts in granting partial enforcement of a contract.in the context of restrictive covenants,c ase law empowers pennsylvania courts to grant partial enforcement of an overbroad covenant either by excising offensive portions of the covenant or by adding language.bell fuel cattolico,citing sidco paper aaron,mobile frame hoot,the man who wildly claims that he owns all the cherry trees in the country can not be denied protection of the orchard in his back yard.
section of the restatement first of contracts provides support for pennsylvania law 
a bargain that is illegal only because of a promise or a provision for a condition,disregard of which will not defeat the primary purpose of the bargain,can be enforced with the omission of the illegal portion by a party to the bargain who is not guilty of serious moral turpitude unless this result is prohibited by statute.recovery is more readily allowed where there has been part performance of the legal portion of the bargain.

section of the restatement second of contracts contains the following similar language 
if less than all of an agreement is unenforceable under the rule stated in,a court may nevertheless enforce the rest of the agreement in favor of a party who did not engage in serious misconduct if the performance as to which the agreement is unenforceable is not an essential part of the agreed exchange.

in forbes forbes,the court cited of the restatement first of contracts in holding that an illegal provision collecting wages in a family settlement contract did not defeat the primary purpose of the agreement which was to provide for the support and maintenance of a spouse.similarly,in huber huber,the court relied on of the restatement second of contractss in ruling that an illegal attempt to condition enforcement of a agreement upon the award of an uncontested divorce to one of the parties did not defeat the remaining provisions of a contract which contained the essential purpose of providing support for the couple children.
