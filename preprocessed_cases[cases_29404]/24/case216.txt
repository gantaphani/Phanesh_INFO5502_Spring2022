this appeal concerns the interaction between a broad agreement between the parties to arbitrate their disputes and a series of agreements that one party asserts vitiate that understanding.appellant bank julius baer,appeals from an interlocutory order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,hellerstein,refusing to stay the of appellee waxfield.the district court concluded that merger and forum selection clauses contained in a series of contracts superseded broad language in an earlier document.because we believe,consistent with our general policy of interpreting contracts in favor of arbitration,that those clauses do not alter the scope of the initial arbitration agreement,we vacate and remand.
this appeal arises out of litigation concerning a complicated scheme to defraud perpetrated by yehuda shiv,a private investment advisor.the facts underlying shiv case are not particularly relevant we recapitulate them here only to illustrate where this appeal fits into the larger context.
on september,waxfield,a british virgin islands corporation wholly owned by baruch and neomy ivcher,opened an account with the bank by executing two agreements,entitled acknowledgments and and arbitration and acknowledgments and and security agreement referred to as,respectively,the arbitration agreement and the credit agreement.shiv,along with the ivchers,possessed general power of attorney over waxfield,and all three allegedly executed these agreements 
on october,shiv alone via his power of attorney executed three third party collateral deposit agreements,known as pledge agreements.together,the pledge agreements pledged the assets in the waxfield account as collateral for loans by the bank to three entities sydney plastics,eclectic holdings,and sagam.
allegedly,the pledge agreements were fraudulent in that they made no business sense for waxfield,but rather were part of an ongoing scheme by shiv,who had an interest in the various sagam entities.as part of this scheme,shiv misrepresented the balances of clients accounts,transferred money between client accounts to conceal his misrepresentations,charged inflated fees based on the misrepresented balances,and transferred client funds to related and unrelated third parties,including sagam.
in december,the securities and exchange commission sec charged shiv and sagam with securities fraud.see sec shiv,d.a december,preliminary injunction froze sagam assets and appointed a receiver,arthur steinberg,to identify the funds shiv misappropriated and to repatriate them to their rightful owners.shiv ultimately settled the enforcement action,disgorged most of his personal assets,and subsequently pleaded guilty to criminal securities fraud and received a sentence of months.he died in prison.
in march,steinberg the sagam receiver filed the case below as ancillary to the overall receivership proceedings to recover the assets behind the sagam accounts.the receiver named the bank and waxfield as defendants,alleging that certain liens on and property interests in the sagam accounts should be avoided on fraudulent conveyance grounds.waxfield then answered,including filing against the bank for breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,conversion,negligence,and equitable relief,among other things.the kernel of waxfield allegations is that the bank was complicit in shiv contention with which steinberg agrees.
the bank responded to the by moving for a stay pending arbitration,citing an agreement to arbitrate contained in the original documents.by oral decision rendered on november,and memorialized in a summary opinion dated the same day,the district court denied the bank motion,holding that provisions of the pledge agreements superseded the arbitration clause.
this appeal followed.
we have jurisdiction over the bank interlocutory appeal pursuant to the federal arbitration act faa.see cpr usa spray,cir i f the application to compel arbitration is embedded in a broader action in which one party or the other seeks some relief other than an order requiring or prohibiting arbitration then orders denying arbitration are immediately appealable.emphasis omitted.we review de novo the district court decision on arbitrability.see gold deutsche aktiengesellschaft,cir.

in deciding whether a dispute is arbitrable,we must answer two questions whether the parties agreed to arbitrate,and,if so,whether the scope of that agreement encompasses the claims at issue.campaniello imports,saporiti italia,cir.consistent with the strong federal policy in favor of arbitration,any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver,delay,or a like defense to arbitrability.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.
applying these principles,we have no trouble concluding that,at least at some point,waxfield and the bank agreed to arbitrate all claims.the arbitration agreement contains a general obligation by the parties to subject any disagreement between them to mediation,and,failing that,to arbitration 
upon the termination of mediation,any unresolved dispute,controversy or claim arising out of or relating to any business relationship between waxfield and the bank,including but not limited to any dispute,controversy or claim with regard to any agreement,the breach thereof or any account or transaction waxfield has with the bank,shall be settled by arbitration and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator s may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
emphasis added.the credit agreement,executed contemporaneously with the arbitration agreement,contains similar language.
these provisions mean that if the arbitration agreement is still in force,waxfield and the bank must arbitrate the instant dispute.complications arise from the pledge agreements,ratified a month later,which contain language that according to the district court supersedes the agreement to arbitrate.of particular importance are two clauses in the pledge agreements,a merger clause and a forum selection clause.the merger clause provides 
this agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between waxfield and the bank.it constitutes the entire agreement of the parties.
the forum selection clause provides 
without limiting the right of the bank to bring any action or proceeding against waxfield in the courts of other jurisdictions,waxfield hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any new york state or federal court sitting in new york city,and waxfield hereby irrevocably agrees that any action may be heard and determined in such new york state court or in such federal court.waxfield hereby irrevocably waives,to the fullest extent it may effectively do so,the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action in any jurisdiction.
emphasis added.finally,also relevant is an incorporation clause in the pledge agreements that provides 
without exception,all the rights and remedies provided in this agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided under any other agreement or by law or in equity.
