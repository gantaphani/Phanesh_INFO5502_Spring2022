ii.facts and procedural background 
plaintiffs filed a complaint on october,against osborne,alleging the homes they purchased from osborne suffered from construction defects in design and workmanship,including,among other things,problems from soil movement foundation deficiencies plumbing leaks stucco,window,and roof problems finish problems relating to cabinets,floor tiles,and countertops and problems with the framing and electrical,heating,plumbing,and ventilation systems.the complaint alleged causes of action for strict liability,breach of the implied warranty of merchantability,breach of the purchase agreement,negligence,and breach of warranty.
osborne answered the complaint in march on july,osborne filed a motion to compel arbitration as to certain plaintiffs 
in support of the motion,osborne contended that certain plaintiffs had entered into an enforceable arbitration agreement.osborne provided evidence that osborne participated in a new home warranty program administered by home buyers warranty corporation hbw.under the program,osborne,as the builder,enrolled new homes by paying hbw an enrollment fee and mailing to hbw a builder application for home enrollment builder application form signed by the homebuyer and the builder.the builder application stated,by signing below,you acknowledge that you have read the builder copy of the warranty booklet,and consent to the terms of these documents including the binding arbitration provision contained therein.
after hbw accepted homes for enrollment in the warranty program,hbw issued warranty booklets to the homeowners.the hbw warranty booklet provided,any and all claims,disputes and controversies by or between the homeowner,the builder,the warranty insurer hbw,or any combination of the foregoing,arising from or related to this warranty,to the subject home,to any defect in or to the subject home or the real property on which the subject home is situated,or the sale of the subject home by the builder,including without limitation,any claim of breach of contract,negligent or intentional misrepresentation or nondisclosure in the inducement,execution or performance of any contract,including this arbitration agreement,and breach of any alleged duty of good faith and fair dealing,shall be submitted to arbitration this arbitration agreement shall inure to the benefit of,and be enforceable by,the builder subcontractors,agents and any other person whom the homeowner contends is responsible for any defect in or to the subject home or the real property on which the subject home is situated this arbitration agreement shall be deemed to be a arbitration agreement.any disputes concerning the interpretation or the enforceability of this arbitration agreement,including without limitation,its revocability or voidability for any cause,the scope of arbitrable issues,and any defense based upon waiver,estoppel or laches,shall be decided by the arbitrator.
plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to compel arbitration.plaintiffs stated they had purchased their homes based upon purchase and sale agreements which they entered into before construction of their homes.the purchase and sale agreements contained an arbitration provision limited to the deposit of funds in escrow.at or shortly before the close of escrow,plaintiffs were presented with the builder application.in addition,plaintiffs received an osborne development corporation homeowner policy which contained a limited warranty,but which did not contain an arbitration agreement.a few weeks after moving into their homes,plaintiffs received a copy of a home buyers warranty which contained the arbitration provisions and which purported to disclaim any and all other warranties provided by the builder.in addition to the provisions governing arbitration set forth above,the warranty booklet purported to limit plaintiffs rights and remedies as follows 
t he warranty insurer will not accept,nor will the arbitrator be able to award to you,any claimed structural defect that you have had repaired or replaced.in addition,you will not be reimbursed for any costs or expenses you undertake to investigate a structural defect such as,but not limited to,engineering and attorney fees.
all other express or implied warranties,including any oral or written statements or representations made by your builder or any other person,and any implied warranty of habitability,merchantability or fitness,are hereby disclaimed by your builder and hereby waived by you.in addition,you are waiving the right to seek damages or other legal or equitable remedies from your builder,his subcontractors,and materialmen,under any other common law or statutory theory of liability,including but not limited to negligence and strict liability.your only remedy in the event of a defect in or to your home or in or to the real property on which your home is situated is the coverage provided to you under this express limited warranty.
no arbitration proceeding shall involve more than one detached dwelling 
the warranty booklet specifically excluded a variety of legal claims,including claims for n oncompliance with plans and specifications violations of local or national building codes,ordinances or standards and a ny condition which has not resulted in actual physical damage to your home.
the arbitration agreement purports to be enforceable against the homeowners by nonparties as follows the builder subcontractors,agents,vendors,suppliers,design professionals,insurers and any other person whom the homeowner contends is responsible for any defect in or to the subject home or the real property on which the subject home is situated.
the warranty booklet provides the arbitration agreement is to be governed by the rules of construction arbitration services,cas or some other unnamed arbitration service of hbw own choosing.under the cas rules,cas is granted the sole discretion to select the arbitrator and to set the locale of the arbitration,and the arbitrator may decide the date,time,and place of all hearings and the scope of discovery.
a number of the individual plaintiffs filed declarations stating they had signed the builder application without reading it osborne cites one such declaration as representative.in that declaration,plaintiff thomas baker stated.at no time was i ever advised to review a builder copy of the warranty booklet.at the time i executed the builder application for home enrollment it was included among numerous other documents which i was signing in the days before the purchase of my home was set to close.i was not advised to review any materials relating to the home warranty or given any information verbally about the hbw home warranty.a few weeks after moving into my home,i received in the mail some materials from home buyers warranty.these materials included a warranty booklet.this was the first time i had ever seen the warranty booklet.at no time prior to learning of the present motion to compel arbitration did i ever know that the application for home warranty was actually intended by hbw to be a waiver of my rights against osborne.at no time did i understand that the application for home warranty included a provision to arbitrate any claims i may have in the future against osborne.had i known that these documents that purported to be a warranty were actually intended to be a waiver of claims against osborne,i would not have signed the builder application for home enrollment.
following a hearing,the trial court denied the motion to compel arbitration.the trial court found that it,rather than the arbitrator,would decide if the arbitration agreement were enforceable.the court explained,w hether a particular arbitration agreement is unconscionable is a gateway issue that a court decides,rather than an arbitrator,unless the arbitration agreement at issue clearly reserves that decision for the arbitrator.the arbitration agreement here does not clearly provide that issues of enforceability are to be decided
