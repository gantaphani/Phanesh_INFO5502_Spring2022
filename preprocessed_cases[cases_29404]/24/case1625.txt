this is an appeal from a judgment confirming an arbitration award.the appeal rests on a claim that the arbitrators exceeded their authority.at issue are two provisions of the award,both drawn from the parties terminated agreement and both governing future controversies.the challenged provisions compel further arbitration and permit an award of attorneys fees in the event of future disputes over the arbitration award.we conclude that the arbitrators acted within the scope of their powers in including the arbitration and fee provisions in the award.we therefore affirm the judgment.
facts and procedural history 
the parties to this proceeding are ajida technologies,respondent and roos instruments,and mark roos collectively,appellant.this dispute arose out of the parties joint marketing and development agreement jmda or the agreement.
the agreement contemplated that appellant and respondent would work together to develop and market a microwave measurement system for testing integrated circuits.under the terms of the agreement,each party bore equal responsibility for the venture.by the same token,the parties were to share equally in any benefits from the resulting technology,both during the term of the agreement and for five years after its termination.the agreement required the parties to submit disputes to binding arbitration and empowered the arbitrators to determine and award attorneys fees and costs.
after signing the agreement,the parties began developing a device,the ri.the first unit was sold in.as development efforts increased,appellant hired additional employees to work on the project,while respondent contributed the services of two of its employees.
eventually,disputes arose.among other things,the parties disagreed about control of the joint venture and about the value of their respective contributions to the project.by september,the parties relationship had irretrievably broken down.appellant terminated the agreement and locked respondents employees out of its facility.respondent sought arbitration.
as contemplated by the agreement,the parties selected a panel of three arbitrators the panel commenced a hearing on the parties claims in march.the following month,the panel issued an interim award,which resolved some issues while reserving others for further hearing.the arbitrators then conducted a second hearing in early july.later that month,the panel issued a tentative final award.thereafter,the parties submitted argument in a prearranged telephone conference and by subsequent letter briefs.
the panel issued a final award in august,which expressly recognized that the parties agreement had been terminated in september.the award directed appellant to pay respondent specified damages,attorneys fees,royalties,inventory payments,interest,interest,and costs.it also required appellant to diligently develop and market the ri,and to make royalty payments to respondent as specified for five years from termination.in light of the award royalty and provisions,the arbitrators gave each party certain audit rights.finally,as pertinent here,the arbitrators ruled that the provisions in the agreement for arbitration and attorneys fees would apply to any future disputes arising out of the award 
after receiving the final award,appellant requested the panel to clarify,correct,and modify it in several respects.first,appellant sought clarification of a royalty provision.more significantly,appellant asked the panel to strike the provisions of the award that carried forward the contractual arbitration and attorneys fees clauses.in support of that request,appellant argued that there was no contractual basis for ordering either party to submit to any future arbitration or to pay attorneys fees,in light of the panel acknowledgment that the agreement had been terminated.in response to appellant requests,the panel corrected the royalty provision but refused to delete the arbitration and fee clauses from the award.in september,the arbitrators issued and served their final award,as corrected 
respondent immediately petitioned the trial court to confirm the award.in response,appellant requested the court to correct the award prior to confirmation by eliminating the arbitration and attorneys fees clauses.in seeking correction of the award,appellant argued that inclusion of the challenged clauses exceeded the arbitrators powers.the trial court disagreed and granted respondent petition to confirm the award in its entirety,without correction.the court later entered its formal judgment confirming the award in may.
this timely appeal followed.
issues on appeal 
appellant sole claim on appeal is that the trial court erred in refusing to correct the arbitration award.to resolve that claim,we must determine whether the arbitrators exceeded their authority in extending the arbitration and fee provisions from the parties terminated contract to future controversies.
in addition to the issue raised by appellant,we are called upon to decide whether respondent is entitled to attorneys fees on appeal.
appealability 
after submission of the parties briefs on appeal,we requested further briefing on the issue of whether appellant is an aggrieved party under code of civil procedure,section one is considered aggrieved whose rights or interests are injuriously affected by the judgment.citations.appellant interest must be immediate,pecuniary,and substantial and not nominal or a remote consequence of the judgment.county of alameda carleson cal d,life county of los angeles d.radunich basso d.compare ely frisbie cal.
at the time of our request for additional briefing,the record did not disclose any current dispute between the parties that might result in an order to arbitrate or the imposition of attorneys fees.for that reason,it appeared that any adverse consequence of the challenged judgment would be so remote or contingent as to render our opinion advisory.but in further briefing,the parties have informed us of a pending controversy,which respondent seeks to arbitrate,concerning the scope of the parties audit rights under the award.both parties assert that appellant is an aggrieved party within the meaning of section,and both parties request us to consider this appeal on its merits.
we are mindful of appellant observation that section is a remedial statute,which should be liberally construed,with any doubts resolved in favor of the right to appeal.aries dev.california coastal zone conservation com.d.more to the point,we are persuaded that respondent attempts to compel further arbitration result in an immediate adverse impact on appellant.we therefore agree that appellant is an aggrieved party within the meaning of the statute,with the right to seek review of the judgment at this time.
having concluded that the judgment is appealable,we turn to a consideration of this appeal on its merits.
standard of review 
it is well settled that the scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely narrow.citations.california faculty superior court th,d accord,board of education round valley teachers cal th,d.in determining whether private arbitrators have exceeded their powers,the courts must accord substantial deference to the arbitrators own assessments of their contractual authority advanced micro devices,intel cal th,d.nevertheless,except where the parties have conferred upon the arbiter the unusual power of determining his own jurisdiction citation,the courts retain the ultimate authority to overturn awards as beyond the arbitrator powers,whether for an unauthorized remedy or decision on an unsubmitted issue.id.at,d.guided by these standards,this court conducts a de novo review,independently of the trial court,of the question whether the arbitrator exceeded the authority granted him by the parties agreement to arbitrate.citation.california faculty superior court,supra,th at,d compare,pierotti torian th,d.in undertaking our review,however,we must draw every reasonable inference to support the award.citations.pierotti torian,supra,th at,d.

discussion 
a.did the arbitrators exceed their authority by compelling future arbitration 
as a starting point for our analysis,we accept appellant basic premise that a party can not be compelled to arbitrate without its consent.it is beyond cavil that arbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.steelworkers warrior gulf,d accord,freeman state farm mut.auto.ins.cal d,renaissance hotel associates th,d.
the question here is whether appellant initial agreement to arbitrate survived termination of the contract.neither party has cited any california authority that squarely answers that exact question,nor has our independent research disclosed any.this appeal thus presents an issue of first impression in this state.we are not without guidance in resolving it,however.
we analyze the issue against the backdrop of california strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution.citations.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.to further the policy favoring arbitration,courts indulge every reasonable intendment giving effect to such proceedings.ibid.for the same reason,ambiguities in the scope of arbitration are resolved in favor of coverage.citations.taylor crane cal d.moreover,courts should generally defer to an arbitrator finding that determination of a particular question is within the scope of his or her contractual authority.advanced micro devices,intel,supra,cal th at,d.the deference due an arbitrator thus requires a court to refrain from substituting its judgment for the arbitrator in determining the contractual scope of those powers.ibid.in short,we apply a rule of substantial deference to the arbitrators jurisdictional determinations.citation.id.at,d.
the strong public policy favoring arbitration is further promoted by judicial recognition that arbitration awards may be vacated or corrected only on very limited statutory grounds.see,moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at,d,alternative systems,carey th,d.here,the sole statutory basis for correcting the award is the claim that the arbitrators exceeded their powers,subd.b.we consider that claim,bearing in mind the substantial deference due the arbitrators determination that they acted within the scope of their powers advanced micro devices,intel,supra,cal th at,d,david abergel th,d.
agreement to arbitrate.
our assessment of appellant claim begins with this fundamental proposition the powers of an arbitrator derive from,and are limited by,the agreement to arbitrate.advanced micro devices,intel,supra,cal th at,d,citing moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at,d.thus,in determining whether the arbitrators exceeded the scope of their powers here,we first look to the parties agreement to see whether it placed any limitations on the arbitrators authority it did not.
here,in a arbitration clause,the parties agreed that a ny disputes over this agreement shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration in accordance with the rules then obtaining under the provisions of the california code of civil procedure.that clause has sufficient breadth to include all controversies,whether legal,factual,equitable,contractual or tortious,having their roots in the parties relationship tate saratoga savings loan d,criticized on other grounds in advanced micro devices,intel,supra,cal th at,d.and see generally,knight et,cal.practice guide alternative dispute resolution the rutter group.
application to future disputes.
notwithstanding the breadth of the arbitration clause,appellant objects to its application to future controversies,contending that the contractual obligation to arbitrate expired with termination of the agreement.on the same grounds,appellant also objects to the extension of the contractual attorneys fees clause to future disputes.not surprisingly,respondent disputes those contentions.
to resolve the issue,we consider whether the provisions in the award that compel future arbitration and permit the imposition of attorneys fees bear some rational relationship to the contract and the breach.advanced micro devices,intel,supra,cal th at,d.the required link may be to the contractual terms as actually interpreted by the arbitrator if the arbitrator has made that interpretation known,to an interpretation implied in the award itself,or to a plausible theory of the contract general subject matter,framework or intent.ibid.the critical question with regard to remedies is not whether the arbitrator has rationally interpreted the parties agreement,but whether the remedy chosen is rationally drawn from the contract as so interpreted.id.at,d.
interpreting the agreement here,the arbitrators found that the parties intended joint ownership of the technology for a period of five years after contract termination.the arbitrators painstakingly spelled out the details of that continuing joint ownership.they recounted the history of the joint venture,detailing the actions of each party.without expressly finding a breach by either party,the arbitrators declared the agreement terminated by mutual consent.finally,in the portion of the award challenged here,the arbitrators extended the contract arbitration provisions,including the attorneys fees clause,to any controversies arising under the award.
we conclude that the challenged portions of the award are rationally drawn from the parties agreement as interpreted in the arbitration proceeding.advanced micro devices,intel,supra,cal th at,d.our conclusion rests on several factors.first,the parties contracted to arbitrate any disputes over the agreement.assuming a broad interpretation of that clause,it is not irrational to extend its operation to controversies arising from the very award that interprets the agreement.likewise,assuming a similarly broad reading of the parties intent regarding fees,it is not irrational to extend the companion attorneys fees clause to future disputes as well.compare,tanner tanner th,d pursuant to parties intent,attorneys fees provision limited to marital dissolution proceeding.furthermore,the agreement contemplated continuing joint ownership after its termination,with concomitant rights and responsibilities.apparently anticipating that difficulties might inhere in joint ownership,especially given the parties discordant history,the arbitrators fashioned a remedy that contained a mechanism for future dispute resolution.in our view,that remedy is rationally drawn both from the agreement as interpreted and from the circumstances that gave rise to its termination.we are therefore compelled to affirm the arbitrators award.the award will be upheld so long as it was even arguably based on the contract it may be vacated only if the reviewing court is compelled to infer the award was based on an extrinsic source.citations.in close cases the arbitrator decision must stand.advanced micro devices,intel,supra,cal th at,d,original italics.
in affirming the award in this case,we expressly hold that a party contractual duty to arbitrate disputes may survive termination of the agreement giving rise to that duty.while neither statutory nor case law addresses the precise issue before us,the judicial policy of deference to the judgment of arbitrators provides appropriate guidance.swan magnetics,superior court th,d.we also find guidance in california statutory scheme,which explicitly recognizes that written agreements to arbitrate may be extended or renewed by an oral or implied agreement,subd.f.see paud alco plating d.berman renart sportswear d.in addition,our holding finds implicit support in several cases involving terminated agreements.see,moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at,d,the parties dispute over the allocation of attorney fees following termination of employment clearly arose out of the employment contract the arbitrator award does no more than resolve that dispute.under these circumstances,the arbitrator was within his powers in resolving the questions of law presented to him.see also,coast plaza doctors hospital blue cross of california th,d arbitration was compelled notwithstanding termination of the agreement containing the arbitration provision bos material handling,crown controls d.claims of wrongful contract termination were arbitrable paud alco plating,supra,d at.arbitrator did not exceed his jurisdiction by awarding vacation pay that accrued after termination of the labor agreement productions,love d.where demand for arbitration was made after contract termination,determination of arbitrability was for arbitrator.
the conclusion we reach here is further bolstered by several persuasive federal cases.for example,in interpreting collective bargaining agreements,the united states supreme court has determined that the parties obligations under their arbitration clause survived contract termination when the dispute was over an obligation arguably created by the expired agreement.nolde,bakery workers,d,discussing john wiley sons livingston,d.as the high court said,in the absence of some contrary indication,there are strong reasons to conclude that the parties did not intend their arbitration duties to terminate automatically with the contract.nolde,bakery workers,supra,at.but see also,litton financial printing div.nlrb,d.we acknowledge the need for caution in applying principles from collective bargaining decisions to commercial arbitration cases.advanced micro devices,intel,supra,cal th at,d.at the same time,we observe that the critical principle here,though developed in federal labor cases,has been applied in at least one other context as well.see,aspero shearson american,supra,arbitration under new york stock exchange rules.stated simply,the federal rule is this although it is created by contract,the duty to arbitrate does not necessarily end when the contract is terminated.id.at.in this case,the arbitrators made a considered decision to apply that principle.in our view,the arbitrators acted properly in doing so here,given the nature of the agreement before them 
jury trial rights.
appellant also complains that the award violates its constitutional jury trial rights by compelling involuntary participation in future arbitration proceedings.we disagree.
the parties waived their jury trial rights by consenting to arbitrate their contract disputes.madden kaiser foundation hospitals cal d,rosenthal great western fin.securities cal th,d,compare,titan group,sonoma valley county sanitation dist.d.under our holding,the parties consent survived termination of their contract.enforcing the arbitration clause thus does not implicate the parties constitutional rights it merely gives effect to their agreement.rifkind sterling,rifkind th,d.
retained jurisdiction.
appellant next claims that the arbitrators improperly retained jurisdiction by mandating arbitration in the event of future disputes.appellant points out that the arbitrators tentative final award expressly declined to reserve jurisdiction absent both parties consent.but the later versions of the award included the arbitration provision challenged here.appellant objects to that provision as an improper attempt to retain arbitral jurisdiction.
respondent counters that the arbitrators did not retain jurisdiction in including those provisions they merely decided that the parties contractual arbitration provision would apply to future disputes over the award.respondent thus distinguishes between the reservation of jurisdiction,which permits a pending arbitration to continue,and the provision challenged here,which mandates the institution of a new arbitration proceeding in the event of future disputes.we appreciate that distinction and its procedural implications.see,arbitrators lose jurisdiction to correct award days after its service.in the context of this particular appeal,however,that distinction need not affect our analysis since appellant resists the prospect of any future arbitration,whether it results from the retention of jurisdiction or from the institution of a new proceeding.colvig rko general,d.in any event,appellant objection is unavailing.
an arbitrator continuing authority may properly be drawn both from the parties agreement to arbitrate their disputes and from the nature of the remedy itself.swan magnetics,superior court,supra,th at,d.of course,an arbitrator may not exert or retain jurisdiction over issues that the parties have not submitted.ray wilson.anaheim memorial hospital d,disapproved on other grounds in moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at,d.nor may an arbitrator reserve jurisdiction when the remedy does not warrant it.san jose federation.teachers superior court d.the arbitrators in this case did neither,however.here,the parties gave the arbitration panel the authority to resolve any disputes over their agreement that contemplated continuing performance for five years after its termination.given the nature of the contract and the character of the dispute in this case,the arbitrators were warranted in fashioning a remedy that permitted future arbitral jurisdiction.
appellant also takes issue with the award on the ground that its provision for future arbitration robs it of finality.as appellant properly points out,our high court has underscored the importance of finality in arbitration awards.even in the absence of an explicit agreement,conclusiveness is expected the essence of the arbitration process is that an arbitral award shall put the dispute to rest.this expectation of finality strongly informs the parties choice of an arbitral forum over a judicial one.the arbitrator decision should be the end,not the beginning,of the dispute.moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at,d.but finality is achieved by minimizing judicial intervention in the arbitration process.ibid.and as we recently observed,the strong judicial and legislative policy in favor of arbitral finality is directed at judicial upon petitions to confirm,correct,or vacate arbitration awards thus,a result reached through arbitration is not inherently more final than decisions reached by a trial court rather,the process is considered to be final with respect to subsequent challenges to the merits in the court system.swan magnetics,superior court,supra,th at,d original italics.
the fact that an arbitration award contemplates additional future proceedings does not necessarily destroy its character as final and binding.compare san jose federation.teachers superior court,supra,d at.furthermore,our courts have recognized that the finality accorded to judgments sometimes must give example,where an injunctive decree is concerned.this is so because the decree,although purporting on its face to be permanent,is in essence of an executory or continuing nature,creating no right but merely assuming to protect a right from unlawful and injurious interference.swan magnetics,superior court,supra,th at,d,quoting sontag chain stores superior court cal d.here,too,the arbitrators chose a remedy of an executory or continuing nature.swan magnetics,superior court,supra,th at,d.but that does not prevent the award and the ensuing judgment from being final with respect to subsequent challenges to the merits in the court system.id.at,d,original italics.
as appellant correctly observes,a judgment confirming an arbitration award is enforceable in the same manner as any other judgment in a civil action.but appellant takes that observation a step further,arguing that the retention of arbitral jurisdiction and the prospect of future arbitration proceedings are anathema to the comprehensive statutory scheme governing enforcement of judgments.we disagree.
in our view,the judgment enforcement laws do not impair a party right to arbitrate new disputes which might affect its performance under earlier awards.valsan partners limited partnership calcor space facility,th,d sandler casale d.subsequent action may be brought to interpret judgment confirming arbitration award,and colvig rko general,supra,d at.court continuing jurisdiction does not impair finality of judgment confirming award.in the valsan case,disputes over a continuing contract had resulted in three prior arbitration awards.the plaintiff sought to compel a fourth arbitration following its termination of the contract.while expressing concern about a party attempting to endlessly rearbitr
