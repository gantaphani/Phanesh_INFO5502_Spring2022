background

failure to allege violation of ucl 
plaintiff failed to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action under the ucl.a voluntary bar association unilateral refusal to sell its membership list to any particular buyer,even if the association reason was to protect some of its members from price competition,is not an unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice under the ucl.
in communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,the california supreme court held that the ucl establishes three varieties of unfair or practices which are unlawful,or unfair,or fraudulent.in other words,a practice is prohibited as unfair or deceptive even if not unlawful and vice versa.citations.id.at.in this case,plaintiff does not argue that the association refusal to sell its membership mailing list to him was deceptive or unlawful he argues only that it was unfair.the ucl,however,does not define the term unfair,and courts have struggled to come up with a workable definition.davis,supra,th at,quoting gregory,supra,th at.
there is authority that the test to determine whether a business practice is unfair differs depending on whether the plaintiff in a ucl case is a competitor of the defendant or a consumer.see,supra,cal th at,fn.differentiating between competitor and consumer claims bardin.daimlerchrysler th,same bardin.it is unclear which test would apply in this case.on the one hand,plaintiff does not compete with the association,and he would be a consumer of the association mailing list if he was permitted to buy it.on the other hand,plaintiff alleged that the motive and effect of the association conduct was to hinder his ability to compete with the association members in the market for mediation services.we need not decide whether plaintiff was a competitor or consumer,however,because in either case he failed to allege facts showing that the association conduct was unfair.
in competitor cases,a business practice is unfair only if it threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law,or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law,or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition,supra,cal th at.if the conduct is deemed reasonable and condoned under the antitrust laws,there is no violation of the ucl.chavez whirlpool th,manufacturer refusal to sell to retailers who did not comply with minimum retail price policy not unfair under ucl see also people choice wireless,verizon wireless th,cellular telephone company refusal to sell new cell phone models to independent retailers during holdback period not unfair under ucl.
