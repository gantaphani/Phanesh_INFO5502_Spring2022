this consolidated appeal arises out of two separate reinsurance arbitrations.banco de seguros del estado banco,a reinsurance corporation wholly owned by the government of uruguay,entered into two separate casualty umbrella liability quota share agreements umbrella agreements with mutual marine offices,mmo and mount mckinley insurance mckinley,corporations in the insurance and reinsurance business.mmo and mckinley separately commenced arbitration proceedings claiming that banco failed to comply with its contractual obligations under the umbrella agreements.
in each case,an arbitration panel the panel granted defendants motions to require banco to post security pending a final determination by the panel.banco moved to vacate both interim orders in the united states district court for the southern district of new york scheindlin,and pauley.the district courts in both cases confirmed the interim orders.
on appeal,banco claims that as a foreign corporation it is protected from a security order by foreign sovereign immunities act fsia.banco argues that in awarding security,the mmo and mckinley panels exceeded their authority acted in manifest disregard of the law offended public policy and violated fundamental fairness.
we need not decide today whether the fsia applies to arbitration proceedings.instead,we will assume arguendo that it does.even so,we find that banco explicitly waived its immunity to the posting of security in the umbrella agreements.we therefore affirm both district courts.
background 
banco is a reinsurance corporation wholly owned by the government of uruguay.this consolidated appeal involves two distinct reinsurance arbitrations.
banco was a party to two separate umbrella agreements,one with mmo and the other with mckinley.the umbrella agreements were reinsurance contracts in which banco agreed to be responsible for a percentage of mmo and mckinley net liability on certain policies.each umbrella agreement contained substantially identical terms,including an arbitration clause.
the arbitration clause provided that any dispute must be referred to arbitration and that t he arbitrators shall consider this treaty an honourable engagement rather than merely a legal obligation they are relieved of all judicial formalities and may abstain from following the strict rules of law.the clause also provided that t he decision in writing of any two arbitrators shall be final and binding on both parties.
another clause in the umbrella agreement provided that banco must apply for and secure delivery to mmo a clean irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank acceptable to such insurance department in an amount equal to banco proportion of said reserves.banco never furnished the letter of credit.
mmo and mckinley started separate arbitration proceedings claiming that banco failed to comply with its obligations under the umbrella agreement.in both cases,there was an organizational meeting,after which the panels issued interim orders requiring banco to post security.
a.the mutual marine arbitration scheindlin,
before the organizational meeting,the panel ordered the parties to exchange brief position statements.mmo notified the panel that it would make a motion seeking security and submitted its statement of position one week before the meeting.mmo argued that such security was required under new york insurance law the security was also required by the umbrella agreement and unless there were a provision precluding security,the arbitrators had the inherent power to order such relief.
banco statement of position posited that,as an instrumentality of a foreign state,it was immune under the fsia from having to post security.it claimed that such immunity could only be waived by an explicit contractual provision,and requested the panel to withhold any determination on mmo claim for security until after the parties had an opportunity to engage in discovery and to present their evidence at a hearing.
at the organizational meeting,the panel heard the parties arguments and ruled that it was authorized under the umbrella agreement to order security.it instructed the parties to confer about the proper amount of that security.
after receiving documents reflecting the sums mmo claimed were due and after conducting a telephone conference,the panel issued an interim order directing banco to post as security an irrevocable letter of credit for.banco moved for reconsideration.the panel denied banco motion in a second interim order.
banco then moved to vacate the panel interim orders in the united states district court for the southern district of new york scheindlin.the district court,as a threshold issue and a matter of first impression,determined that the panel interim orders constituted arbitral awards and were therefore reviewable.the court denied banco motion,finding that the panel did not act in manifest disregard of the law or exceed the scope of its authority by awarding security.see banco de seguros del estado mutual marine offices,d,banco i.
banco moved before judge scheindlin for reconsideration asserting that the court should have employed a de novo standard in reviewing the arbitral awards the arbitration award was against public policy the court erred in finding that the panel did not act in manifest disregard of the law and the panel erroneously relied on the terms of the umbrella agreement in finding that banco was required to post security.
the district court granted the motion to reconsider solely because it had overlooked banco public policy argument raised on the initial motion.the district court then found that the standard of review was proper banco did not cite any controlling authority or any factual matter overlooked by the court when it determined that the panel did not act in manifest disregard of the law and even if the umbrella agreements did not expressly provide for an award of security,case law cited to the panel provided an adequate basis to confirm the interim orders.banco de seguros del estado mutual marine offices,d,banco ii.finally,the district court found that,although banco identified an explicit public policy,it failed to show how enforcing the arbitral award explicitly conflicts with that public policy.id.at.
b.the mckinley arbitration pauley,
pursuant to a different umbrella agreement,but under circumstances mirroring those with mmo,mckinley brought an arbitration proceeding against banco claiming it failed to comply with its contractual obligations.at the panel organizational meeting,mckinley made a motion to compel banco to post security.it did in the mmo the motion,claiming to be immune from security under the fsia.subsequently,the panel directed banco to post an irrevocable letter of credit for.
banco moved in the united states district court for the southern district of new york pauley,to vacate the panel interim order requiring banco to post security.the district court denied the motion,citing the mmo opinion and order.
banco now appeals both district court judgments.

standard of review 
in reviewing a district court confirmation of an arbitral award,we review legal issues de novo and findings of fact for clear error.pike freeman,cir.
the scope of the district court review of an arbitral award is limited.see sperry int l trade,gov t of israel,cir.a n arbitration award should be enforced,despite a court disagreement with it on the merits,if there is a barely colorable justification for the outcome reached.landy michaels realty local,serv.employees int l union,cir quoting andros compania maritima,marc rich,cir.
ii.the foreign sovereign immunities act 
banco asserts that,as an instrumentality of a foreign state,it is immune from posting security under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia.a,d.we disagree.
