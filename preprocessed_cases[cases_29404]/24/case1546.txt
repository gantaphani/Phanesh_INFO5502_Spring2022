in this appeal,we must determine the consequences of failing to comply with the arbitration disclosure requirements of health safety code section that statute requires health care service plans to disclose in clear and understandable language,appearing as a separate article and prominently displayed on the enrollment form immediately before the signature line that the plan requires binding arbitration of any dispute,and that both parties are giving up their constitutional right to have the dispute decided in a court of law.blue cross enrollment form violated section because the arbitration provision was not prominently displayed immediately before the signature line.despite these violations,the trial court initially concluded that section was preempted by the federal arbitration act faa et and granted blue cross petition to compel arbitration.almost three years later,the trial court reconsidered its ruling based on our decision in smith pacificare behavioral health of,th,d,cert den,d smith,and thereafter denied the petition to compel arbitration.
though both parties raise procedural challenges to the trial court orders,we are principally concerned with whether the technical violations of blue cross enrollment form render its arbitration provision unenforceable.our decision in smith did not so hold,but imbler pacificare of,th,d imbler,does.in that case,the court concluded that strict compliance with section is required to enforce the arbitration provision.we agree with the imbler court.a violation of section renders a contractually binding arbitration provision in a health service plan enrollment form unenforceable.although we do not foreclose the possibility that under the appropriate circumstances the doctrine of substantial compliance might apply,we conclude that the blue cross enrollment form at issue here does not substantially comply with section.we therefore affirm the trial court order denying the petition to compel arbitration,along with its challenged orders vacating the arbitrator award and vacating its original decision to grant the petition to compel arbitration.
factual and procedural background 
our recitation of the factual and procedural aspects of this appeal is limited to those necessary for the resolution of the legal issues before us.suffice it to say,suzanne and michael malek the maleks did not want to arbitrate this dispute and relentlessly attacked the trial court order compelling them to do so.three years after that order,the parties are back in court.obviously,the simplicity,informality,and expedition of arbitration,alluded the parties here.
the blue cross enrollment form contained an arbitration provision 
in and,the maleks enrolled in blue cross health care plans.the maleks each signed an enrollment form that contained an arbitration provision collectively,enrollment form the arbitration provision appears at the bottom of the enrollment form.it is the second provision in the text at the bottom of the enrollment form and follows the section entitled deduction authorization.following the arbitration provision are additional sections entitled,to provider,declining coverage,and authorization to obtain or release medical information.these section headings are in bold and capitalized letters.the text follows each section heading and is set in three columns.the arbitration provision is in the first column on the side of the enrollment form.the signature block is in the bottom side of the form,appearing below the authorization for the release of medical information.
before the maleks initiated this lawsuit,they also received finalized evidences of coverage eoc,which set forth the terms and conditions of their blue cross group health care coverage.these eoc contained arbitration provisions.the maleks also received numerous letters from blue cross,and explanation of benefits forms,all of which advised them of their arbitration requirement.
the maleks complaint and blue cross petition to compel arbitration 
in october,the maleks filed a complaint alleging numerous causes of action against defendant blue cross and five other named defendants,who are not subject to this appeal,based on blue cross allegedly improper denial of benefits for infertility treatment.
on november,blue cross filed a notice of petition and petition to compel arbitration and for stay of proceedings hereafter petition.after supplemental briefing,on june,the trial court granted blue cross petition to compel arbitration june order.the trial court concluded that the maleks enrollment form constituted an arbitration agreement covered under the faa although the arbitration provision in the enrollment form did not meet the disclosure requirements of section,the trial court concluded that based on erickson aetna health plans of california,th,d,the faa preempted those requirements.therefore,the trial court granted blue cross petition,with the exception of the maleks injunctive relief claim brought under the consumer legal remedies act clra.
in october,the trial court appointed an arbitrator.after the arbitration proceedings commenced,the maleks filed an amended complaint against blue cross,which included,among other things,an additional claim for injunctive relief,restitution,and disgorgement on behalf of the public under business and professions code section ucl.
on april,the arbitrator ruled that he had jurisdiction over the maleks individual statutory claims under the ucl and clra for monetary relief but did not have jurisdiction to hear the private attorney general claims under those statutes.
the maleks attempted to vacate the trial court order compelling arbitration based on smith 
in october,the maleks moved to vacate the trial court june order compelling arbitration based upon our decision in smith,supra,th,d.the trial court denied the motion because it lacked jurisdiction to consider the matter.
the arbitrator dismissed the arbitration based on smith and its progeny 
the maleks then filed their motion to dismiss the arbitration before the arbitrator.the motion was based on the grounds that smith and its progeny,pagarigan superior court th,d,and imbler,supra,th,d,required dismissal for,among other things,failure to comply with the disclosure requirements of section.blue cross opposed the motion on the grounds that the arbitrator could not,in essence,reverse the trial court order finding the existence of a valid arbitration agreement and compelling arbitration.the arbitrator granted the motion 
blue cross filed a petition to vacate the arbitrator award 
on march,blue cross filed a petition to vacate the arbitrator decision to dismiss the arbitration on the grounds that the arbitrator exceeded his powers under the arbitration agreement.the maleks opposed the petition,arguing that blue cross had agreed that the arbitrator could decide jurisdictional issues,that the decision was correct,and that since the arbitrator decision was legally correct,it could not be vacated.
the trial court concluded that the arbitrator dismissal order was an award,and thereafter opted to exercise its limited jurisdiction under code of civil procedure section to vacate the award.in so ruling,the trial court concluded that the arbitrator exceeded his power by making the determination that he lacked jurisdiction to proceed with the arbitration.
having vacated the arbitration award,the trial court issued an order to show cause based on code of civil procedure section,subdivision c,in which it noticed the parties that it intended to reconsider its june order to grant blue cross petition to compel arbitration.the trial court order to show cause was based on a change in the law.the court reasoned that erickson aetna health plans of,supra,th,d,the case upon which it had originally relied in its order to compel arbitration,had been overturned by smith and its progeny.following a hearing on the issue,the trial court,citing our opinion in blake ecker th,d,concluded that it would be error for it not to reconsider its prior order in view of the change in the law.thereafter,the trial court entered a different order denying blue cross petition to compel arbitration.these appeals followed.
the parties contentions 
both the maleks and blue cross challenge the trial court orders.
the maleks attack the trial court decision to vacate the arbitration award.they contend that the trial court erred in vacating,as opposed to confirming,the award under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,because even if the arbitrator exceeded his authority,any error in the award could have been corrected without affecting the merits of the decision.the maleks further contend that blue cross waived this issue by submitting what it characterizes as a jurisdictional question to the arbitrator.
blue cross challenges the trial court order to vacate its june order to compel arbitration.blue cross contends that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to reconsider the matter.blue cross further contends that the arbitration provision in the enrollment form was enforceable even though it did not strictly comply with section,and that based on code of civil procedure section,the trial court could only invalidate the arbitration provision on grounds that exist at common law for the revocation of a contract 
discussion 
the trial court did not err in vacating the arbitration award 
the maleks contend that the trial court should have confirmed the arbitrator award and not vacated it for two reasons.first,the requirements of code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,were not satisfied.second,although the maleks achieved the result they wanted,that is,to proceed in a judicial forum,the trial court order delays that process because the denial of a petition to compel is an appealable order.code civ,subd.a.we need not dwell on the latter point,given the delays arguably attributable to the maleks through the course of this arbitration.moreover,we conclude that the trial court did not err in vacating the arbitrator award.
a.the applicable grounds to vacate an arbitrator award and standard of review 
an award reached by an arbitrator pursuant to a contractual agreement to arbitrate is not subject to judicial review except on the grounds set forth in code of civil procedure sections to vacate and for correction.at issue here are the requirements of subdivision a of code of civil procedure section.
code of civil procedure section sets forth the grounds for vacation of an arbitration award.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.one of the grounds for which the court shall vacate the award is if it determines that t he arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted.code civ,subd.a.
on appeal from an order vacating an arbitration award,we review the trial court order not the arbitration award under a de novo standard.reed mutual service th,d.to the extent that the trial court ruling rests upon a determination of disputed factual issues,we apply the substantial evidence test to those issues.id.at,d see also advanced micro devices,intel cal th,fn,d.applying these principles,we conclude that both the statutory requirements of code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,have been met.
the arbitrator exceeded his authority 
an arbitrator exceeds his powers when he acts in a manner not authorized by the contract or by law.jordan department of motor vehicles th,d.the gateway question of whether the parties are bound by a particular arbitration agreement is a question of arbitrability for the court.howsam dean witter reynolds,d see also code civ,the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists.
here,the arbitrator exceeded his authority by reexamining whether the parties were bound by the arbitration provision in the blue cross enrollment form.that decision was in the province of the trial court,which had previously determined arbitrability.the arbitrator attempt to distinguish in his ruling an agreement to arbitrate,which already had been determined to exist,and the legal validity,which he purportedly decided,was a distinction without a difference.the legal validity of the arbitration provision,that is,whether an agreement to arbitrate exists,is a judicial determination,which the trial court made in its june order.
the arbitration award could not be corrected without affecting the merits of the arbitrator decision 
the maleks contend that even if the arbitrator exceeded his authority,the trial court could not vacate the award under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,because the second requirement of that statute has not been satisfied.according to the maleks,the second requirement of the statute requires the arbitrator award to be wrong on the merits.the maleks assert that the award was not wrong because the trial court ultimately agreed with the arbitrator.we find this argument meritless.
we differ with the maleks in our understanding of the second requirement of code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.that section provides that the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted.it does not require that in order to vacate an arbitration award it must be wrong on the merits.advanced micro devices,intel,supra,cal th at,d.rather,this requirement simply means that the arbitration award can not be corrected without affecting the arbitrator decision whether right or wrong on the merits.
here,the trial court could not correct the arbitrator award without affecting the merits of his decision.the arbitrator made a determination of arbitrability,which rested solely with the trial court,not the arbitrator.the only way to correct such an award would have been to reverse the arbitrator,which affects the merits of his decision.
we further reject the maleks argument relying on code of civil procedure section,subdivision b that subdivision of the statute contains language similar to the second requirement of subdivision a of section of the code of civil procedure.as we have stated,the award could not be corrected without affecting the merits of the arbitrator decision.
finally,while the maleks rely on lindenstadt staff builders th,d,to advance their argument,we fail to see the relevancy of that case.the lindenstadt court concluded that where one of the parties contends the entire contract or transaction underlying the award is illegal,the trial court is required to review the evidence de novo to determine whether the arbitration award was based on an illegal agreement or transaction.id.at,d.that is not the issue here.
blue cross did not waive the right to challenge the arbitrator decision 
the maleks argue that blue cross has waived its right to challenge the arbitrator award because in january,blue cross submitted to the arbitrator the question of whether the maleks ucl claim was arbitrable.according to the maleks,under california law,by submitting that issue to the arbitrator,blue cross became bound by the arbitrator subsequent decision on whether the arbitration agreement was enforceable.we disagree.neither logic nor the law supports the maleks position.
blue cross would not have submitted an issue to the arbitrator that would have jeopardized the june order compelling arbitration.the issue before the arbitrator was limited to the scope of the arbitration and whether the maleks ucl claim was subject to the arbitration agreement this question did not leave open the possibility of revisiting the gateway issue that the parties had agreed to arbitration,which had already been decided in blue cross favor and was not within the province of the arbitrator.
moreover,the maleks overstate the law to make their point.in both the cited cases,the parties agreed to submit the question of arbitrability to the arbitrator and challenged the arbitrator authority only after the unfavorable award.in united food commercial workers union clougherty packing d,the parties by agreement asked an arbitrator to decide if a particular seniority provision was arbitrable.the arbitrator answered in the affirmative but also went further by declaring the provision illegal under the labor code and existing case law.id.at.the company challenged the award,claiming the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction to decide whether the provision was illegal.the trial court disagreed and confirmed the award.the court of appeal affirmed,concluding that the issue had been submitted by agreement to the arbitrator.id.at.the legality finding was upheld for two reasons.first,both parties had clear knowledge,well in advance of the hearing,that the legality aspect would be an issue even though not formally submitted.second,it was the arbitrator opinion that the underlying controversy could not be resolved without addressing the legality issue.id.at.
likewise,in university of san francisco faculty university of san francisco d,the faculty association successfully contended that the trial court erred in upholding the university claim that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in making an award relating to the supplemental pension benefits.the parties had agreed to negotiate on an annual basis the plan benefits and expressly agreed that an arbitrator would determine whether or not changes,durations,and modifications in that plan were within the scope of the arbitration.id.at.moreover,the parties had stipulated to permit the arbitrator to determine his jurisdiction.id.at.as the court stated a claimant may not voluntarily submit his claim to arbitration,await the outcome,and if the decision is unfavorable,challenge the authority of the arbitrator to act.citations.ibid.
as noted,these cases do not advance the maleks argument,and are inapposite.blue cross and the maleks did not agree to confer jurisdiction on the arbitrator to determine arbitrability,did not acquiesce to the determination of arbitrability by briefing the issue of the scope of the arbitration,and did not implicitly agree to the resolution of this issue by the arbitrator.there was no waiver here.
the trial court did not lack jurisdiction to reconsider its june order to compel arbitration 
blue cross contends that the trial court could not vacate its june order compelling arbitration until completion of the arbitration.in support of this argument,blue cross relies on code of civil procedure section,which provides that once arbitration is ordered,the court in which the action or proceeding is pending shall stay the action or proceeding until an arbitration is had in accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such earlier time as the court specifies.
brock kaiser foundation hospitals th,d brock,described the settled principles applicable to this jurisdictional issue.once a court grants the petition to compel arbitration and stays the action at law,the action at law sits in the twilight zone of abatement with the trial court retaining merely a vestigial jurisdiction over matters submitted to arbitration.this vestigial jurisdiction over the action at law consists solely of making the determination,upon conclusion of the arbitration proceedings,of whether there was an award on the merits or not citations.id.at,d.as pertinent here,the court vestigial jurisdiction included confirming,correcting,or vacating the arbitration award.code civ.
while brock sets forth the rule,that case,and equities group,superior court th,d,upon which blue cross also relies,are inapposite because neither case involved a motion for reconsideration under code of civil procedure section,subdivision c.in brock,the court held that the superior court had no power to dismiss an action for failure to prosecute once it had granted the motion to compel arbitration.th at,d.likewise,equities group,superior court,supra,at,d,held that the trial court could not make discovery and scheduling orders to move along the arbitration proceedings.
although blue cross attempts to distinguish our opinion in blake ecker,supra,th,d,we find that decision controlling.in that case,like here,a change in the law required the trial court to reconsider its prior ruling compelling arbitration.id.at,d.blue cross distinction of blake is based on the parties near completion of arbitration.the progress of the arbitration is not material when considering a change in the law affecting whether the arbitral forum was a correct one.based on code of civil procedure section,subdivision c,the trial court could reconsider its order to compel arbitration in light of our decision in smith,supra,th,d.as we will explain,however,the trial court reliance on smith as a basis for holding that strict compliance with section was required to enforce the arbitration provision,is misplaced.the conclusion the trial court reached,however,was a correct one.as we shall explain,the arbitration provision is unenforceable.
blue cross arbitration provision failed to comply with the disclosure requirements of section 
as a part of its regulation of health care service plans,california imposes certain disclosure requirements as a predicate to the enforcement of arbitration clauses contained in plan subscriber agreements.smith,supra,th at,d.those disclosure requirements are set forth in section.
section provides 
any health care service plan that includes terms that require binding arbitration to settle disputes and that restrict,or provide for a waiver of,the right to a jury trial shall include,in clear and understandable language,a disclosure that meets all of the following conditions 
a the disclosure shall clearly state whether the plan uses binding arbitration to settle disputes,including specifically whether the plan uses binding arbitration to settle claims of medical malpractice.
b the disclosure shall appear as a separate article in the agreement issued to the employer group or individual subscriber and shall be prominently displayed on the enrollment form signed by each subscriber or enrollee.
c the disclosure shall clearly state whether the subscriber or enrollee is waiving his or her right to a jury trial for medical malpractice,other disputes relating to the delivery of service under the plan,or both,and shall be substantially expressed in the wording provided in subdivision a of section of the code of civil procedure.
d in any contract or enrollment for a health care service plan,the disclosure required by this section shall be displayed immediately before the signature line provided for the representative of the group contracting with a health care service plan and immediately before the signature line provided for the individual enrolling in the health care service plan.italics added.
in this case,upon reconsideration the trial court found that blue cross enrollment form did not comply with subdivision d of section because the arbitration provision did not immediately appear before the signature line.the trial court therefore concluded that the arbitration provision was unenforceable and denied blue cross petition to compel arbitration.
though the maleks renew their argument that the enrollment form did not comply with any of the disclosure requirements we need not address them because blue cross concedes that the enrollment form does not comply with subdivision d of section.we also conclude that the enrollment form does not meet the prominence requirement of section,subdivision b.
blue cross enrollment form violates section,subdivision b,by failing to meet the prominence requirement 
as stated,section,subdivision b,requires that the disclosure shall be prominently displayed on the enrollment form italics added.the blue cross enrollment form contains plan conditions toward the bottom of the form.the arbitration provision is in the same type size and font as provisions authorizing deductions and release of medical information.while the arbitration provision constitutes a separate numbered paragraph,it does not stand out and was not readily noticeable from these other provisions.we fail to see how this is prominently displayed in compliance with section,subdivision b.
blue cross enrollment form violates section,subdivision d,by failing to meet the placement requirement 
section,subdivision d,requires that the arbitration disclosure be displayed immediately before the signature line.italics added.it is undisputed that the arbitration provision in the enrollment form is not immediately before the signature line.instead,the signature line appears immediately following the paragraph authorizing the release of medical information.the juxtaposition of the arbitration provision does not satisfy the statute placement requirement.we must therefore determine the effect of blue cross noncompliance,which is at the heart of blue cross appeal.
noncompliance with section renders the contractual arbitration provision in blue cross enrollment form unenforceable 
blue cross presents several arguments to support its contention that a technical violation of the requirements of section is not a defense to the enforcement of a contractual arbitration agreement.as discussed below,we are not persuaded and conclude that an arbitration provision in a health care service plan is unenforceable if it does not meet the mandatory disclosure requirements of section.
imbler concluded that a violation of section rendered the contractual arbitration agreement unenforceable 
we begin with imbler,supra,th,d,the only published case to directly address compliance with section.in that case,the court concluded that the arbitration agreement could not be enforced based on noncompliance with section.imbler,supra,at,d.the court determined that pacificare benefits enrollment form did not comply with the notice requirements of section,subdivision b,which requires that the arbitration provision be prominently displayed on the enrollment form.the arbitration disclosure in the pacificare form was included in a paragraph authorizing the release of medical records.imbler,supra at,d.the imbler court reasoned that this did not meet the prominence requirement because p rominent is defined as standing out or projecting beyond a surface or line,or readily noticeable.id.at,d,fn.omitted.in the imbler court view,this definition was not satisfied because a disclosure sentence in the same paragraph which was not bolded,underlined,or italicized,was not prominent.because the arbitration disclosure failed to meet the prominence requirement of section,subdivision b,imbler concluded that the trial court properly denied pacificare petition to compel arbitration.id.at,d.
imbler,supra,th,d,however,is the only case holding that strict compliance with section,is necessary to enforce a health care service plan arbitration provision.in smith,supra,th,d,pacificare had conceded noncompliance.id.at,d.our focus in that case was on whether the act precluded preemption of section by the faa.likewise,in pagarigan superior court,supra,th,d,the court assumed that any failure to comply with section rendered the arbitration clause void,but that case did not decide the issue.pagarigan,at,d.the pagarigan court concluded that the general preemption provision of the medicare act did not preclude application of section.pagarigan,at,d see also zolezzi pacificare of california th,fn,d.
although we agree with blue cross that neither smith nor pagarigan addressed the issue before us,we do not agree with the blue cross that we should depart from the decision reached in imbler,supra,th,d.while the imbler court assumed,without any discussion,that any transgression of section invalidated the arbitration provision,we reach the same conclusion based on our construction of section.we conclude that based on the statutory language of section noncompliance with the arbitration disclosure requirements of that section renders the arbitration provision in the blue cross enrollment form unenforceable.
b.the arbitration disclosure requirements of section are mandatory 
as previously discussed,health care service plans containing arbitration provisions must disclose in clear and understandable language,appearing as a separate article and prominently displayed on the enrollment form immediately before the signature line that the plan requires binding arbitration of any dispute,and that both parties are giving up their constitutional right to have such dispute decided in a court of law.
blue cross contends that despite this mandatory language,noncompliance with the arbitration disclosure requirements of section is not a defense to a contractual arbitration agreement based on the language of code of civil procedure section.that statute provides that written arbitration agreements are valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for revocation of any contract.code civ.in other words,under california law,an arbitration agreement may only be invalidated for the same reasons as other contracts.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,supra,cal th at,d.thus,according to blue cross,because only contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate the arbitration provision in its enrollment form,noncompliance with section does not render its arbitration agreement unenforceable.we disagree.
when presented with a question of statutory construction,our primary task is to determine the legislature intent.allen contracting cal th,d.we begin by examining the statutory language because it generally is the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.we give the language its usual and ordinary meaning,and i f there is no ambiguity,then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citation.if the statutory language is ambiguous,we consider the legislative history and select the construction that comports most closely with the legislative intent.we must promote,rather than defeat,the general purpose of the statute.torres parkhouse tire service,cal th,d.
the plain language of section is arbitration disclosure requirements are mandatory.section specifies that the arbitration agreement shall contain each of the enumerated disclosures in subdivisions a through d.it is well settled that the word shall is usually construed as a mandatory term.common cause board of supervisors cal d.this is particularly true here where to construe the statute as optional would render it ineffective,a construction that we must avoid.moreover,it would be inconsistent with the legislative intent that these disclosures be included in any health care service plan that includes the terms that require binding arbitration this language evidences an implicit legislative determination that these disclosures must be included in a health care service plan to safeguard against patients unknowingly waiving their constitutional right to a jury trial.section,therefore,establishes the requirements that must be satisfied in order to arbitrate disputes involving a health care service plan.accordingly,even though section is silent on the effect of noncompliance,because the disclosure requirements are mandatory,the failure to comply with those requirements renders an arbitration provision unenforceable.
nothing in code of civil procedure section prohibits the legislature from establishing the requirements for the lawful contractual arbitration between a health care service plan and its participants.section is not directed at arbitration agreements in general but is specifically applicable only to such provisions in health care service plan contracts.in this regard,the legislature has specified these requirements in the context of health care service plans based on general state law contract principles.in doing so,the legislature has determined that if the arbitration disclosure requirements are satisfied,by definition,binding arbitration is a contract term and the arbitration provision is enforceable subject only to contract defenses.the converse must also be true.that is,absent the arbitration disclosure requirements of section,the minimal requirements under state law contract principles have not been met and there is no contract to arbitrate that can be enforced.
rosenfield superior court reached the same conclusion when construing the mandatory notice provisions related to medical malpractice arbitration 
although there is no published case addressing whether noncompliance with section is a defense to an arbitration agreement,a similar argument related to mandatory arbitration disclosure requirements was raised and rejected in rosenfield superior court d.rosenfield.that case addressed the issue of whether the mandatory disclosure requirements to arbitrate medical malpractice claims as set forth in code of civil procedure section were a basis for denying arbitration under code of civil procedure section.that statute compels a court to order arbitration if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists,unless it determines that b grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement.
the rosenfield court concluded that the advisements were mandatory and failure to so advice would render an arbitration agreement unenforceable.d at.the rosenfield court reasoned to conclude that section takes precedence over section,setting aside an arbitration agreement only if grounds exist for revocation of that agreement,would be plainly inconsistent with the legislature intent expressed in section.the legislature has specified the manner in which the communication of significant contractual consequences must be made to a patient.a clear understanding of those consequences assures the enforceability of the agreement.id.at.according to the rosenfield court,the enforceability of the contract rested on the reasonable expectation of the parties and if the arbitration agreement did not contain the notices of section,factual issues are then created concerning the parties reasonable expectations and whether the contract is in fact oppressive or unconscionable.id.at.
we find the rosenfield court reasoning equally applicable in construing whether the mandatory notice requirements of section,can be reconciled with the defenses available to revoke a contract under code of civil procedure section.the disclosure requirements are necessary to form a contractual arbitration agreement.the disclosures communicate the contractual consequences of the jury waiver to ensure a knowing waiver of the right to a jury trial.absent these disclosure requirements,there is no contractual agreement to arbitrate.this construction does not conflict with code of civil procedure section,which assumes the formation of a contract.
although blue cross attempts to distinguish rosenfield,supra,d,we find its arguments unpersuasive.the rosenfield court decision did not turn on the specific language of code of civil procedure section,or the lack of an administrative remedy,but rather,like here,on general contract principles of the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties.we therefore conclude that the legislature determination in section as to the specific manner in which to communicate the contractual consequences of arbitration are necessary to enforce the arbitration provision in a health care service plan.if these requirements have not been met,there is no indicia that the health care service plan enrollee knowingly assented to arbitration.therefore,noncompliance with section renders the arbitration agreement unenforceable.
d.the act is not the exclusive remedy for noncompliance of section 
blue cross contends that absent an express statutory prohibition,a contract entered into in violation of section is not for that reason void because the exclusive penalties for noncompliance are those provided in the act act 
the omission of statutory language relating to the consequences of violating section is of no legal significance 
blue cross contends that since section is silent on the consequences of failing to comply with the disclosure requirements,the legislature must have concluded that failure to comply would not render an arbitration provision unenforceable.invoking the doctrine of expressio unius est exclusio alterius,that is,the expression of certain things in a statute necessarily involves the exclusion of other things not expressed,blue cross asserts that had the legislature wanted to make the arbitration provision void for failure to comply with the disclosure requirements,it would have explicitly said so in section.to support this argument,blue cross cites two sections of the act in which the legislature explicitly stated the consequences of noncompliance.section,provides that a health service plan lifetime waiver of mental health service coverage in a nongroup plan shall be deemed unenforceable.section,subdivision d,prohibits a health service plan from entering into medicare supplement contracts that contain prohibited provisions.although these statutes contain explicit language,we find any comparison to section unpersuasive based on the mandatory language of section and the involved.
moreover,the express mention in one particular statute of enforceability does not imply that a statute silent on that matter compels the opposite conclusion.instead,as noted,section creates a mandatory obligation on the contracting parties.the language itself implies that an enrollment form complying with these notice requirements will be enforced.such a contract can not be enforced against the party that did not knowingly waive his or her right to a jury trial.there is no need to explicitly state the consequences of failure to comply when this statutory language is clear and unambiguous.
for this reason,blue cross reliance on gonzales concord gardens mobile home park,d,is misplaced.that case involved violations of the notice requirements in the state contractors license laws.the contractor violated statutes related to notice of the state lien laws bus,and notice on a written contract of the state contractors license requirement bus.prof code.gonzales at.the court concluded that since the statute did not include a penalty for noncompliance,and another provision in the contractors license law had,the doctrine of expressio unius est exclusio alterius must reasonably be applied.id.at.the similar principle of statutory construction does not apply here because to do so would contravene the plain meaning of section,and such application would,therefore,be unreasonable.
the administrative penalty is not the exclusive remedy for noncompliance with section 
we also reject blue cross argument that the act treats violations of section and similar provisions as regulatory matters subject to the administrative penalties set forth in the act that are within the exclusive enforcement powers of the department of managed health care department.samura kaiser foundation health plan,th,d,cert den,d.
section is different from other regulatory provisions of the act that blue cross cites in support of its argument.see,disclosure of prescription drug formulary,notice of reproductive health services,and disclosure of denial of health care services process.those sections are pure notice requirements.section requires notice that is necessary to ensure consent to a binding agreement to arbitrate.the very purpose of the disclosure requirement of section is to ensure that the parties agree to be bound to contractual arbitration it would be absurd to impose an administrative penalty on a health service plan provider for failure to comply with the arbitration disclosure requirements but permit arbitration to go forward.under those circumstances,there would be no consent to arbitrate.therefore,we find inapposite the authorities construing other provisions of the act and concluding that no private right of action exists,samura kaiser foundation health plan,supra,th at,d,and stating the broad authority of the department to enforce provisions of the act,van de kamp gumbiner,supra,d at.
e.the legislative history supports our conclusion that the disclosure requirements of section are mandatory 
we are not persuaded by blue cross argument that we must reach a different result based on the absence of any discussion on noncompliance in the legislative history of section.blue cross asked that we take judicial notice of the legislative history,which it contends reveals that the bill enacting section was introduced for several reasons,none of which included the intent to invalidate arbitration provisions in enrollment forms for noncompliance with the notice requirements of that statute this is true.nevertheless,we have found that the scant legislative history confirms that the disclosure requirements of section were intended to be mandatory in order to ensure that health care consumers were aware that the execution of the enrollment form containing an arbitration provision would constitute a waiver of the right to a jury trial consistent with this legislative purpose,we read section as requiring health service plan enrollment forms to contain the advisements of that statute as a condition to the enforcement of the arbitration agreement.
the arbitration agreement does not fall within an exception to the rule permitting enforcement of an illegal contract 
in the alternative,blue cross contends that the arbitration provision can not be revoked on the grounds that it is an illegal contract because to do so would result in a disproportionately harsh penalty in relation to the gravity of a violation of a purely regulatory statute.we disagree and conclude that the common law defense of illegality is a separate and alternative ground for upholding the trial court order denying blue cross petition to compel.
g enerally speaking,a contract made in violation of a regulatory statute is void,however,the rule is not an inflexible one to be applied in its fullest rigor under any and all circumstances.arya group,cher th,d,citing asdourian araj cal d.in compelling cases,illegal contracts will be enforced in order to avoid unjust enrichment and a disproportionately harsh penalty upon the plaintiff.citation.asdourian araj,supra,at.in each case,the extent of enforceability and the kind of remedy granted depend upon a variety of factors,including the policy of the transgressed law,the kind of illegality and the particular facts.citation.ibid.
application of these factors to the arbitration provision at issue here supports the conclusion that it should not be enforced.first,the policy of section is to protect health care consumers from the consequences of unknowingly waiving their right to a jury trial in a dispute with their health care service plan.the maleks are members of the group primarily in need of the statute protection.it would defeat the statutory purpose to allow blue cross to compel arbitration without first complying with the necessary disclosure requirements.
second,although the violation of section does not involve the kind of illegality that automatically renders an agreement void,nevertheless,the parties were not equally at fault.blue cross knew or should have known of the disclosure requirements under section.indeed,as blue cross has admitted,the enrollment forms at issue here were printed after the enactment and effective date of section.
third,under the facts of this case,the arbitration provision should not be enforced.blue cross cites to several factors,suggesting that such a decision is a harsh one.it characterizes the violation of the statute as a technical one points to the fact that the arbitration was nearing completion,that the maleks failed to bring smith,supra,th,d,to the attention to the trial court for nearly a year after the decision was published and that the maleks had actual notice of their obligation to arbitrate this dispute.these factors overlook one important point that is,the juxtaposition of the arbitration provision and the maleks signatures on the enrollment form,raises a concern as to whether the maleks agreed to waive their right to a jury trial.this factor alone makes the arbitration provision unenforceable.this consequence is not disproportionately harsh because the purpose of section is to ensure that health care consumers knowingly waive their right to a jury trial.
this is not a case where the defendant retained the benefit of the bargain and would be unjustly enriched if the agreement were not enforced.in that respect,this case is distinguishable from felix zlotoff d.nor,as discussed,do the equitable factors support upholding the agreement upon which blue cross relies.see,homestead supplies,executive life ins.d.
as a health care service plan provider,blue cross should have been aware that section provided specific disclosure requirements.in this factual context,enforcing the arbitration provision would defeat the policy of section.we therefore conclude that the penalty,namely unenforceability for noncompliance with the arbitration disclosure requirements,is not disproportionately harsh in relation to the gravity of the violation.
the blue cross enrollment form does not substantially comply with section 
blue cross next contends that the facts of this case merit the application of the doctrine of substantial compliance.though no cases have applied the doctrine of substantial compliance in this context,blue cross asserts that it should be applied here because the violation of section is technical and inconsequential,as the maleks repeatedly received actual notice of their arbitration obligation,making the fact that the signature block is not immediately below the arbitration provision of no moment given the prominent placement of that arbitration provision on a one page form.we disagree with blue cross position.
as discussed,we have concluded that the disclosure requirements of section are mandatory.that statute provides that the disclosures shall appear and shall clearly state and shall be prominently displayed,and does not expressly sanction mere substantial compliance with its provisions.nevertheless,to the extent that blue cross raises the substantial compliance doctrine in connection with mandating literal compliance of the statutory disclosure requirements to effectuate its objectives,we do not rule that doctrine out in the appropriate case.we find,however,that this is not such a case because the blue cross enrollment form did not substantially comply with section.
substantial compliance,as the phrase is used in the decisions,means actual compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute.citation.where there is compliance as to all matters of substance technical deviations are not to be given the stature of noncompliance.citation.substance prevails over form.when the plaintiff embarks on a course of substantial compliance,every reasonable objective of the statute at issue has been satisfied.citation.conditioning,auburn union school dist.th,d.
our primary concern is the objective of the statute.as we have discussed,contrary to blue cross position,section is not just a notice statute.the purpose of section is to disclose the requirement to arbitrate and to ensure a knowing waiver of the right to a jury trial.the signature of the individual enrolling in the health service plan is required in order to ensure a knowing waiver of his or her rights.
in our view,the blue cross enrollment form did not satisfy these statutory objectives.it is disputable whether the arbitration provision satisfied the prominence requirement.as discussed,the arbitration notice provision was one of many indistinguishable paragraphs on the form related to the plan.nevertheless,assuming the notice requirement was satisfied with actual notice at a later date,there is no indication that the maleks knowingly waived their right to a jury trial based on the juxtaposition of the signature line.the arbitration provision is on the side of the enrollment form while the signature line is on the lower side of the form.the signature line appears directly below the authorization to obtain or release medical information.this placement is not a technical defect of form because it leaves in doubt whether the maleks knowingly waived their right to a jury trial.under these circumstances,the statutory objectives of section have not been met.
blue cross contends that the facts of this case are distinguishable from those in imbler,supra,th,d,where the court required strict compliance with the prominence requirement of subdivision b of section.the imbler court did not address substantial compliance because pacificare failure to comply with the statute was not merely a technical violation.likewise,blue cross violations of section are not technical ones.therefore,we conclude the substantial compliance doctrine does not apply.
in sum,the trial court correctly denied blue cross petition to compel arbitration.
