in this appeal,we revisit our holding in sanchez valencia holding,llc th sanchez,review granted march,that a retail installment sale contract used to purchase an automobile is unconscionable and unenforceable.having considered the decisions of other california appellate courts handed down after sanchez,we have refined our analysis and again conclude that the identical sale contract does not require the arbitration of disputes between a purchaser and a car dealer because it is permeated by unconscionability.
background 
the allegations and facts in this appeal are taken from the pleadings and the exhibits submitted in connection with the motion to compel arbitration.
plaintiffs,jorge vargas and guadalupe carcamo,filed this putative class action on january.two months later,plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint complaint,which alleged as follows.
on or about september,plaintiffs went to the automobile dealership owned by defendant sai monrovia b,doing business as assael bmw mini of monrovia assael bmw.plaintiffs were interested in buying a new mini cooper s.a salesman,roger,showed them a model on the lot.plaintiffs completed a credit application to obtain financing.as required by law,plaintiffs should have been given a copy of the signed credit application,but assael bmw did not give them one.plaintiff vargas took the car for a test drive.upon returning to the dealership,plaintiffs told roger they were interested in purchasing the car.in response to plaintiffs inquiries about financing,roger told them that to keep their monthly payments below,they would have to make a down payment of,and the loan would have to be for a term of six years.because the finance office had closed for the day,roger told plaintiffs to return the following day to complete the paperwork.
on september,plaintiffs returned to assael bmw.roger introduced them to one of the dealership finance managers.during discussions with the manager,plaintiffs agreed to purchase an extended warranty,otherwise known as a service contract,for.plaintiffs gave the manager in cash as a down payment.
the manager presented plaintiffs with a retail installment sale contract sale contract,which was a preprinted document consisting of one page,inches wide and inches long.there were numerous and extensive provisions on both sides of the sale contract,leaving little in the way of margins.plaintiffs signed or initialed the front side in places,each relating to a different provision.no signatures or initials of the buyers were required on the back there were no places on the back for the buyers to initial or sign.the arbitration provision,entitled,arbitration clause,was on the back at the bottom of the page,outlined by a black box the arbitration provision was the last provision in the sale contract concerning the purchase of the vehicle a provision related to the assignment of the contract appeared below it.the buyers final signatures appeared near the bottom of the front side.the only signature line on the back was at the very bottom of the page it required the seller signature to assign the contract to a third party.the sale contract was written by the reynolds and reynolds company and,in this case,was designated form ca arb,effective may.
the sale contract listed the price of the car as,the amount financed as,the monthly payments as,the term of the loan as months,and an annual percentage rate of percent.the sale contract listed a charge of for california tire fees and a charge of for optional dmv electronic filing fee.assael bmw was required by law to charge plaintiffs for each new tire purchased see pub.resources code,subds.b,d it unlawfully charged them for five new tires when the car had only four see,subd.e.further,assael bmw did not discuss the electronic filing fee with either plaintiff or tell them it was optional.if plaintiffs had been so informed,they would have declined to pay the fee.in addition,assael bmw did not provide plaintiffs with a disclosure statement showing them what their monthly payments would be with and without the service contract,violating applicable law see.
at some point after september,assael bmw assigned the sale contract to chase auto finance corporation chase.
shortly after purchasing the car,plaintiffs experienced problems with it,including an intermittently inoperable window,inoperable headlamps,a repeatedly illuminated check engine light,sluggish acceleration,poor gas mileage,and a knocking noise.plaintiffs took the car to assael bmw to be repaired,but the dealer did not correct the problems.plaintiff carcamo then contacted bmw of north america,llc,and complained about assael bmw failure to fix the car.notwithstanding plaintiffs efforts,the car was never fixed.
the complaint contained nine causes of action,alleging violations of the consumers legal remedies act clra,the automobile sales finance act,the california unfair competition law ucl bus,the song beverly consumer warranty act song beverly act,and the california tire recycling act tire recycling act pub.resources code,some of the causes of action were brought against only assael bmw some were brought against assael bmw and chase and the last cause of action,for violation of the song beverly act,was brought against both assael bmw and bmw of north america,llc.plaintiffs sought injunctive relief for violations of the clra and the ucl.under the heading,class allegations,plaintiffs alleged that their causes of action satisfied the class action requirements of numerosity,predominate questions of law and fact,typicality,superiority of a class action over individual actions,and adequate class representation.at the end of the complaint,the prayer requested actual damages,restitution,punitive damages,and prejudgment interest,among other remedies.plaintiffs also sought an award of attorney fees.
motion to compel arbitration 
on or about july,assael bmw and jp morgan chase bank,erroneously sued as chase,filed a motion to compel arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provision in the sale contract.as used in the arbitration provision,you referred to the buyer or cobuyers,and we or us referred to the seller.the provision stated.either you or we may choose to have any dispute between us decided by arbitration and not in court or by jury trial.
if a dispute is arbitrated,you will give up your right to participate as a class representative or class member on any class claim you may have against us including any right to class arbitration or any consolidation of individual arbitrations.
discovery and rights to appeal in arbitration are generally more limited than in a lawsuit,and other rights that you and we would have in court may not be available in arbitration.
any claim or dispute,whether in contract,tort,statute or otherwise including the interpretation and scope of this arbitration clause,and the arbitrability of the claim or dispute,between you and us or our employees,agents,successors or assigns,which arises out of or relates to your credit application,purchase or condition of this vehicle,this contract or any resulting transaction or relationship shall,at your or our election,be resolved by neutral,binding arbitration and not by a court action any claim or dispute is to be arbitrated by a single arbitrator on an individual basis and not as a class action.you expressly waive any right you may have to arbitrate a class action.you may choose one of the following arbitration organizations and its applicable rules the national arbitration forum,the american arbitration association,or any other organization that you may choose subject to our approval

you and we retain any rights to remedies,such as repossession.you and we retain the right to seek remedies in small claims court for disputes or claims within that court jurisdiction,unless such action is transferred,removed or appealed to a different court.neither you nor we waive the right to arbitrate by using remedies or filing suit.any court having jurisdiction may enter judgment on the arbitrator award.this arbitration clause shall survive any termination,payoff or transfer of this contract.if any part of this arbitration clause,other than waivers of class action rights,is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason,the remainder shall remain enforceable.if a waiver of class action rights is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason in a case in which class action allegations have been made,the remainder of this arbitration clause shall be unenforceable.italics added,some capitalization omitted.
assael bmw and jp morgan chase bank collectively assael bmw argued in their memorandum of points and authorities that the class action waiver in the sale contract was valid,the arbitration provision covered all of plaintiffs causes of action,and the suit should be stayed pending the issuance of an arbitration award.
in their opposition papers,plaintiffs asserted that the arbitration provision was procedurally and substantively unconscionable and should not be enforced.in the alternative,they argued that the clra entitled them to maintain a class action.more specifically,as stated in the clra,a consumer may bring an action on behalf of himself and such other consumers to recover damages or obtain other relief as provided for under the clra,and t he court shall permit the suit to be maintained on behalf of all members of the represented class if certain conditions exist,subds.a b.the clra also provides any waiver by a consumer of the provisions of this title is contrary to public policy and shall be unenforceable and void,see fisher dch temecula imports,llc th,clra entitles consumers to maintain class actions and is not preempted by federal arbitration act.plaintiffs claimed that the clra invalidated the class action waiver in the sale contract and that pursuant to the poison pill clause in the contract stating that the entire arbitration provision shall be unenforceable if the class action waiver is found unenforceable plaintiffs were entitled to have all of their causes of action heard in a judicial forum.
plaintiffs vargas and carcamo submitted virtually identical declarations.for example,vargas declaration stated when carcamo and i signed a sale contract for the mini cooper,we were presented with a stack of documents,and were simply told by assael bmw employee where to sign initial each one.all of the documents including the purchase contract were form documents.when we signed the documents,we were not given an opportunity to negotiate any of the terms.the documents were presented to us on a basis.the documents including the purchase contract were given to us and we were simply told sign here in various places.there was no question of choice on our part or of our being able to negotiate anything.i did not even realize the contract had a second,back side with additional terms.i had no reason to suspect that hidden on the back of the form was a section that prohibited us from being able to sue in court if we had a problem.
when we signed the purchase contract and related documents,assael bmw did not ask us if we were willing to arbitrate any disputes with it or its assignees.assael bmw did not tell us that there was an arbitration clause on the back side of the purchase contract,and i did not see any such clause before i signed the documents.assael bmw did not explain to us what an arbitration clause or agreement was.we were not given any opportunity at any time during our transaction with assael bmw to negotiate whether or not we would agree to arbitrate any potential disputes,or any of the terms by which we would agree to arbitrate any disputes.we were never given an option whether to sign a contract with an arbitration clause or one without 
at no point during our interactions with assael bmw were we presented with a separate arbitration agreement to review and sign.no one at assael bmw turned the sale contract over to show me and carcamo the writing on the back or asked us to sign any sections on the back of the contract where assael bmw apparently now says an arbitration clause is located.i was not aware there was a clause in the sale contract supposedly requiring me to arbitrate any disputes.
prior to the filing of defendants motion to compel arbitration,i had never heard of the national arbitration forum or american arbitration association.when carcamo and i were at assael bmw to sign the sale contract,we did not have,nor were we given,an opportunity to use a computer to download any information about these or any other arbitration organizations,including their procedures or rules.nor was i aware we could have or should have done this.
on or about august,assael bmw filed a motion to strike the class allegations in the complaint on the ground that the sale contract precluded a class action.the motion to strike was set for hearing on the same day as the motion to compel arbitration.plaintiffs filed opposition to the motion to strike.
the motions to compel arbitration and to strike the class allegations were heard on september.by order of the same date,the trial court granted the motion to compel arbitration as to the first eight of the nine causes of action.the court denied the motion to compel as to the ninth cause of action,which alleged a violation of the song beverly act,because bmw of north america,llc,was a defendant on that cause of action but was not a party to the sale contract and thus not subject to arbitration.the trial court also granted the motion to strike the class action allegations in the complaint.plaintiffs appealed 
discussion 
whether an arbitration provision is unconscionable is ultimately a question of law.on appeal,when the extrinsic evidence is undisputed,as it is here,we review the contract de novo to determine unconscionability.suh superior court th,citations omitted accord,mercuro superior court th.because this appeal presents a question of law,we may resolve it in the first instance,without remand to the trial court.we are not bound by the trial court stated reasons,if any,supporting its ruling walgreen city and county of san francisco th.
the parties disagree as to whether the class action waiver is unenforceable under the clra,thereby making the entire arbitration provision unenforceable in accordance with the poison pill clause.they also dispute whether the arbitration provision is procedurally and substantively unconscionable and whether the provision is permeated by unconscionability,rendering it unenforceable.for convenience,our use of assael bmw,car dealer,dealership,or any similar term includes the assignee,jp morgan chase bank,
we do not address whether the class action waiver is unenforceable under the clra and the poison pill clause.rather,we conclude the arbitration provision as a whole is unconscionable the provision is procedurally unconscionable because it is adhesive and satisfies the elements of oppression and surprise it is substantively unconscionable because it contains overly harsh terms that favor the car dealer to the detriment of the buyer.because the provision contains multiple invalid clauses,it is permeated by unconscionability and unenforceable.severance of the offending language is not appropriate.it follows that the case should be heard in a court of law.
general principles of unconscionability 
in,the legislature enacted civil code section,which codified the principle that a court can refuse to enforce an unconscionable provision in a contract as section,subdivision a states if the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract,or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause,or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.because unconscionability is a reason for refusing to enforce contracts generally,it is also a valid reason for refusing to enforce an arbitration agreement under the california arbitration act code civ,which provides that arbitration agreements are valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.the united states supreme court,in interpreting the same language found in section of the federal arbitration act,recognized that generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,armendariz,citation omitted.
g enerally applicable contract defenses,such as unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening the federal arbitration act unconscionability consists of both procedural and substantive elements.the procedural element addresses the circumstances of contract negotiation and formation,focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power substantive unconscionability pertains to the fairness of an agreement actual terms and to assessments of whether they are overly harsh or a contract term is not substantively unconscionable when it merely gives one side a greater benefit rather,the term must be so as to shock the conscience.pinnacle museum tower pinnacle market development us,llc cal th,citations omitted.
the party resisting arbitration bears the burden of proving unconscionability both procedural unconscionability and substantive unconscionability must be shown,but they need not be present in the same degree and are evaluated on a sliding scale.t he more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.pinnacle museum tower pinnacle market development us,llc,supra,cal th at,citations omitted.
in applying the foregoing principles,we necessarily reject assael bmw contention that at t mobility llc concepcion.concepcion precludes a court from relying on unconscionability as a ground for invalidating an arbitration provision.concepcion does not foreclose our analysis for three reasons.first,our supreme court decision in pinnacle,which was handed down more than a year after concepcion,applied california traditional unconscionability principles in concluding that an arbitration provision governing a condominium complex was not unconscionable.second,concepcion itself recognized the continuing validity of the doctrine of unconscionability as a basis for declaring an arbitration agreement unenforceable.concepcion,at.third,the california courts of appeal have recognized that concepcion did not eliminate state law unconscionability as a defense to the enforcement of arbitration agreements subject to the federal arbitration act.sparks vista del mar child and family services th,accord,nelsen legacy partners residential,th,samaniego empire today,llc th.
in concepcion,the court held that,under the federal arbitration act,a state may not rely on categorical rules that prohibit the arbitration of a particular type of claim.concepcion,supra.at,see cruz cingular wireless,llc cir,brewer missouri title loans,see also marmet health care center brown.california traditional principles of unconscionability do not constitute a categorical rule invalidating arbitration agreements.on the contrary,the doctrine of unconscionability requires courts to determine whether,in the formation of a contract,there are elements of oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power and whether the terms of the contract are overly harsh or.see pinnacle museum tower pinnacle market development us,llc,supra,cal th at.unlike the rule in discover bank superior court cal th,which constituted a categorical rule against class action waivers in consumer contracts and was therefore inconsistent with the federal arbitration act see concepcion,at,the principles we apply today are arbitration neutral and thus do not stand as an obstacle to the purposes of the federal arbitration act.see generally gilles friedman,after class aggregate litigation in the wake of t t mobility concepcion,note,there is still hope for the little guy unconscionability is still a defense against arbitration clauses despite t t concepcion whittier.
procedural unconscionability 
as indicated,procedural unconscionability requires oppression or surprise.oppression occurs where a contract involves lack of negotiation and meaningful choice,surprise where the allegedly unconscionable provision is hidden within a prolix printed form.pinnacle museum tower pinnacle market development us,llc,supra,cal th at.
in gutierrez autowest,th gutierrez,the plaintiff leased a vehicle pursuant to a contract virtually identical to the one here and signed it under similar circumstances.the court of appeal had no difficulty concluding the arbitration provision was procedurally unconscionable,saying the trial court implicit conclusion that the arbitration clause in the automobile lease is adhesive is supported by substantial evidence.the lease was presented to plaintiffs for signature on a take it or leave it basis.plaintiffs were given no opportunity to negotiate any of the preprinted terms in the lease.the arbitration clause was particularly inconspicuous,printed in typeface on the opposite side of the signature page of the lease.the plaintiff was never informed that the lease contained an arbitration clause,much less offered an opportunity to negotiate its inclusion within the lease or to agree upon its specific terms.he was not required to initial the arbitration clause he either had to accept the arbitration clause and the other preprinted terms,or reject the lease entirely.under these circumstances,the arbitration clause was procedurally unconscionable.id.at,citation omitted accord,fittante palm springs motors,th.
even the california attorney general has commented that the lengthy sale contract is problematic,describing it as an unwieldy size for a business document,and incompatible with standard office printing and reproduction machines.this incompatibility leads to significant trouble and expense for automobile dealers,as well as for those consumers who need to make or transmit copies of their sales contracts.the attorney general has advised that a sale contract need not be a single page but may consist of multiple pages fastened together and sequentially numbered.id.at pp.as the attorney general explained,the use of multiple pages,as opposed to a single page,will facilitat e the consumer review of all of the parties agreements before the consumer signs the sale or lease contract,so that the consumer has complete and accurate information.the rule also helps to avert later disputes about the terms of the parties final agreement.id.at,italics added.
we realize that the sale contract was drafted as a single page in an attempt to comply with the automobile sales finance act,which states in part every conditional sale contract subject to this chapter shall be in writing and,if printed,shall be printed in type no smaller than point,and shall contain in a single document all of the agreements of the buyer and seller with respect to the total cost and the terms of payment for the motor vehicle,including any promissory notes or any other evidences of indebtedness,italics added.but nothing in the act,regardless of how it is interpreted,required that the arbitration provision be placed on the back of the page,that all of the buyer initials and signatures be placed on the front,or that,in this case,the finance manager instruct the buyers where to initial and sign the sale contract on the front without letting them read any of the contract provisions or see that the contract had provisions on the back.
assael bmw emphasizes that,on the front side of the sale contract,plaintiffs placed their signatures near a provision stating you agree to the terms of this contract.you confirm that before you signed this contract,we gave it to you,and you were free to take it and review it.you acknowledge that you have read both sides of this contract,including the arbitration clause on the reverse side,before signing below.you confirm that you received a completely copy when you signed it.capitalization omitted,italics boldface added.this acknowledgement provision was located inches from the top of the page,on the front side,and flush to the right margin in a space measuring about two inches wide and one inch high.to the immediate left of the provision was boxed text discussing the lack of a period the boxed text was approximately six inches wide and one inch high.a sentence appeared above both the acknowledgement provision and the provision it stated,in boldface and larger font the annual percentage rate may be negotiable with the seller.the seller may assign this contract and retain its right to receive a part of the finance charge.and the signature line for the buyer appeared flush to the left margin under the boxed text discussing the lack of a period,not under the provision referring to the arbitration clause on the reverse side.in short,the provision on the front side stating that the buyers had read the arbitration clause on the reverse side was obscured by the surrounding text.
spacing and format aside,plaintiffs stated in their declarations that the finance manager instructed them where to sign or initial the sale contract telling them sign here in various places and he did not turn the contract over,which would have revealed the arbitration provision.the finance manager controlled the presentation and the signing of the purchase documents,including the sale contract.if assael bmw had wanted plaintiffs to read the sale contract,it would have given them the contract and told them to initial or sign in the appropriate places as they read the document.instead,by having the finance manager point to various blank lines and tell plaintiffs to sign here,assael bmw deprived plaintiffs of an opportunity to read the sale contract.as a result,plaintiffs did not know the contract contained an arbitration provision they did not see the reference arbitration clause on the front side,nor did they see the arbitration provision or any other provision on the back.as one court of appeal has explained in analogous circumstances p laintiffs are claiming that they never knowingly agreed to the arbitration provision.as in most,if not all,adhesion contract cases,they deny ever reading it.the general rule that one who signs an instrument may not avoid the impact of its terms on the ground that he failed to read the instrument before signing it applies only in the absence of overreaching or imposition thus,it does not apply to an adhesion contract.indeed,failure to read the contract helps establish actual surprise bruni didion th,citations omitted,italics added accord,madden kaiser foundation hospitals cal d.and even if plaintiffs had read the pertinent provision on the front and seen the words arbitration clause buried therein,they still would have been surprised nearly three years later,when they first learned that the arbitration provision,located on the back,was overly harsh.
similarly,a federal district court found that the arbitration provision in a sale contract is procedurally unconscionable,explaining t he court is able to find both elements of oppression and surprise,which renders the arbitration agreement procedurally unconscionable.the buyer asserts that when he was given the purchase agreement,it was presented to him on a it basis and was not afforded an opportunity to negotiate any of the terms on the form in the approximately twenty to thirty minutes that the buyer took to sign the agreement,the dealership representative directed his attention to the front side of the form,which was the only area where a signature was required the buyer was never informed that the sale contract contained an arbitration clause located on the of the form 
the car dealer maintains that there was no surprise because the arbitration clause was prominently displayed on the of the form in a box titled arbitration clause,and that the buyer nonetheless signed next to a paragraph on the front side mentioning the arbitration clause the court is unpersuaded.the location of an arbitration clause on the back of a dense form where the purchaser is not required to sign does relatively little to notify the consumer that such clause exists.although the paragraph on the front mentions the arbitration clause on the back,the language lies imbedded inconspicuously within a paragraph of the same font size,and to the right of where the buyer signature was required the buyer failure to notice the reference to the arbitration clause on the front side of the agreement was a result of the term being hidden in a prolix printed form drafted by the the dealer.lau mercedes benz usa,llc,no.cv mej dist.lexis,pp.wl,italics added.
in sum,the arbitration provision satisfies the two elements of procedural unconscionability oppression and surprise.plaintiffs were presented with the sale contract on a basis.its preprinted terms were not negotiable.the contract was a single page.the arbitration provision,which was printed on the back side,was unnoticeable to buyers who were told where to sign on the front side and were not given an opportunity to see that the contract had provisions on the back or to read the provisions on either side.
we conclude that the arbitration provision exhibited a high degree of procedural unconscionability.because of the format of the sale contract and the way in which the finance manager controlled and directed its execution,the buyers knew nothing about the arbitration provision,placing the parties agreement to arbitrate on a weak legal foundation.given the high degree of procedural unconscionability,plaintiffs were required to show a relatively lower degree of substantive unconscionability.see pinnacle museum tower pinnacle market development us,llc,supra,cal th at.but they also made a strong showing of substantive unconscionability,as we discuss next.
substantive unconscionability 
of course,simply because a provision within a contract of adhesion is not read or understood by the nondrafting party does not justify a refusal to enforce it.the term may only be denied enforcement if it is also substantively unreasonable substantive unconscionability focuses on whether the provision is overly harsh or and is shown if the disputed provision of the contract falls outside the reasonable expectations of the nondrafting party or is unduly oppressive.where a party with superior bargaining power has imposed contractual terms on another,courts must carefully assess claims that one or more of these provisions are and unreasonable.gutierrez,supra,th at,citations omitted.
a contract term is substantively unconscionable if it is either overly harsh or so as to shock the conscience.pinnacle museum tower pinnacle market development us,llc,supra,cal th at,citing hour fitness,superior court th,substantive element traditionally involves contract terms that are so as to shock the conscience,or that impose harsh or oppressive terms italics added.an arbitration agreement can provide a margin of safety that provides the party with superior bargaining strength a type of extra protection for which it has a legitimate commercial need without being unconscionable however,unless the business realities that create the special need for such an advantage are explained in the contract itself,it must be factually established.armendariz,supra,cal th at.
we conclude that four clauses in the arbitration provision are unconscionable.first,if an arbitration award exceeds,the losing party may appeal the decision to a panel of three arbitrators.second,an appeal is permitted if an award includes injunctive relief.third,the appealing party must pay,in advance,the filing fee and other arbitration costs subject to a final determination by the arbitrators of a fair apportionment of costs.fourth,the provision exempts repossession from arbitration while requiring that a request for injunctive relief be submitted to arbitration.these clauses impose an unduly oppressive burden on buyers.in assessing unconscionability,we focus on the practical effect of a provision,not a facial interpretation.saika gold th,saika.
appeal of award exceeding 
under the sale contract,either side may appeal to a panel an adverse award exceeding.as courts have recognized,this type of provision has the effect of benefiting the party with superior bargaining power,here,assael bmw,and places an unduly harsh burden on the weaker party.
in little auto stiegler,cal th,an employment case,the arbitration provision allowed either party to appeal an initial award to a second arbitrator if it exceeded.the supreme court found the provision unconscionable,stating the employer and its amici curiae claim that the arbitration appeal provision applied evenhandedly to both parties and that there is at least the possibility that an employer may be the plaintiff,for example in cases of misappropriation of trade secrets but if that is the case,they fail to explain adequately the reasons for the award threshold.from a plaintiff perspective,the decision to resort to arbitral appeal would be made not according to the amount of the arbitration award but the potential value of the arbitration claim compared to the costs of the appeal.if the plaintiff and his or her attorney estimate that the potential value of the claim is substantial,and the arbitrator rules that the plaintiff takes nothing because of its erroneous understanding of a point of law,then it is rational for the plaintiff to appeal.thus,the threshold inordinately benefits defendants.given the fact that the employer was the party imposing the arbitration agreement and the threshold,it is reasonable to conclude it imposed the threshold with the knowledge or belief that it would generally be the defendant.
although parties may justify an asymmetrical arbitration agreement when there is a legitimate commercial need,that need must be other than the employer desire to maximize its advantage in the arbitration process there is no such justification for the threshold.little auto stiegler,supra,cal th at,citations omitted accord,gibson nye frontier ford,alaska,fn.
little relied in part on saika,supra,th.in saika,a patient signed a patient physician arbitration agreement before undergoing a chemical skin peel of her face.the agreement provided that if an award exceeded,either party could request a trial de novo in superior court,and the arbitration award would be null and void.id.at.after the medical procedure,the patient filed a civil suit against the physician,alleging medical malpractice based on severe burns.the physician successfully moved to compel arbitration.the arbitrators awarded the patient.the physician filed a request for a trial de novo.the patient responded by filing a motion to strike the physician request,and a petition to confirm the arbitration award.the trial court granted the physician request for a trial de novo and denied the patient motion to strike and petition to confirm.
the court of appeal reversed,stating a trial de novo clause within the arbitration agreement purportedly allows either party to disregard the results of the arbitration and litigate in the courts when the arbitration award exceeds,but the practical effect of the clause is to tilt the playing field in favor of the doctor.by making arbitration virtually illusory as far as one side is concerned,the clause contravenes the strong public policy favoring arbitration.saika,supra,th at pp.
the court acknowledged that an arbitration award in favor of a patient in a malpractice case typically exceeds by such a substantial amount that only the physician would invoke the trial de novo clause.in contrast,a claim by a physician against a patient,most likely a billing matter,would rarely result in an award exceeding,especially if the patient had private health insurance or was covered by some type of governmental assistance program.as the court explained true,there is a theoretical class of cases where the trial de novo clause could arguably benefit a patient namely,situations where the initial arbitration award exceeds but is still so low that it represents an injustice for example,the case before us appears to involve facial disfigurement.the arbitrators handed down what appears,at least insofar as the record discloses,an appropriately large award.had they only given the patient,the trial de novo clause would have been of some benefit to her.
but a s a practical matter,the benefit which the trial de novo clause confers on patients is nothing more than a chimera.the odds that an award will both a clear the threshold but b still be so low that the patient would want to have a trial de novo are so small as to be negligible t he cases where the trial de novo clause could possibly benefit the patient are going to be rare indeed.
w hile the trial de novo clause in the present case purports to apply to both parties,it is the same heads i win,tails you lose proposition that the court condemned in prior case law.
p ublic confidence in arbitration in large part depends on the idea that arbitration provides a fair alternative to the courts.that confidence is manifestly undermined when provisions in arbitration clauses provide that when one side wins the game does count alternative dispute resolution must be a genuine alternative to litigation in the courts,not a sham process by which one party to an agreement can increase the total costs of making a claim against it.saika,supra,th at pp,citation omitted.
the same analysis applies here.car buyers will rarely benefit from the right to appeal where an adverse award exceeds because they,not the dealer,are more likely to recover such an award and be satisfied with it the car dealer would most likely appeal such an adverse award to a panel.under the sale contract in this case,plaintiffs are obligated to pay a total of over six years.in comparison,assael bmw obligations under the sale contract and california law are to sell a vehicle in working condition,to avoid making misleading or false representations,and to comply with various consumer protection laws,the violation of which could result in substantial damages,including punitive damages.given the remedies available under the consumer protection laws,an award in a buyer favor could readily exceed simply put,there is no justification for the threshold,other than to relieve the car dealer of liability it deems excessive.a truly balanced provision would allow the buyer to appeal if he or she recovered less than.
appeal of award that includes injunctive relief 
the arbitration provision allows an appeal by either side if an award against it contains injunctive relief.although injunctive relief is not defined in the sale contract,the plain meaning of that term would include a temporary restraining order tro,a preliminary injunction,and a permanent injunction.an appeal of an award containing injunctive relief is unduly harsh because the buyer,not the car dealer,would typically be the party obtaining that type of relief.

the buyer,not the car dealer,would usually be the party seeking preliminary or permanent injunctive relief,primarily to enforce consumer protection laws like the clra.if an interim award a preliminary injunction or final award permanent injunction is issued against the car dealer,then the arbitrator has favorably reviewed the merits of the buyer claims and determined that the interests of consumers will be irreparably injured without injunctive relief.see white davis cal th,millennium rock mortgage,service th.
yet the appeal clauses in the arbitration provision allow the car dealer to delay the effect of an injunction by way of appellate review before a arbitration panel.by subjecting injunctive relief to an appeal process,only the car dealer is benefited,making the clause overly harsh on consumers and undermining the purpose of the clra to protect consumer rights.
in addition,the arbitration provision is silent as to the procedure for taking an appeal.presumably,if the arbitrator issues a preliminary injunction in the form of an interim award,the car dealer may appeal at that time,putting the entire case,including the injunction,on hold pending a decision by the appellate panel.this delay is inconsistent with the enforcement of consumer rights laws and the expediency of the arbitration process.
payment of fees and costs on appeal 
as provided in the arbitration provision,if either side files a claim and recovers nothing,it may request a new arbitration under the rules of the arbitration organization by a panel.the appealing party requesting new arbitration shall be responsible for the filing fee and other arbitration costs subject to a final determination by the arbitrators of a fair apportionment of costs.italics added.
but the american arbitration association aaa rules and procedures do not mention arbitration costs when a consumer appeals an initial award to a panel.indeed,the aaa rules and procedures do not contemplate or provide for an appeal of any kind.see aaa,supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes as of june,see also aaa,commercial arbitration rules and mediation procedures eff.june,as of june.and the appeal clauses in the sale contract require the appealing party to pay the fees and costs for both sides in advance,subject to reallocation at the conclusion of the arbitration.even if the rules and procedures of the aaa or another arbitration organization did not require the appealing party to pay such expenses,the sale contract states that the provisions of this arbitration clause shall control.
the clra confers unwaivable statutory rights on consumers and accords them some of the rights set forth in armendariz,supra,cal th at pages.see gutierrez,supra,th at fn.harvard westlake school th,discussing gutierrez.one of those rights limits the payment of arbitral expenses by the consumer.
under the clra,a consumer does not have to pay arbitration costs or arbitrator fees arbitral expenses that he or she can not afford or that are prohibitively high.see gutierrez,supra,th at pp,applying armendariz,supra,cal th at pp,and green tree financial.randolph.nevertheless,the appeal clauses mandate that the appealing party bear the arbitral expenses for both sides unless and until the expenses are reapportioned at the end of the proceeding.but reapportionment at the conclusion of the arbitration is inadequate.see gutierrez,at.that possibility provides little comfort to consumers who can not afford to initiate the appeal process in the first place.ibid.items covered by an advance payment on appeal include,as stated in the sale contract,the filing fee and other arbitration costs.arbitrator fees in los angeles average around per hour,and here,the appeal is heard by three arbitrators.see adr services,southern california mediation arbitration panel as of june.hearing room rental costs and the arbitrator travel expenses may also be included.see harvard westlake school,supra,th at,fn.
because the arbitration provision leaves the buyer in the dark as to the amount to be paid in advance and permits,but does not mandate,apportionment at the conclusion of arbitration,it discourages buyers from pursuing an appeal and enforcing their rights under the clra.although the aaa ensures that a consumer does not have to pay an exorbitant sum at the beginning of an arbitration proceeding see supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes,c as of june,its rules and procedures do not mention an appeal to a panel of arbitrators and,thus,do not set forth the costs associated with an appeal.but whatever the costs of an appeal,the requirement that the appealing party pay the filing fee and arbitration costs of both sides in advance puts an unduly harsh burden on a consumer.
that is not to say a buyer must be allowed to pursue an appeal without paying anything up front.but the arbitration provision in this case provides no procedure or criteria for determining how much the consumer must advance.as the court explained in gutierrez unconscionability is determined as of the time the contract is made the flaw in this arbitration agreement is readily apparent.despite the potential for the imposition of a substantial advance of costs to appeal,there is no effective procedure for a consumer to obtain a cost waiver or reduction.a comparison with the judicial system is striking t he judicial system provides parties with the opportunity to obtain a judicial waiver of some or all required court fees.
the government code prescribes a tripartite means test for litigants seeking such a waiver the first two tests automatically exempt a party who receives certain designated governmental benefits or who falls below a designated poverty limit under the third test,courts have discretion to exempt litigants unable to proceed without using money which is necessary for the use of the litigant or the litigant family to provide for the common necessaries of life.the judicial council,at the legislature direction,has provided a set of forms and rules that supplement the government code statute these rules detail the application form,the procedure for determining the application,and when a hearing is required denial of the application,in whole or in part,shall include a statement of reasons.
in contrast,the arbitration provision here does not indicate how this process is begun,or who makes the determination,or what criteria are utilized to decide if costs should be reduced or deferred 
we do not mean to suggest that an arbitration agreement requiring the posting of costs to initiate the appeal process must provide a procedure that duplicates the judicial waiver procedure.but the agreement must provide some effective avenue of relief from unaffordable fees.this one does not.gutierrez,supra,th at pp,citations omitted.nor does the arbitration provision in this case.
appeal where award is 
an appeal of an initial arbitration award is permitted by the losing side if it brings a claim and recovers nothing.as assael bmw sees it,this clause benefits buyers more than itself and renders any other problems with the appeal clause such as permitting an appeal of an award exceeding of no legal consequence.according to assael bmw,the clause allowing a loser appeal is of such benefit to buyers,as opposed to itself,that the arbitration provision as a whole should be deemed valid notwithstanding other unconscionable clauses in the provision.
but we can not say that the loser appeal clause benefits one side more than the other in the absence of statistical evidence,which neither side has provided.for example,without statistics,we do not know whether buyers or car dealers file more claims against the other side.buyers might seek relief if they believe their vehicle is defective,the defect is covered by a warranty,and the dealer has not fixed the problem.on the other hand,if a buyer defaults on the monthly payments due under the sale contract,the car dealer may seek a deficiency judgment if,after repossessing the vehicle and selling it,the sale proceeds are less than what the buyer owes on the loan.see generally bank of america lallana cal th,in seeking deficiency judgment against defaulted purchaser of vehicle,creditor must comply with provisions of rees levering motor vehicle sales and finance act,subd.a,and california uniform commercial code,subds.b,see also arguelles romero superior court th,fn.if assignee of vehicle purchase contract repossesses vehicle due to buyer default under loan,assignee would have to pursue any deficiency judgment in arbitral forum,not court,subject to mutual exemption for small claims cases.
for all we know,car dealers bring more claims against buyers than buyers bring against dealers,and a buyer,when defending a claim,prevails more often than the dealer,resulting in an award of for the dealer.if that were so,the loser appeal clause would work to the advantage of the dealer and would not lessen the overly harsh effect of the other problems with the contractual right to appeal to a panel.consequently,we reject assael bmw contention that the loser appeal clause benefits the buyer to such an extent that it cures the overly harsh effect of the clauses permitting an appeal when an award exceeds,permitting an appeal when an award includes injunctive relief,and requiring the buyer to advance the fees and costs of both sides if the buyer appeals.
finally,we note that the foregoing analysis also applies to the exemption from arbitration of small claims cases.absent a statistical study,we can not say that the contractual right to bring a small claims case benefits one side more than the other.
remedies exempt from arbitration 
the arbitration provision expressly exempts from arbitration remedies such as repossession,which is perhaps the most significant remedy from the car dealer perspective.the buyer has no effective remedies against a car dealer,and none of the buyer remedies is exempt.yet one of the most important remedies to a buyer injunctive relief is subject to arbitration.while a buyer is more likely to seek an injunction against a car dealer than vice versa,we can not conceive of a situation where the dealer would be requesting that type of relief against a buyer.here,the buyers seek injunctive relief under the clra and the ucl.
in flores transamerica homefirst,th,the plaintiffs obtained a reverse mortgage on their home.the loan agreement contained an arbitration clause requiring the arbitration of all controversies with the exception of remedies,stating t his section does not limit the lender right to foreclose against the property whether judicially or by exercising its right of sale or otherwise,to exercise remedies such as,or to obtain appointment of a receiver from any appropriate court,whether before,during or after any arbitration.id.at.the plaintiffs filed suit against the lender,alleging fraud,unfair business practices,and violation of the clra.the lender moved to arbitrate the case.the trial court denied the motion.the court of appeal affirmed,stating that a s a practical matter,by reserving to itself the remedy of foreclosure,the lender has assured the availability of the only remedy it is likely to need the clear implication is that the lender has attempted to maximize its advantage by avoiding arbitration of its own claims.id.at.
we do not hold that the exemption of repossession by itself is unconscionable.our concern is that the arbitration provision exempts the most important remedy to the car dealer but does not exempt any of the buyer remedies,in particular,injunctive relief.
by exempting repossession to which only the car dealer would resort from arbitration,while subjecting a request for injunctive relief the buyer remedy to arbitration,the sale contract creates an unduly oppressive distinction in remedies.this is especially so given that the california arbitration act code civ,exempts tro and preliminary injunctions from arbitration,allowing an application for provisional remedies to be filed directly in court.nevertheless,the sale contract dictates otherwise.
as several courts have held,arbitration provisions are unconscionable if they provide for the arbitration of claims most likely to be brought by the weaker party but exempt from arbitration claims most likely to be filed by the stronger party.see armendariz,supra,cal th at baker osborne development th,fitz ncr th,mercuro superior court,supra,th at pp,stirlen supercuts,th.that rule should apply here because the sale contract mandates the arbitration of one of the buyers most important remedies injunctive relief while exempting the car dealer remedy of choice repossession.
given that repossession may be either a remedy or a judicial remedy see cal,subd.b,assael bmw can not justify exempting remedies of which the buyer has none from arbitration while requiring that injunctive relief a remedy unique to buyers be sought only in arbitration.as provided by statute after default,a secured party may do both of the following take possession of the collateral.without removal,render equipment unusable and dispose of collateral on a debtor premises a secured party may proceed in either of the following ways pursuant to judicial process.without judicial process,if it proceeds without breach of the peace,subds.a b,italics added.the statute does not define or explain the conduct that will constitute a breach of the peace,leaving that matter for continuing development by the courts.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.secured transactions in personal property.in considering whether a secured party has engaged in a breach of the peace,courts should hold the secured party responsible for the actions of others taken on the secured party behalf,including independent contractors engaged by the secured party to take possession of collateral.official comments on,com,deering ann.cal.ed.foll,pp.for example,a creditor is liable for conversion if it hires a licensed repossessor see bus,who takes a vehicle by engaging in force or by making threats of force.henderson security nat.bank d.a creditor is also liable for conversion if it or its agent repossesses a vehicle by means of an unlawful entry id.at,for instance,by breaking the lock on the debtor garage door ibid.and a debtor has a viable cause of action against a creditor for conversion where the creditor seizes a vehicle and thereafter rejects the debtor demand to return personal property located in the vehicle.varela wells fargo bank d,see rochon pacific coast,although purchaser of vehicle understated amount of personal debt on loan application,constituting misrepresentation,seller was liable for conversion where it repossessed vehicle pursuant to provision in sales contract authorizing taking of vehicle if borrower financial position endangered rights or security of seller,and borrower had made all payments due under contract.
a hypothetical illustrates the disadvantage imposed on the buyer.assume that after a car is sold,the dealer assigns the sale contract to the bank that financed the purchase.months later,in conversations between the buyer and the bank representatives,the bank adopts the erroneous position that the buyer is in default.the buyer goes to the bank,discusses the matter with bank employees,and presents documentation showing that the account is current.but the bank relies on its own summary of the buyer account a summary
