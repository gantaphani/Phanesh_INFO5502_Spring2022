factual and procedural background 
on march,plaintiffs,the minor son and mother of kintausha clemmons filed a wrongful death complaint against ghaderi alleging medical malpractice caused the death of kintausha clemmons 
on july,the parties attended a mediation with the honorable robert altman,retired.plaintiffs and their counsel appeared.ghaderi was present with obi amanugi,a claims specialist.two attorneys also attended with ghaderi attorney kent brandmeyer,the attorney and attorney robert reback,cumis counsel 
under the provisions of her professional liability policy with,ghaderi had the right to withhold her consent to the settlement of any third party malpractice claim.prior to engaging in settlement discussions,ghaderi executed a written consent to settlement form provided by.in pertinent part,the document provided as follows i consent to the settlement of the claim for an amount not to exceed that authorized by the claims review committee of.it is understood and agreed that my consent to the negotiated settlement of this claim involves the compromise of a doubtful and disputed claim.neither my consent to settlement nor the payment of any sum of money by in connection with this negotiated settlement shall constitute or be construed as an admission of liability on my part.i understand that has an obligation to report settlements to the national practitioner data bank as well as the medical board of california in a manner consistent with statute and regulations.i understand and agree that this consent to settlement may only be revoked in writing.this consent to settlement shall remain in full force and effect unless and until written revocation of my consent to settlement is received by at its office.italics added.prior to signing the consent agreement,ghaderi added the following language at the bottom,the settlement value is limited to one hundred thousand dollars zero cents.ghaderi signed and dated the consent agreement.
settlement discussions then proceeded.during settlement discussions,ghaderi waited in another room with attorney reback.eventually,advised judge altman to offer plaintiffs to settle the matter in exchange for a dismissal with prejudice and a waiver of costs.plaintiffs accepted the offer.while judge altman prepared a document reflecting the settlement agreement for the parties to sign,amanugi went to the other room to inform ghaderi and attorney reback that a settlement had been reached.when she was advised of the settlement,ghaderi said,good,because i am revoking my consent.amanugi discussed this with ghaderi,and also telephoned the office to obtain guidance on how to proceed.general counsel informed amanugi that considered ghaderi oral revocation of her consent to be valid.shortly thereafter,ghaderi left the building.judge altman,plaintiffs and plaintiffs counsel signed the written settlement agreement no one signed on behalf of ghaderi or.
the following day,plaintiffs attorney and attorney brandmeyer,the attorney,appeared in court.both counsel recounted the facts of the july,mediation to the ghaderi written consent to settle for,the offer in that amount,the acceptance of the offer,and ghaderi departure while the settlement was being reduced to writing.counsel sought guidance on how to proceed.
the trial court speculated that there may be an enforceable settlement agreement.attorney brandmeyer agreed that may eventually take that position,but he first wanted to speak with ghaderi in the hopes of obtaining her agreement to the settlement.the trial court vacated the trial date and set the matter for an order to show cause why the case should not be dismissed on july.
on july,ghaderi sent a letter formally revoking her consent to settle.on july,plaintiffs filed an application for an ex parte order shortening time for a hearing on a petition to approve the compromise of the minor claim 
at the july,hearing,attorney brandmeyer informed the trial court that ghaderi had informed that she had decided to revoke her consent.attorney brandmeyer was not sure where that leaves us.the trial court asked attorney brandmeyer if was going to pay the money without ghaderi signature on a settlement agreement attorney brandmeyer said was still trying to figure it out,but he did think would pay if ghaderi did not consent.the trial court ordered ghaderi to personally appear at the order to show cause hearing on july.
on july,ghaderi was present,with attorney brandmeyer and cumis counsel,attorney reback.the trial court spoke with ghaderi and her counsel in chambers.the court then stated on the record that ghaderi was unwilling to consent to the settlement.the court added,i told her that i would have to get briefing on the contractual issue of whether she is obligated by virtue of the document she signed to consent to this settlement.i said that if i found upon motion that she was so bound,i would approve the settlement over her objection.the court indicated that it appeared that the proper course of action would be for plaintiffs to bring a motion to enforce the settlement agreement under code of civil procedure section.plaintiffs counsel asked if he could obtain a copy of the written consent agreement ghaderi had signed.attorney brandmeyer agreed to provide a copy.plaintiffs counsel also asked the court if it would entertain a declaration from the mediator would that be inappropriate as to what occurred the trial court agreed that it probably would be appropriate.attorney reback did not interpose an objection to disclosure of the consent agreement or the obtaining of a declaration from the mediator.
on august,plaintiffs filed their motion to enforce the settlement,on the basis that an oral agreement had been reached with while had ghaderi consent to settle the action.thus,plaintiffs argued any further consent from ghaderi would have been superfluous.plaintiffs supported their motion with a copy of ghaderi signed consent to settle the action for a declaration from plaintiffs counsel setting forth the events at the july,mediation the written settlement agreement executed by plaintiffs only and a short declaration from judge altman,confirming that the case was settled for and that ghaderi then revoked her consent.
on september,ghaderi,represented by attorney reback,filed her opposition to the motion.she raised no objections to the evidence relied upon by plaintiffs.in fact,her memorandum of points and authorities admitted that ghaderi gave consent to cap mpt to engage in settlement discussions on her behalf.any settlement value was to be limited to with no admission of liability a settlement offer of in exchange for a dismissal of the matter with prejudice and a waiver of costs was made and p laintiffs accepted and ghaderi then declined to settle and left the mediation without signing the written settlement agreement.ghaderi opposition was based on the premise that,since she did not sign the written settlement agreement,the settlement was not consummated and her subsequent written revocation of consent was therefore timely.
another opposition was filed on ghaderi behalf by attorney brandmeyer.the opposition was based on the following rationale.the summary procedure for enforcing settlements under code of civil procedure section generally requires the written consent or oral consent in open court of the party.robertson chen th,d.nevertheless,when the party is represented in settlement negotiations by an insurer who settles within policy limits,the party consent is superfluous as long as the insurer consents.fiege cooke th,d.however,in many professional liability policies,including the one under which was providing a defense for ghaderi,the policy gives the insured the right to approve or reject any settlement negotiated by the insurer.this is designed to prevent settlements which might be regarded as an admission of wrongdoing,thus injuring the insured professional reputation.in such a case,the insured written consent is necessary in order to enforce a settlement under code of civil procedure section.see robertson chen,supra,th at,fn,d.
a hearing on the motion was held on september.the court concluded the summary procedure of code of civil procedure section did not apply because neither ghaderi nor had signed the written agreement.nonetheless,the court expressed its opinion that an enforceable oral settlement agreement was reached and that ghaderi subsequent attempt to withdraw her consent was ineffective.the court and counsel then agreed that the best way to proceed would be for plaintiffs to amend their complaint to allege a cause of action for breach of contract.on march,plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint which asserted a cause of action for breach of contract.
on june,ghaderi moved for summary adjudication of the breach of contract cause of action.ghaderi motion was based on the theory that there was no valid contract because she did not sign the written settlement agreement.ghaderi motion was supported by her own declaration in which she stated that she had given her consent for to settle the case for her counsel had made a settlement offer to plaintiffs and she revoked her consent without executing the settlement agreement.in ghaderi separate statement of undisputed facts,she asserted the above facts were undisputed.
on august,plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motion,arguing that,during the time that had been authorized to settle the action on ghaderi behalf for,made the offer which was accepted,resulting in an enforceable oral contract.the opposition was supported by the transcript of ghaderi deposition,taken on august.at her deposition,ghaderi had testified in contrast to her declaration that she did not know if a offer had been made to plaintiffs at the mediation.attorney reback then stated,we not disputing the fact that the offer was made or that the plaintiffs accepted it.plaintiffs counsel responded,i accept the stipulation.attorney reback rejoined,great.the opposition was also supported by the deposition of amanugi,who testified that,based on ghaderi written consent to settlement,she had offered plaintiffs to settle the case,and that the offer had been accepted.
ghaderi reply memorandum again argued that her consent for to settle the case had remained in effect only until her revocation,and that she had revoked it prior to completion of the settlement agreement.
the trial court denied the motion on the basis that,since plaintiffs had unconditionally accepted the settlement offer,operating with ghaderi consent and within her authorization appears to have completed a contract before she revoked her consent.
on september,the trial court severed the breach of contract cause of action and ordered it tried first.the parties were directed to file simultaneous trial briefs.
on october,ghaderi filed her trial brief.in that document,filed nearly fifteen months after the mediation,ghaderi asserted,for the first time,that a ny attempt to introduce evidence of discussions,purported agreements,or any form of communication at mediation or thereafter is barred by the mediation confidentiality provisions of the evidence code.ghaderi trial brief raised no other issue.her sole position was that plaintiffs could not prove the existence of a contract to settle the malpractice action,because any proof would violate the confidentiality of the mediation.
the case proceeded to trial where,over objection,amanugi testified as to the events at the mediation.the trial court concluded that a valid,enforceable contract had been entered into prior to ghaderi withdrawal of her consent the court stated,whether,when and how ghaderi withdrew her consent is irrelevant if the settlement agreement was entered into by her agent acting within her consent.if so,the settlement agreement became effective and enforceable notwithstanding her later withdrawal of consent.the bottom issue,for this court,is whether an oral settlement agreement that was entered into by an attorney who was specifically authorized by his client to accept the settlement terms is enforceable.this settlement agreement,in the court view,meets the conditions for and is therefore enforceable as an oral contract.the trial court ordered specific performance of the agreement.
the court subsequently entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs for plus prejudgment interest.ghaderi filed a timely notice of appeal.
contentions of the parties 
ghaderi again argues that her revocation of consent was sufficient to prevent the settlement from becoming effective,and that no evidence of the events occurring at the mediation was admissible due to the principles of mediation confidentiality.plaintiffs dispute each of these arguments.
discussion 
a valid oral contract was formed 
under general rules of the laws of contract,a contract is formed when capable parties mutually agree to a lawful object supported by consideration.contracts may be oral,except as required by statute.once a valid offer is accepted,the parties are bound.a subsequent revocation is not valid.
when an insurer settles a case within policy limits under a policy that gives the insurer the right to settle without the insured consent,the insured consent to the settlement is unnecessary.fiege cooke,supra,th at,d.in such a case,the insurer is permitted to take full control of the settlement negotiations and the insured is precluded from interfering.id.at,d.the insured may not prevent settlement by purporting to withhold consent.ibid.
professional liability policies,however,present a different problem.by statute,no medical malpractice insurer shall enter into a settlement without the written consent of the insured.bus,subd.g.thus,unless such consent is provided,the insurer has no right to conclude a settlement of the action brought against the insured.when such an insurer has the written consent of the insured,however,the rule of fiege applies and the insurer may take full control of the settlement negotiations,within the limits of the insured written consent.the insured no longer has any right to object to the settlement or to otherwise interfere in the process 
in this case,had ghaderi written consent to settle the action for.with this authorization,entered into a valid oral contract to settle the action for that amount.ghaderi subsequent revocation of her consent was both irrelevant and ineffectual.was authorized when it made the offer which plaintiffs accepted the offer could not be revoked after the contract was formed.plaintiffs contractual right had attached and was legally bound to perform under the agreement whatever concerns it may have had about the effect of ghaderi tardy attempt to withdraw her consent.
mediation confidentiality is no bar 
evidence code section provides as follows except as otherwise provided in this chapter a no evidence of anything said or any admission made for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation or a mediation consultation is admissible or subject to discovery,and disclosure of the evidence shall not be compelled,in any arbitration,administrative adjudication,civil action,or other noncriminal proceeding in which,pursuant to law,testimony can be compelled to be given.b no writing that is prepared for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation or a mediation consultation,is admissible or subject to discovery,and disclosure of the writing shall not be compelled,in any arbitration,administrative adjudication,civil action,or other noncriminal proceeding in which,pursuant to law,testimony can be compelled to be given.c all communications,negotiations,or settlement discussions by and between participants in the course of a mediation or a mediation consultation shall remain confidential.the purpose of mediation confidentiality is to ensure open communication in mediation.stewart preston pipeline th,d.
in this case,the mediation took place on july.the next day,counsel appeared before the trial court,set forth the facts that had taken place,and sought guidance on how to proceed.thereafter,for fifteen months,the parties litigated the legal effect of the events which had taken place at the mediation.indeed,the relevant.ghaderi written consent to settlement,the offer,its acceptance,and ghaderi subsequent revocation of and are undisputed the sole dispute was as to their legal effect.until her october,trial brief in this action,ghaderi never challenged the admissibility of these facts or the trial court authority to receive such evidence and to determine its legal effect.indeed,ghaderi stated those facts in a declaration,argued them in her motion,and asserted they were undisputed in her separate statement.her attorney went so far as to stipulate to some of these facts at her deposition,stating that ghaderi was not disputing the offer or its acceptance.these circumstances clearly demonstrate that this evidence was not compelled in violation of evidence code,section.nor would any purpose or rationale of the mediation statute be served by applying it in this case.
moreover,under these facts,for ghaderi to now assert mediation confidentiality is an impermissible exaltation of form over substance.ghaderi does not dispute the relevant facts she never has.she has simply decided that,since the facts do not appear to favor her current legal position which had been repeatedly rejected by the trial court,she will now assert that the court can take no notice or evidence of these facts,because they happened to occur in the course of a mediation.recognition of mediation confidentiality in this case would not help to ensure open communication in mediation but it would allow a disgruntled litigant to use the shield of mediation confidentiality as a convenient place behind which to hide facts,although indisputably true,she no longer believes are favorable.
when a party asks the court to determine a matter,the party is estopped from arguing the court action was,in fact,outside of the court statutory power to resolve.gee american realty construction,th,d conservatorship of kevin th,d.this is,in effect,what ghaderi has done in this case.for fifteen months,ghaderi placed before the trial court the facts of the mediation and sought a legal determination as to their effect,effectively conceding the trial court jurisdiction to resolve the dispute.only when it appeared that the trial court determination was going against her did ghaderi then argue that the mediation confidentiality statutes put the undisputed facts beyond the court reach.to allow ghaderi to seek the court resolution of the legal effect of the proceedings before the mediator and thereafter argue the evidence code barred the court from doing so would permit her to trifle with the courts.gee american realty construction,supra,th at,d.
we find ghaderi attempt to prevent enforcement of the undisputed settlement contract on the ground of mediation confidentiality particularly egregious in this case,in that,once ghaderi signed the written consent to settle,she had no further rights to object to the settlement at all.see fiege cooke,supra,th at,d when the insured is fully covered by insurance,the primary insurer is entitled to take control of the settlement negotiations and the insured is precluded from interfering therewith.ghaderi consented to settling plaintiffs claim and the claim was settled prior to ghaderi revoking her consent.just as ghaderi has no authority to challenge the settlement by a subsequent withdrawal of her consent,she similarly has no authority to challenge the settlement by raising the principles of mediation confidentiality.having given her written consent to,ghaderi can not be heard to complain about the settlement reached.
we do not here disagree with the principle that mediation confidentiality rights can not be waived impliedly by merely raising a claim about an agreement reached through mediation.eisendrath superior court th,d.we simply hold that once a party voluntarily declares certain facts to be true,stipulates that she does not dispute them and extensively litigates the legal effect of such facts,she is estopped to later claim that the court must disregard those facts based upon a belated assertion of mediation confidentiality we therefore affirm 
disposition 
the judgment is affirmed.plaintiffs shall recover their costs on appeal.
i respectfully dissent.
introduction 
by avoiding the mediation confidentiality statutes,et,the majority ignores the pivotal and dispositive law governing this case.a proper analysis of this statutory scheme,together with its legislative history,leads inescapably to the conclusion that in this case there was no admissible evidence of an oral contract.therefore,the trial court erred in accepting oral and documentary evidence made during the mediation and in entering judgment for plaintiffs on their breach of oral contract cause of action.the matter must be reversed and remanded for a trial on the merits.
factual and procedural background 
the initial complaint.
on march,plaintiffs filed a wrongful death complaint against lida ghaderi,alleging medical malpractice caused the death of kintausha clemmons clemmons.
the july,mediation.
cooperative of american physicians,mutual protection trust was ghaderi medical malpractice provider 
on july,the parties attended mediation with the honorable robert altman,retired.plaintiffs and their counsel appeared.ghaderi was present with her two attorneys,kent brandmeyer and robert reback.attorney brandmeyer was the attorney and attorney reback was cumis counsel obi amanugi,a claims specialist,was also present.
before any discussions occurred,amanugi presented ghaderi with a standard written consent to settlement form.this,three paragraph document authorized to negotiate a settlement on behalf of ghaderi.it recognized that the settlement amount was not to exceed that authorized by claims review committee and was not to be construed as an admission of liability.it also stated that ghaderi consent to settlement could only be revoked in writing and would remain in force until a written revocation was received by at its offices 
ghaderi executed the consent to settlement form and in her own handwriting added the following statement to the document the settlement value is limited to one hundred twenty five thousand dollars zero cents.at the time ghaderi signed the consent to settlement,she understood her consent would remain in effect until her written revocation was received by.
the parties engaged in settlement discussions.at one point,judge altman was instructed to offer plaintiffs to settle the matter in exchange for a dismissal with prejudice and a waiver of costs.pursuant to these instructions,judge altman extended that offer to plaintiffs.plaintiffs accepted the offer.
judge altman then placed the essential terms of the settlement into a document for the parties to sign.additionally,the proposed settlement agreement stated in part that the parties further agree that this agreement may be introduced into evidence in any subsequent proceeding to enforce the terms of this agreement and that evidence code section does not apply in such a proceeding.plaintiffs and their counsel signed the settlement agreement,which was initialed by judge altman as witness.
ghaderi was informed that the case had settled.ghaderi stated she did not agree with the resolution of the case and declined to sign the settlement agreement.ghaderi left the building without signing the written settlement agreement prepared by judge altman.neither of her counsel signed the settlement agreement.
amanugi contacted the office and learned that would consider ghaderi oral revocation of her consent valid.
the july,hearing.
at a hearing on two motions,the plaintiffs attorney and the attorney representing ghaderi appeared.both counsel recounted the events of the preceding day,including that plaintiffs had accepted the offer,but ghaderi had departed before signing the settlement agreement prepared by judge altman.the parties asked for guidance.plaintiffs attorney expressed the bewilderment of both counsel when he stated,we are somewhat flummoxed by this

the following day,attorney informed the trial court that was still trying to figure it out,but he did not think would pay if ghaderi did not consent.the trial court set an order to show cause re dismissal and ordered ghaderi to appear on that date.
ghaderi personally appeared at the dismissal hearing with counsel.after an unreported conference in chambers,the trial court placed on the record the fact that ghaderi was unwilling to consent to the settlement.the trial court suggested plaintiffs bring a motion to enforce settlement code civ,and set a hearing to consider such a motion.
plaintiffs motion to enforce settlement.
plaintiffs moved to enforce settlement pursuant to code of civil procedure section.after describing the events of july,plaintiffs contended that a valid oral contract was entered into because ghaderi had provided written consent to settle.plaintiffs attached to their motion ghaderi written consent to settle,the settlement agreement prepared by judge altman and signed only by plaintiffs and their counsel,and a declaration from judge altman.
ghaderi did not dispute plaintiffs summary of the event of july.however,she opposed plaintiffs motion arguing that no agreement was consummated because her consent had been withdrawn and thus,has no authority to execute a settlement agreement on her behalf.ghaderi also argued that the settlement could not be enforced because it did not meet the requirements of code of civil procedure section as there was no writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the court lastly,ghaderi argued that since her insurance policy with was a professional liability policy,no settlement could be enforced because there was no consent to settle as required by business and professions code section,subdivision g 
the trial court denied the motion to enforce settlement.the court concluded that the requirements of code of civil procedure section had not been met.the trial court speculated,however,that there might be an enforceable oral contract and suggested plaintiffs amend the complaint to allege breach of contract.
the breach of contract cause of action.
on march,plaintiffs amended the complaint to add a cause of action for breach of contract.plaintiffs alleged that ghaderi breached an oral settlement arrived at during the mediation.
plaintiffs served a request for admissions on ghaderi and deposed ghaderi.in response to this discovery,ghaderi did not deny the events that had occurred during the july,mediation.
the summary adjudication motion.
ghaderi moved for summary adjudication of the breach of contract cause of action.ghaderi argued there was no enforceable settlement because the mediation had concluded before a formal settlement agreement had been executed and her refusal to sign the settlement agreement and her act of leaving the building were manifestations of her lack of consent.ghaderi also argued these acts constituted a withdrawal of her consent to settle.bus.
the trial court denied ghaderi motion for summary adjudication.
on september,the trial court granted plaintiffs motion to sever the causes of action.the case proceeded to a court trial only on plaintiffs cause of action for breach of oral contract.
the trial and judgment entered against ghaderi.
plaintiffs submitted the following documents at trial the consent to settlement signed by ghaderi the settlement agreement prepared by judge altman ghaderi july,letter revoking her consent to settlement ghaderi deposition testimony amanugi deposition testimony and a declaration from judge altman.
in ghaderi trial brief she argued that the mediation confidentiality rules codified in evidence code section et,and in particular evidence code section,made inadmissible all evidence of an oral contract.ghaderi argued,the law of the state of california does not permit discussions at a mediation or documents generated thereat to be introduced at trial to prove that an agreement was created there.ghaderi filed a formal objection to plaintiffs evidence in which she objected to any and all testimony documentary evidence concerning the any sic mediation held in this action pursuant to california evidence code,et and ryan garcia th,d.ghaderi asserted that plaintiffs could not prove the existence of an oral contract to settle the medical malpractice case because any proof would violate the confidentiality of mediation.
at the bench trial of the breach of contract cause of action,the parties agreed to almost everything that had occurred on july,including that they had entered into mediation discussions once ghaderi had provided written consent to to settle the case up to.the parties further agreed that plaintiffs had accepted a offer,judge altman prepared a written settlement agreement reflecting the parties agreement,and ghaderi had refused to sign the document and had left the mediation.the only factual item in conflict was what amanugi did once ghaderi refused to sign the settlement agreement.over objection,amanugi was called to the stand and testified about those events.the bulk of the trial consisted of arguments of counsel as to the effect of ghaderi act of refusing to sign the settlement agreement prepared by judge altman and whether the mediation confidentiality statutes,including evidence code section,prevented plaintiffs from proving their case.
the trial court issued a tentative statement of decision in favor of plaintiffs on the breach of contract cause of action.the trial court held an enforceable oral contract for settlement came into existence before ghaderi withdrew her consent.the trial court reasoned that ghaderi had given her attorneys,her authorized agents,authority to communicate a offer to plaintiffs,and that offer had been accepted prior to any withdrawal of consent.
on december,the trial court adopted the tentative decision as its final decision,issued a final statement of decision,and entered a judgment in favor of plaintiffs.the judgment ordered ghaderi to pay plaintiffs,plus prejudgment interest and costs.
ghaderi timely appealed.
discussion 
introduction.
in mediation,ghaderi gave her attorneys the authority to offer plaintiffs up to and including to settle the case.acting within the confines of their authority,the attorneys caused this offer to be conveyed to plaintiffs who accepted the offer.ghaderi refused to sign a settlement agreement,and terminated the mediation by leaving the building.the majority does not dispute any of these facts.inexplicably,however,the majority never discusses the mediation confidentiality statutes.
i would hold that the mediation confidentiality statutes contained in evidence code section et,preclude plaintiffs from proving the existence of an offer and acceptance,the terms of an oral settlement,or the creation of an oral agreement.i reach this holding by examining the confidentiality statutes,the law revision commission comments to the present statutes that articulate the legislature intent,and the most recent case authority.all of these compel one of an oral agreement formed during the july,mediation was made inadmissible in the trial by evidence code section and plaintiffs can not satisfy the explicit burden under evidence code sections and to introduce evidence of an oral agreement.
the mediation confidentiality statutes.
california legislature has a strong policy favoring mediation as an alternative to litigation.because mediation provides a simple,quick,and economical means of resolving disputes,and because it may also help reduce the court system backlog of cases,it is in the public interest to encourage its use.citation.doe superior court th,d.
the mediation confidentiality statutes were designed by the legislature to promote a candid and informal exchange regarding events in the past this frank exchange is achieved only if the participants know that what is said in the mediation will not be used to their detriment through later court proceedings and other adjudicatory processes.citations.foxgate homeowners,bramalea california,cal th,d,foxgate.c onfidentiality is essential to effective mediation ibid.
commencing with evidence code section et,the legislature has delineated the parameters of mediation confidentiality and the express statutory exceptions thereto these statutes apply to all mediations,except family conciliation proceedings,et,mediation of custody and visitation issues,et,and court supervised mandatory settlement conferences pursuant to california rules of court,rule.
although m ediation may take many forms saeta superior court,supra,th at,d,it is defined broadly in evidence code section as a process in which a neutral person or persons facilitate communication between the disputants to assist them in reaching a mutually acceptable agreement.cal.law revision com,west ann.supp.foll,to accommodate a wide range of mediation styles,the definition is broad,without specific limitations on format.
evidence code section is an expansive limitation on the admissibility of evidence emanating from mediations.it prohibits any person,mediator and participants alike,from revealing any written or oral communication made during mediation.foxgate,supra,cal th at,d.it bars admission in any civil action,and in other specified proceedings,of anything said or any admission,as well as any writing,made for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation or mediation consultation.evidence code section mandates that all communications,negotiations,or settlement discussions between the participants in the course of mediation shall be confidential.it also makes such evidence not subject to discovery.
evidence code section reads 
except as otherwise provided in this chapter 
a no evidence of anything said or any admission made for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation or a mediation consultation is admissible or subject to discovery,and disclosure of the evidence shall not be compelled,in any arbitration,administrative adjudication,civil action,or other noncriminal proceeding in which,pursuant to law,testimony can be compelled to be given.
b no writing,as defined in section,that is prepared for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation or a mediation consultation,is admissible or subject to discovery,and disclosure of the writing shall not be compelled,in any arbitration,administrative adjudication,civil action,or other noncriminal proceeding in which,pursuant to law,testimony can be compelled to be given.
c all communications,negotiations,or settlement discussions by and between participants in the course of a mediation or a mediation consultation shall remain confidential.
the only way evidence of an oral agreement arrived at in mediation can be admissible is for it to meet the requirements of an express statutory exception to evidence code section.this exception is delineated in evidence code section,which refers to evidence code section.
evidence code section states 
an oral agreement made in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation is not made inadmissible,or protected from disclosure,by the provisions of this chapter if any of the following conditions are satisfied 
a the agreement is in accordance with section.
b the agreement is in accordance with subdivisions a,b,and d of section,and all parties to the agreement expressly agree,in writing or orally in accordance with section,to disclosure of the agreement.
c the agreement is in accordance with subdivisions a,b,and d of section,and the agreement is used to show fraud,duress,or illegality that is relevant to an issue in dispute.
evidence code section states 
an oral agreement in accordance with section means an oral agreement that satisfies all of the following conditions 
a the oral agreement is recorded by a court reporter,tape recorder,or other reliable means of sound recording.
b the terms of the oral agreement are recited on the record in the presence of the parties and the mediator,and the parties express on the record that they agree to the terms recited.
c the parties to the oral agreement expressly state on the record that the agreement is enforceable or binding or words to that effect.
d the recording is reduced to writing and the writing is signed by the parties within hours after it is recorded.
evidence code section also permits the disclosure of oral agreements emanating from a mediation if there is an express agreement to do so,under certain conditions.it specifies,in part,that a communication or writing made or prepared for the purpose of,or in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation or a mediation consultation,is not made inadmissible if there is express agreement to disclose in writing or orally in accordance with section,subd.a.
other statutes also delineate express exceptions to mediation confidentiality.for example,evidence code section addresses when written settlement agreements emanating from mediation are not made inadmissible evidence code section delineates when a mediator report or findings are not confidential.
the legislature also clarified that statements made during mediation and mediation materials are confidential not only during mediation,but also after the mediation ends,cal.law revision com,west ann.supp.foll.evidence code section defines when mediation ends for purposes of confidentiality.this includes when there is an oral agreement fully resolving the dispute in accordance with evidence code section,subd.a.evidence code section recognizes that a party may end a mediation without reaching an agreement,subd.a.
plaintiffs had no admissible evidence of an oral contract.
the comprehensive mediation confidentiality statutes delineated above makes it clear that plaintiffs are precluded from proving their cause of action.to prove their breach of oral contract cause of action,plaintiffs had to show that ghaderi had given settlement authority to her attorneys,the terms of the offer,and that the offer was accepted before ghaderi rescinded authority.at trial,ghaderi objected to all testimony and documentary evidence concerning the mediation pursuant to evidence code section et.a proper ruling on that objection should have prevented plaintiffs from proving their case as there would have been no admissible evidence of an oral agreement.
subdivisions a and c of evidence code section preclude admission in any civil proceeding of all communications,negotiations,settlement discussions,and anything said for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to a mediation.thus,for plaintiffs to prove the oral agreement,they would have to meet the explicit requirements of the exceptions in evidence code section,that in turn,refer to evidence code section.plaintiffs are unable to do so.
specifically,after the mediation ended,there was no reliable means of sound recording,such as a recording by a court reporter or tape recorder that recorded an agreement the terms of the oral agreement were not recited on the record in the presence of the parties and the mediator and the parties did not express on the record the terms of such an agreement the parties did not expressly state on the record that the agreement was enforceable or binding and the agreement was not reduced to writing or signed by the parties within hours after a recording.the parties did not expressly agree in writing or orally that the agreement could be disclosed and there were no issues of fraud,duress,or illegality.
to the extent the settlement agreement prepared by judge altman was used as evidence of an oral contract,this writing was also made inadmissible by subdivision b of evidence code section,as well as evidence code sections and,as there was no express agreement that it could be disclosed and it was not signed by the settling parties.see fns.although the settlement agreement drafted by judge altman included a provision waiving evidence code section,neither ghaderi nor her attorneys signed the settlement agreement.rather,when ghaderi stated she did not want to settle,did not sign the settlement agreement,and left the scene,she ended the mediation without reaching an agreement and terminated the mediation,subd.c see fn.likewise,judge altman declaration was inadmissible.
because the evidence of an oral agreement was made inadmissible by evidence code section and the exceptions in evidence code sections and do not apply,there was no evidence to prove plaintiffs breach of contract cause of action and ghaderi was entitled to judgment as a matter of law 
the california law revision commission comments demonstrate that there is no enforceable oral contract.
my interpretation of the mediation confidentiality scheme is bolstered by the california law revision commission comments to the statutes.these comments demonstrate that the statutes were designed to make inadmissible in a civil proceeding any evidence of an oral agreement in this case.
to provide context to the california law revision commission comments,it is necessary that i discuss two cases decided prior to the enactment of the present statutes.
ryan and regents.
in,ryan garcia,supra,th,d ryan addressed a situation similar to the one before us.
in ryan,the parties mediated their dispute.after meeting with the parties,the mediator announced a settlement had been reached.someone stated the terms of the agreement and one party was assigned to reduce the agreement to writing.the parties left,believing the case was settled they later disagreed about the terms of the settlement and no writing was executed.ryan,supra,th at,d.
the plaintiffs amended their complaint to add a cause of action to enforce an oral settlement agreement and the case proceeded to a court trial only on that cause of action.ryan,supra,th at,d.at trial,the defendants objected to anything said during the mediation,contending such statements were inadmissible under former evidence code section section,the predecessor to evidence code section.the trial court overruled the objection as to statements made after the mediator announced the parties had reached an agreement.the court reasoned mediation had ended when an agreement was reached,and the statement of the terms of the agreement was therefore not a part of mediation.ryan,supra,at,d.
the appellate court phrased the issue before it as whether the evidence used to prove the existence and terms of the oral settlement agreement was admissible.ryan,supra,th at,d.ryan examined section that contained some of the language now found in evidence code section.section stated in relevant part evidence of anything said or of any admission made in the course of the mediation is not admissible in evidence ryan,supra,at,d.
ryan had to define the operative phrase,in the course of the mediation,as neither this phrase nor the boundaries of the mediation process were defined in section.ryan,supra,th at,d.the plaintiffs argued that the evidence of the existence and terms of the settlement agreement were not made in the course of mediation because the mediation was successfully completed when the mediator convened the parties to recite the terms of the settlement.ibid.they contend ed this must be so because,otherwise,settlements reached in mediation would be unenforceable.ibid.
ryan,supra,th,d,rejected the plaintiffs argument concluding,as the defendant had asserted,that the existence and terms of the settlement agreement were part of the mediation and,therefore,were inadmissible as evidence.id.at.ryan,supra,reasoned that section must be interpreted broadly to serve its purpose,that is,to encourage the use of mediation by ensuring confidentiality by using the broad phrase in the course of the mediation,the legislature manifested its intent to protect a broad range of statements from later use as evidence in litigation.furthermore,narrow interpretation would lead the trial court to filter the mediation proceedings to determine if any portion of the proceeding crossed the line from negotiation into agreement.this is the type of disclosure and use of statements made in mediation the confidentiality statute is meant to preclude.w e need not undertake the task of defining the boundaries of mediation.instead,we merely determine that the statements made here among the parties and the mediator,at the time and in the place set for mediation,were well within the course of the mediation,and,therefore,evidence of those statements was inadmissible in a later proceeding under section.indeed,if the parties to mediation sign a written settlement agreement waiving confidentiality,the agreement can be enforced in the courts by a simple motion,subd.a code civ.ryan,supra,d.
ryan,supra,th,d,held that the trial court erred by admitting evidence,over objection,of statements made in the course of mediation.citation.without this evidence,there is no substantial evidence of an oral settlement agreement and the judgment can not be sustained.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
justice raye dissented in ryan.he would have held that o nce a compromise is reached the mediation process is over.an oral agreement can not be crafted until after compromise has been reached.therefore an oral statement of the terms of the agreement does not fall within evidence code.ryan,supra,th at,d dis.opn.of raye.
soon after ryan,supra,a conflict was created when regents of university of california sumner th,d regents was decided.in regents,supra,the plaintiffs brought a sexual harassment action against the regents,and others.id.at,d.following mediation sessions,the terms of a settlement agreement were dictated into a tape recorder.the plaintiffs indicated they agreed to the terms of the settlement.the settlement required the formal approval of the regents and the parties agreed that after the regents approved the settlement,the terms would be placed into a formal document.id.at,d.however,after the dictated settlement was concluded and before the typed release was prepared,the plaintiffs decided not to go through with the settlement.ibid.thereafter,the defendants brought actions to enforce the dictated settlement agreement.the trial court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,from which the plaintiffs appealed.id.at,d.
in affirming the summary judgment,regents,supra,th,d,rejected the reasoning of ryan,supra.among other holdings,regents held that ryan was distinguishable because i n the present case,the parties concluded their mediation session,and then created a transcript of the settlement they had reached in order to memorialize the agreement they had reached.the transcript of the settlement was not a part of the mediation session,where section would bar introduction into evidence of concessions of liability made only for purposes of mediation or settlement discussions.no valid purpose would be served here by misinterpreting to bar introduction of evidence regarding the settlement agreed to by the parties.regents,supra,at,d.
regents,supra,th,d,concluded by stating that justice raye dissenting opinion in ryan,supra,properly recognized that evidence of oral statements defining the scope of a settlement agreement reached after mediation is admissible to enforce the settlement,since the legislature enactment of section shields only statements made in the course of mediation from admission in subsequent proceedings,and section does not affect the admissibility of evidence of an oral settlement which is reached after mediation has successfully concluded once a compromise is reached the mediation process is over.an oral agreement can not be crafted until after compromise has been reached.therefore an oral statement of the terms of the agreement does not fall within section.regents,supra,at,d citing dis.opn.of raye.
this split of authority was quickly addressed in when the legislature repealed section and replaced it with the comprehensive scheme now found in evidence code section et.stats,ch.
with the enactment of evidence code section,the present statutory scheme has continued,without substantial change,the provisions of section.however,the protections in evidence code section are more expansive.evidence code section explicitly applies in a subsequent arbitration or administrative adjudication,as well as in any civil action or proceeding in addition,the protection of section a extends to oral communications made for the purpose of or pursuant to a mediation,not just oral communications made in the course of the mediation.s ubdivision b expressly encompasses any type of writing as defined in section,regardless of whether the representations are on paper or on some other medium.cal.law revision com,west ann.supp.foll.
when the exceptions to evidence code section were drafted,evidence code sections and were crafted to set the standards for the admission in civil proceedings of oral agreements made in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation.these and other statutes were expressly designed to codify ryan,supra,and reject regents,supra.
as the california law revision commission comments to evidence code section state in part evidence code,section sets forth specific circumstances under which mediation confidentiality is inapplicable to an oral agreement reached through mediation.except in those circumstances,sections mediation confidentiality and codify the rule of ryan,supra,th,d mediation confidentiality applies to oral statement of settlement terms,and reject the contrary approach of regents,supra,th,d mediation confidentiality does not protect oral statement of settlement terms.subdivision a of section facilitates enforcement of an oral agreement that is recorded and memorialized in writing in accordance with section.cal.law revision com,west ann.supp.foll.
the legislature has established by statute when a mediation ends.as relevant here,evidence code section,subdivision a provides that a mediation ends when a n oral agreement that fully resolves the dispute is reached in accordance with evidence code section.see fn.the california law revision commission comments to evidence code section state in part subdivision a applies where mediation participants fully resolve their dispute by an oral agreement that is recorded and memorialized in writing in accordance with section.the mediation is over upon completion of that procedure,and the confidentiality protections of this chapter do not apply to any later proceedings,such as attempts to further refine the content of the agreement.see section oral agreements reached through mediation cal.law revision com,west ann.supp.foll.
thus,by enacting the present comprehensive mediation confidentiality statutory scheme,the legislature firmly articulated the policy that all communications of an oral settlement and all communications relating to such an agreement,including negotiations,made for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation are inadmissible unless there was compliance with the express statutory requirements of evidence code sections and.
it is tempting to prohibit ghaderi from escaping the deal to which she agreed.but,such a result would encourage a flexible approach to the statutes.the legislature has the mediation confidentiality statutes after ryan and regents to reject that approach.the legislature has articulated explicit steps that a party must take to admit evidence of an oral agreement made for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation.because the parties did not take these steps here,such as by memorializing the agreement in a recording or in a writing,the evidence of the july,oral agreement was inadmissible.
precedent establishes that we are not permitted to judicially craft an exception to the statutory scheme.
by focusing on estoppel,the majority in essence is attempting to create a new exception to the comprehensive scheme.this can not be done.in foxgate,supra,cal th,d,and rojas superior court cal th,d,rojas,the supreme court pronounced that mediation confidentiality is to be strictly enforced,even in situations that on the surface might beg for flexibility.
in foxgate,supra,cal th,d,the trial court awarded sanctions based upon a mediator report that there had been misconduct during the mediation proceedings.id.at,d.the report indicated that an attorney had engaged in a pattern of tactics pursued in bad faith and solely intended to delay.id.at,d.although the court of appeal reversed for other reasons,it also addressed the admissibility of the report.the court of appeal found it was necessary to create a nonstatutory exception to the mediation confidentiality statutes so that the mediator report could be considered and sanctions imposed.it reasoned that otherwise parties who disobeyed valid orders governing participation in mediation would be shielded from their obstructive behavior.id.at,d.the supreme court reversed concluding that the mediation confidentiality statutes are clear.evidence code s ection prohibits any person,mediator and participants alike,from revealing any written or oral communication made during mediation.foxgate,supra,at,d.to carry out the purpose of encouraging mediation by ensuring confidentiality,the statutory scheme unqualifiedly bars disclosure of communications made during mediation absent an express statutory exception.id.at,d,fn.omitted.foxgate held that the motion for sanctions and the trial court consideration of the motion and attached documents violated both evidence code s ections and.foxgate,supra,at,d.thus,even though the goal of preventing bad faith conduct was laudable,the purpose of the mediation promote and ensure open communications in not be served if exceptions to the statutes were judicially created 
in rojas,supra,cal th,d,the owner of an apartment complex settled a construction defect case with the contractors as a result of a mediation.as part of the settlement,the parties stipulated that reports and photographs prepared for the mediation were to remain confidential.in a subsequent lawsuit,tenants of the apartment complex sought to discover the files,witness statements,analyses of raw data,and photographs prepared during the prior mediation.noting that all of the items were prepared for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,the mediation in the underlying action id.at,d,the rojas court held that the mediation confidentiality statutes are not subject to a good cause exception.ibid.since permitting the disclosure of the items conflicted with evidence code section,the items were not discoverable.
together,foxgate and rojas stand for the proposition that the courts may not craft exceptions to the statutory scheme because the legislature has decided that mediation confidentiality is required to further the purpose of mediation and has decided to statutorily limit the number of exceptions thereto.
thus,it would be unwarranted for us to expand the legislature list of express statutory exceptions by judicially permitting plaintiffs to prove an oral contract when to do so would not further the purpose of the statutory scheme.
the arguments of the majority are not persuasive.
the majority concludes that a valid contract was formed because ghaderi provided the attorneys for her insurance carrier with consent to settle and the case was resolved within the confines of that authority.for this proposition,the majority relies only upon fiege cooke th,d fiege.fiege is irrelevant to the present situation and its rationale is inapplicable.
in fiege,supra,th,d,the plaintiff orally agreed before the court to a settlement arrived at between himself and the insurers of the defendants.id.at,d.thereafter,the plaintiff tried to escape from the settlement and the defendants successfully moved for enforcement of the agreement pursuant to code of civil procedure section.fiege,supra,at,d.code of civil procedure section permits the enforcement of an oral agreement under certain circumstances.it states in part,if parties to pending litigation stipulate,in a writing signed by the parties,outside the presence of the court or orally before the court,for settlement of the case,or part thereof,the court,upon motion,may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.italics added.
quoting extensively from robertson chen th,d robertson,fiege concluded that while the defendants themselves did not agree in writing or orally before the court to the settlement,the agreement was enforceable because the attorneys for the defendants agreed to the settlement orally before the court in the presence of the insurers representatives who did not object,the insurers had total control over settlement,and the insurers fully covered the settlement under the insurance policies.fiege,supra,th at,d.fiege held that this satisfied code of civil procedure section requirement that the parties had agreed to the settlement orally before the court.
fiege,supra,th,d does not control the issues here.the issue in this case is not who negotiated the settlement on behalf of ghaderi,but if the oral agreement formed during the july,mediation can be proven.the mediation statutes do not provide for an exception to the requirements of evidence code sections,and when mediation negotiations are being handled by an insurance carrier representatives.
nor does the rationale of fiege,supra,th at,d,apply here.fiege recognized that in levy superior court cal th,d,the supreme court held that the term parties as used in code of civil procedure section means the litigants themselves,and does not include their attorneys of record.fiege,supra,at,d.fiege also recognized that levy conclusion was based on the proposition that the legislature intended to require litigants direct participation because this tends to ensure that the settlement is the result of their mature reflection and deliberate assent.t his protects the parties against hasty and improvident settlement agreements by impressing upon them the seriousness and finality of the decision to settle,and that it protects parties from impairment of their substantial rights without their knowledge and consent.citation.id.at,d.however,fiege concluded that the goals discussed in levy were met when litigants,by contract,have given total control to their insurance carriers to resolve a dispute and the negotiated settlement is fully covered by the policy.in such situations,the right to settle rests with the insurer and not the insured.fiege,supra,at,d robertson,supra,th at,d.as robertson,supra,recognized,this rationale does not apply when there is a professional liability policy,such as the one ghaderi had with.
robertson,supra,the case fiege quoted extensively,correctly stated an exception to the general rule affording insurers the unconditional right to settle most third party claims without the insured consent are the provisions in professional liability policies which often give the insured the right to approve or reject any settlement negotiated by the insurer.this is designed to prevent settlements which might be regarded in the community as an admission of wrongdoing by the insured,thus injuring the insured professional reputation.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group et,to see,bus,subd.d requiring the consent of health care professionals for settlement of health care malpractice claims accord,carlile farmers ins.exchange d,fn.the rationale of levy superior court,supra,cal th,d,would apply to protect the insured in the professional liability context where the insured consent is specifically required for settlement.robertson,supra,th at,fn,d.
additionally,unlike fiege,supra,and robertson,supra,the case before us does not involve a traffic accident where monetary considerations are paramount in settling the dispute.while would be responsible for the financial aspect of settling with plaintiffs,other aspects vital to a resolution were significant to ghaderi,such as the potential harm to ghaderi reputation.thus,as business and professions code section,subdivision g see fn.demands,ghaderi explicit approval of a settlement would be required.when that approval was withdrawn before any settlement was finalized,there was no enforceable deal.
lastly,even if the rationale of fiege,supra,applies when there is a professional liability policy,it is inappropriate to do so here.
the purported july,settlement took place in a mediation,before a mediator.code of civil procedure section permits an expedited proceeding to enforce settlements when the parties to pending litigation stipulate orally before the court when the oral agreement sought to be enforced was made orally before a mediator who had no adjudicatory function,the agreement was not before the court.murphy padilla th,d in re marriage of assemi cal th,d,clarified by levy superior court,supra,cal th at,fn,d.after the mediation,when ghaderi and her attorneys explained the events of july,to the trial court,they did so to explain why ghaderi believed there was no enforceable contract.further,the mediation ended when ghaderi refused to execute the settlement agreement and left the mediation.indicated it would consider her withdrawal of consent effective and thereafter,always argued to the trial court that there was no enforceable settlement.thus,it can not be said that a mediated settlement was the result of mature reflection and deliberate assent.to enforce the oral settlement by the use of the expedited procedures provided in code of civil procedure section would impair ghaderi substantial rights without her knowledge and consent,and without her carrier,agreeing to the resolution of the case.
the majority holds that ghaderi is estopped from asserting the mediation confidentiality statutes.this holding turns a blind eye to the mediation confidentiality statutory scheme and is a veiled attempt at relabeling waiver as estoppel.
throughout the litigation in this case,ghaderi and her attorneys honestly described the events of july,that raised the issue as to whether there was an enforceable oral contract.the majority concedes that these representations can not be classified as an implied waiver by ghaderi of the mediation confidentiality statutes.this concession is based upon eisendrath superior court th,d eisendrath.
in eisendrath,supra,th,d,a former husband filed a motion to correct a spousal support agreement.the judgment was based upon a settlement reached in mediation.id.at,d.the argued that the order did not accurately reflect the parties agreement.in support of the motion,the filed a declaration that recalled mediation negotiations and conversations.id.at,d.the filed a motion for a continuance so that she could depose the mediator.she stated she was willing to waive mediation confidentiality and argued her had impliedly waived the mediation privilege.id.at,d.the opposed the request and asked for a protective order barring the deposition,other discovery,and admission of any communications during the mediation sessions.in his opposition,the stated he would not rely on discussions within the scope of mediation confidentiality for his motion to correct the judgment.the trial court denied the protective order finding that both parties had impliedly waived the mediation confidentiality statutes.ibid.
on appeal,eisendrath,supra,th,d,held that without express consent as required in the mediation confidentiality statutes,the had not impliedly waived confidentiality by discussing confidential material in his declaration.id.at.eisendrath recognized that because the needed information to make his argument,and because express waivers of confidentiality from both parties were required,the had a substantial measure of control over the ability to present evidence in support of his motion to correct the spousal support agreement.nonetheless,this result does not disturb our interpretation of the statutory scheme in question.in explaining that the legislature had balanced conflicting policies in enacting this scheme,the foxgate court recognized that the scheme effectively gives control over evidence of some sanctionable misconduct to the party engaged in the misconduct.following the foxgate court,we assume that the legislature considered these limitations on the presentation of evidence when it enacted the statutory scheme.id.at,d.
thus,the fact that prior to trial ghaderi revealed in her pleadings and orally before the court confidential material does not result in an implied waiver of the mediation confidentiality statutes although the majority agrees that there was no implied waiver here,the majority attempts to turn these same facts into an estoppel.
the majority is mixing traditional notions of equitable estoppel with estoppel to contest the court jurisdiction.
traditionally,equitable estoppel is a concept based upon fairness.in order to establish a claim or defense based on equitable estoppel,a party must establish four elements the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon,or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was so intended the other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts and he must rely upon the conduct to his injury.citation.citation.chen superior court th,fn,d.
here,plaintiffs knew all of the facts and they did not change their position in reliance upon any action taken by ghaderi.there is no unfairness to plaintiffs as they can return to the trial court and litigate the merits of their medical malpractice case.
also,the majority reliance upon gee american realty construction,th,d and conservatorship of kevin th,d confuses another type of estoppel.the majority states,when a party asks the court to determine a matter,the party is estopped from arguing the court action was,in fact,outside the court statutory power to resolve.ante,at.this is an imprecise statement of the law,as demonstrated by the two cases cited by the majority,and an attempt at making an around the strict limits of the confidentiality statutes.
the supreme court in in re griffin cal d,articulated the correct legal proposition when the court has jurisdiction of the subject,a party who seeks or consents to action beyond the court power as defined by statute or decisional rule may be estopped to complain of the ensuing action in excess of jurisdiction.citations.whether he shall be estopped depends on the importance of the irregularity not only to the parties but to the functioning of the courts and in some instances on other considerations of public policy.a litigant who has stipulated to a procedure in excess of jurisdiction may be estopped to question it when to hold otherwise would permit the parties to trifle with the courts.citation.on the other hand waiver of procedural requirements may not be permitted when the allowance of a deviation would lead to confusion in the processing of other cases by other litigants.citation.substantive rules based on public policy sometimes control the allowance or disallowance of estoppel.id.at.
for example,a defendant was not estopped to attack banishment as a condition of probation even though he requested it,as public policy forbade banishment.people blakeman d.on the other hand a party who has procured a divorce decree is estopped to claim later that it is invalid.in re griffin,supra,cal d at.or,when a defendant orally stipulates to arbitration,the defendant is estopped from arguing that a written stipulation to arbitrate was required.law offices of ian herzog law offices of joseph fredrics th,d.
in gee american realty construction,supra,th,d,the defendants asked the trial court to permit them to file abstracts of judgment.thereafter,they challenged that procedure.the court of appeal held the defendants were estopped to challenge the result they generated.in conservatorship of kevin,supra,th,d,the appellate court held there was an estoppel that resulted in permitting one party to have a jury trial,even though the request did not meet the time limitations of welfare and institutions code section.conservatorship of kevin,supra,at,d.
here,ghaderi never argued that the trial court could not proceed.she never argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction.she never argued that the trial did not have the right to decide her case.she never used a procedure and then argued against the use of that procedure.rather,at every step of the process,ghaderi stated,and restated her was no enforceable settlement.when ghaderi disclosed facts,she did so to explain the events and to explain why she believed there was no enforceable oral contract.
thus,ghaderi is not estopped from arguing the evidence of an oral agreement emanating from the mediation is inadmissible.
conclusion 
the majority does not want to accept the result of the legislative mandate that communications made for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation are not admissible in a civil proceeding unless specifically made admissible.since the facts here do not fit into any of the exceptions,the majority inartfully has crafted a result that may feel is just wrong.
i would reverse the judgment because plaintiffs should have been prohibited from introducing at trial on their breach of contract cause of action the existence and terms of any oral agreement.the mediation confidentiality statutes made inadmissible all evidence of an oral contract between ghaderi and plaintiffs.the trial court had no substantial evidence of an oral contract,and thus no evidence upon which it could render a judgment for plaintiffs on their cause of action for breach of an oral contract.the matter should be reversed and remanded to the trial court where plaintiffs would have a trial on the merits of their medical malpractice cause of action,since that cause of action has not been dismissed.
the complaint was filed by michelle simmons,as the personal representative of the estate of kintausha clemmons.thereafter,michael dujuan nelson iii,through his guardian ad litem,michelle simmons,was added in as a plaintiff.michelle simmons and michael dujuan nelson iii were decedent mother and minor son.at some point,tommie simmons was also added as a plaintiff.for simplicity,we refer to these parties as plaintiffs.
clemmons had been under the care of a nephrologist who was treating her with dialysis for renal failure.the complaint alleged that,without consulting with clemmons nephrologist,ghaderi took clemmons off dialysis,resulting in her death from severe renal failure.
cumis counsel is the term sometimes used to refer to the independent counsel provided to an insured by an insurer contesting coverage but still providing a defense.the authority for such counsel is san diego federal credit union cumis ins.society,d.and civil code,section.see also,croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group,et.
according to plaintiffs counsel declaration,at some time after the july,hearing,attorney brandmeyer had told plaintiffs counsel that he was uncertain as to what was occurring but to move fast and get the minor compromise approved.
ghaderi motion was also supported by the declaration of attorney melanie shornice,an associate of attorney reback.her declaration purported to set forth the events that took place at the july,mediation.as attorney shornice had not been present at the mediation,objections to her declaration were sustained.
interestingly,this was not the court initial decision.at first,the trial court concluded that a settlement was not reached,because the settlement process as followed by judge altman was to write up the settlement agreement,and to provide a signature line for signature by plaintiffs,by the counsel,by defense counsel and defendant so i think the authorization was revoked in the middle of the settlement discussions.i know an argument could be made to the contrary,and a strong argument too,but that is the side i come down on.
our colleague dissent argues that the rule of fiege has no application because ghaderi had a right under her professional liability policy to withhold her consent to any settlement negotiated by her insurer citing robertson chen,supra,th at,d.this argument ignores the undisputed fact that ghaderi had given her written consent to the settlement that
