in october,the department of the army issued a solicitation for bids on a contract to provide services for a military cafeteria at fort campbell,kentucky.the solicitation indicated that the contract was subject to the act,et.rsa.under the rsa,state licensing authorities representing the interests of licensed blind vendors are allowed to submit bids on federal contracts on behalf of those vendors,and those bids are given special consideration.id.b.regulations promulgated under the rsa require federal agencies to discuss the licensing authority bid with the secretary of education whenever the bid is judged to be within a competitive range and has been ranked among those proposals which have a reasonable chance of being selected for final award.b.the department of defense has gone even further,mandating that if the state licensing agency submits a proposal and it is within the competitive range established by the contracting officer,the contract will be awarded to the state licensing agency.dep t of defense directive.in order to facilitate compliance with the department of defense directive,the contracting officer in this case incorporated two competitive criteria in the cafeteria services solicitation.according to the solicitation,the first and more important criterion was the amount of the bid,which would be classified as either satisfactory or unsatisfactory.the second criterion was the bidder past performance on other contracts,upon which each bidder would receive a rating ranging from exceptional to unsatisfactory.
the kentucky department for the blind kdb,a state licensing agency under the rsa,submitted a bid on the contract.the army classified kdb past performance as very good,the same rating that most of the other bidders received.the army also classified the cost of kdb bid as satisfactory.however,three other companies bids contained a lower price than kdb bid.the contracting officer subsequently determined that only the three lowest prices fell within the competitive range.because kdb bid was not one of the three lowest,it was deemed to be outside the competitive range.kdb bid therefore did not receive preferential treatment,and kdb was not awarded the contract.
after the contract was awarded,kdb requested a debriefing on the bidding process.from the debriefing,kdb learned that it was placed outside the competitive range even though,like the winning bidder,it received a rating of satisfactory on price and a rating of very good on past performance.kdb then filed a bid protest action in the court of federal claims,contending that its bid should have been included within the competitive range.kdb argued that it should have been placed in that range because its past performance should have been rated exceptional,rather than very good,and because the contracting officer should not have limited the competitive range with respect to price to the three lowest bids.
on the government motion,the trial court dismissed kdb complaint for lack of jurisdiction.kentucky united states.because kdb complaint had a reasonable nexus to the rsa,the court held that kdb was required to exhaust its administrative remedies under the act by asking the secretary of education to convene an arbitration panel to resolve the dispute.kdb appeals that dismissal,arguing that its complaint did not raise a claim under the rsa and thus arbitration is inappropriate and unavailable.in addition,kdb argues that even if its claims fall within the scope of the rsa,arbitration is not mandatory under the rsa,but is an optional procedure that state licensing agencies can invoke as an alternative to other judicial and administrative remedies.
the rsa contains two provisions for arbitration of disputes arising under the act.section a provides that any vendor who is dissatisfied with any action arising from the operation or administration of the vending facility program may file a complaint with the secretary who shall convene a panel to arbitrate the dispute after first complaining to the state licensing agency.a.section b provides that when a state licensing agency determines that a federal agency is failing to comply with the provisions of this chapter or any regulations issued thereunder such licensing agency may file a complaint with the secretary who shall convene a panel to arbitrate the dispute.id.b.the trial court held that the statutory language encompasses all federal agency actions that have a reasonable nexus to the act,which beyond a doubt would include a challenge to any agency decision to reject a proposal in response to a solicitation involving the operation of a vending facility.the court further noted that i t is doubtful whether procurement award issues exist that are truly independent of the act.we do not agree that the scope of the arbitration provision of the rsa is so broad.
section b clearly limits the types of grievances that are subject to the rsa arbitration scheme.only when the state licensing agency determines that the federal agency is failing to comply with the provisions of this chapter or any regulations issued thereunder is arbitration allowable.see b see also a section b provides,as one example of the type of claim that is arbitrable,a limitation on the placement or operation of a vending facility as described in this title.section further emphasizes that the arbitration panel may act only if it finds that the acts or practices of any federal agency are in violation of this chapter,or any regulation issued thereunder.b see also d if the panel finds that the acts or practices of any department are in violation of the act or of this part,the head of any such department shall cause such acts or practices to be terminated promptly.accordingly,not every complaint that a state licensing agency may have against a federal agency is arbitrable,but only those complaints that allege a violation of the rsa or its attendant regulations.
the legislative history of the rsa bears out that interpretation of the statute.although the rsa was originally enacted in,see act of june,ch,stat,the arbitration provisions were not incorporated into the rsa until,see act amendments of,title ii,stat.congress added the arbitration provisions because it determined that state agencies are still without recourse from decisions of federal agencies regarding blind vendor facilities on property they control,at.in other words,prior to the amendment blind vendors and state licensing agencies had no neutral forum in which to press claims of violations of the rsa that did not involve violations of contract rights or federal procurement provisions.see wilson watson,aff,cir.the arbitration provisions closed that gap,providing a means by which aggrieved vendors and state agencies may obtain a final and satisfactory resolution of disputes under the rsa,at.
arbitration,however,was not meant to cover every complaint by a state licensing agency concerning the procurement of vending services.congress enacted the arbitration provisions to fill a gap in the existing statutory scheme,under which vendors and state licensing agencies could bring claims based on a breach of contract or a violation of other federal procurement provisions,but could not bring a claim arising under the rsa.see wilson.at.congress specifically sought to fill that gap in a targeted fashion,covering only claims alleging a failure to comply with the rsa.there is no reason to believe that congress meant to funnel every complaint by a state licensing authority against a federal agency into arbitration,thus duplicating remedies that the failed bidders already had against the government.the senate report on the arbitration provisions noted that i t is not anticipated that these arbitration mechanisms will be used with great frequency,at.congress had that expectation because it intended that the arbitration provisions would be triggered only if the state licensing agency alleged a violation of the rsa,and not in the case of other,more common allegations such as a breach of contract or a violation of government procurement provisions.
apart from the purpose and history of the arbitration provision,it would be odd to interpret th
