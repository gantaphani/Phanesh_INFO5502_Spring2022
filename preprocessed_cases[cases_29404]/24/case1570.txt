david kalai appeals from a judgment entered against him on his claim for damages against timothy lee gray.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of gray on the ground that the parties had agreed to submit their dispute to arbitration,and kalai failed to exhaust that arbitration remedy.kalai does not challenge the court basic premise that the parties had an enforceable arbitration agreement,but instead focuses on two more specific issues.first,kalai asserts the court erred by including in the judgment an express determination that kalai waived his right to arbitrate by filing a lawsuit in court,thus preventing kalai from litigating the merits of his claim in any forum.second,kalai contends the court erred in awarding attorney fees to gray,despite the fact the parties agreement provided for such an award only in favor of the prevailing party to the arbitration.
we agree with kalai on both counts.a party who enters into a agreement to arbitrate does not waive his right to resort to that forum merely because he first attempts to air his grievance in court.at most,such an effort might lead to a waiver of that party right to thereafter enforce the arbitration agreement against an unwilling opposing party.moreover,an agreement for the payment of attorney fees must be interpreted in accordance with its terms,without regard to whether it might appear fair in a given circumstance.the agreement in this case provides for an award of fees only to the party who prevails in the arbitration.if gray is that party,then he will be entitled to request his fees at that time.the judgment is reversed and remanded with directions.
kalai,a homeowner,and gray,a contractor,entered into an agreement for the construction of improvements on kalai home.their agreement included an arbitration clause,providing in pertinent part as follows in entering into this agreement,it is the intent of owner and contractor to avoid litigation in the state or federal courts should a dispute arise.therefore,it is agreed that the exclusive remedy for any dispute between owner and contractor to terms of this agreement or arising out of this agreement,including but not limited to claims such as breach of contract,shall be to submit to binding arbitration before a neutral third party pursuant to the rules of the american arbitration association.the administrative costs of the arbitration proceedings shall initially be borne by the party requesting the arbitration.the prevailing party to such arbitration proceedings,should there be a prevailing party,shall be entitled to recover from the other all reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred by said prevailing party in connection with the arbitration proceedings.
needless to say in this context,a dispute did arise.however,instead of initiating an arbitration,kalai filed a complaint against gray in superior court,alleging negligence,breach of contract and related claims.and gray,rather than filing a petition to compel arbitration pursuant to title of the code of civil procedure et,hereafter title,filed a motion for summary judgment based upon the arbitration agreement.
gray motion was based upon charles rounds joint council of teamsters cal d,in which the supreme court held that a party faced with a lawsuit filed in contravention of an arbitration agreement may move for summary judgment as an option to filing a petition to compel arbitration pursuant to title.the court explained that the theory underlying such a motion was similar to that of a motion seeking dismissal for failure to exhaust an administrative remedy.
kalai opposed the summary judgment motion,arguing,among other things,that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable because it did not comply with the statutory requirements for an arbitration provision contained in a contract for residential construction of the type at issue.gray countered that contention by arguing,without evidentiary support,that kalai himself had drafted the agreement.
the court granted the summary judgment.its order stated the reasons for granting the motion were that the parties had entered into an arbitration agreement,and that kalai had elected to file a lawsuit rather than to file for arbitration,thereby failing to exhaust his administrative remedy.however,the actual judgment contained an additional finding plaintiff having waived his right to arbitrate against defendant gray and having thereby failed to exhaust his administrative remedy,judgment is entered in favor of defendant timothy lee gray and against plaintiff david kalai.
kalai thereafter sought to initiate an arbitration of the dispute with the american arbitration association,but gray filed an objection to the arbitration on the basis that kalai claim had already been summarily adjudicated against him in the superior court.
gray then sought an award of attorney fees in the superior court,based upon the parties agreement and his status as prevailing party in the litigation.kalai opposed the motion,pointing out that the parties agreement allowed such an award only for the prevailing party to the arbitration,which had not taken place.kalai cited the court to various cases demonstrating that such an attorney fee provision must be enforced only in accordance with its terms.the court agreed with kalai characterization of the fee provision as very limited,but proceeded to apply what appeared to be an equitable analysis you absolutely right counsel.however,i think the court also needs to look at the conduct of the parties and in so doing i grant the motion for attorneys fees.the court awarded gray fees in the amount of.
kalai first argues that the judgment must be reversed because it provides that he has waived his right to arbitrate against defendant gray.he points out that the contention was never advanced factually in gray summary judgment motion,and was not supported by any evidence.gray responds that kalai waiver of his right to pursue arbitration was established as a matter of law,merely because he filed this aborted action in court.we are somewhat uncertain what the trial court intended by the waiver language,but we are clear that it must be stricken.
the argument that a plaintiff might irrevocably waive his right to arbitration by filing an action in court is based upon a statement in charles rounds,supra,in which the court held that a litigant sued in court on a claim governed by arbitration had more than one option to address the problem.w here the only issue litigated is covered by the arbitration clause,and where plaintiff has not first pursued or attempted to pursue his arbitration remedy,it should be held that plaintiff has impliedly waived his right to arbitrate,such that defendant could elect to submit the matter to the jurisdiction of the court defendant may also elect to demur or move for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiff has failed to exhaust arbitration remedies and defendant may also elect to move for a stay of proceedings pending arbitration if defendant also moves to compel arbitration.plaintiff may of course sue preliminarily to enforce its arbitration rights.charles rounds joint council of teamsters,supra,cal d at,italics added.
however,the italicized language relied upon by gray does not mean what he would like it to.the supreme court is merely stating that one option given to defendant when a plaintiff bypasses an arbitration agreement is to treat the act as a waiver and essentially adopt that waiver by itself electing to submit the matter to the jurisdiction of the court.and by the matter the court means the merits of the dispute.the distinct options,for the defendant who does not choose to voluntarily submit the matter to the jurisdiction of the court,is to demur or move for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiff has failed to exhaust arbitration remedies,or to seek a stay and compel arbitration.in fact,the court expressly denied it was concluding that the plaintiff in that case was precluded from a subsequent arbitration,the very conclusion gray so fervently espouses here what remedies plaintiff may have to now compel arbitration must await assertion of that right.charles rounds joint c
