introduction 
this appeal involves interpretation of an arbitration provision contained in an employment contract between appellant municipal resource consultants mrc and respondent nicholas.after mrc fired,filed a lawsuit.mrc moved to compel arbitration.the trial court refused to enforce the arbitration provision,finding it did not meet the criteria established by case law.mrc appeals.we find the arbitration provision is both substantively and procedurally unconscionable and therefore affirm the trial court decision 
factual and procedural background 
mrc provides financial consulting services to municipalities.in february,mrc hired pursuant to a written contract.responsibilities included designing and providing revenue enhancement audits for mrc municipal clients.the purpose of these audits is to increase the amount of tax revenues the municipalities receive.
two provisions of the employment contract govern our analysis on this appeal.
section,entitled mrc remedies for breach,provides 
you acknowledge and agree a because your employment duties will provide you access to possession of trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary information,and b because of your intimate knowledge of mrc and your particular experience,that your services to mrc are of a special,unique,unusual and extraordinary nature and,therefore,any activities or employment on your part which would constitute a breach of any of sections,or above,will cause irreparable harm to mrc and money damages would be inadequate to compensate mrc completely for its loss resulting from such breach.you therefore agree that mrc,in addition to all other rights,shall have the right to file a lawsuit,in any court of competent jurisdiction,to enjoin you from engaging in such activities and to seek any other equitable relief that may be appropriate.italics added.
section,entitled,arbitration,provides 
any claim that you may have arising out of or relating to this agreement,or the breach thereof,or your employment by mrc,or the termination of your employment by mrc,shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association then in effect,and judgment upon the award entered by the arbitrator s may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.there shall be no discovery.neither mrc right to file a lawsuit seeking an injunction nor mrc right to injunctive relief is subject to arbitration or to the provisions of this section.italics added.
in april,mrc fired who was then more than years old.
in may,filed suit against mrc and related corporate and individual defendants.the complaint includes,inter alia,causes of action for wrongful discharge and age discrimination under the fair employment and housing act feha,et served the complaint in april and may of.
in may,mrc served with special interrogatories,form interrogatories,and a request to produce documents.and his attorney spent approximately hours preparing responses.
in june,mrc wrote requesting him to agree to submit his claims to arbitration.did not respond.
in july,mrc filed a motion to compel arbitration and sent a letter suspending discovery.filed opposition to which mrc replied.
following a hearing,the trial court denied mrc motion.its minute order recites defendants motion to compel arbitration and for stay of proceedings is denied.the employment agreement states that the arbitration process will be governed by the aaa rules.notwithstanding the aaa rules,the employment agreement does not satisfy the armendariz requirement in that it lacks mutuality.
this appeal by mrc follows.
discussion 
governing legal principles 
code of civil procedure section,subdivision b provides a trial court can deny a petition to compel arbitration if it determines g rounds exist for the revocation of the agreement.in a similar vein,code of civil procedure section provides a written arbitration agreement is valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.
civil code section,subdivision a provides if the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract,or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause,or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.
in this case,urged,and the trial court agreed,the arbitration agreement should not be enforced because it was procedurally and substantively unconscionable under the standard set forth by the california supreme court in armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,armendariz 
armendariz held u nconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element,the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,the latter on overly harsh or results.citation.armendariz,supra,cal th,d.stated another way,s ubstantive unconscionability focuses on the actual terms of the agreement,while procedural unconscionability focuses on the manner in which the contract was negotiated and the circumstances of the parties.american software,ali th,d.both procedural and substantive unconscionability must be present before a court can refuse to enforce an arbitration provision based on unconscionability.however,the two elements need not be present in the same degree.essentially a sliding scale is invoked which disregards the regularity of the procedural process of the contract formation,that creates the terms,in proportion to the greater harshness or unreasonableness of the substantive terms themselves.citations.in other words,the more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
as no extrinsic evidence was presented to the trial court,we review its determination de novo to determine whether the arbitration agreement is legally enforceable.stirlen supercuts,th,d stirlen.we first address the question of substantive unconscionability and then turn to the issue of procedural unconscionability.
substantive unconscionability 
claims the arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable in three separate ways.we examine each one separately.
lack of mutuality 
armendariz held there must be a modicum of bilaterality in an arbitration agreement.given the disadvantages that may exist for plaintiffs arbitrating disputes,it is unfairly for an employer with superior bargaining power to impose arbitration on the employee as plaintiff but not to accept such limitations when it seeks to prosecute a claim against the employee,without at least some reasonable justification for such based on business realities.as has been recognized,unconscionability turns not only on a result,but also on an absence of justification for it.citation.if the arbitration system established by the employer is indeed fair,then the employer as well as the employee should be willing to submit claims to arbitration.without reasonable justification for this lack of mutuality,arbitration appears less as a forum for neutral dispute resolution and more as a means of maximizing employer advantage.arbitration was not intended for this purpose.citation.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
contends the arbitration provision lacks the required modicum of mutuality because it requires him to arbitrate all of his claims,expressly permits mrc to file a lawsuit seeking injunctive and equitable relief against him,and is silent about requiring mrc to arbitrate any other claim it may have against him.the contention is.
in armendariz,the arbitration clause required the employee to arbitrate all wrongful termination claims.although,the agreement did not expressly grant the employer the right to litigate in court its claims against the employee,the court found that was the clear implication of the agreement.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.it reasoned obviously,the lack of mutuality can be manifested as much by what the agreement does not provide as by what it does.ibid.the court explained that an arbitration agreement imposed in an adhesive context lacks basic fairness and mutuality if it requires one contracting party,but not the other,to arbitrate all claims arising out of the same transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences.ibid.in language equally applicable to this case,the court concluded the arbitration provision lacked mutuality because it requires the arbitration of not arising out of a wrongful termination.an employee terminated for stealing trade secrets,for example,must arbitrate his or her wrongful termination claim under the agreement while the employer has no corresponding obligation to arbitrate its trade secrets claim against the employee.ibid.that is the situation in this case.is required to arbitrate any work related claim,including a discharge based upon the claim he breached the explicit obligations set forth in sections,and about nondisclosure of trade secrets and confidential information see fn,ante.there is,however,no requirement that mrc arbitrate any claim breached those obligations.in fact,the arbitration provision explicitly reserves mrc right to file a lawsuit seeking injunctive and equitable relief based upon alleged breaches of the confidentiality provisions.
mrc arguments to support a contrary conclusion are not.
first,mrc argues its obligation to arbitrate should be implied because it is not expressly excluded.in particular,mrc argues that because the agreement only explicitly excepted from arbitration its right to seek injunctive and equitable relief,that means mrc agreed to arbitrate all other claims against.for instance,in its reply brief mrc boldly states t he parties employment brief requires both and mrc to arbitrate all claims arising out of the agreement,except for claims for injunctive relief made by mrc against for violating his agreement not to disclose or misappropriate mrc valuable trade secrets.mrc argues,for example,it would be compelled to arbitrate an action for money damages against predicated upon the claim he breached the confidentiality provisions of the contract.this argument is unpersuasive for several reasons.
for one thing,mrc fails to acknowledge all of the language in the employment contract.section,entitled mrc remedies for breach,provides that agrees that mrc,in addition to all other rights,shall have the right to file a lawsuit for injunctive and equitable relief.italics added.the language we have italicized undermines mrc argument that we should imply that mrc agreed to arbitrate any claim against other than that for injunctive and equitable relief.instead,it establishes mrc was also preserving its right to file any lawsuit against.section merely emphasized to that mrc would file an action for injunctive and equitable relief were he to breach any of his obligations because that was the harm mrc most wanted to deter.the specification of that remedy by mrc does not mean mrc otherwise waived any other rights to seek judicial relief and agreed to assert any other claims in arbitration.the inclusion of the phrase in addition to all other rights can only mean mrc was similarly preserving the right to file any lawsuit it felt in its interest.otherwise,the phrase in addition to all other rights has no import.as mrc itself points out,t he whole of a contract is to be taken together,so as to give effect to every part,if reasonably practicable,each clause helping to interpret the other.mrc tepid argument that in addition to all other rights refers to mrc right to seek arbitration of any other claim is patently meritless given that nothing in the agreement granted mrc that right.
furthermore,the next paragraph in the agreement is section,the arbitration provision.it explicitly states claims are to be arbitrated and concludes with a statement that mrc rights to injunctive relief,set forth in the immediately preceding section,are not subject to any requirement of arbitration.the arbitration provision repeated use of the word you to refer to is further indication that only his claims but not those of mrc are subject to arbitration.and the immediate juxtaposition of section reserving mrc right to file an action for injunctive and equitable relief with section compelling to arbitrate all of his claims clearly conveys mrc has no obligation to arbitrate any claim it may have against.obviously,the lack of mutuality can be manifested as much by what the agreement does not provide as by what it does.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
at oral argument,mrc placed great reliance upon the last sentence in section to construct an argument that it implicitly agreed to arbitrate most of its claims against.that sentence reads neither mrc right to file a lawsuit seeking an injunction nor mrc right to injunctive relief is subject to arbitration or to the provisions of section.mrc argues because this sentence only excepts from arbitration mrc right to file a lawsuit for injunctive relief,it means mrc implicitly agreed it could not file a lawsuit for any other claim,money damages and any other such claim would be subject to arbitration.we are not persuaded.as already explained,the sentence in section that mrc,in addition to all other rights can file a lawsuit for equitable relief clearly reserved to mrc the right to file any lawsuit on any theory for any form of relief.understood in context,the sentence upon which mrc now relies is nothing more than a reiteration that the right specifically granted in section to file a lawsuit for equitable relief was not subject to arbitration.mrc no doubt sought to make that point because,as explained below,the primary remedy it wished to preserve and enforce against was a lawsuit for injunctive relief to prevent disclosure,dissemination,and sharing of confidential information and trade secrets.
in a similar vein,we reject mrc argument that it implicitly agreed to arbitrate a claim for money damages.section,drafted by mrc,essentially states that in the event of a breach by of any of the contract confidentiality provisions,the remedy at law a claim for money damages is inadequate.in fact,as explained below,that is the business reality mrc asserts to justify its explicit exception to arbitration.consequently,even were we to accept mrc interpretation of the contract,if mrc initiated an action against,the likelihood that it would be required to arbitrate is slim,if not nil.see mercuro superior court th,d mercuro stirlen,supra,th,d.
in light of this analysis,mrc errs in relying upon civil code section to urge a requirement that it arbitrate be implied into the agreement.the statute reads stipulations which are necessary to make a contract reasonable,or conformable to usage,are implied,in respect to matters concerning which the contract manifests no contrary intention.here the contract does manifest a contrary intent mrc is not required to arbitrate any of its claims against 
mrc next argues t he arbitration provision bilaterality is not vitiated by the limited exception for injunctive relief because there is a legitimate business interest for this exception.we disagree.as explained above,the agreement does not just except from arbitration mrc right to obtain injunctive relief against it exempts mrc from arbitrating any claim against.in any event,the requisite business justification for exempting a request for injunctive relief is lacking.our supreme court explained i f an employer does have reasonable justification for the,a justification grounded in something other than the employer desire to maximize its advantage based on the perceived superiority of the judicial an agreement would not be unconscionable.without such justification,we must assume that it is.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
mrc argues that given the highly confidential and proprietary nature of the auditing and consulting work that mrc does,and the access to that information inherent in position,it could not adequately and efficiently protect these assets without access to and injunctive provisional and permanent.two decisions from the courts of appeal have rejected an essentially identical argument on the basis a party subject to arbitration already has the right to obtain that relief.mercuro,supra,th,d,and stirlen,supra,th,d.
in regard to obtaining relief pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding,code of civil procedure section,subdivision b provides a party to an arbitration agreement may file in court an application for a provisional remedy in connection with an arbitrable controversy,but only upon the ground that the award to which the applicant may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual without provisional relief.the statute was enacted primarily to allow a party to an arbitration to obtain provisional judicial remedies without waiving the right to arbitrate.citations.woolley embassy suites,d.as both courts of appeal noted provisional relief as used in the statute includes preliminary injunctions and temporary restraining orders.mercuro,supra,th at,d,citing stirlen,supra,th at,d.accordingly,t he unilateral right to litigate rather than arbitrate claims can not be justified by the need for provisional remedies.stirlen,supra,th at,d.
in regard to obtaining injunctive relief following the conclusion of arbitration,it is arbitrators commonly provide equitable relief as part of their decision.mercuro,supra,th at,d,including cases cited in fn.in particular,an arbitrator may award permanent injunctive relief,a point mrc concedes.see swan magnetics,superior court th,d.we reject mrc vapid argument that w hile an arbitrator can issue injunctive relief,only a court can ultimately enforce it so that it is far more efficient for mrc to bring this particular type of claim in court in the first instance.regardless of the particular relief granted,any arbitrator award is enforceable only when confirmed as a judgment of the superior court.see jones kvistad d.code civ.carried to its logical conclusion,mrc argument would mean any party could carve out for itself an exception to an arbitration provision by simply urging that for it judicial relief is more expeditious.we decline to follow that path.
in sum,mrc argument it needed to except its rights to file an action for injunctive relief fails because that remedy is available both prior to and at the conclusion of arbitration.
mrc argument also fails on another basis it is too broad.section of the contract not only granted mrc the right to file a lawsuit to seek injunctive relief it also provided mrc could seek any other equitable relief that may be appropriate.in language equally applicable to this case,the mercuro court concluded furthermore,even assuming business realities would justify exempting claims for injunctive relief to protect intellectual property rights,the exemption sweeps too broadly because it covers not only claims for injunctive relief but claims for any equitable relief involving intellectual property issues.mercuro,supra,th,d.
lastly,relying upon little,supra,cal th,d,mrc argues to the extent that this court finds the for injunctive relief to be unconscionable,little dictates that we should sever that provision alone and enforce the rest of the agreement,which was clearly drafted in good faith.this argument misconstrues little.there,the supreme court found one discrete portion of the arbitration arbitral appeal be unconscionable.the court concluded that because only this single provision was unconscionable,it could be severed and the rest of the arbitration agreement left intact.to support its conclusion that severance of the singular unconscionable provision was the appropriate remedy as opposed to a refusal to enforce the entire arbitration agreement,the court found it significant there was no indication the appellate provision had been included in bad faith.
this case presents a completely different scenario.as explained above,mrc did not simply carve out a provision entitling it to file a lawsuit for injunctive relief.mrc drafted a completely agreement compelling to arbitrate all of its claims while allowing mrc to file a lawsuit on any claim it had against him.because unconscionability permeates the entire agreement,severance is not appropriate.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.t here is no single provision we can strike or restrict in order to remove the unconscionable taint from the agreement.rather,we would have to,in effect,reform the contract,not through severance or restriction,but by augmenting it with additional terms.id.at,d.we have no explicit or implicit authority to do so.ibid.
costs provision 
contends the costs provision applicable to the arbitration proceeding is inconsistent with armendariz requirements.we agree.
in armendariz,the arbitration agreement provided the parties would share the costs of arbitration.armendariz,supra,cal th,d.there,as here,the employees were seeking to vindicate,in part,rights accorded by the feha.armendariz held that when an employer imposes mandatory arbitration as a condition of employment,the arbitration agreement or arbitration process can not generally require the employee to bear any type of expense that the employee would not be required to bear if he or she were free to bring the action in court.this rule will ensure that employees bringing feha claims will not be deterred by costs greater than the usual costs incurred during litigation,costs that are essentially imposed on an employee by the employer.id.at,d.
the employment contract is silent on the issue of the allocation of costs.however,section of the contract explicitly incorporates the rules of the american arbitration association aaa.mrc concedes the applicable rule requires the parties to equally bear the expenses of arbitration unless they agree otherwise or the arbitrator directs otherwise and to equally bear the arbitrator compensation unless they agree otherwise,or unless the law provides otherwise.the rule clearly contravenes armendariz.
in the trial court,mrc essentially conceded this point.its reply memorandum in support of its motion to compel arbitration expressly acknowledge d it was prepared to pay such costs.on this appeal,mrc reaffirms that position and therefore argues the question of allocation of costs is a.this approach misses the mark.in armendariz,the court found an expression of willingness by the employer to amend the arbitration provision to bring it into conformity with law to be wanting.it reasoned w hether an employer is willing,now that the employment relationship has ended to change a provision of an arbitration agreement so it conforms to law does not change the fact that the arbitration agreement as written is unconscionable and contrary to public policy.such a willingness can be seen,at most,as an offer to modify the contract an offer that was never accepted.no existing rule of contract law permits a party to resuscitate a legally defective contract merely by offering to change it.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,quoting stirlen,supra,th,d.it therefore follows that mrc willingness to bear all costs in the arbitration proceeding does not change the fact the arbitration provision is substantively unconscionable.
denial of discovery 
next contends the arbitration provision is substantively unconscionable because it denies him any right to discovery.for reasons to be explained,we need not reach the ultimate merits of this claim.
as set forth above,section,the arbitration provision,includes the explicit statement there shall be no discovery.armendariz,supra,cal th,d,held that when,as here,there is a claim of employment discrimination based upon violation of the feha,adequate discovery is indispensable to the vindication of the statutory claim.id.at,d.the court explained employees are at least entitled to discovery sufficient to adequately arbitrate their statutory claim,including access to essential documents and witnesses,as determined by the arbitrator s and subject to limited judicial review.id.at,d,see also kinney united healthcare services,th,d.
mrc concedes the existence of the employment contract prohibition on discovery and armendariz holding.nonetheless,mrc contends the discovery would be allowed in this arbitration proceeding based upon the following.section of the employment contract provides the arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the
