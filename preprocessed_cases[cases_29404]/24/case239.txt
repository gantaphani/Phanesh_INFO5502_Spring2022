astra oil,astra appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york laura taylor swain,district judge denying astra motion to compel rover navigation,rover to arbitrate astra claims for damages relating to the late delivery of a shipment of gasoil.while astra was not a signatory to the tanker voyage charter party contract the charter party that contains the arbitration clause astra now seeks to enforce,astra maintains that,under our precedent,it may compel rover to arbitrate because astra is an affiliate of signatory aot trading ag aot,the charterer,and astra claims are inextricably intertwined with the charter party,to which rover is a party.
although the district court applied the correct legal standard in assessing whether a signatory to a contract containing an arbitration clause can be estopped by a to that contract from refusing to participate in arbitration,the court erred in concluding that astra claims here are not closely intertwined with the contract containing the arbitration provision.in fact,astra claims are that rover breached its warranties of speed and seaworthiness under the charter party.in light of the close connection between astra claims and the charter party,the close corporate and operational relationship between astra and aot,and the actions of the parties during the events giving rise to this dispute,we hold that the petition to compel arbitration should have been granted,and rover is estopped from avoiding arbitration under the terms of the arbitration clause contained in the charter party to which it is a signatory.
background 
the dispute between the parties arises from the delay in shipment of gasoil on rover vessel the emerald.under the charter party entered into on november,between rover and aot,rover agreed to transport gasoil for aot from taiwan to a designated port in the united states.the charter party contains an arbitration clause requiring arbitration of a ny and all differences and disputes of whatsoever nature arising out of this charter in the city of new york pursuant to the laws relating to arbitration there in force astra and aot are affiliated companies engaged in the business of international arbitrage merchant oil trading both are owned by astra oil trading of the netherlands.on november,astra entered into a sales contract with sprague energy corporation sprague in which sprague agreed to purchase a certain quantity of gasoil from astra.the sales contract included terms specifying the quantity,price,and location of delivery,and contained a clause providing that the gasoil would be delivered between december,and january,for a price of cents per gallon over the standard nymex heating oil contract,or between january and,for a price of only cents per gallon over the standard nymex contract.
although the emerald loaded in taiwan without incident on november,during the course of its voyage,it encountered some problems with a main engine turbocharger.appellee br.at.astra maintains that the emerald then limped to somewhere off hawaii where the vessel drifted offshore to perform engine repairs.from december to,the vessel remained drifting off hawaii.appellant br.at.the vessel eventually made its way to boston on january,where it planned to unload a portion of its cargo and then discharge the remaining cargo for delivery to sprague in portland,maine.while in the waters off boston,however,the coast guard issued a detention order after an inspector discovered a crack in the vessel main deck plate over a loaded cargo tank.the emerald remained docked in boston through february,pursuant to this detention order.
after the main deck crack was discovered,rover issued a general average declaration to astra and aot,and exercised a lien on the cargo on february.astra,in turn,issued to rover a claim notice for commercial cargo late delivery damages and threatened a maritime arrest of the vessel to secure that claim.consistent with maritime practice,the parties attorneys exchanged security for the respective claims rover posted a club letter of understanding lou dated february,and astra posted a lloyd average bond dated february.both the cargo and the vessel were then released.
in negotiating the lou,counsel for astra and aot wrote to rover counsel,stating 
w e request a draft of the proposed lou at your earliest opportunity.the lou should include the appropriate language identifying the claimants,the cargo,the nature of the dispute,the threat of arrest and jurisdiction is the united states district court for the district of maine at portland,the dispute will be heard in new york arbitration,and the lou is in an amount certain plus interest,reasonable attorney fees and costs.
this lou encompassed the claims of both aot,as voyage charterer,and astra,as.the club lou issued february,to aot and astra,states in relevant part 
in consideration of your agreeing not to seize,arrest,attach or otherwise detain the emerald the undersigned association hereby agrees 
to file,or cause to be filed,a claim by or on behalf of the owner of said vessel in any suit which you intend to bring in the united states district court for the district of maine in the event it is determined that another court or tribunal has competent jurisdiction,to file or cause to be filed an appearance on behalf of said vessel in any suit you commence in that jurisdiction in the alternative,to proceed in new york arbitration in accordance with the arbitration clause in the above referenced charterparty.
astra then tendered a claim for the damages it sustained as a result of the late,the loss in the price in the gasoil resulting from the fact that it was not delivered by january,rover refused to pay.subsequently,astra and aot jointly demanded that rover arbitrate this claim each side appointed an arbitrator,pursuant to the terms of the charter party arbitration clause.the two arbitrators,again consistent with the terms of the arbitration clause,elected a third.after initial submissions to the arbitrators but before the first hearing,rover informed the arbitrators that it contested astra standing to arbitrate astra then filed a petition to compel arbitration in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,and the arbitrators suspended further proceedings pending resolution of the standing issue by the district court.
the district court held that astra could not enforce the arbitration clause against rover.astra oil rover navigation,wl.although recognizing that t he second circuit has been willing to estop a signatory from avoiding arbitration with a nonsignatory when the issues the nonsignatory is seeking to resolve in arbitration are intertwined with the agreement that the estopped party has signed,id.at quoting,am.arbitration ass n,cir,the district court rejected astra argument that rover was estopped from avoiding arbitration because it found that the late delivery claim was not intertwined with the charter party,which contains no provision for damages due to late delivery of cargo.id.at.
astra timely appealed.

we have addressed the issue of the enforceability of an arbitration agreement against a signatory by a in two recent decisions.see choctaw generation am.home assurance,cir cogeneration smith cogeneration int l,cir.in both cases,we held that the signatory was estopped from avoiding arbitration because the issues the nonsignatory was seeking to resolve in arbitration were intertwined with the agreement that the estopped party had signed,at accord choctaw generation,at 
in choctaw generation,we allowed enforcement by the on an estoppel theory,based on a finding that the controversy between choctaw and american home was closely related to the underlying dispute between choctaw and the signatory under the agreement containing the arbitration clause.see id.at in short,the controversy presented on this appeal is linked textually to the construction contract containing an arbitration clause,and its merits are bound up with the dispute now being arbitrated between choctaw and bechtel.although choctaw generation did not specify the degree of that would be required to suppor
