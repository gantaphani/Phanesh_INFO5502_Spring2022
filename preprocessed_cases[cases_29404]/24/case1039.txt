this case began in when dominion video satellite,dominion claimed that echostar satellite corporation and echosphere corporation collectively,echostar were in breach of a lease agreement between the parties and sought to have the matter arbitrated as required by the agreement.after holding hearings on the dispute,the arbitration panel found in favor of dominion and granted it in damages.dominion moved the district court to confirm the award,pursuant to the federal arbitration act,and.echostar vigorously opposed both the arbitration panel decision as well as dominion motion to confirm by filing numerous motions and supporting memoranda.in october,the district court confirmed the arbitration award.it also determined that echostar had unreasonably and vexatiously extended the arbitration hearings and court proceedings.as a result,the district court sanctioned counsel for echostar and awarded dominion its costs,expenses,and attorneys fees incurred in responding to echostar frivolous motions.see.echostar appeals the confirmation of the arbitration award its counsel also appeals the fees and costs awarded to dominion.we take jurisdiction of both appeals under and affirm.
background 
both dominion and echostar operate direct broadcast satellite systems dbs that are licensed and regulated by the federal communications commission.dominion network,known as sky angel,offers predominantly christian programming on approximately twenty channels.echostar network,known as the dish network,offers a wide variety of programming on over channels.prior to,dominion could not broadcast its sky angel network to dbs consumers because it did not own any satellites.at the same time,echostar could not meet its consumers needs because,although it owned a satellite,it did not own sufficient fcc broadcastings license rights to serve its market.
in,dominion and echostar executed a mutually beneficial contract entitled direct broadcast service transponder lease,channel use and programming agreement agreement.under the terms of the agreement,echostar leases eight transponders from its broadcasting satellite to dominion and in return dominion subleases six of these frequencies back to echostar with accompanying fcc license rights.thus,this agreement gives dominion a platform from which to broadcast the sky angel network and provides echostar increased capacity to serve its market.
as a result of this arrangement,dbs consumers who wish to subscribe either to echostar dish network or to dominion sky angel network must purchase the same equipment.therefore,to prevent the parties from competing for the other customers,the agreement includes a programming exclusivity provision that prohibits echostar from carrying christian programs.
in december,echostar began broadcasting several predominantly christian channels on the dish network.after attempting to persuade echostar that the programming exclusivity provision prohibited such action,dominion sued to enjoin echostar from broadcasting these programs.after three days of hearings,during which the district court was thoroughly briefed on the merits of the underlying dispute,the district court granted dominion a preliminary injunction in so doing,the district court noted that echostar arguments on the merits of the underlying contractual claims regarding federal preemption,legal impossibility,res judicata,and purported violations of the first disingenuous,exceedingly fanciful,and based on a gross contortion of governing law.the district court then ordered the parties to arbitrate their dispute in accordance with a binding arbitration provision in the agreement.
thereafter,dominion filed a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association and sought monetary and injunctive relief.the dispute was heard by an arbitration panel composed of three members who were selected in accordance with the agreement one panel member was selected by each of the parties,and these two panelists selected a third neutral member.the panel opted to bifurcate the would first resolve the issue of contractual interpretation and then,if necessary,it would address the question of damages.in the first proceeding,in march,echostar raised the same arguments the district court had called disingenuous,exceedingly fanciful,and based on a gross contortion of governing law.the panel unanimously decided that echostar broadcast of certain christian channels violated the programming exclusivity provision of the agreement.it issued a final award to that effect which the panel called a partial final award because it had yet to resolve the damages issue.the panel then scheduled a remedies hearing.
in the partial final award,the panel issued certain directives to the parties to prevent future breaches of the agreement.echostar,however,refused to comply with those directives.as a result,dominion moved the district court to confirm the partial final award.notwithstanding the rule that a district court may vacate an arbitration award only in the narrowest of as fraud,corruption,and manifest disregard of controlling opposed dominion motion and moved to vacate the partial final award.in that motion,echostar again argued that federal preemption,legal impossibility,and the first amendment prohibited confirmation of the award.
while the district court was considering dominion motion to confirm the partial final award,the arbitration panel held the remedies hearing.in september it issued a unanimous final award,which included an award of for past economic harm suffered by dominion.dominion moved the district court to confirm the final award,and echostar again filed an opposition brief and a motion to vacate the final award.dominion brief in opposition to echostar motion to vacate included a request that the district court sanction echostar under by awarding dominion its fees and costs incurred defending against echostar motions to vacate.
the district court scheduled a consolidated hearing on october,to hear all the pending motions.at the hearing,echostar defended their decision to again raise the previously rejected arguments,including the federal preemption and first amendment contentions.the district court confirmed both arbitration awards and granted dominion motion for sanctions.it then made an oral ruling that dominion may obtain its fees under within the next days by filing a motion or a statement of agreement.if there is a disagreement as to the amount of fees,i will appoint a special master and assess costs as the special master recommends on the attorneys fees issue.the ruling was incorporated into a written judgment on october.
on october,dominion sent a letter to echostar counsel listing the fees it had incurred in seeking confirmation of the panel award.the letter stated dominion was attempt ing to reach agreement on the amount of fees and costs to be paid by echostar and explained that it would need echostar response by november in order to meet the deadline established by the district court.echostar failed to respond to dominion letter in any way.
on november,dominion filed a motion with the district court seeking in attorneys fees.as it had done at nearly every stage of the proceedings,echostar responded with a motion in opposition and a supporting brief during a hearing on the matter,the district court called this case the most glaring example of the wisdom of having.it ordered three attorneys for todd jansen,wade welch,and ross pay dominion requested fees.it then ordered the attorneys to pay an additional to dominion for attorneys fees incurred in preparing for the hearing that could have been avoided if echostar had responded to dominion october request for attorneys fees.
echostar,through jansen,welch,and wooten,now appeals the district court order confirming the arbitration awards.jansen,welch and wooten also appeal the district court imposition of in attorneys fees and costs under.
ii.arbitration award 
standard of review 
judicial review of arbitration panel decisions is extremely limited indeed,it has been described as among the narrowest known to law.bowen amoco pipeline,cir quotation omitted.under of the federal arbitration act,a court may vacate an arbitration award in certain instances of fraud or corruption,arbitrator misconduct,or where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.id.quoting a.in addition,we have acknowledged a basis for vacating an award when the arbitrators acted in manifest disregard of the law.arw exploration aguirre,cir.this standard requires a finding that the panel decision exhibits willful inattentiveness to the governing law.id.merely erroneous interpretations or applications of law are not reversible.id.put another way,we r equir e more than error or misunderstanding of the law.a finding of manifest disregard means the record will show the arbitrators knew the law and explicitly disregarded it.bowen,at internal citation omitted.finally,we review a district court factual findings in confirming the award for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.denver rio grande ry.union pac.ry,cir.
despite the narrow grounds for judicial review of arbitration panel decisions,echostar advances multiple theories for why this court should overturn the district court decision to confirm the final award.specifically,echostar argues that the award should be set aside because federal law preempts dominion claim for breach of contract the award violates the first amendment prohibition on restrictions and prior restraints claim preclusion bars the award the doctrine of legal impossibility bars the award dominion breach of contract claim is not justiciable and the agreement does not provide for damages for any breach by the parties.if the award is not vacated,echostar argues that it should be remanded to the panel for clarification as to how it reached its figure for damages.
as an initial matter,we note that none of echostar arguments include allegations that fraud,corruption,or arbitrator misconduct marred the panel proceedings.as such,echostar can only succeed if it shows that the panel acted in manifest disregard of the law or otherwise exceeded its powers.as we proceed to the merits of echostar contentions,we are mindful that nearly all of its arguments have been raised and rejected three times first by the district court prior to arbitration when dominion sought a preliminary injunction then again by the arbitration panel itself and finally,by the district court when dominion sought to confirm the arbitration panel award.
federal preemption 
in,congress passed legislation establishing public interest obligations for dbs providers such as echostar and directed the fcc to require every provider to reserve a portion of its channel capacity exclusively for programming of an educational or informational nature.see.current regulations require echostar to reserve four percent of its channel capacity for such use.see f.echostar argues that because christian programs are educational,federal law preempts dominion claim that echostar violated the agreement by broadcasting christian programs.
to the contrary,neither the legislation nor the regulation either explicitly or by implication preempts the enforcement of the programming exclusivity provision in the agreement between dominion and echostar.furthermore,echostar cites no controlling precedent and it fails to identify any evidence in the record that indicates the panel acted in manifest disregard of the law.as such,this is not a legitimate basis to overturn the panel ruling.
first amendment 
echostar next argues that the district court order confirming the arbitration award and enjoining echostar from broadcasting christian programming is both a restriction on speech and an unlawful prior restraint on speech.again,however,echostar argument must be rejected.not only has echostar failed to provide relevant authority to satisfy its burden of demonstrating state action a finding required to trigger application of the first amendment,it has also failed to allege or point to any evidence that the panel willfully ignored relevant first amendment doctrine when it found in dominion favor.we therefore refuse to vacate the panel decision on this basis.
claim preclusion 
in,a different arbitration panel resolved a prior dispute between dominion and echostar regarding the interpretation of another provision in the agreement.in the course of that decision,the prior panel made a single isolated reference to a limited exception to the agreement programming exclusivity provision that is at issue in the case.echostar now argues that claim preclusion prevents confirmation of the arbitration award.
claim preclusion bars the of issues that were decided or issues that could have been raised in the earlier action.frandsen westinghouse,cir.the record shows that even though the prior arbitration panel referenced a provision of the agreement at issue in this case,it did not decide any issues related to that exception,nor was the reference invited by the parties or necessary to the resolution of the prior dispute.thus,claim preclusion does not apply.
impossibility 
under the defense of impossibility of performance,a party breach of its contractual obligation will be excused when changed circumstances have rendered the promise vitally different from what reasonably should have been within the contemplation of both parties when they entered into the contract.performance mariposa,quotation omitted.echostar claims that the fcc regulations,which were promulgated in and require echostar to reserve four percent of its programming capacity for educational or informational purposes,make it impossible for it not to broadcast christian programming.echostar bare allegations,which are not supported by the record,do not establish evidence in support of this contention,however,and we will therefore not vacate the arbitration award on this basis.
justiciability 
in its request for arbitration dominion alleged that,in addition to breaching the programming exclusivity provision,echostar was in breach of a provision that requires echostar to provide to dominion reasonable cooperation in the activation of its customers receivers.the panel ultimately concluded that echostar was not currently violating that clause but nonetheless ordered it to work with dominion to find better ways to activate the receivers in the future.echostar argues that because the panel determined that it was not in breach,the panel could not issue an order requiring it to take any future action.echostar fashions this as an issue of justiciability.
again,this is not a basis to vacate the arbitration award.the concept of justiciability is derived from article iii of the constitution and limits the jurisdiction of federal courts.this court has found no controlling authority that mandates application of those limits in arbitration 
echostar next argues that the panel exceeded its authority by awarding dominion over two million dollars in damages because the agreement states that the parties will not be liable to each other for any direct,indirect,incidental,consequential,special or other damages resulting from loss of actual or anticipated revenues or profits,or loss of business,customers,or goodwill.contrary to echostar assertions,this language appears in a provision relating to the parties right to indemnification from actions it has no bearing on the parties liability to each other for breach of contract.indeed,the arbitration panel was fully briefed on the issue and it concluded that the provision did not preclude the award of damages.echostar fails to provide this court with any evidence that in reaching this conclusion the panel disregarded the law or exceeded its power,and we therefore will not vacate the award on this ground.see sterling.beef united food commercial workers local union,cir stating that this court will not set aside an arbitrator decision unless it can be said with positive assurance that the contract is not susceptible to the arbitrator interpretation 
remand for clarification 
finally,echostar contends that the district court should have remanded the award to the panel to clarify how it reached the figure.once again,the record before the district court provides
