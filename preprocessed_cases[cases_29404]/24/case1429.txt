louis exline,john trahan,and initiatek,appeal from an order denying their motion to compel arbitration under a contractual provision for binding arbitration.appellants contend that the trial court erred in deciding that individual defendants,who were not signatories to a contract containing an arbitration provision but were sued as alter egos of a corporate defendant who was a signatory,may not compel another signatory party to arbitrate the controversies raised in the complaint.we agree with appellants and reverse the order.
facts and procedural history 
respondent philip rowe rowe filed a verified complaint on march,asserting causes of action in his individual capacity and in a derivative capacity in the name of initiatek,initiatek,against appellants louis exline exline,john trahan trahan and initiatek.
rowe complaint and the subject contract 
rowe complaint alleged the following.initiatek was a corporation existing from october,until august.rowe was a founder,chief executive officer,and director of initiatek from october,until july.exline and trahan were founders,shareholders,and directors of initiatek throughout its existence.
in september,rowe and initiatek entered into a confidential settlement agreement and general release agreement,a copy of which rowe attached to the complaint.rowe alleged that he entered into the agreement with exline and trahan,although the agreement itself recites that he entered into it with initiatek.according to the signature lines on the agreement,rowe was signing as an individual,and trahan and exline were signing on behalf of initiatek,as its secretary and ceo,and its president and coo,respectively.
under the agreement,rowe was to transfer his ownership interests in initiatek to the corporation effective july,and to resign as a corporate officer.in return,rowe was to receive in installment payments,with the last installment of due by september.
the agreement contains an arbitration clause,which reads as follows.dispute resolution all disputes under this agreement shall be subject to mandatory arbitration.the costs of the arbitration shall be determined by the arbitrator.the parties shall agree on the selection of an arbitrator.if the parties can not agree on an arbitrator,then the arbitration shall proceed with an arbitrator from the judicial arbitration and mediation services,jams pursuant to the applicable rules of jams.attorney fees may be awarded to the prevailing party in any dispute under this agreement.bolding and underscoring in the original.the agreement also provides that it is to be construed and interpreted in accordance with california law.
in august,exline and trahan signed and filed a certificate of dissolution of initiatek with the california secretary of state.on the date of its dissolution,initiatek accounts receivable were in excess of,and upon its dissolution its assets were distributed to the shareholders,exline and trahan.rowe was not paid the installment due on september,notwithstanding his demand.around the september due date,counsel for exline and trahan informed rowe counsel that initiatek had been reincorporated and there was no money to pay the final installment under the agreement.
the complaint alleges four causes of action.the first cause of action is for breach of contract against initiatek,exline,and trahan,based on an alter ego theory.in paragraph,rowe alleges defendant initiatek corporation was the alter ego of defendant trahan and defendant exline and the obligations of defendant initiatek corporation as set forth above are also the obligations of defendant trahan and defendant exline.among the facts alleged to support the alter ego theory is the following subsequent to january of,defendant initiatek corporation was never intended to have and never has had any true corporate existence.the sole purpose for the organization of defendant initiatek corporation became to act as a device by which exline and trahan could evade their contractual obligations to third parties and to rowe by causing defendant initiatek corporation to enter into contracts through which exline and trahan could carry on their own business without personal liability.based on the alter ego theory,it is alleged that exline and trahan are individually liable for the debt under the agreement,plus interest and costs.
the second cause of action is also against all three named defendants.it alleges that,in violation of corporations code section,subdivision c,initiatek failed to provide proper notice to rowe of the winding up of initiatek.as a result,rowe was precluded from adequately monitoring and protecting the expected payment of by,among other things,notifying the secretary of state that the certificate of dissolution contained a false statement.this second cause of action,like the breach of contract claim,seeks recovery of the owed under the agreement,plus interest and costs.
the third cause of action is a derivative claim brought by rowe,on behalf of the corporation,against trahan and exline as directors.it alleges that initiatek owed rowe under the agreement,rowe claim arose before initiatek dissolution,rowe did not consent to the dissolution,and directors exline and trahan are liable for the improper distribution of initiatek assets under corporations code section,subdivision a.like the breach of contract claim,this cause of action seeks recovery of the owed under the agreement,plus interest and costs.
the fourth cause of action is another derivative claim brought by rowe on behalf of the corporation,against trahan and exline as shareholders,alleging improper distribution of assets in violation of corporations code sections and.this cause of action is also expressly asserted pursuant to the agreement and seeks contractual damages of plus interest and costs.
appellants motion to compel arbitration 
exline,trahan,and initiatek filed a motion to compel arbitration and to stay the court proceedings pending the arbitration.they argued that initiatek could compel arbitration as a signatory to the agreement containing the arbitration provision,and exline and trahan could compel arbitration as initiatek alleged alter egos.rowe countered that only signatory initiatek could enforce the arbitration clause.
after a hearing,the court denied the motion by written order.the court found that rowe was obligated under the agreement to arbitrate his claims against initiatek,but he never signed a contract requiring him to arbitrate his claims against exline and trahan.while recognizing that a party to an arbitration agreement can be compelled to arbitrate claims against third parties under certain circumstances,the court found that those circumstances were not present and rowe could not be compelled to arbitrate his claims against exline and trahan.allowing arbitration against initiatek to proceed at the same time as court proceedings against exline and trahan,the court observed,would create a risk of conflicting rulings on common issues of law and fact,and ordering a stay of the court proceedings pending an arbitration would not promote judicial economy.the court therefore exercised its discretion under california law to refuse to enforce the arbitration agreement as against initiatek,the only party bound by that agreement.civ,section,subd.c last paragraph.the court concluded all of plaintiff claims against all three defendants shall be tried to judgment in this superior court action.
this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
a strong public policy favors the arbitration of disputes,and doubts should be resolved in favor of deferring to arbitration proceedings.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.
appellants contend the trial court erred in denying their motion to compel arbitration because exline and trahan,although not signatories to the agreement,are alleged to be alter egos of signatory initiatek.as such,appellants argue,they can compel the arbitration of the controversies in the complaint and the court erred in relying on code of civil procedure section,subdivision c,to deny the arbitration 
in light of the parties debate on the point,we begin our discussion by clarifying the appropriate analytical steps and the standard of appellate review applicable to each.section generally mandates arbitration of all claims that are subject to an enforceable arbitration agreement.the statute reads in part on petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy,the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement exists,except in circumstances set forth in the statute.
there is no dispute in this case that the arbitration clause in the agreement is enforceable.instead,the threshold question is who may enforce it whether any or all of the petitioning,trahan,or enforce the arbitration clause as parties to the agreement.the trial court ruled that only initiatek could,as signatory to the agreement.whether and to what extent exline and trahan can also enforce the arbitration clause is a question of law,which we review de novo.turtle ridge media group,pacific bell directory th,d turtle ridge.
if exline,trahan,or initiatek can enforce the arbitration agreement,the next question is whether there is an exception to otherwise mandatory arbitration.subdivision c of section provides an exception where a party to the arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court action with a third party,arising out of the same transaction or series of transactions and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact.the trial court ruled that this exception applied,finding that a party to the arbitration agreement rowe was also a party to the pending court action with third parties exline and trahan,arising out of the same transaction or series of transactions the agreement,and conflicting rulings on common issues of law and fact were possible because all three defendants were parties to the first and second causes of action.whether exline and trahan were third part ies,such that section,subdivision c applied,is also a question of law that we review de novo.
the final step in the analysis pertains if,in fact,subdivision c of section applies.section reads in part if the court determines that a party to the arbitration is also a party to litigation in a pending court action with a third party as set forth under subdivision c herein,the court may refuse to enforce the arbitration agreement and may order intervention or joinder of all parties in a single action or special proceeding may order intervention or joinder as to all or only certain issues may order arbitration among the parties who have agreed to arbitration and stay the pending court action or special proceeding pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding or may stay arbitration pending the outcome of the court action or special proceeding.in the matter before us,the trial court selected the first option and refused to compel arbitration.the court decision as to how to proceed in a situation governed by section,subdivision c,is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see henry alcove investment,d.
we address these issues to the extent necessary to resolve the appeal.
can exline and trahan enforce the arbitration agreement 
as a general matter,only signatories to an arbitration agreement may enforce it.see,county of contra costa kaiser foundation health plan,th,d even the strong public policy in favor of arbitration does not extend to those who are not parties to an arbitration agreement or who have not authorized anyone to act for them in executing such an agreement.there are limited exceptions to this rule,as we discuss next.
alter ego exception first cause of action 
exline and trahan are sued in the first cause of action for breach of contract under an alter ego theory.the complaint alleges that the individuality of defendant initiatek corporation or its separateness from defendant trahan and defendant exline has ceased,and the corporation was not intended to have any true corporate existence s ubsequent to january of.
alter ego theory posits that the individual defendants are inseparable from the corporation and in legal effect are the corporation.walter zuckerman cal,alter ego theory requires that the corporation and individual should be considered as one.the corporate form is disregarded and the entity is considered an association of individuals.mesler bragg management cal d,see riddle leuschner cal d,shareholders may be liable as principals or partners.
no reported california case has decided whether a nonsignatory sued as the alter ego of a signatory can enforce an arbitration provision.california courts do recognize,however,that a nonsignatory sued as an agent of a signatory may enforce an arbitration agreement.in dryer los angeles rams cal d,dryer,the plaintiff filed a lawsuit against the rams,as well as individuals sued in their capacities as owners,operators,managing agents,and in control of sic the rams,under a contract containing an arbitration provision.id.at.the individual defendants were alleged to have been party to the contract and breached the contract.id.at.the trial court denied a petition to compel arbitration as to the individual defendants,on the ground they were not signatories to the contract.id.at.the court of appeal reversed,holding that if,as the complaint alleges,the individual defendants,though not signatories,were acting as agents for the rams,then they are entitled to the benefit of the arbitration provisions.id.at.
a nonsignatory who is the agent of a signatory can even be compelled to arbitrate claims against his will.in harris superior court d.harris,plaintiffs were enrolled in a health services program that required arbitration of disputes.id.at.after they sued a hospital,a physician,and others for malpractice,the hospital motion to compel arbitration was granted.the plaintiffs then sought to compel the physician to arbitrate as well.id.at.the trial court denied the motion because the physician had not signed the enrollment form containing the arbitration provision.the court of appeal reversed,holding that the physician relationship as an employee of the corporation was sufficient to bind him to the arbitration agreement which named the corporation.id.at.
rowe does not refute the law permitting a nonsignatory to compel arbitration if sued as a signatory agent.nor does he provide any persuasive reason why a nonsignatory should be precluded from compelling arbitration if sued as a signatory alter ego.indeed,while an agent is one who acts on behalf of a corporation,an alter ego is one who,effectively,is the corporation.by suing exline and trahan for breach of the agreement on the ground that they are initiatek alter egos,and even alleging in the complaint that exline and trahan entered into the agreement,exline and trahan are entitled to the benefit of the arbitration provisions.dryer,supra,cal d at.
the alter ego rationale,however,applies only to the first cause of action for breach of contract.the other three causes of action asserted against exline and trahan allege violations of corporations code section,subdivision c corporate board is obligated to send notice to creditors of the voluntary winding up of the corporation corporations code section,subdivision a directors are jointly and severally liable for their approval of corporation improper distribution of assets and corporations code sections corporation may recover from shareholder for corporate assets received in the course of the winding up of the corporation,where distribution was made without payment or provision for an existing debt and where corporation has been dissolved,shareholders may be sued for cause of action arising prior to the dissolution.the alter ego theory does not pertain to these causes of action.if exline and trahan can not compel arbitration of these claims,the claims would have to be resolved in the court proceedings,and the trial court would have discretion to stay the arbitration of the contract claim pending the resolution of the statutory claims,subd.c third paragraph.we need not consider this possibility further,however,beca
