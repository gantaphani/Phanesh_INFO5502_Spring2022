this appeal concerns two arbitration awards entered as a result of a dispute between illinois district council of the international union of bricklayers and allied craftworkers,and its affiliated local union and mckinney restoration,mckinney construction,mc construction,and lee mckinney collectively employer.the employer filed suit in the district court to vacate two labor arbitration awards entered in favor of the union,and the union counterclaimed seeking enforcement of those awards.because the employer challenge to the first arbitration award was untimely,the district court granted the union motion for partial summary judgment enforcing the first award based on the statute of limitations.the court subsequently granted the parties joint motion for direction of entry of final judgment pursuant to rule b,and the employer appealed.the sole issue before this court on appeal is whether the employer action to vacate the first arbitration award was filed outside the statute of limitations.
the employer argues that the first arbitration left open issues that were decided in the second award,and therefore that it was not a final appealable decision until after the second arbitration award.accordingly,it argues that the statute of limitations for both awards commenced only after the second arbitration award was entered,and that the action is thus timely as to both awards.the history of the arbitration is therefore critical to this case.
mckinney restoration is a construction contracting business that was formerly incorporated,and lee mckinney was the president and sole shareholder.mckinney construction and mc construction are unincorporated businesses in the construction contracting industry and are owned and operated by lee mckinney.in the first arbitration,the union filed a grievance against the employer,alleging violations of the collective bargaining agreement.according to that collective bargaining agreement,all disputes had to be submitted initially to the joint arbitration board jab.the jab conducted a hearing on that grievance on december,and reconvened on march,to hear additional evidence.notice of the hearing was provided to lee mckinney as well as to all three of the mckinney business entities,and lee mckinney and an attorney appeared at the hearing on behalf of the those three business entities.following those hearings,the jab issued a written decision.it found that mckinney restoration was the only signatory to the collective bargaining agreement,but that mckinney restoration,mckinney construction,and mc construction were effectively the same business and therefore that all three were bound to the terms of the agreement.the jab further determined that those businesses had performed more than hours of bargaining unit work in violation of the agreement,and it ordered them to pay in damages.a written copy of the decision was sent to lee mckinney,and receipt of that decision was acknowledged on may.accordingly,this decision is known as the may award.
the three business entities failed to comply with that may award,however,resulting in a second grievance by the union against the employer.in a letter dated october,the union informed the employer of the grievance and informed it that a hearing would be held before the jab to consider claims related to liability for and compliance with the may decision.the jab conducted that hearing on october,and held that mckinney was personally bound by the collective bargaining agreement and therefore was jointly liable for the obligations under the may award.accordingly,the jab ruled that a bond lee mckinney had previously posted could be applied towards satisfaction of that obligation.lee mckinney received a copy of that award in december,which is thereby termed the december award.
on march,the employer filed an action in the district court seeking to vacate both the may and december awards pursuant to the relations act lmra.the union countersued seeking enforcement of the awards.the district court bifurcated the proceedings,addressing first whether the action to vacate the may award was barred by the statute of limitations.the court held that it was barred by the limitations period,and the employer appealed.
it is law in this circuit that the failure to challenge an arbitration award within the applicable limitations period renders the award final.int l union of operating engineers,local,centor contractors,cir sullivan gilchrist,cir sullivan lemoncello,cir.all parties agree that the appropriate limitations period in this case is days,and our cases are in accord.centor,at applicable limitations period to vacate an arbitration award in illinois is days gilchrist,at same lemoncello,at same.that would seem to end the case because the suit to vacate the may award was filed well beyond that period.the employer,however,seeks to avoid that consequence by contending that the may award was not in fact a final decision by the jab because the issue of mckinney personal liability was before the jab at the initial hearing and was not decided until the december award.accordingly,the employer maintains that the may and december awards were actually one decision by the jab and therefore the limitations period did not begin to run until the december award was issued.that argument is both factually and legally insupportable.
the argument is factually flawed because there is no evidence whatsoever that lee mckinney personal liability was before the jab for the hearings culminating in the may award.the employer points to a compendium of innocuous facts to support its position.first,it notes that in a november,letter apprising the employer of the december hearing for the first arbitration,the union stated 
local believes that the relationship among each of the named business entities and the relationship of mckinney to those entities is such that each of the named entities and mckinney personally are liable for the obligations imposed by the labor contract between district council and mckinney restoration.
the employer contends that this letter establishes that the issue of lee mckinney personal liability was before the jab prior to the may award.in addition,the employer points out that each letter regarding the hearings was addressed to lee mckinney as well as the three business entities.that is the only evidence that lee mckinney identifies indicating that his personal liability was before the jab at the first arbitration.
in addition,lee mckinney asserts that certain aspects of the october hearing for the second arbitration indicate that it was a continuation of the first arbitration.specifically,he notes that the two jab decisions were heard and authored by the same jab panel and that the october,letter regarding the second arbitration provided although the claim raised by the union has to do with compliance,you will be given an opportunity if you wish to request that the joint arbitration board consider any arguments or evidence you wish to present.although the connection is far from,the employer contends that this statement demonstrates that the evidence at the october hearing was not limited to the personal liability of mckinney which had not been addressed or decided at the prior hearing but rather that the purpose of the hearing was to reopen the prior hearing for whatever the parties wanted to discuss 
those arguments by the employer fall far short of establishing that the may and december awards were actually one comprehensive decision by the jab.in fact,the record demonstrates that the opposite is true.although the november letter preceding the hearings for the first arbitration evidenced the union belief that lee mckinney should be held personally liable,there is absolutely no evidence that his personal liability was presented to the jab.the jab determined the liability of the three business entities and never discussed lee mckinley liability,nor did it indicate that his personal liability had ever been raised.in fact,in the may award,the jab identifies the parties notified of the hearing and the representatives present,in each case mentioning only the three business entities.for instance,the jab records tha
