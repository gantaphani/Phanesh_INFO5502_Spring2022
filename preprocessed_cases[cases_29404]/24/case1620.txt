defendant and appellant mario nicastro nicastro appeals an order denying attorney fees and costs after nicastro prevailed in an arbitration brought by plaintiff and respondent carole ring associates ring.nicastro seeks attorney fees and costs he incurred at the arbitration level as well as attorney fees and costs incurred in judicial proceedings.
the issue is whether a contract providing for arbitration and authorizing attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party may be relied on to support postarbitration attorney fees and costs pursuant to code of civil procedure section,even though the arbitrator directed the parties to bear their own attorney fees and costs 
here,nicastro is bound by the judgment confirming the arbitration award,including the arbitrator refusal to award attorney fees and costs incurred during the arbitration proceeding.however,the arbitrator decision does not prevent nicastro entitlement under the contract to recover attorney fees and costs incurred in judicial proceedings,although that result may seem somewhat anomalous.therefore,the order is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
factual and procedural background 
nicastro was the owner of residential real property in diamond bar,california.on july,nicastro listed the property for sale with ring as the broker,executing a listing agreement for a term of six months to january.the agreement provided in pertinent part that nicastro would pay to ring a six percent broker commission,b if the property is withdrawn from sale,transferred,conveyed,leased,rented,or made unmarketable by a voluntary act of seller,without the consent of the broker,during the above time period 
on or about november,nicastro leased the subject property for a term.after learning of the execution of the lease,ring made claim to its commission,based on the quoted contract language and the lease of the premises during the contract term without the broker consent.ring demanded plus interest and attorney fees.nicastro disputed ring claim.the term of the listing agreement expired on january.the tenant completed the leasehold term and the property was not sold during that time.
arbitration proceedings and award.
the listing agreement contained an arbitration clause,requiring binding arbitration of any dispute or claim arising out of this contract accordingly,on ring request,the matter proceeded to arbitration.an arbitration hearing was held,with the arbitrator issuing a decision,finding for nicastro.that decision reasoned as follows 
this matter was arbitrated on january,pursuant to a stipulation executed by the parties.this dispute involved the claim by the plaintiff for a full real estate brokers commission because the defendant leased the property during the term of the listing agreement.plaintiff claims that the fact of leasing the property in and of itself is sufficient to cause a breach fn.omitted of the listing agreement that would make defendant responsible to her for a full brokers commission.the property was leased on november,the listing agreement terminated on january.the lessee executed a day move out letter in event of a sale.the letter was executed after the lease but before the termination of the listing agreement.the plaintiff never presented a ready and willing buyer at any time during the term of the listing agreement.based upon the testimony and the documents presented the arbitrator finds for the defendant.the execution of the lease,by itself,does not fn.omitted cause a breach of the listing agreement unless such actions render the property unmarketable.the actions of the defendant in this case had no effect on the marketability of the property.the plaintiff is not entitled to any commission.italics added.
although the contract entitled the prevailing party to attorney fees and costs and nicastro was the prevailing party in that the arbitrator had rejected ring claim for a commission,the arbitrator ruled each party bears their own attorney fees and costs.
superior court vacation of arbitration award.
following ring unsuccessful attempt at reconsideration with the arbitrator,on march,ring filed a petition in the superior court for judicial review of arbitration award and for order to vacate arbitration award.after briefing and argument,on april,the court agreed with ring and granted the petition.the court minute order reads 
petition granted.a plain reading of the listing agreement demonstrates that the agreement was breached and the commission earned when the respondent entered into the lease.that the lessee subsequently agreed,under alleged compulsion,to move out in the event the property was sold has no e ffect upon the breach.the arbitrator exceeded his powers within the meaning of d by disregarding the express terms of the agreement,which could not have been anticipated by claimant.
