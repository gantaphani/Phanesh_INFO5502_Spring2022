this is the second appeal in an action arising out of plaintiff claims against multiple defendants for defects in his newly purchased home.in the first appeal,this court affirmed a judgment reducing to zero a verdict plaintiff obtained against one of the defendants by offsetting against the verdict the amount of a larger pretrial settlement with other defendants.the present appeal questions whether a pretrial settlement and corresponding offset to zero necessarily requires the shifting of postoffer costs under code of civil procedure section if the plaintiff previously rejected a section cash offer from the defendant against whom the claim was tried.there is currently a division of authority with respect to a similar issue under section.however,regardless of the proper interpretation of section,the determination of whether the plaintiff recovered more or less than the amount offered by the defendant for the purpose of applying section is to be made taking into account any other settlements entered as of the time the section offer was outstanding,but not considering settlements that had not yet been reached.the trial court here implicitlyapplied this approach in awarding all costs to plaintiff and we shall,therefore,affirm.
factual and procedural background 
in april,plaintiff purchased a home in santa rosa from elizabeth gonsalves.both plaintiff and gonsalves were represented in the transaction by a real estate agent for santa rosa.prior to the close of escrow,the home was inspected by defendants rodan termite control,and its agent daniel madrid collectively,rodan.shortly after the close of escrow,plaintiff discovered dryrot in the bathroom and kitchen and evidence of unpermitted and undisclosed repairs to the home.in february,plaintiff filed suit against gonsalves,and rodan.in december,rodan served on plaintiff a section offer to compromise for,each side to bear its own costs.plaintiff did not accept the offer.approximately three years later,in november,shortly before the start of trial,plaintiff entered a judicially approved good faith settlement with for.the case proceeded to trial against rodan and the jury returned a special verdict for plaintiff in the amount of.the court subsequently granted rodan motion pursuant to section to offset the settlement proceeds against the verdict and reduce the judgment to zero.judgment was entered in favor of plaintiff for zero dollars,and this court affirmed that judgment guerrero rodan,wl,nonpub.opn.
after the entry of judgment,the parties both filed cost memoranda.rodan moved to tax the costs plaintiff incurred subsequent to the filing of the section offer to compromise,arguing that plaintiff zero judgment was not more favorable than the settlement offer.at the same time,plaintiff filed a motion to strike rodan memorandum of costs,contending he was nonetheless the prevailing party.
the trial court granted plaintiff motion to strike rodan memorandum of costs and denied rodan motion.the court stated it was on the verge of finding that the section offer was not even a good faith offer.noting that rodan just happened to get the benefit of a pretrial settlement with another defendant and observing that the purpose of section is to encourage reasonable prejudgment or pretrial settlements,the court concluded,the policy of section is best served by having the operation of this statute not come into effect in this particular circumstance.rodan filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
the right to recover costs is wholly dependent on statute.crib retaining walls,th,d.here,that right is conferred by sections and.section,subdivision b provides the general rule that the prevailing party is entitled to recover its costs as a matter of right.section,subdivision a defines the prevailing party as the party with a net monetary recovery,a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered,a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief,and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.when any party recovers other than monetary relief and in situations other than as specified,the prevailing party shall be as determined by the court,and under those circumstances,the court,in its discretion,may allow costs or not and,if allowed may apportion costs between the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under section.
section modifies the general rule of section that only the prevailing party recovers its costs.scott blount,cal th,d.section,subdivision a states,the costs allowed under sections and shall be withheld or augmented as provided in this section.under section,subdivision c,i f an offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award,the plaintiff shall not recover his or her postoffer costs and shall pay the defendant costs from the time of the offer.the parties here disagree whether,for the purpose of allocating costs under section,a plaintiff whose judgment is reduced to zero by operation of section can be deemed to have obtain ed a more favorable judgment or award than a rejected section offer to pay.in construing section,we review the trial court decision de novo.mesa forest products,paul mercury ins.th,d.
s ection is a statute which encourages the settlement of actions,by penalizing parties who fail to accept reasonable pretrial settlement offers.a plaintiff who refuses a reasonable pretrial settlement offer and subsequently fails to obtain a more favorable judgment is penalized by a loss of prevailing party costs and an award of costs in the defendant favor.heritage engineering construction,city of industry th,d.the goal has been to apply section in a manner which best promotes its purpose.guzman visalia community bank th,d,citing cobb superior court cal d.
this purpose is not accomplished by permitting the defendant to recover its postoffer costs in every case in which the plaintiff fails to recover more than the defendant section offer.unless the is dependent on the defendant having submitted a reasonable offer that the plaintiff could realistically have been expected to accept,there will be no encouragement for settlement.thus,in wear calderon d.wear,the court concluded that in order to accomplish the legislative purpose of encouraging settlement of litigation without trial citation,a good faith requirement must be read into section.in other words,the pretrial offer of settlement required under section must be realistically reasonable under the circumstances of the particular case.wear,supra,at.since the legislature reenact ed section without pertinent change in light of wear,the legislature has approved and adopted wear interpretation of section.elrod oregon cummins diesel,d.
similarly,in determining whether plaintiff obtained a more favorable judgment or award than a section offer,the objective of encouraging settlement requires consideration of the status of the litigation when the section offer was submitted.in the present case,when rodan submitted its offer early in the litigation,plaintiff had recovered nothing by way of settlement or otherwise and had a valid claim against rodan that the jury later determined to be worth substantially more than the that rodan offered.plaintiff thus did not reject an offer that the outcome of trial indicates should have been accepted.even if rodan offer was not so low as to have been in bad faith,there is still no reason why rodan should be rewarded for having submitted the offer,nor is there any reason to penalize plaintiff for having rejected it.the costs that plaintiff incurred subsequent to rejecting the offer were incurred in pursuit of a claim with a value of at least.regardless of the offset based on subsequent developments in the litigation,plaintiff was justified in rejecting the offer when he rejected it.
the situation would have been very different if rodan had submitted a section offer for after plaintiff had accepted in settlement from.in that event,plaintiff would have been required to evaluate the likelihood of recovering at least from rodan.had he rejected such an offer at that time,it would be entire
