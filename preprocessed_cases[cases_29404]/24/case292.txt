opinion of the court 
we consider whether a district court,rather than an arbitrator,should decide if an agreement to arbitrate disputes between the parties to that agreement also authorizes classwide arbitration.because of the fundamental differences between classwide and individual arbitration,and the consequences of proceeding with one rather than the other,we hold that the availability of classwide arbitration is a substantive question of arbitrability to be decided by a court absent clear agreement otherwise.
background 
plaintiffs david opalinski and james mccabe sometimes collectively referred to as appellees,former employees of robert half international,rhi,bring this action on behalf of themselves and other individuals,alleging that rhi failed to pay them overtime and improperly classified them as employees in violation of the fair labor standards act flsa,et.both mccabe and opalinski signed employment agreements that contained arbitration provisions.they provide that a ny dispute or claim arising out of or relating to employee employment,termination of employment or any provision of this agreement shall be submitted to arbitration.neither agreement mentions classwide arbitration.
rhi moved to compel arbitration of opalinski and mccabe claims on an individual basis.in october,the district court granted the motion in part,thus compelling arbitration but holding that the propriety of individual also known as bilateral versus classwide arbitration was for the arbitrator to decide the october order.the court subsequently entered an order terminating the case.rather than immediately appealing the october order,rhi proceeded with the arbitration process and did not return to the district court until the arbitrator issued a partial award and ruled that the employment agreements permitted classwide arbitration.rhi then moved the district court to vacate the arbitrator partial award.the district court denied the motion to vacate the december order.
rhi appeals the december order.the crux of the appeal,however,is not the underlying issue whether the employment agreements between the parties permit classwide as opposed to only bilateral arbitration.rather,the question before us is who decides that is,should the availability of classwide arbitration have been decided by the arbitrator or by the district court 
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction over this action per because plaintiffs brought claims under the flsa.we have jurisdiction under a d an appeal may be taken from an order confirming or denying confirmation of an award or partial award.
appellees argue that this appeal is untimely because although rhi styles it as one based on the district court december order denying its motion to vacate,the appeal actually challenges only the october order holding that the availability of classwide arbitration is a question for the arbitrator.the october order,appellees contend,was a final decision that was immediately appealable on an interlocutory basis,and rhi attempt now to appeal the merits of that decision is untimely.see fed.a a party seeking to appeal a final decision must file notice of appeal within days of entry of the judgment or order appealed from.
the federal arbitration act preserves immediate appeal of any final decision with respect to an arbitration,whether the decision is favorable or hostile to arbitration.green tree fin.randolph,d quoting a.a final decision is one that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing more for the court to do but execute the judgment.id.quotation marks and citation omitted.here the october order was not a final decision because it effected only a,administrative closure,and explicitly acknowledged the potential need for further litigation before the district court.freeman pittsburgh glass works,llc,cir administrative closings are not final orders.rhi timely appealed the district court final decision the december order and we have jurisdiction to consider this appeal.
on appeal from a district court ruling on a motion to confirm or vacate an arbitration award,we review its legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.sutter oxford health plans llc,cir,aff,d.
iii.discussion 
we decide first what arguments we may properly consider on this appeal.appellees contend that because rhi did not argue in its motion to vacate that the district court and not the arbitrator should have determined the permissibility of classwide arbitration,it has waived its right to raise that argument in this appeal.however,waiver,which is intended to protect litigants from unfair surprise and prevent district courts from being reversed on grounds that were never argued before them,does not apply in this instance.appellees were well aware of rhi argument that the district court,not the arbitrator,should decide the availability of classwide arbitration the court expressly addressed the issue in its october order,rhi objected to the arbitrator determination whether classwide arbitration was permissible throughout the arbitration proceedings,and rhi did flag the who decides issue in its motion to vacate by reminding the court that from the outset rhi has maintained that the class action issue is for this court to decide.thus,our addressing the issue on appeal prejudices neither appellees nor the district court.
we proceed to the merits of the case and consider whether,in the context of an otherwise silent contract,the availability of classwide arbitration is to be decided by a court rather than an arbitrator.the analysis is twofold.we decide whether the availability of classwide arbitration is a question of arbitrability.see howsam dean witter reynolds,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.if yes,it is presumed that the issue is for judicial determination unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise.id.internal quotation marks,citations,and alteration omitted.if the availability of classwide arbitration is not a question of arbitrability,it is presumptively for the arbitrator to resolve.see first options of,kaplan,d.
is the availability of classwide arbitration a question of arbitrability 
a rbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.howsam,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.while federal policy favors arbitration agreements,an arbitrator has the power to decide an issue only if the parties have authorized the arbitrator to do so.because parties frequently disagree whether a particular dispute is arbitrable,courts play a limited threshold role in determining whether the parties have submitted a particular dispute to arbitration,the question of arbitrability.id.at emphasis in original.
questions of arbitrability are limited to a narrow range of gateway issues.they may include,for example,whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration clause or whether an arbitration clause in a concededly binding contract applies to a particular type of controversy.id.at.on the other hand,questions that the parties would likely expect the arbitrator to decide are not questions of arbitrability.id.those include procedural questions that grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition,as well as allegations of waiver,delay,or similar defenses to arbitrability.id.
the supreme court has not yet decided whether the availability of class arbitration is a question of arbitrability.in green tree financial bazzle,d,a plurality of the court concluded that the availability of classwide arbitration was not a question of arbitrability because it concerns neither the validity of the arbitration clause nor its applicability to the underlying dispute between the parties,but only contract interpretation and arbitration procedures.id.at.
subsequent supreme court decisions,however,cast doubt on the bazzle plurality decision.in stolt nielsen animalfeeds international,d,the court specifically noted that only the plurality in bazzle decided that an arbitrator should determine whether a contract permits classwide arbitration and bazzle is accordingl
