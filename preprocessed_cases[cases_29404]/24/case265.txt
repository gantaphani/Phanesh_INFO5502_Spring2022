guangzhou zhen hua shipping,zhen hua appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york william conner,judge,entered october,upon an august,opinion and order,as amended september,granting the motion of to compel arbitration in london and denying the motion of to dismiss on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction,lack of personal jurisdiction,and improper venue,see titan,guangzhou zhen hua shipping,d,titan i,and upon a september,opinion and order,clarifying the scope of arbitration,see titan,guangzhou zhen hua shipping,titan ii.
on appeal,zhen hua contends principally that the district court exceeded the scope of its jurisdiction under the federal arbitration act,the faa by compelling arbitration of the parties dispute pursuant to a charter party allegedly negotiated by the parties in september.more specifically,zhen hua argues that the court should not have determined whether the parties had formed a charter party because the parties had allegedly negotiated an ad hoc agreement to arbitrate that issue and that the court erred in finding that no such ad hoc agreement existed.in addition,zhen hua asserts that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the foreign sovereign immunities act,that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over zhen hua,and that venue in the southern district of new york was improper.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
background 
titan,titan is a corporation organized under the laws of texas,with its principal place of business in pelham,new york.zhen hua is a corporation organized under the laws of the people republic of china,engaged primarily in the shipping industry,with its principal place of business in guangzhou also known as canton,china.
a.the negotiations 
in august,titan and zhen hua began negotiating a time charter of the bin he the bin he,a ship owned by zhen hua.the parties conducted negotiations through two shipbrokers in connecticut,seabrokers representing titan and seagos representing zhen hua.the two connecticut brokers served as conduits for the transmission of many of the communications from one party to the other.most of the parties communications during the negotiations are memorialized in writings transmitted via facsimile or telex between and among the brokers and the parties.these communications establish the following chronology of the negotiations.
on september,zhen hua offered to charter the bin he to titan for months at per day,with an option for an additional months at per day.the parties proceeded to negotiate different time periods and rates,as well as several other terms,the details of which are not relevant to the issues before us.on september,zhen hua sent titan a firm counter offer 
upon receipt of this telex,titan informed its broker,seabrokers,that charterers are in agreement and accept owner s last offer.seabrokers then sent via fax to seagos and titan a fixture recap,confirming the owners and charterers agreement.the agreement was based on the shelltime time charter,a standard time charter,see michael wilford et,time charters ed,containing an arbitration clause that provides for arbitration in london at the election of either party the recap from seabrokers to seagos and titan contained,in part,the following language 
after zhen hua the bin he in hong kong,denholm ship management overseas denholm conducted the inspection contemplated by the parties.following a preliminary inspection,which revealed several problems with the ship,zhen hua apparently began considering a sale of the bin he.
on october,titan received from denholm an initial summary report on the drydock inspection.on october,titan informed seabrokers that it had concerns about the seaworthiness of the bin he,but would await denholm final report.titan indicated also that it was interested in a purchase option and would like to know what steps the owner intends to take to bring the vessel up to an acceptable trading standard.seabrokers relayed this message to seagos,which,acting through henry chen,responded later that day 
now owners have decided to sell the vessel on cash basis.they are asking million on the market.but i reckon will go at millions sic.prospective buyers will be inspecting this week while the vsl is still in the yard.
owners thank titan interest and advice.they ask to convey their willingness to entertain future business proposals and look forward to possible cooperation.
on october,titan faxed a message to seabrokers,noting that the final inspection had not yet arrived and remarking 
it is encouraging that zhen hua is now in a position to sell the vessel if we do not exercise our option for the time charter.we assume therefore that the vessel has been successfully withdrawn from camaro.we await owners sic confirmation of this withdrawl sic per our agreement,so we can begin marketing the vessel for voyage consecutive voyage charter.
titan also asked seabrokers to determine whether zhen hua would provide a purchase option throughout the period of its charter.
on october,seagos,through chen,faxed seabrokers,stating in relevant part 
we know that after the vsl failed the sub with titan on monday,zhen hua preference is to do a straight sale,and not to give purchase options.if you think titan is still interested in the time charter of the vsl,please ascertain if titan can take delivery of the vsl upon owners lift sic their subject.
on the same day,titan apparently became concerned that a misunderstanding might have developed between the parties.consequently,titan wrote again to seabrokers which,in relevant part,states 
first,let me be perfectly clear with,my fax of october was not a rejection of the vessel.it is difficult to see how this could be so interpreted.in fact it was clearly stated that the inspection report was due wednesday today and we are serious about this vessel.frankly,owners sic recent lack of response conveys the impression of a recent disinterest on their part in trying to conclude this charter 
we received the full denholm report today,october,and after review and assuming owners cooperation per the agreed eligibility clause,we lift our inspection subject.
we now look to owners to lift their camaro withdrawl sic subject.the titan board will make its decision within the working days after the lifting of this subject per ou r agreement 
seabrokers forwarded the fax to henry chen of seagos.
on october,chen informed seabrokers that the bin he had been withdrawn from camaro,and stated that titan approved the vsl belatedly.however,if titan is still serious with sic the vsl,owners can consider a time charter arrangement for the time being.in response,on october titan advised seabrokers that it was pleased to finally learn that the vessel had been officially withdrawn from the camaro charter and that owners had lifted this subject.titan stated further that it would respond with its board approval by the close of business on october.in fact,titan board of directors approved the charter party on october.
on october,titan sent a telex direct to chen,as well as to seabrokers,stating,in part,as follows 
clearly,titan position is that it has done what was required to conclude the month,option month contract which it had negotiated,ie.the agreement 
therefore,titan requests that owners reconsider their withdrawal of the bin he and advise when ship will be available in its next position.reported to be hong kong.
in response to a suggestion by chen that the parties pursue expedited resolution of the apparent dispute,titan faxed chen directly on november,
since we firmly believe that we entered into a binding fixture with owners and therefore have a valid claim,we agree with your suggestion to seek an expedited resolution of this claim.we would suggest submitting this matter to three arbitrators in new york who would have days to take evidence and issue a ruling on the threshold issue of whether the parties entered into a binding agreement on september subject to conditions that were subsequently fulfilled.
chen faxed seabrokers on november 
per our telecon this morning and subsequent discussion with southern shipping claim dept,southern will respond to titan commencement of arbitration request.but pls do not deviate by introducing new forum selection.shell time camaro proforma is very clear on the simplified arbitration which has been agreed by titan and agreeable to southern shipping as well.there is no need for a separate sic arbitration agreement at al sic 
later that day,titan gave seagos formal written notice of arbitration pursuant to the shell time clause c of charter party.
titan apparently found the references to southern shipping in seagos november fax confusing,writing on november 
we refer to our fax of november commencing arbitration pursuant to clause c of the charter party.we want to make clear that titan has agreed to arbitrate with zhen hua,with whom the fixture was negotiated,and not with any other party,including southern shipping.please therefore confirm immediately that zhen hua has agreed to arbitrate titan claims against it in accordance with clause c of the charter.
replying that same day,chen faxed seabrokers 
acknowledge receipt of titan fax of yesterday.herewith confirm that arbitration will be between titan and zhen hua not any other party including southern shipping.accordingly,london arbitration shud sic be commenced in accordance with clause c of the shell time camaro proforma.
on november,titan requested that seagos,for the sake of good order,confirm that the arbitration proceedings in london are to commence in accordance with clause c of the shell time zhen hua titan proforma,which is based on the camaro charter.the same day,chen responded 
thanx john fax to which owners reply that they can reiterate that both sides have an agreement to arbitrate in london via simplified procedure according to shell time clause c camaro proforma to ascertain whether there is a charter between guangzhou zhen hua and titan.
guangzhou zhen hua will work with titan in the arbitrator nomination process to expedite this arbitration procedure.
titan replied on november 
acknowledge your fax of november.
we confirm arbitration in london is acceptable per the agreement.
we list below our names of three arbitrators and remind zhen hua that it need only agree on one.should none be acceptable,please have owners advise soonest sic of their list of three alternatives.
if we are unable to come up with a sole arbitrator through this procedure,we recommend that each party nominate a sole arbitrator and then they would agree on a third.
titan also listed its three nominees in the fax.
on november,zhen hua sent a fax directly to titan stating,we,as prior disopponent owner of bin he,hereby agree to submit this matter to london arbitrator pursuant to the shell time clause.no doubt this dispute will be govern sic by english law.zhen hua then listed three nominees of its own,apparently indicating that titan nominees were unsatisfactory.
on november,titan acknowledged that the parties had not reached agreement on a sole arbitrator and suggested a procedure for appointing a panel of three arbitrators.titan added,please advise if this procedure is agreeable.we will then notify you of our appointed arbitrator.zhen hua responded,
as to the arbitration procedure,we perfer sic to maintain that only one london arbitrator would be appointed by both parties according to the ad hoc arbitration clause.obviously this procedure will save your and our time and cost.we therefore would be grateful if you could provide another list of arbitrator s for our election.
titan never submitted another list of arbitrators.instead,more than two months later on february,titan sent a fax to the attention of chen at seagos 
after a review of our file including the recent correspondence between on the issue of arbitration in london,it appears to.that we do not have 
your clear agreement that zhen hua is the appropriate party in dispute with titan.otherwise,why the correspondence to by the former disponent owners southern shipping which is irrelevant.
an acknowledgement by you that we have a binding charter party agreement rather,we have oblique references to the pro forma camaro charter and an ad hoc arbitration clause.
we will not agree to arbitration outside of the binding titan zhen hua charter.
given the absence of such an acknowledgement,we see no reason to conclude that london is the jurisdiction for this dispute,and we are initiating litigation against zhen hua in new york courts.
later that day,zhen hua responded 
it is very clear from the alleged and the correspondence regarding the arbitration that the party involved on the part of owner is zhen hua.please clarify why you refer to southern shipping many times.
you are not allowed to be in breach of the ad hoc arbitration clause which is actually running.
we are still waiting for your another sic list of london arbitrator s.
b.the proceedings below 
on february,titan filed a petition to compel arbitration pursuant to section of the faa in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.titan requested a summary determination of the making of a binding charter party contract between titan and respondent zhen hua and to compel zhen hua to arbitrate titan claim for breach of that charter party.in its petition,titan argued 
since the charter contract between zhen hua and titan is a condition precedent to the arbitration agreement incorporated into that contract,the court must determine the threshold issue whether the parties entered into that contract.therefore,pursuant to,titan requests that the court proceed summarily to try the question of whether zhen hua and titan agreed to a binding charter contract.titan further requests that the court,upon finding that zhen hua entered into a binding contract with titan,pursuant to and,forthwith direct zhen hua to arbitrate any remaining issues including damages in accordance with the charter party arbitration agreement.
on october,zhen hua gave notice of its motion to dismiss the petition pursuant to.b,based on lack of personal jurisdiction over zhen hua dismiss the petition pursuant to.b,based on lack of jurisdiction under the foreign sovereign immunities act,the fsia,and based on the existence of an ad hoc agreement to arbitrate whether the parties had formed a binding charter party in the alternative,dismiss the petition pursuant to.b and f for improper venue and in the alternative,stay the proceedings pursuant to section of the faa and section of the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,the convention.
on august,the district court issued its first of two opinions,holding that the parties had not formed an ad hoc arbitration agreement but that they had formed a binding charter party,granting titan motion to compel arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clause contained in the charter party,and denying zhen hua to dismiss the petition.see titan i,d at.the court also stayed the proceedings pending arbitration in london.see id.at.
subsequently,zhen hua moved to alter or amend the opinion and order pursuant to.e and local civil rule,on the ground that the court opinion did not fully identify the issues left open for consideration by the arbitrators in london.titan ii,at internal quotation marks omitted.zhen hua argued that titan i made unclear to the arbitrators whether they may excuse the parties performance under the charter if respondent can prove that the subjects or conditions were not satisfied.id.at.in opposition,titan argued that the opinion unambiguously and correctly limited the scope of the arbitrators authority.id.at.
in its second opinion,the district court noted first that t he pivotal issue is whether the arbitrators may excuse the parties from their obligations under the charter in the event that one of the subjects,or conditions,has not been satisfied.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.id.having characterized the issue as such,the district court then held 
we grant respondent motion to the extent of specifying that the parties must arbitrate in london all disputes arising under the charter party.thus,the arbitrators may determine whether the actions of either party,subsequent to the formation of the charter party,have vitiated the agreement.any parts of our prior opinion which suggested otherwise are hereby withdrawn.
an amended judgment was entered on october.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,zhen hua argues that the district court erred in several regards.first,zhen hua asserts that in november the parties reached an ad hoc agreement,separate and distinct from the provisions of the charter party,for the purpose of arbitrating whether the parties had entered into a charter party.if so,contends zhen hua,the faa cloaked the district court with jurisdiction only to order arbitration in accordance with that agreement,leaving the issue of charter party formation to the arbitrator.second,zhen hua contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the fsia.third,zhen hua asserts that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over zhen hua because zhen hua did not have substantial or continuous and systematic contacts with the united states.finally,zhen hua claims that venue in the southern district of new york was improper.for the reasons stated below,we disagree with zhen hua and affirm the decision of the district court.
a.the purported agreements 
the district court held that the parties did not enter into an ad hoc agreement to arbitrate whether they had formed a charter party,but did conclude that the parties had formed a charter party that included an arbitration clause requiring the parties to submit disputes to arbitration in london.as a result,the court granted titan motion to compel arbitration pursuant to the charter party and stayed the litigation pending such arbitration.on appeal,zhen hua argues that,as a matter of law,the parties communications established an ad hoc arbitration agreement that,under the faa and the convention,delegated authority to an arbitrator in london to determine whether the parties had formed a charter party.we disagree.
standard of review 
before addressing the merits of zhen hua argument,we must resolve the parties dispute over the standard of review applicable to the district court conclusions about the existence,or lack thereof,of the two purported agreements.according to zhen hua,the district court decided the contractual formation issues as a matter of summary judgment and therefore our review is de novo.in response,titan contends that the district court appropriately made findings of fact based on the parties evidentiary submissions and that we review such findings,including the court factual findings on formation,for clear error.
the determination of whether there was a meeting of the minds sufficient to constitute a contract is one of fact.see interocean shipping national shipping trading,cir.this remains true regardless of whether the contract at issue is an arbitration agreement,see genesco,kakiuchi,cir based on written exchanges and after a detailed review of the voluminous evidentiary submissions,the district court found that plaintiff had agreed to arbitrate its disputes under both the signed and unsigned agreements with defendants.we see no reason to disturb this factual finding,or a charter party,see great circle lines,matheson,cir whether there was a meeting of the minds resulting in a charter party is a question of fact.
when parties disagree about whether they entered into an arbitration agreement subject to the faa,the faa directs that the court shall proceed summarily to trial of the issue.contrary to zhen hua characterization of the proceedings below,the district court opinion and the record make clear that the district court did try the issue of whether the parties formed an agreement to arbitrate.although the district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing,the parties filed multiple briefs and extensive evidence with the court over a period.most significantly,the parties submitted the telex and facsimile communications that were alleged to have formed the ad hoc arbitration agreement according to zhen hua and the charter party according to titan.no dispute existed as to the authenticity of these communications.instead,the parties disagreed over the meaning of the communications.
in addition,zhen hua did not and does not now seek an evidentiary hearing.nowhere in its briefs does zhen hua assert that it requested the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing.furthermore,zhen hua does not contest or even address the district court statement in footnote twelve of its first opinion that notwithstanding s ection of the faa,no such hearing was required.see titan i,d at internal citation omitted.finally,zhen hua explicitly disclaims that the case should be remanded to the district court for such a hearing 
neither titan nor zhen hua seeks remand for a factual trial,nor is a trial appropriate when the sole issue is whether,as a matter of law and through application of the presumption favoring arbitration,the parties communications reflect an enforceable agreement to arbitrate the issue of charter formation.
appellant reply br.at emphasis added.consequently,under the circumstances of the matter sub judice,we hold that the district court tried the issue of formation of both purported agreements on the papers and that zhen hua has waived any right under the faa to an evidentiary hearing.
the correct standard of review of the facts found by the trial court is contained in rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure findings of fact,whether based on oral or documentary evidence,shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous as stated in the rule,the clearly erroneous standard of review controls our consideration of the factual findings of the district court even though based upon a documentary record.see anderson city of bessemer city,north carolina,d.we are not permitted to find the district court findings of fact to be clearly erroneous if the findings are one of two permissible views of the evidence.see id.
formation of the purported agreements 
the federal arbitration act creates a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability,applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the act.painewebber bybyk,cir quoting moses cone memorial hosp.mercury constr,d.arbitration agreements subject to the convention are enforced in accordance with chapter of the faa.see.an agreement to arbitrate exists within the meaning of the convention and the faa if there is a written agreement the writing provides for arbitration in the territory of a signatory of the convention the subject matter is commercial and the subject matter is not entirely domestic in scope.see cogeneration.partnership,smith cogeneration int l,cir see also.upon finding that such an agreement exists,a federal court must compel arbitration of any dispute falling within the scope of the agreement pursuant to the terms of the agreement.
zhen hua and titan argue over whether the first requirement,the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate,has been met with regard to the ad hoc agreement and the charter party.under the convention a written agreement include s an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement,signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams,convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitrable awards,art.ii notwithstanding the strong federal policy favoring arbitration as an alternative means of dispute resolution,see david threlkeld metallgesellschaft london,cir,courts must treat agreements to arbitrate like any other contract,see volt info.sciences,board of trustees of leland stanford,d prima paint flood conklin,d.a contract is formed when there is a meeting of the minds of the parties on the essential terms of an agreement.see interocean shipping,at.a court must therefore examine the parties written communications to determine whether they have formed an agreement to arbitrate enforceable under the faa and the convention.
a.the ad hoc arbitration agreement 
the district court considered zhen hua argument that in november the parties reached a separate,ad hoc agreement to arbitrate whether the parties had formed a binding charter party.preliminarily,the court noted that the existence of an agreement to arbitrate is a threshold question for a court to resolve,absent a clear and unmistakable delegation of that authority to an arbitrator.titan i,d at citing first options of chicago,kaplan,d.the court also observed that where the parties contest the formation of an agreement,any silence or ambiguity about whether such a question is arbitrable reverses the usual presumption that issues should be resolved in arbitration favor.id.at quoting abram landau real estate bevona,cir citing first options,at.the court then found that although the parties had begun negotiating such an ad hoc agreement around november,zhen hua cut off such negotiations on november when it stated,there is no need for a separate arbitration agreement.id.therefore,the court concluded,the parties never formed a separate agreement to arbitrate whether they had formed a charter party.
on appeal,zhen hua argues that the district court erroneously relied on first options to require evidence that the parties had clear ly and unmistakabl y delegated authority to an arbitrator to decide the question of charter formation.instead,zhen hua contends,the district court should have applied the contract formation standards articulated by the convention to find that the parties had formed an ad hoc agreement to arbitrate formation of the charter party.
in first options,the supreme court addressed,inter alia,the narrow issue of the appropriate standard of review applied to an arbitrator decision about arbitrability.at.in defining this issue,the court delineated the three types of disagreement between the parties whether the defendants were liable to the plaintiffs whether the parties agreed to arbitrate the issue of liability and whether the courts or the arbitrators possess the primary power to decide the second question.see id.the issue presented to the supreme court was the third question,which the court reformulated as does that power belong primarily to the arbitrators because the court reviews their arbitrability decision deferentially or to the court because the court makes up its mind about arbitrability independently id.answering this question,the supreme court held that c ourts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is clea r and unmistakabl e evidence that they did so,id.at.second and third alterations in the original,and that any silence or ambiguity about whether such a question is arbitrable reverses the usual presumption that issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,see id.at.abram landau,at citing,inter alia,first options,at.
zhen hua is correct that the standard articulated by the supreme court in first options is not apposite to the precise question presented to the district court.unlike first options,the instant case required the district court to determine whether the parties formed an ad hoc agreement to arbitrate whether they had formed a charter issue analogous to the second of the three disagreements between the litigants in first options.on appeal,neither zhen hua nor titan contends that an arbitrator should resolve this question instead the parties disagree as to whether the court below correctly answered this question.
zhen hua errs,however,in asserting that the district court applied the first options standard in deciding whether the parties had formed an ad hoc arbitration agreement.when read in context,the passage of the district court opinion relying on first options and abram landau makes clear that the district court invoked the standard only to note preliminarily that the dispute over formation was properly before it rather than an arbitrator.see titan i,d at.furthermore,the ensuing analysis by the district court reveals that the district court correctly evaluated the written communications under general principles of the law of contract formation consistent with the convention in finding that zhen hua had terminated negotiations over an ad hoc arbitration agreement.see genesco,at under the faa whether a party is bound by an arbitration clause is determined under federal law,which comprises generally accepted principles of contract law.
having determined that the district court did not apply the first options standard,we conclude further that the district court did not commit clear error in finding that the parties did not reach a binding ad hoc agreement to arbitrate the issue of formation of the charter party.on november,zhen hua rejected titan proposal to arbitrate the issue of charter formation in new york,stating 
pls do not deviate by introducing new forum selection.shell time camaro proforma is very clear on the simplified arbitration which has been agreed by titan and agreeable to southern shipping as well.there is no need for a separate sic arbitration agreement at al sic.
the district court did not commit clear error in finding this statement to be a rejection of the idea of an arbitration agreement extraneous to the charter party.however,even if we were to interpret the statement to constitute an acceptance of the offer to arbitrate charter formation combined with a proposal that the parties employ the procedures set forth in the form agreement serving as the basis for the purported charter party,we could not override the factfinder interpretation because the november communication is certainly susceptible of both meanings.
subsequent communications between the parties bolster our conclusion that the district court findings were not clearly erroneous.the november communication from zhen hua acknowledged titan notification of arbitration pursuant to clause c of the charter party,and removed the confusion over previous references to southern shipping,but failed to specify that the parties were arbitrating the issue of the formation of the charter.titan then requested confirmation that the parties were agreeing to arbitrate in accordance with the very charter party to which titan believed zhen hua was bound.although zhen hua replied that o wners reiterate that both sides have an agreement to arbitrate in london via simplified procedure according to shell time clause c camaro proforma to ascertain whether there is a charter between guangzhou zhen hua and titan,titan never responded to this suggestion that the parties were arbitrating the issue of the existence of the charter party.instead,titan responded that arbitration was acceptable per the agreement,which the district court reasonably construed to mean the charter party itself.see titan i,d at.from november until february,the parties dickered over arbitrators,never clarifying what exactly they were arbitrating or which agreement bound them to arbitrate.as a result,we hold that the district court did not commit clear error by finding that the negotiations never resulted in a meeting of the minds sufficient to form a binding ad hoc agreement to arbitrate whether they had entered into a charter party.
b.the charter party 
although the district court determined that the parties did not form an ad hoc arbitration agreement,the district court granted titan motion to compel arbitration on the ground that the parties had formed a binding charter party that included an arbitration clause.specifically,the court concluded that the parties formed a charter party through their respective brokers no later than september,on which date titan broker seabrokers confirmed the agreement by faxing both parties a recap or fixture.see id.at.relying on this court decision in great circle lines,the district observed that a recap communication,or fixture,is recognized throughout the shipping industry as an agreement to a charter party essential terms.titan i,d at citing great circle lines,at.in the court view,the recap embodied the charter party main terms by incorporating the terms of shell time charter,a standard form charter,which included an arbitration clause.see id.
the court then rejected on two grounds zhen hua argument that the charter party did not come into force due to the alleged failure of one of its subjects the approval of the charter party by titan board of directors upon receipt of the inspection report.first,the court found that the weight of the evidence demonstrated that titan board did approve the charter party within the agreed time period.see id.second,relying again on great circle lines,the court held that a subject detail does not create a condition subsequent to a charter party.id.as a result,the court ordered that the parties arbitrate in london pursuant to the charter party arbitration clause any disputes arising under the charter party.see id.at.in a subsequent opinion the court clarified that the london arbitrators may determine whether the actions of either party,subsequent to the formation of the charter party,have vitiated the agreement.titan ii,at.
on appeal,zhen hua contends that the district court made an erroneous finding as to the existence of a charter party.zhen hua does not contest,however,that the district court finding was in accordance with the standard set forth in great circle lines,which holds that a recap communication,such as the one sent on september,in the instant case,represents an agreement as to the charter party main terms,with the subject details being no more than an acknowledgment of an intention to continue negotiations.instead,zhen hua calls for the overruling of great circle lines,asserting that its holding conflicts with the laws of the united kingdom and with the trade practices of the shipping industry at large.unpopular though it may be,great circle lines is binding precedent,and we will not overrule a prior decision of a panel of this court absent a change in the law by higher authority or by way of an in banc proceeding of this court.samuels mann,cir.
given that the district court as well as this court is bound by great circle lines,the district court correctly applied great circle lines to find that the parties had formed a charter party.under great circle lines,the september,recap constituted proof of a binding agreement or fixture,which is a commitment that a voyage will be performed,and one which presupposes a final contract,with main terms set,and final details to be resolved subsequently.at.as explicated in great circle lines,
c harter parties are formed in two stages.first,significant main terms are negotiated through brokers.these terms usually include the name of the charterer,name of owner,ship,and its characteristics,time and place of delivery,duration of charter,place of redelivery,hire rate,printed form upon which the contract is based,and any other term that a party deems important.these are considered the of the contract.the main terms when agreed upon are entitled a fixture.second,after a fixture has been reached,the parties continue to negotiate details amending the form contract specified in the fixture.these minor or side issues the original agreement or fixture.the details include a wide variety of matters,for example fuel used,speed of vessel,condition of ship holds,exact time of ship delivery to charterer,brokerage,breakdown,bunkering,option to extend charter,cargo capacity,demurrage and whatever else is deemed by the parties to be of minor importance.
id.at footnote omitted.in other words,titan and zhen hua formed an enforceable agreement to charter the bin he,subject to certain conditions,including cp details,future agreement between the parties about charter party terms other than those enumerated in the broker recap a satisfactory inspection of the ship in drydock the ship release from a time charter to a company called camaro,to which it was still chartered at the time and approval by titan board of directors of the proposed charter within days of receipt of the drydock inspection report.consequently,even if titan board did fail to timely approve the charter,such failure would not prevent or undo formation of the charter party.instead,the failure if any occurred would constitute a breach of the charter party for which the london arbitrator may impose a remedy consistent with the terms of the charter party and english law which,under the charter party,controls the interpretation of the agreement 
subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia 
zhen hua moved the trial court to dismiss titan petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground zhen hua was immune from suit under the fsia.the district court agreed with zhen hua,and no dispute exists here,that zhen hua qualifies as a foreign state under the fsia because it is a corporation owned by the people republic of china see titan i,d at.nevertheless,the district court held that zhen hua fell within two exceptions to the fsia grant of jurisdictional immunity to foreign states the arbitration exception,see a b and the commercial activities exception,see id.a see titan i,d at.because we hold the former exception applicable,we do not address the latter.
the standard of review applicable to district court decisions regarding subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia is clear error for factual findings and de novo for legal conclusions.see filetech france telecom,cir.
the arbitration exception to the fsia provides in pertinent part 
a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the united states or of the states in any case 
in which the action is brought,either to enforce an agreement made by the foreign state with or for the benefit of a private party to submit to arbitration all or any differences which have arisen or which may arise between the parties with respect to a defined legal relationship,whether contractual or not,concerning a subject matter capable of settlement by arbitration under the laws of the united states,or to confirm an award made pursuant to such an agreement to arbitrate,if b the agreement or award is or may be governed by a treaty or other international agreement in force for the united states calling for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards 
a.the district court found that,because china and the united states were both signatories to the convention,and because titan alleged that the parties had entered into a charter party containing an arbitration clause,it had jurisdiction to determine whether the parties formed an agreement to arbitrate so as to vitiate zhen hua immunity under the fsia.see titan i,d at.
on appeal,zhen hua contends that,because there was an ad hoc agreement to arbitrate the issue of whether a charter party existed,the arbitration clause in the alleged charter could not form the basis for waiver of immunity by zhen hua under a b.zhen hua further asserts that the exception might have applied if titan had sought to enforce the ad hoc agreement and to compel zhen hua to arbitrate in london the question of whether a binding charter had been concluded but that titan never asked for such relief,nor did zhen hua,who raised the ad hoc agreement only defensively in seeking dismissal or a stay of the suit.appellant brf.at.
in light of our ruling above that the district court did not commit clear error in finding that parties did not form an ad hoc arbitration agreement,we need not further address zhen hua argument.instead,we hold simply that the arbitration clause contained in the charter party satisfies the requirements of arbitration exception to the fsia.
personal jurisdiction 
zhen hua also moved the district court to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.after noting that subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over foreign sovereigns are nearly coextensive,the court determined that zhen hua contractual negotiations with titan satisfied constitutional due process requirements.see titan i,d at.on appeal,zhen hua attacks the latter conclusion,arguing that its contacts with the united states were not substantial,continuous and systematic,or purposeful in the sense required to satisfy due process concerns,and the actions of seagos can not be imputed to zhen hua because seagos served as a broker rather than an agent.we disagree.
the standard of review applicable to district court decisions regarding personal jurisdiction is clear error for factual findings and de novo for legal conclusions.see shapiro republic of bolivia,cir.
in general,subject matter jurisdiction plus service of process equals personal jurisdiction under the fsia.texas trading milling federal republic of nigeria,cir.zhen hua does not contend
