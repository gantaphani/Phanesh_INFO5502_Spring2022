this case has its roots in a labor dispute between the department of veterans affairs va medical center in asheville,north carolina,and the american federation of government employees,local,the union,which represents operating room nurses who work at the asheville medical center.the union secured an arbitration award in favor of the asheville nurses,but a subsequent decision by the va under secretary for health made it impossible for the union to enforce that award.the union filed this lawsuit against the secretary of veterans affairs and the va under secretary for health to have that decision declared unlawful,so that the arbitration award could be enforced.the district court dismissed the union lawsuit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.on this appeal,the union argues that the district court erred in dismissing the suit and should have ruled in its favor on the merits.for the reasons that follow,we hold that the district court did have jurisdiction over the union complaint.on the merits,however,we hold that the district court should have ruled for the va defendants.
jurisdiction 
background 
title vii of the civil service reform act of csra,which is codified at title,chapter of the,authorizes most federal employees to collectively bargain over the conditions of their employment.see.the collective bargaining rights of doctors and nurses employed by the va,however,are more limited.in colorado nurses ass flra,we held that the secretary of the va had the authority to set the conditions of employment for these employees by regulation and that va medical professionals did not have a right to mandatory collective bargaining.nurses,at.following that decision,in congress passed a new statute providing that 
except as otherwise specifically provided in this title,the authority of the secretary to prescribe regulations under section of this title is subject to the right of federal employees to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through representatives chosen by them in accordance with chapter of title relating to relations.
department of veterans affairs personnel act,title ii,stat,codified at a.chapter of title governs federal employees labor relations generally,including grievance procedures under collective bargaining agreements.in other words,a gives va medical professionals the right to bargain according to the rules set out in chapter of title,subject to limitations specifically provided in title.title imposes three substantive limitations on the va nurses bargaining rights under title 
such collective bargaining and any grievance procedures provided under a collective bargaining agreement in the case of employees described in section b of this title may not cover,or have any applicability to,any matter or question concerning or arising out of professional conduct or competence,peer review,or the establishment,determination,or adjustment of employee compensation under this title.
b.the third of these concerning employee at issue in this case.in addition,congress authorized the va secretary to determine whether a matter is subject to collective bargaining or instead falls under one of the three listed exceptions.as applicable to this case,the statute provides that a n issue of whether a matter or question concerns or arises out of the establishment,determination,or adjustment of employee compensation under this title shall be decided by the secretary and is not itself subject to collective bargaining and may not be reviewed by any other agency.id.d.the va secretary has delegated this d authority to the under secretary for health.
pursuant to their collective bargaining rights under a and chapter of title,operating room nurses at the va medical center in asheville,north carolina are represented by the plaintiff union,afge local.the asheville medical center is subject to a nationwide collective bargaining agreement cba between the american federation of government employees and the.in february afge local filed a grievance.the union claimed that,under the cba,operating room nurses at the medical center were entitled to premium pay for any hours worked at night or on weekends.the medical center disagreed.the grievance went to arbitration,and in december the arbitrator ruled in favor of the union.the arbitrator concluded that operating room nurses were entitled to premium pay for night and weekend work,and ordered appropriate back pay dating to the filing of the grievance.the details of the grievance,which are not relevant to the question of the district court jurisdiction over this lawsuit,are discussed at greater length in section ii of this opinion.
an arbitrator award may be appealed to the federal labor relations authority flra,but in this case the medical center waited too long before filing its appeal and the flra dismissed the appeal as untimely.the medical center refused to recognize the award.it is an unfair labor practice ulp for a federal agency to fail to comply with a valid arbitration award,see dep t of health human servs.flra,so to enforce the award the union filed a ulp charge with the flra.in september the flra served a ulp complaint on the medical center.
meanwhile,by letter of february,the medical center had requested a determination from the va that the arbitrator lacked the authority to rule on the union grievance,on the grounds that b excludes matters concerning the determination of employee compensation from the bargaining and grievance process.several months later,the va under secretary for health returned the medical center request for a determination.the under secretary instructed the center to first attempt to resolve the matter through consultation with the union,pursuant to the collective bargaining guidelines then in effect between the afge and the.negotiations failed,and in october the medical center again requested a ruling from the under secretary.
with this request still pending with the under secretary,the flra general counsel prepared to seek judgment against the medical center in the ulp proceeding.on march,the general counsel moved for a summary judgment to enforce the arbitration award.also on march,the va under secretary issued a decision paper decision.the under secretary found,u nder the authority in d,that the arbitrator decision and the subsequent ulp proceeding before the flra concern the establishment,determination,or adjustment of employee compensation.
with the decision in hand,the medical center opposed summary judgment in the flra proceeding and sought dismissal of the union attempt to enforce the arbitration award.the medical center argued that the flra lacked jurisdiction over the union complaint,and that the under secretary decision conclusively decided the issue because a question decided by the va under d is not itself subject to collective bargaining and may not be reviewed by any other agency.d.the flra agreed and dismissed the complaint.the flra held that its jurisdiction could be challenged at any stage in its proceedings,and that because the under secretary has made a d determination,the authority lacks jurisdiction over this matter.dep t of veterans affairs,va med,asheville,wl,at,vamc asheville.
the union did not seek judicial review of the flra decision,for reasons that will be discussed below.instead,in april it filed this lawsuit against the secretary of veterans affairs and the under secretary for health in their official,the va on the theory that the under secretary decision was unlawful.if the decision were declared unlawful by the district court,the union reasoned,then the arbitration award would be enforceable against the medical center,and the operating room nurses at that facility would finally receive their premium pay for night and weekend work.
the union and the va filed cross motions for summary judgment.the va also sought dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the claims raised in the union complaint.in july the district court granted the va motion to dismiss.afge,local principi,d,local.the district court concluded that,although the union claimed to be challenging the legality of the under secretary decision,the union complaint is properly characterized as a claim seeking review of the january,flra decision in the ulp proceeding,which dismissed plaintiff administrative complaint.id.at.judicial review of such an flra order is established by a,which provides that an aggrieved,the seek review of an flra order involving an unfair labor practice in the united states court of appeals.see id.at.and because the union flra case involved va medical professionals whose bargaining rights were established and limited by,subsection e of that statute specifically requires that a petition for judicial review authorized by be brought in the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit.id.at.
district courts do not have concurrent jurisdiction to review challenges to flra orders,afge loy,so the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction over the flra january,order dismissing the ulp complaint.review of that order,the court concluded,could be had only in the circuit.local,d at.having found that the union complaint was actually an appeal of the flra ruling,the district court concluded that the union had failed to adequately set forth any claim challenging the merits of the under secretary determination.id.at.for the reasons explained below,we reverse the district court jurisdictional determination.
this court reviews the district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.doe metro.police dep t.first,the union argues that the district court mischaracterized its complaint.according to the union,this lawsuit is not a veiled attempt to appeal the january,flra order.rather,it is a straightforward claim under the administrative procedure act apa to set aside agency under secretary the union contends is arbitrary and capricious or otherwise unlawful.see.second,the union argues that the district court did have jurisdiction over its complaint.the va acknowledges that the legality of final agency action is presumptively subject to judicial review,see transactive united states,but argues that in this case the union was required to bring its claims against the va in this court,not the district court.we agree with the union on this issue,and hold that the district court erred in dismissing the union complaint.
judicial review of the flra order 
as emphasized by the district court,the union did not seek review of the january,flra order in the circuit,although it was authorized to do so under e and a.the reason is simple petitioning for review of that order would have been to no avail,because the circuit lacked the authority to grant the relief sought by the union.the under secretary decision that a matter arises out of a collective bargaining exclusion may not be reviewed by any other agency.d.the federal labor relations authority and the department of veterans affairs,of course,are separate agencies.the flra therefore lacked authority to review the decision,and on review of the flra dismissal this court could not have concluded otherwise.
it is true that district courts do not have concurrent jurisdiction over matters within the exclusive purview of the flra.afge loy.the district court concluded under loy,that the flra had exclusive jurisdiction over the claims raised in this lawsuit.local,d at.the rule from loy does not apply in the instant case,however,because the legality of the disputed decision is expressly outside the flra purview.because the union is presumptively entitled to judicial review of its claim that the under secretary decision was unlawful,and because the circuit could not provide that review on a petition for the review of the flra decision dismissing the ulp complaint,loy does not provide a basis for the district court dismissing this case for lack of jurisdiction.
judicial review of the decision 
notwithstanding any mistaken reliance on loy,the va contends that the district court nonetheless reached the right result in dismissing this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the va argues that the union was required to bring such a challenge directly to the circuit.on this theory,the district court correctly dismissed the union lawsuit,not because it was a veiled appeal of the flra order,but because the district court lacked jurisdiction over the union challenge to the under secretary decision.
to resolve this question we must analyze the scope of e,which concerns judicial review of disputes involving va medical professionals.as discussed above,under title these va employees are entitled to bargain collectively in accordance with chapter of title,e xcept as otherwise specifically provided in title.a.one of the exceptions to the rights provided under title is found in e 
a petition for judicial review or petition for enforcement under section of title in any case involving employees described in section b of this title or arising out of the applicability of chapter of title to employees in those positions,shall be taken only in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit.
id.e.as it concerns petitions for review of flra orders,the effect of e is simply to channel all such petitions involving va medical professionals to the circuit,as opposed to any other united states court of appeals.noted the union sought judicial review of the january,flra order,e would have required the union to file that petition for review in this court.such a petition for judicial review would be brought under section of title which authorizes judicial review of unfair labor practice claims involving arbitration awards,see a,and would involve va employees described in section b which include registered nurses,see b.e.in contrast,a party whose right to judicial review of an flra order arises directly under title may choose to seek review in the circuit in which the person resides or transacts business or in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia.a emphasis added.
that much should not be controversial.the controversy is over the meaning of the phrase petition for judicial review as it is used in e a petition for judicial review or petition for enforcement under section of title in any case involving employees described in section b of this title or arising out of the applicability of chapter of title to employees in those positions must be brought in the circuit.the va argues that e applies not only to petitions authorized under,but also to all other disputes that aris e out of the applicability of chapter of title to va medical employees.on this argument,the union claims in this lawsuit were required to be brought in a petition for review filed in the circuit because the union claims aris e out of the applicability of chapter of title to the asheville operating room nurses.in defense of their reading of subsection e,the va asks us to read as a whole.it makes argument subsection e would govern all challenges to the va authority,established in subsection d,to settle disputes concerning the collective bargaining exclusions enumerated in subsection b.
while plausible at first glance,the va intuition is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the statute.on the va reading of subsection e,the term petition for judicial review refers to two types of petitions petitions under section of title in any case involving employees described in section b of this title,and petitions arising out of the applicability of chapter of title to employees in those positions.in other words,according to the va,subsection e provides that a petition for judicial review or petition for enforcement must be taken in the circuit if that petition is brought under section of title in any case involving employees described in section b of this title,and a petition must also be taken in the circuit if that petition aris es out of the applicability of chapter of title to employees in those positions.
the statute does not support such an unwieldy construction.to the contrary,the term petition for judicial review refers only to one type of petition petitions authorized under section of title.it is clear that both petition for judicial review and petition for enforcement are so authorized.section a provides that aggrieved persons may obtain judicial review of specified final flra orders.section b provides that the flra may petition for the enforcement of any order of the authority.and c contains rules applicable to a petition under subsection a of this section for judicial review or under subsection b of this section for enforcement.accordingly,the first fifteen words in e must be read together a petition for judicial review or petition for enforcement under section of title must be taken in the circuit if that petition is from any case involving employees described in section b of this title or arising out of the applicability of chapter of title to employees in those positions.subsection e does not apply to every case arising out of the applicability of chapter of title,because any case does not refer to all cases,but only to those cases involving final flra orders that are subject to judicial review under.
our construction of this statute is supported by a recent decision in a very similar case.in afge,local principi,cir,the ninth circuit rejected the argument that challenges to the va d authority must be brought in the circuit.though subsection e is not a model of clear draftsmanship,we agree with the ninth circuit that t he plain language of e refers only to petitions for review or petitions for enforcement under of title.id.at.read properly,e merely channels petitions to the circuit in certain cases involving va employees it does not establish the circuit jurisdiction to review,in the first instance,all cases involving the application of title to va medical professionals.congress did not preclude judicial review of the va d authority,and because e does not establish the circuit as the forum for such challenges we hold that the district court erred in dismissing this case for lack of jurisdiction.under,the district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions arising under federal law,and the union properly filed this lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of columbia.
the district court dismissed the union complaint on for summary judgment.the facts are not in dispute.rather than remand the case for further proceedings,in the interest of judicial mindful that the asheville operating room nurses with a stake in this litigation received their favorable arbitrator award in december turn to the merits of the union claims.see,block meese.section d grants the va broad authority to decide whether a question concerns or arises out of a determination of employee compensation,and we hold that the under secretary decision was not unlawful.
background 
in february the plaintiff in this case,afge local,filed a grievance on behalf of operating room nurses employed by the va medical center in asheville,north carolina.the grievance alleged that the collective bargaining agreement in place between the afge and the va required the medical center to pay its operating room nurses a premium for all work at night or on weekends.the grievance was not resolved,so the union pursued arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement.
in december the arbitrator sided with the union.the arbitrator based this decision on,which governs va nurses premium pay,and on corresponding provisions in the collective bargaining agreement.section provides,in relevant part 
b a nurse performing service on a tour of duty,any part of which is within the period commencing at postmeridian and ending at antemeridian,shall receive additional pay for each hour of service on such tour at a rate equal to percent of the nurse hourly rate of basic pay if at least four hours of such tour fall between postmeridian and antemeridian.when less than four hours of such tour fall between postmeridian and antemeridian,the nurse shall be paid the differential for each hour of service performed between those hours.
c a nurse performing service on a tour of duty,any part of which is within the period commencing at midnight friday and ending at midnight sunday,shall receive additional pay for each hour of service on such tour at a rate equal to percent of such nurse hourly rate of basic pay.
b c.the premium pay section of the cba,in turn,repeats most of this statutory language and provides that premium pay shall be provided in accordance with.the medical center argued that nurses were entitled to premium pay only for regularly scheduled tours of duty that include night or weekend hours.because the medical center operating room was generally open only on weekdays,operating room nurses did not work any regularly scheduled tours on weekends or after,and the center claimed that the nurses were entitled only to overtime pay when their work was required during those times.in support of this argument the medical center pointed to an internal regulation that defined tour of duty as scheduled hours that employees were required to work on a regular and recurring basis.
the arbitrator,however,concluded that service at night or on weekends was service on a tour of duty as required by the statute,and ruled that the medical center had violated and the cba by failing to award the nurses premium pay for all hours worked at night and on weekends.the arbitrator ordered the medical center to compensate the nurses accordingly,hereafter and retroactive to the date of the grievance filing.
an arbitrator award may be appealed to the flra.if the flra finds that the award is contrary to any law,rule,or regulation,it may take such action and make such recommendations concerning the award as it considers necessary.a.but,i f no exception to an arbitrator award is filed during the period beginning on the date the award is served on the party,the award shall be final and binding.id.b.in this case,the medical center waited days before filing its exceptions,and the flra rejected the appeal as untimely.
the medical center refused to recognize the award,so in june the union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the flra.this attempt to enforce the arbitrator award was thwarted by the va under secretary march decision on the medical center request for a ruling.in that decision,the under secretary noted that,under the va pay regulations,tour of duty is defined in terms of nurses basic,work schedule,and that the nurses receive overtime not premium work outside that normal workweek.because the operating room nurses regularly scheduled tours of duty did not involve night or weekend work,the under secretary concluded 
under the authority in d,i find 
that the arbitrator decision and subsequent ulp concerns sic the establishment,determination,or adjustment of employee compensation.
under the authority in d,i find 
that the payment of night differential and weekend premium pay to or operating room nurses for periods of overtime work concerns or arises out of a matter or question of the establishment,determination,or adjustment of employee compensation under title.
in response,the flra dismissed the ulp complaint for lack of jurisdiction.vamc asheville,wl,at.
we determine the parties motions for summary judgment under the standard set by federal rule of civil procedure c summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and if either the union or the va is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.
the union makes two principal arguments.the first is based on timing the union argues that the va waited too long before issuing the determination.the second concerns the substance of the under secretary determination the union argues that the grievance did not concern the determination or adjustment of employee compensation.we reject these arguments and hold in favor of the.
the timing of the decision 
the union argues,first,that the va lacks statutory authority to issue a d determination after a grievance has been resolved in a final and binding arbitration.section b provides that grievance procedures provided under a collective bargaining agreement may not be applied to matters concerning the determination of employee compensation according to the union,those grievance procedures ended when the arbitrator award became final an
