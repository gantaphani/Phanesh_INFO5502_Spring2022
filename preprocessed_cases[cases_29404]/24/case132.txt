appeals from two judgments of the united states district court for the southern district of new york sweet,dismissing both the initial action to enforce and the subsequent action to confirm a foreign arbitral award brought by plaintiffs appellants cbf indústria de gusa,da terra siderúrgica ltda,fergumar ferro gusa do maranhão ltda,ferguminas siderúrgica ltda,gusa nordeste,sidepar siderúrgica do pará,and siderúrgica união collectively,appellants or award creditors against defendants appellees amci holdings,american metals coal international,k m investment corporation,prime carbon gmbh,primetrade,hans mende,and fritz kundrun collectively,appellees.
appellants brought suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york to enforce a foreign arbitral award against appellees as alter egos of the then defunct award debtor.the district court first dismissed appellants cause of action to enforce the foreign arbitral award on the basis that the united nations convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards and chapter of the federal arbitration act,et,required appellants to seek confirmation of the award prior to enforcement.the district court also dismissed appellants five causes of action for fraud on the basis of issue preclusion due to prior consideration of certain fraud issues by the arbitral panel.after appellants filed a second proceeding seeking to confirm the foreign arbitral award and filed an amended complaint in the enforcement proceeding,the district court dismissed the action to confirm on the basis that the award debtor was immune from suit under federal rule of civil procedure b and then dismissed the amended action to enforce for failure to confirm the foreign arbitral award.
in,we hold that the district court both erred in determining that the united nations convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards and chapter of the federal arbitration act,et,require appellants to seek confirmation of a foreign arbitral award before the award may be enforced by a united states district court and erred in holding that appellants fraud claims should be dismissed prior to discovery on the ground of issue preclusion as issue preclusion is an equitable doctrine and appellants plausibly allege that appellees engaged in fraud.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment dismissing the action to enforce and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.in,we hold that the appeal of the judgment dismissing the action to confirm is moot and accordingly dismiss that appeal.

background 
i.the parties 
appellants are a group of foreign companies organized under the laws of,and with their offices located in,brazil.they produce and supply pig iron,which is a type of intermediate metal made by smelting iron ore with high carbon fuel.app x at.pig iron can then be further refined to become steel or wrought iron.
appellees are a group of interrelated companies collectively,the corporate appellees and two individuals,hans mende and fritz kundrun collectively,the individual appellees.according to appellants,the individual appellees financially control,directly or indirectly,the corporate appellees.
ii.allegations in the amended complaint 
as this is an appeal taken from a decision on a motion to dismiss,the facts are largely drawn from the amended complaint and are accepted as true for the purposes of this appeal.see ashcroft iqbal,bell atl.twombly.
beginning in the mid,appellants sold pig iron to a swiss company called primetrade ag.some portion of that pig iron was then supplied to primetrade usa which,appellants allege,together with primetrade ag,operated as one company at all relevant times.app x at on or about february,a bulk carrier transporting cargo for primetrade ag exploded off the coast of colombia,causing the death of the master and five crew members.in april,primetrade ag transferred its assets,including its agreements with appellants,to steel base trade,ag sbt,a swiss company,which began operating with the same officers and directors as primetrade ag and at the same offices.app x at.the transfer to sbt was apparently due to the fact that primetrade ag garnered negative publicity following litigation arising out of the ship explosion.ja silvio moreira,a representative of primetrade ag in brazil,informed two of the appellants that the business would be the same,just under a different name.app x at.
on or about october,amci international gmbh amci international,a company owned and controlled by the individual appellees,purchased sbt and its subsidiary,primetrade usa.in,appellants and sbt entered into ten separate contracts for the sale and purchase of metric tons of pig iron to sbt for more than million the contracts.only appellants and sbt are signatories of the contracts none of the appellees are signatories.appellants claim four of the ten contracts provided for delivery of pig iron in the united states.the delivery dates were set from april through december.
each of the contracts contained the following identical arbitration provision 
all disputes arising in connection with the present contract shall be finally settled under the rules of conciliation and arbitration of the international chamber of commerce,paris,by one or more arbiter,appointed in accordance with said rules.
app x at.the contracts did not provide that they were entered into on behalf of any other party or specify that they are binding on successors in interest or assigns.
initially,in accordance with the contracts,sbt purchased metric tons of pig iron.subsequently,however,sbt ceased purchasing pig iron from appellants as required by the contracts and,by october,sbt was in default of the contracts.indeed,in,as the global economy declined,the so called commodities bubble burst,causing many commodities to drop in price by more than a third.see,clifford krauss,commodity prices tumble,times,stating that m etals,like aluminum,copper,and nickel have declined by a third or more.soon thereafter,appellants contacted sbt regarding its non compliance with the contracts and,on november,sbt representative dominic sigrist responded via e mail,stating 
you know our group and it is not our style to walk away from obligations.we will need a long time to work this out together.my message to your group is we are not walking away 
app x at.appellants allege this was a false representation made in furtherance of mende and kundrun fraudulent conveyance scheme,which involved selling sbt assets to a separate entity a shell company owned by mende and kundrun.despite sbt statement that it would not walk away from its obligations,appellants allege they learned through publicly available shipping records that sbt had been purchasing pig iron from other sources.
on september,appellants sent a written notice to sbt stating amounts due from sbt under the contracts and proposing negotiation prior to submitting the contract breach to arbitration before the international chamber of commerce,paris the icc paris.sbt allegedly asked for some time to evaluate the contracts and respond to the offer to negotiate.appellants allege,however,that this was simply a ruse to buy time to allow its alter egos,appellees,to engage in a scheme to leave sbt assetless and unable to pay its some of creditors,including appellants.app x at.
iii.arbitration proceedings,the transfer agreement,and sbt bankruptcy 
when sbt ultimately responded but failed to either provide a settlement proposal or provide an indication that it would perform the contracts,appellants filed a request for arbitration in accordance with the arbitration clause of the contracts with the icc paris on november.soon thereafter,sbt requested an extension of time from the icc paris until february,to answer the request for arbitration.the icc paris granted an extension until january.during this period,appellants allege that sbt,at mende and kundrun direction,formulated and enacted their fraudulent scheme to transfer all of sbt assets to a preexisting shell company owned by mende and kundrun on december.app x at.for example,appellants learned through publicly available records that a swiss entity named prime carbon gmbh prime carbon had begun making significant purchases of pig iron.on january,appellants sent a letter to the icc paris suggesting that sbt appeared to be transferring its business operations and assets to prime carbon.app x at.appellants had discovered that a prime carbon had the same address as sbt parent company amci international b mende was the president of the board of directors of prime carbon c former directors of sbt had become directors of prime carbon and d sbt website was no longer available.ten days later,sbt responded by stating 
sbt does not try to evade from its obligations.
it is true that the website was shut down at the beginning of january.the reason is that sbt first has to analyze its position regarding pending or imminent claims for damages from purchasers as well as against suppliers as well as its financial situation.therefore,sbt has at least temporarily suspended its business activities.please note,however,sbt is still existing and has not resolved to be dissolved and liquidated.
app x at.according to appellants,this letter represents an additional intentional misrepresentation made by appellees to both appellants and the icc paris in order for the appellees to buy time while they effectuate d their plan to make sbt an assetless and judgment proof company.appellants br.at.
indeed,on december,around one month before sbt submitted its answer to appellants request for arbitration and two weeks before sbt sent its letter to the icc paris stating it ha d not resolved to be dissolved and liquidated,appellants allege sbt entered into a transfer agreement with prime carbon.see cbf indústria de gusa amci holdings,civ,wl,at,hereinafter enforcement decision.under this transfer agreement,designated as a single entity succession by the terms of the agreement,prime carbon became sbt successor in interest.sbt transferred nearly all of its assets,valued at approximately million,along with liabilities of approximately million to prime carbon in exchange for.app x at.the transferred assets included sbt ownership stake in primetrade usa its main asset,shares of an aruba llc,insurance policies and physical assets,and bank lines.sbt sole remaining asset after the transfer was a few thousand swiss francs chf.sbt also retained approximately million in liability to appellants and million in liability to another creditor,progress rail.appellants describe the transfer agreement as a turn key operation so that prime carbon could seamlessly assume sbt place in the pig iron market without any contractual obligations to a ppellants.appellants br.at internal quotation marks omitted.
on january,sbt sent letters to a variety of its pig iron suppliers notifying them that 
i as of november,sbt had transferred all goods and the respective title of the goods to prime carbon ii prime carbon was the new and sole owner of the goods iii prime carbon assumes all rights with respect to the transferred goods and iv prime carbon is willing to enter in to all contracts between your company and sbt and to perform under the same conditions.
app x at internal quotation marks omitted.further,the letters advised pig iron suppliers to act from the time being only on the instruction of prime carbon.app x at.according to appellants,sbt,at mende and kundrun direction,used the delay granted by the icc paris to effectuate their plan to transfer sbt assets to a new company ultimately owned by them.appellants br.at.
following the transfer agreement,prime carbon a had at least five of the same directors as sbt b assumed ten of sbt employment contracts c appointed mende to serve as the president of its board of directors and d had,at all times,either the same address as sbt or the same address as amci international.the boards of sbt and prime carbon formally approved the transfer agreement on january,just two days after sbt had informed icc paris that sbt does not try to evade from its obligations and that sbt is still existing and has not resolved to be dissolved and liquidated,app x at,and the same day sbt filed its answer to appellant request for arbitration,app x at.
on april,sbt mysteriously transferred chf to prime carbon.afterward,sbt was left with only chf in assets.the next day,april,sbt filed for bankruptcy in switzerland before the cantonal court of zug.appellants note that,despite having little to no assets following the transfer agreement,sbt waited four months to file for bankruptcy.appellants also contend that the transfer of chf to prime carbon on april,was an intentional act designed to make it impossible for sbt bankruptcy administrator to participate in the arbitration on sbt behalf.appellants,however,admit that none of sbt records provide a contemporaneous explanation for the transfer.appellants br.at.
sbt bankruptcy administrator thereafter sought a stay of the arbitration proceedings pending before the icc paris on june.the icc paris did not initially rule on the request.
iv.the arbitration proceedings 
on june,after appellants became aware of the transfer agreement and after they had made several requests to icc paris to take action with regards to sbt and the assets transferred to prime carbon during the arbitration proceedings,appellants requested that the icc paris grant appellants interim relief to allow appellants to seize up to approximately million of sbt.in their petition,appellants alleged wrongful asset transfers and requested the icc paris grant them relief allowing them to seize assets held by sbt or held in the name of prime carbon.following a hearing,the icc paris ordered appellants to specify the interim relief they sought from sbt.appellants submitted a petition for interim relief on july,and sought an order for sbt to post a guarantee and to provide documents and information regarding its company including its shareholders,its directors,its assets,and its liabilities.in that request and related correspondence,appellants specifically requested that the icc paris r ecognize the existence of fraudulent acts as a basis upon which appellants might reach the assets of related third parties,recognize as illegal the fraud perpetrated by sbt,which shall then be held liable,permitting appellants to pursue their credits against sbt shareholders and managers,by application of the disregard doctrine,recognize these acts taken in the course of the procedure as frauds,and decide upon the interim measures which are necessary to make an upcoming award effective.app x at,internal quotation marks omitted.appellants also asserted that they were pursuing a reasonable relief by means of having their credit duly recognized,as well as the fraud carried out by sbt in the course of the procedure,so that they c ould pierce the corporate veil and make sbt shareholders,directors,and affiliated companies liable for the losses caused to appellants.app x at.
on september,the icc paris held a hearing regarding whether sbt was transferring its assets.sbt neither attended the hearing nor asked for the hearing to be postponed.thereafter,the icc paris sent questions to all parties on september,these questions included inquiries into whether sbt had transferred goods and respective titles of goods to prime carbon ag or to any other company after being notified of the request for arbitration and whether sbt sold,donated,or transferred assets,receivables,or rights to third parties after the date sbt w as notified of the instauration of th e arbitration procedure before the icc paris.app x at.sbt did not provide any response and also did not respond to the icc paris order to provide information of which assets,receivables,and rights have been sold,donated,or somehow transferred to third parties after the date they were notified of the instauration of th e arbitration procedure.app x at.after considering these allegations,the icc paris deferred decision until the merits phase of the arbitration.
as the icc paris did not initially rule on sbt bankruptcy administrator seeking of a stay of the arbitration proceedings in june,the administrator renewed his request for a stay on december.on march,the administrator informed the icc paris that he had determined that sbt had insufficient funds to participate in the arbitration and that the estate and sbt creditors did not wish to defend the claims before the icc paris.the bankruptcy administrator therefore admitted the claims against sbt as well as the damages sought by appellants chf.
on november,the icc paris rendered an arbitral award the award or foreign arbitral award in favor of appellants for plus interest,and granted appellants arbitration costs and legal fees in the amount of.the icc paris did not grant appellants requested relief to reach prime carbon or any other third parties,shareholders,or directors,holding that appellants did not introduce sufficient evidence in the present proceedings to demonstrate the existence of fraud in the bankruptcy proceedings.enforcement decision,wl,at internal quotation marks,brackets,and citation omitted.
v.the action in brazilian courts 
concurrent with its requests for interim relief from the icc paris,appellants also took additional actions in an effort to prevent sbt attempts to flout its contractual obligations.in particular,appellants sought an order in the judicial body of the state of rio de janeiro,second district court of rio de janeiro the brazilian district court,against both sbt and prime carbon to prevent the departure of pig iron from brazilian ports that had been purchased by prime carbon during the pendency of the icc paris arbitration.on march,the brazilian district court granted the preliminary order,finding that 
postponing the adoption of the measures requested by appellants can realistically cause them a serious,irreparable or hardly reparable damage,also taking into account the uncertainty regarding the current economic situation of sbt and prime carbon,considering the fraud that might have been perpetrated in the case at stake.
app x at.sbt and prime carbon appealed the brazilian district court order to the court of justice,thirteenth district court of rio de janeiro the brazilian appeals court.on march,the brazilian appeals court upheld the brazilian district court order because it wa s certain that sbt and prime carbon d id not provide evidence to prove that they have sufficient means for in theory honoring the mentioned debt that appears to be partly acknowledged.app x at.during the week the appeal was pending,however,prime carbon left port with the pig iron cargo and appellants were thereafter unable to secure relief in the brazilian action.
vi.appellants attempts to collect on the arbitral award 
on january,the sbt bankruptcy administrator issued a final report and,on january,sbt bankruptcy was declared closed.because sbt had transferred almost all of its assets to prime carbon,appellants were unable to enforce their award from the icc paris against sbt.when appellants sent notices to sbt related companies,most did not reply and those that replied denied involvement with sbt.appellants allege they were also unable to pursue claims against prime carbon because appellees had transferred prime carbon ownership stake in primetrade usa to amci holdings,a united states company under the ownership of mende and kundrun.
vii.the enforcement action 
on april,appellants filed an action to enforce their foreign arbitral award in the district court for the southern district of new york,seeking to enforce the award against sbt alter egos and successor s in interest as well as to recover on state law fraud claims the enforcement action.app x at.on july,appellees filed a motion to dismiss the enforcement action on the grounds that,among other things,forum in the united states was improper forum non conveniens,that the action was an improper effort to modify the award,and that appellants were precluded from asserting the state law fraud claims because their fraud claims had been denied by the icc paris.appellants assert that while briefing was ongoing in the enforcement action,unbeknownst to appellants,sbt was deleted from the swiss commercial register on september.appellants br.at citing app x at.appellants also allege that appellees never disclosed this fact to the district court in their reply brief or in any of their other motions in the enforcement action.
on april,and again on march,the district court dismissed the enforcement action,holding that appellants could enforce the award only after the award was confirmed in switzerland or another court of competent jurisdiction,and dismissed the state law fraud claims on the basis that appellants were precluded from asserting them.enforcement decision,wl,at,dismissing enforcement action cbf indústria de gusa amci holdings,supp,hereinafter initial order dismissing enforcement claim for failure to file confirmation action and dismissing fraud claims.the district court held that under orion shipping trading,states petroleum,cir,cert.denied,appellants could not pursue enforcement of an arbitral award under the convention for the enforcement and recognition of foreign arbitral awards the new york convention and its implementing legislation,chapter of the federal arbitration act,et,without first confirming the award.enforcement decision,wl,at initial order,supp.at.the district court held that orion required a two step process by which appellants were required to confirm the award prior to seeking enforcement of that award.initial order,supp.at.appellants had proposed a carve out whereby confirmation was not required when confirmation was made impossible by appellees alleged fraudulent acts.see enforcement decision,wl,at.appellants argued in support that the confirmation prerequisite should not apply where alter ego defendants,through their own intentional wrongdoing,foreclosed any opportunity to confirm the award.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the district court rejected appellants argument,reasoning that this proposed exception would undermine the twin goals of arbitration,namely,settling disputes efficiently and avoiding long and expensive litigation.id.at quoting encyclopaedia universalis encyclopaedia britannica,cir.
the district court also dismissed appellants five causes of action for fraud on the basis that the claims sought a remedy previously sought by appellants in the icc a rbitration and therefore were barred under a theory of issue preclusion.initial order,supp.at.the district court observed that,as it sat in secondary jurisdiction with regard to appellants arbitral award,it could not modify that award either during the enforcement of the award or pursuant to appellants fraud based causes of action.enforcement decision,wl,at citing initial order,supp.at initial order,supp.at.
viii.the confirmation action 
in response to the district court initial ruling that orion required appellants to confirm their award prior to seeking its enforcement,appellants initiated an action on april,to confirm the arbitral award in the same district court the confirmation action.as a legal entity,however,sbt was effectively a nullity after it was deleted from the swiss commercial register.see peter forstmoser et,swiss company law,n a practical effect is,however,had by the striking of the corporation from the register,as this means the corporation is no longer able to act externally it is no longer able to be sued or have debt collection proceedings filed against it.italics in original.as a result,the district court held that,under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,sbt lacked capacity to be sued because it was no longer a corporate entity according to swiss law.cbf indústria de gusa steel base trade ag,civ,wl,at,hereinafter confirmation decision.
the district court also held that appellees were not judicially estopped from asserting sbt lack of capacity as a defense.appellants had argued that appellees asserted repeatedly that switzerland and france provided adequate forums for appellants claims against sbt and,indeed,were the proper forums for this action,thereby estopping appellees from arguing sbt lacked capacity to be sued in any fora.confirmation decision,wl,at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court noted that,under second circuit precedent,a party may be judicially estopped from asserting a position if the party took an inconsistent position in a prior proceeding and that position was adopted by the first tribunal in some manner,such as by rendering a favorable judgment.id.quoting holtz rockefeller,cir.and citing mitchell washingtonville cent.sch,cir.the district court noted that t he purposes of the doctrine are to preserve the sanctity of the oath and to protect judicial integrity by avoiding the risk of inconsistent results in two proceedings.id.quoting mitchell,at.but the district court held that,because the enforcement action was not dismissed on the grounds of forum non conveniens,the second prong of holtz did not apply and appellees were therefore not judicially estopped from making the argument that sbt presently lacked capacity to be sued.id.at.
appellants timely filed their appeals from both the enforcement decision and the confirmation decision.in their consolidated appeals,appellants argue,in relevant part,that the district court erred in holding that orion shipping trading,at,required appellants to confirm their foreign arbitral award prior to enforcement the district court erred in dismissing appellants fraud claims on the basis of issue preclusion and the district court erred in determining that equitable estoppel did not preclude appellees from using sbt immunity from suit as a basis for dismissing the confirmation action.
appellees contest each of appellants arguments and further argue in response that this court should affirm the district court dismissal of appellants enforcement action and confirmation action on the alternative grounds of forum non conveniens and international comity.
discussion 
i.the district court erred in holding appellants were required to confirm their foreign arbitral award prior to enforcementa.standard of review 
this court review s a district court legal interpretations of the new york convention as well as its contract interpretation de novo findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.vrg linhas aereas matlinpatterson glob.opportunities partners ii,cir.citations omitted.
this action arises under the united nations convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,june.the united states acceded to the new york convention on september,and it entered into force in the united states on december.recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,june,hereinafter convention.
the new york convention only applies to the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards made in the territory of a state other than the state where the recognition and enforcement of such awards are sought and to arbitral awards not considered as domestic awards in the state where their recognition and enforcement are sought.convention,art.i.according to the restatement third of the law of international commercial arbitration,an arbitral award is made in the country of the arbitral seat,which is the jurisdiction designated by the parties or by an entity empowered to do so on their behalf to be the juridical home of the arbitration.restatement third of the law of int l commercial arbitration s,aa am.law,tentative draft.thus,the new york convention applies to arbitral awards made in a foreign country that a party seeks to enforce in the united states known as foreign arbitral awards,to arbitral awards made in the united states that a party seeks to enforce in a different country,and to nondomestic arbitral awards that a party seeks to enforce in the united states.see,restatement third of the law of int l commercial arbitration i,k,o am.law,tentative draft.
here,the parties set the seat of the arbitration as the icc paris in paris,france.the arbitral award which appellants seek to enforce was rendered by the icc paris under french law.initial order,supp.at.the parties are thus correct that the new york convention governs this case as a matter of international arbitration law.since the arbitral award was made in france while recognition and enforcement is sought in the southern district of new york,this litigation presents a classic case of a foreign arbitral award.
under the new york convention,the country in which the award is made is said to have primary jurisdiction over the arbitration award.karaha bodas,perusahaan pertambangan minyak dan gas bumi negara,cir.internal quotation marks omitted hereinafter karaha bodas cir.the new york convention specifically contemplates that the state in which,or under the law of which,an award is made,will be free to set aside or modify an award in accordance with its domestic arbitral law and its full panoply of express and implied grounds for relief.yusuf ahmed alghanim sons toys r us,cir.citing convention,art.v e.here,that country is france because the parties agreed to arbitrate before the icc paris.all other signatory states are secondary jurisdictions,in which parties can only contest whether that state should enforce the arbitral award.karaha bodas,at citation omitted.c ourts in countries of secondary jurisdiction may refuse enforcement only on the limited grounds specified in article v of the new york convention.id.citation omitted yusuf ahmed alghanim sons,at t he new york convention is equally clear that when an action for enforcement is brought in a foreign state,the state may refuse to enforce the award only on the grounds explicitly set forth in article v of the new york convention.the district court here sits in secondary jurisdiction with respect to the foreign arbitral award at issue.initial order,supp.at.
chapter of the federal arbitration act faa,et,implements the united states obligations under the new york convention.see scherk alberto culver.section provides that original jurisdiction for a n action or proceeding falling under the new york convention lies in the united states federal district courts.under section,actions or proceedings that fall under the new york convention include arbitration agreement s or arbitral award s arising out of a legal relationship,whether contractual or not,which is considered as commercial between any parties,unless both parties are citizens of the united states and that relationship involves neither property located abroad,nor envisages performance or enforcement abroad,n or has some other reasonable relation with one or more foreign states.as the instant case involves non citizens all of the appellants,for example,are brazilian corporate entities this case properly falls under chapter of the faa as well as under the new york convention.
the goal of the new york convention,and the principal purpose underlying american adoption and implementation of it,was to encourage the recognition and enforcement of commercial arbitration agreements in international contracts and to unify the standards by which agreements to arbitrate are observed and arbitral awards are enforced in the signatory countries.scherk,at citations omitted.thus,both the new york convention and its implementing legislation in chapter of the faa envision a single step process for reducing a foreign arbitral award to a domestic judgment.amicus curiae memorandum br.at.
under the new york convention,this process of reducing a foreign arbitral award to a judgment is referred to as recognition and enforcement.convention,arts.iii,iv,recognition is the determination that an arbitral award is entitled to preclusive effect enforcement is the reduction to a judgment of a foreign arbitral award as contrasted with a nondomestic arbitral award,discussed below.restatement third of the law of int l commercial arbitration l,z am.law,tentative draft.recognition and enforcement occur together,as one process,under the new york convention.convention,arts.iii,iv,
chapter of the faa implements this scheme through section,which provides that any party may,w ithin three years after an arbitral award is made,apply to any court having jurisdiction under this chapter for an order confirming the award.additionally,chapter of the faa provides that t he court shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the new york convention at article.read in context with the new york convention,it is evident that the term confirm as used in section is the equivalent of recognition and enforcement as used in the new york convention for the purposes of foreign arbitral awards.as the united states as amicus curiae explained,the confirmation proceeding under chapter two of the faa fulfills the united states obligation under the new york convention to provide procedures for recognition and enforcement of new york convention arbitral awards.amicus curiae memorandum br.at.a single proceeding,therefore,facilitate s the enforcement of arbitration awards by enabling parties to enforce them in third countries without first having to obtain either confirmation of such awards or leave to enforce them from a court in the country of the arbitral situs.karaha bodas,perusahaan pertambangan minyak dan gas bumi negara,cir.footnote omitted.
this,in fact,was the entire purpose of the new york convention,which succeeded and replaced the convention on the execution of foreign arbitral awards geneva convention.yusuf ahmed alghanim sons,at.the primary defect of the geneva convention was that it required an award first to be recognized in the rendering state before it could be enforced abroad.id.citation omitted.this was known as the double exequatur requirement,and the new york convention did away with it by eradicating the requirement that a court in the rendering state recognize an award before it could be taken and enforced abroad.id.citations omitted stating that the new york convention intentionally liberalized procedures for enforcing foreign arbitral awards internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
for the sake of completeness and in an effort to dispel confusion in this area,we will briefly discuss the components of and process for a nondomestic arbitral award.
as noted above,in addition to covering foreign arbitral awards awards made in one country for which enforcement is sought in another,such as the arbitral award at issue here,the new york convention also applies to arbitral awards not considered as domestic awards in the state where their recognition and enforcement are sought.convention,art.i.under second circuit precedent,a nondomestic arbitral award is an award that is made in the united states because the parties agreed to arbitrate before an arbitrator in the united states,but which nonetheless falls under the new york convention and chapter of the faa for one of two reasons it was made within the legal framework of another country,pronounced in accordance with foreign law,bergesen joseph muller,cir,or it was decided under the laws of the united states but involves either entities that are not citizens or,even if only citizens are involved,also involves property located abroad,or envisages performance or enforcement abroad,or has some other reasonable relation with one or more foreign states.see yusuf ahmed alghanim sons,at noting t he seventh circuit similarly has interpreted section to mean that any commercial arbitral agreement,unless it is between two united states citizens,involves property located in the united states,and has no reasonable relationship with one or more foreign states,falls under the new york convention internal quotation marks and citations omitted.these types of awards are sometimes referred to as bergesen awards or convention awards we will use the term nondomestic arbitral award for the sake of precision.
as a nondomestic arbitral award is made in the united states,a federal district court sits in primary jurisdiction over a nondomestic arbitral award.see karaha bodas,at.the process by which a nondomestic arbitral award is reduced to a judgment of the court by a federal court under its primary jurisdiction is called confirmation.restatement third of the law of int l commercial arbitration g am.law,tentative draft.under its primary jurisdiction in a confirmation proceeding,the district court is,as this court has recognized,free to set aside or modify an award in accordance with its domestic arbitral law and its full panoply of express and implied grounds for relief.yusuf ahmed alghanim sons,at citing convention,art.v e see also id.the confirmation of an arbitration award is a summary proceeding that merely makes what is already a final arbitration award a judgment of the court.internal quotation marks,brackets,and citation omitted.once a nondomestic arbitral award has been confirmed,it becomes a court judgment and is enforceable and entitled to full faith and credit in any other court in the united states.see const.art iv,see also hatzlachh supply,moishe elecs,supp,noting domestic arbitral award must be confirmed before it is enforceable.
accordingly,the district court erred in holding that appellants were required to confirm their foreign arbitral award before they would be allowed to enforce it.the new york convention and chapter of the faa require only that the award creditor of a foreign arbitral award file one action in a federal district court to enforce the foreign arbitral award against the award debtor.see yusuf ahmed alghanim sons,at.orion shipping trading,a pre new york convention decision under chapter of the faa and involving what would today be considered a nondomestic arbitral award,does not mandate a different result.at.chapter of the faa,which generally covers domestic arbitral awards that do not fall under the new york convention,applies to actions and proceedings brought under chapter only to the extent that chapter is not in conflict with chapter or the new york convention as ratified by the united states.to the extent,then,that a confirmation proceeding is required for nondomestic arbitral awards,such a procedure would be in conflict with the single step procedure mandated by chapter and the new york convention for foreign arbitral awards.
none of the other cases the district court cites are to the contrary.like orion shipping trading,productos merchantiles e industriales,faberge usa,cir,overseas private investment marine shipping,civ,wl,and sea eagle maritime,hanan int l,civ,wl,all involve nondomestic arbitral awards over which the federal district court sits in primary jurisdiction rather than secondary jurisdiction.see productos,at arbitration occurred in new york overseas private,wl,at parties agreed to arbitration in washington,under the rules of the american arbitration association sea eagle,wl,at noting parties agreed to arbitration in new york.on the other hand,one of the cases cited by the district court arbitration between monegasque de reassurances nak naftogaz of ukraine,cir.hereinafter monde re did involve a foreign arbitral award.there,however,although the award creditor had sought confirmation of the foreign award,this circuit never held that such confirmation was a necessary precondition to enforcement of a foreign arbitral award because the circuit never reached the substantive contentions of the parties,instead dismissing the action on an alternative ground.id.at.
the confusion regarding whether parties need to confirm a foreign arbitral award is understandable because section uses the term confirm to describe the process by which a district court acts under its secondary jurisdiction to recognize and enforce a foreign arbitral award.see,vrg linhas,at employing the term confirm as it is used in to describe the process by which the district court sat in secondary jurisdiction over a foreign arbitral award.the restatement third of the law of international commercial arbitration indicates that the proper term for the single step process in which a federal district court engages when it sits in secondary jurisdiction over a foreign arbitral award is enforcement,in contrast to the process in which a federal district court engages when it sits in primary jurisdiction over a nondomestic arbitral award,which is called confirmation.restatement third of the law of int l commercial arbitration g,l am.law,tentative draft.in order to avoid such confusion in the future,we encourage litigants and district courts alike to take care to specify explicitly the type of arbitral award the district court is evaluating domestic,nondomestic,or foreign,whether the district court is sitting in primary or secondary jurisdiction,and,accordingly,whether the action seeks confirmation of a domestic or nondomestic arbitral award under the district court primary jurisdiction or enforcement of a foreign arbitral award under its secondary jurisdiction.
applicable law for an enforcement action 
here,appellants properly sought to have the district court enforce a foreign arbitral award under its secondary jurisdiction.on remand,therefore,we instruct the district court to evaluate appellants enforcement action,particularly appellants effort to reach appellees as alter egos of sbt,under the standards set out in the new york convention and chapter of the faa.
the new york convention provides that r ecognition and enforcement of a foreign arbitral award may be refused only if the requesting party furnishes to the competent authority where the recognition and enforcement is sought,proof that one of five enumerated conditions has been met.convention,art.v.here,the competent authority is the federal district court to which the award creditor has applied for enforcement.see.the five conditions laid out under the new york convention are 
a the parties to the arbitration agreement referred to in article ii of the new york convention were,under the law applicable to them,under some incapacity,or the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or,failing any indication thereon,under the law of the country where the award was made or 
b the party against whom the award is invoked was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case or 
c the award deals with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration,or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration,provided that,if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted,that part of the award which contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration may be recognized and enforced or 
d the composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties,or,failing such agreement,was not in accordance with the law of the country where the arbitration took place or 
e the award has not yet become binding on the parties,or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which,or under the law of which,that award was made.
convention,art.v italics in original.the burden of proving any one of these five conditions rests with the party challenging the arbitral award,here appellees.id.
the new york convention also states that the federal district court,as the competent authority,may refuse to enforce the foreign arbitral award if the court determines that a t he subject matter of the difference is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of the united states or b t he recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of the united states.convention,art.v italics in original.
the new york convention additionally provides that a signatory state shall recognize arbitral awards as binding and enforce them in accordance with the rules of procedure of the territory where the award is relied upon,under the conditions laid down in the following articles.convention,art.iii.the new york convention clarifies that this means that t here shall not be imposed substantially more onerous conditions or higher fees or charges on the recognition or enforcement of arbitral awards to which this convention applies than are imposed on the recognition or enforcement of domestic arbitral awards.id.
this court has previously held that the question of whether a non signatory may have a foreign arbitral judgment enforced against it by a federal district court sitting in secondary jurisdiction falls under the first category by which a federal district court could refuse to enforce a foreign arbitral award of its own volition the subject matter of the difference is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of the country in which enforcement is sought.vrg linhas,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted see convention,art.v a.
this court has also explained,based on supreme court precedent,that there are three questions involved in determining this issue whether the federal district court or the arbitrator is to decide question whether the merits of the dispute are to be arbitrated or decided by the court the question of arbitrability and the merits of the dispute.vrg linhas,at citing first options of,kaplan.the second question of w hether a given dispute is arbitrable and the resulting award enforceable is a question to be decided under united states arbitration law.so too is the first question of who shall decide a dispute arbitrability.id.citing sarhank grp.oracle,cir.
regarding the first question,we have further explained questions of arbitrability are to be sent to arbitration if and only if the parties clearly and unmistakably expressed their intention to do so.id.at citing first options,at,and howsam dean witter reynolds.thus a court must begin by deciding whether the parties before it clearly and unmistakably committed to arbitrate questions regarding the scope of their arbitration agreement.id.at.if but only if the answer is no,the court must then proceed to determine on its own whether the parties dispute falls within the scope of their agreement to arbitrate.id.
when deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter including arbitrability,courts generally should apply ordinary state law principles that govern the formation of contracts.first options,at citations omitted.courts,however,should not assume that the parties intended to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is clear and unmistakable evidence that they did so.id.internal quotation marks,brackets,and citations omitted.this standard for the first question differs from the standard applicable to the second question.for the second question,courts look to general principles of contract law,and will find an agreement to arbitrate when the totality of the evidence supports an objective intention to agree to arbitrate.sarhank,at.
accordingly,on remand,the district court must first consider whether the contracts,which gave rise to the foreign arbitral award at issue in the instant appeal,provide clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties to the contracts agreed to have an arbitrator decide whether they decided to arbitrate the question of whether a nonsignatory could be bound to an award under the contracts.if the district court determines that the parties to the contracts did agree to have an arbitrator decide whether they agreed to arbitrate the question of whether a nonsignatory can be bound,then the district court must refuse to decide the issue.if,on the other hand,the district court determines that the parties to the contracts did not agree to have an arbitrator decide whether they agreed to arbitrate that question,then the district court must,proceeding to the second question of first options,determine whether,under general principles of contract law,the contracts state that the question of whether a nonsignatory can be bound is,in fact,to be arbitrated.if the district court determines the contracts require the question to be arbitrated,then the question must go to the arbitrator.if,however,the district court determines that the question of whether a nonsignatory can be bound was not required to be arbitrated under the contracts,then the district court must turn to the merits of that question.
in case the district court reaches the merits,a determination on which we express no opinion,we provide the following guidance on the issue,which is not meant to be exhaustive.this court has previously held that a nonsignatory party may be bound to an arbitration agreement if so dictated by the ordinary principles of contract and agency.thomson csf,am.arbitration ass n,cir.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.these principles include incorporation by reference assumption agency veil ego and estoppel.smith enron cogeneration,smith cogeneration int l,cir.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.determinations under these principles,especially the veil ego principle raised in the instant case,are often fact specific and differ with the circumstances of each case.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.nonetheless,courts will apply the veil ego theory of liability in two broad situations to prevent fraud or other wrong,or where a parent dominates and controls a subsidiary.thomson csf,at citations omitted.
we leave further legal and factual development of these issues to the district court on remand.

the district court dismissed appellants five causes of action for fraud on the basis that these claims sought a remedy previously sought by appellants in the icc arbitration and are therefore barred.initial order,supp.at citations omitted.
we understand the district court finding to be one of as issue preclusion,that appellants,having already had a full and fair opportunity to litigate their fraud claims and having received an unfavorable determination from the icc paris,are not permitted to relitigate the issue in the federal district court in an attempt to achieve a more favorable outcome.see kulak city of new york,cir.
it is settled law that the doctrine of issue preclusion is applicable to issues resolved by an earlier arbitration.khandhar elfenbein,cir.internal quotation marks,brackets,and citations omitted.the mere fact,however,that an issue appears to have been resolved by an earlier arbitration does not necessarily mean that issue preclusion applies.an arbitration decision may effect issue preclusion in a later litigation only if the proponent can show with clarity and certainty that the same issues were resolved.bear,stearns,ontario,cir.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
issue preclusion is permissible as to a given issue if the identical issue was raised in a previous proceeding the issue was actually litigated and decided in the previous proceeding the party had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue the resolution of the issue was necessary to support a valid and final judgment on the merits and application of the doctrine is fair.
id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the second circuit,applying new york law,has further instructed district courts to consider the following factors in determining whether a party has had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in a prior action 
the size of the claim,the forum of the prior litigation,the use of initiative,the extent of the litigation,the competence and experience of counsel,the availability of new evidence,indications of a compromise verdict,differences in the applicable law,and foreseeability of future litigation.

because issue preclusion is an equitable doctrine,the second circuit and federal courts adhere to the maxim that h e who comes into equity must come with clean hands.keystone driller excavator.this principle,known as the doctrine of unclean hands,is that the equitable powers of this court can never be exerted o n behalf of one who has acted fraudulently,or who by deceit or any unfair means has gained an advantage.to aid a party in such a case would make this court the abettor of iniquity.pennecom merrill lynch,cir.internal quotation marks,brackets,and citations omitted.
here,appellants argue that they were denied a full and fair opportunity to litigate the merits of their fraud claims due to appellees fraud and misconduct before the icc paris.specifically,appellants claim that appellees misled the icc paris as to the extent of the fraud committed by appellees,thereby leading the icc paris to issue an unfavorable decision on the issue which appellees now seek to enforce for purposes of issue preclusion.
appellants allegations against appellees are very similar to those made in pennecom,at.there,pennecom alleged that merrill lynch devised a fraudulent scheme to dupe the arbitrators which led to a decision unfavorable to pennecom regarding the extent of loss incurred by pennecom under the arbitrated contract.id.at.the district court determined that collateral estoppel barred pennecom from relitigating the extent of its loss under the contract.id.
