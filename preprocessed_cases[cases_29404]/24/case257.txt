background 
bell was an employee of cendant predecessor,cuc international,from to january,serving as executive vice president,chief financial officer,and treasurer.from early until his departure,while bell was chief financial officer,the terms and conditions of his employment with cuc were governed by an employment contract,last amended in november the employment agreement.the employment agreement,governed by connecticut law,contained an indemnification clause providing that cendant would indemnify bell for costs related to litigation in which he was involved as a director and officer,and reimburse him for costs incurred in litigation with the company if the action was concluded in bell favor.
after bell ceased working as chief financial officer in february,he continued to work for cuc as a consultant,reporting to the company chief executive and president.the consulting relationship was reflected in a special adviser agreement adviser agreement,dated december and effective through february,that expressly supercede d any prior employment agreement between bell and cendant.it contained,and provisions the provisions,a connecticut choice of law provision,and a broadly worded arbitration clause.the arbitration clause provided that a ny controversy arising in connection with or relating to this agreement,any stock options granted to the executive bell,the executive employment or any services to be provided hereunder,or any other matter or thing,shall be determined and settled by arbitration,in accordance with the rules of the american arbitration association emphasis added.the clause contained an exception allowing cendant to sue in court for injunctive relief arising out of bell violation of the adviser agreement.
in april,following a merger of cuc and hfs incorporated to form cendant,an internal investigation uncovered accounting irregularities at cuc.public disclosure of these irregularities led to a significant decline in the price of cendant stock and triggered numerous securities class actions by purchasers of cuc and cendant securities.a parallel investigation by the securities and exchange commission the sec discovered the existence of a fraudulent accounting scheme at cuc beginning in and running through april.the sec found that the scheme was devised to inflate cuc operating income and was driven by cuc senior management determination that cuc would always meet the earnings expectations of wall street analysts and fueled by disregard for any obligation that the earnings reported need to be real.in re cendant,exchange act release,wl,at june.cendant alleges that bell was involved in and shared responsibility for these accounting irregularities,which spanned the period of both of his agreements with cendant.

i.who decides arbitrability 
this court review of whether the issue of arbitrability is for the court or for the arbitrator is de novo.john hancock life ins.wilson,cir see also abram landau real estate benova,cir this court reviews de novo a final district court order compelling arbitration.there is a strong federal policy favoring arbitration as an alternative means of dispute resolution.oldroyd elmira sav.bank,fsb,cir citation omitted.the federal arbitration act,et,creates a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability,applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the act.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.because an agreement to arbitrate is a creature of contract,however,the ultimate question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is determined by state law.as the supreme court stated in first options of chicago,kaplan,d,w hen deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter including arbitrability,courts generally should apply ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts.see also prima paint flood conklin,d purpose of the federal arbitration act was to make arbitration agreements as enforceable as other contracts,but not more so.
where the scope of an arbitration agreement is ambiguous,the federal arbitration act policy favoring arbitration requires that any doubts be resolved in favor of arbitration.moses cone,at.but where the ambiguity relates to who determines is,the arbitrability of the question of act presumption is reversed and a court ordinarily decides the question.painewebber bybyk,cir citing first options,at.parties to an arbitration agreement may provide that the arbitrator,not the court,shall determine whether an issue is arbitrable.id.at.but the issue of arbitrability may only be referred to the arbitrator if there is clear and unmistakable evidence from the arbitration agreement,as construed by the relevant state law,that the parties intended that the question of arbitrability shall be decided by the arbitrator.id.at.emphasis added quoting first options,at.here,the parties agree that the relevant state law is the law of connecticut.
bell argues that there is a distinction between arbitration law and contract law,and that the district court should have looked only to general principles of connecticut contract law in conjunction with first options in determining who should decide arbitrability.we fail to see the distinction between arbitration law and contract law.as bell acknowledges,arbitration is a creature of contract,and a person may only be compelled to arbitrate a dispute to the extent that he has agreed to do so.see,communications workers of,d white kampner.thus,the intent of the parties,as evidenced by their contractual language,determines whether arbitrability is a determination for the court or for the arbitrator.int l marine holdings,stauff,citing emcon pegnataro.the connecticut supreme court decision in city of bridgeport bridgeport police local,upon which the district court relied in finding that bell and cendant had agreed to arbitrate the issue of arbitrability,exemplifies
