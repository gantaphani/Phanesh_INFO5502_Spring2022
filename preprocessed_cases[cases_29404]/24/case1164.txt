background 
patent license agreement 
interdigital and lg entered into a wireless patent license agreement agreement in january in the agreement,interdigital granted lg a license to certain interdigital patents with respect to devices capable of wireless voice or data communications,including devices designed to operate in accordance with wireless standards,gsm,gprs,and edge and devices designed to operate in accordance with wireless standards,wcdma and.the agreement refers to the licensed products generally as licensed terminal units and to the licensed products more specifically as gsm licensed terminal units.see agreement defining terminal unit,defining licensed terminal units,defining licensed standards,defining gsm licensed terminal unit section,the grant clause,provides in full as follows

ii.discussion 
the threshold question we must consider is whether this court has the power to entertain interdigital appeal.our jurisdictional statute,broadly provides this court with exclusive jurisdiction to hear appeals of any final determinations of the united states international trade commission relating to unfair practices in import trade,made under section of the tariff act of.a.section,in turn,lists various itc determinations for which a party may seek review with this court,along with the sections of the administrative procedure act that govern such review 
any person adversely affected by a final determination of the commission under subsection d,e,f,or g of this section may appeal such determination,within days after the determination becomes final,to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit for review in accordance with chapter of title.notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection,commission determinations under subsections d,e,f,and g of this section with respect to its findings on the public health and welfare,competitive conditions in the united states economy,the production of like or directly competitive articles in the united states,and united states consumers,the amount and nature of bond,or the appropriate remedy shall be reviewable in accordance with section of title.determinations by the commission under subsections e,f,and j of this section with respect to forfeiture of bonds and under subsection h of this section with respect to the imposition of sanctions for abuse of discovery or abuse of process shall also be reviewable in accordance with section of title.
relevant to this appeal is the language in c providing a right to appeal a final determination of the commission under subsection d,e,f,or g of this section.the recited subsections govern exclusion orders,id.d e,cease and desist orders,id.f,and exclusion orders based on default,id.g.
lg and the itc argue primarily that we lack jurisdiction because the order terminating the investigation as to lg was not a final determination of the commission under subsection d,e,f,or g.rather,according to lg and the itc,the itc terminated the investigated under subsection c,which provides that 
the commission shall determine,with respect to each investigation conducted by it under this section,whether or not there is a violation of this section,except that the commission may,by issuing a consent order or on the basis of an agreement between the private parties to the investigation,including an agreement to present the matter for arbitration,terminate any such investigation,in whole or in part,without making such a determination.
id.c.lg and the itc maintain,therefore,that interdigital has no right to appeal the itc order to this court.before addressing the parties arguments,we will provide some background on c.
this court predecessor,the court of customs and patent appeals,provided a framework for analyzing whether an itc order is appealable under c.see import motors,int l trade comm n,in import motors,the court explained that s trictly interpreted,the phrase final determination of the commission under subsection d or e in c refers to a final administrative decision on the merits,excluding or refusing to exclude articles from entry under subsection d or e.id.at emphasis added.despite this strict interpretation,however,the court acknowledged that appealable orders were not necessarily limited to final decisions on the merits.more specifically,the court framed the inquiry as whether an itc order is intrinsically a final determination under c,as amended,and if it is not,whether its effect upon appellants is the equivalent of a final determination.id.the court reasoned that an order terminating participation in itc proceedings could have the same operative effect,in terms of economic impact as a final determination under subsections d,e,f,or g.id.at.substance,not form,must control.id.
in block international trade commission,this court applied the framework from import motors in an appeal from an itc order terminating an investigation as abated because the patent claims that formed the basis for the alleged violation were substantially amended during reexamination proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office.in finding that the appellant had no right to appeal,we held that the itc order was not intrinsically a final determination under subsections d,e,or f because the itc did not rule on the merits and thus did not exclude or refuse to exclude articles from entry under d,e,or f.id.at.we further held that the itc order was not the equivalent of a final determination because the itc termination was without prejudice,explaining that appellant is free to request a second investigation under b based on the reexamined claims id.
this court distinguished block in farrel international trade commission.in farrel,as we do in this case,we reviewed an itc order terminating an investigation on the basis of an arbitration agreement between the parties.we held that we had jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to a and c because unlike in block,in which the itc dismissal was without prejudice to request a second investigation,and the court held that the dismissal was neither intrinsically a final determination nor the equivalent of a final determination,in farrel,the dismissal was with prejudice and,since petitioner can not request reopening,must be considered a final determination.id.at.
after finding jurisdiction,the court in farrel addressed whether the itc properly terminated the investigation without first determining whether there was a violation of.the version of c in effect at that time permitted the itc to terminate an investigation without making such a determination only by issuing a consent order or on the basis of a settlement agreement.id.at.because an arbitration agreement did not fall within the statutory exceptions in c,the court concluded that the itc improperly terminated the investigation.id.at.
in,in response to farrel,congress amended c by striking a settlement agreement and inserting an agreement between the private parties to the investigation,including an agreement to present the matter for arbitration.uruguay round agreements act,a a,stat.this language survives to this day.thus,c now permits the itc to terminate an investigation based on an arbitration agreement without determining whether there is a violation of.
against this historical backdrop,we now address the parties arguments.lg and the itc argue that under the plain language of c,there is no right to appeal an itc order terminating an investigation on the basis of an arbitration agreement.they note that c provides a right to appeal a final determination of the commission under subsection d,e,f,or g,and that the itc terminated the investigation as to lg under the language added to subsection c in the wake of farrel to allow for termination on the basis of an agreement between the private parties to the investigation,including an agreement to present the matter for arbitration.they view c as only permitting appeals of decisions made on the merits as to whether a violation of has occurred.they conclude that the itc termination under subsection c is not a final determination under subsection d,e,f,or g and thus is not appealable.
we find,however,that the reading of c urged by lg and the itc,permitting appeals only of final decisions on the merits,is overly restrictive.it contravenes import motors and its progeny,which establish that a party may appeal an itc order that is not a final decision on the merits if its effect upon appellants is the equivalent of a final determination.import motors,at.their view of the statute also disregards the general rule that judicial review will not be precluded on the sole ground that specific procedures for judicial review of a particular agency action are not spelled out in a statute.allied int l trade comm n,see also traynor turnage,we have repeatedly acknowledged the strong presumption that congress intends judicial review of administrative action.the presumption in favor of judicial review may be overcome only upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence of a contrary legislative intent.quoting bowen.acad.of family physicians,and abbott labs.gardner,in addition,the language of c indicates that when congress amended the statute to permit the itc to terminate an investigation on the basis of an agreement between the private parties to the investigation,including an agreement to present the matter for arbitration,it was envisioning a situation where the parties indisputably agreed to arbitrate not a situation like the present case,where there is a serious disagreement as to whether the dispute is subject to arbitration.
because the itc order terminating the investigation in favor of arbitration was not a determination on the merits under d,e,f,or g,the pertinent question is whether the effect of the itc order is the equivalent of a final determination.as discussed above,in farrel,we found an order terminating an investigation in favor of arbitration to be an appealable final determination because the dismissal was with prejudice and the petitioner could not request reopening.farrel,at.
the itc argues that this case is unlike farrel because the effect of the dismissal depends on the decision of the arbitrator.itc br.the alj terminated the investigation in favor of allowing an arbitrator to determine whether the dispute between interdigital and lg is subject to arbitration.the itc notes that i f the arbitrator decides that the matter is not subject to the arbitration provision,interdigital can its complaint against lg before the commission.id.in essence,the itc argument is that because interdigital may be able to its complaint against lg at some point in the future,the order terminating the investigation is not final.
we disagree.it is true that interdigital may be able to bring its claims against lg in the itc again in the future.on the other hand,it may not.moreover,interdigital contends without contradiction from the other parties that even if it ultimately succeeds in convincing the arbitrators that its claims against lg are not subject to arbitration,it will not be able to reopen the terminated investigation.instead,it will have to file a new complaint.and unlike in block,where the patent owner could file a new complaint immediately,interdigital will have to await the outcome of the proceeding before the arbitrators to find out whether it can file a new complaint.until the arbitrators determine whether interdigital claims are subject to arbitration,any new complaint interdigital filed would also be terminated in favor of arbitration.in the meantime,lg may continue to import devices that allegedly infringe interdigital asserted patents.the order therefore has the same operative effect,in terms of economic impact as a final determination.import motors,at.
our conclusion is further supported by legislative history.when congress amended c after farrel to permit the itc to terminate investigations on the basis of arbitration agreements,the senate report explained that b y according deference to arbitration agreements,this amendment is intended to bring itc practice under section into closer conformity with district court practice under the federal arbitration act faa,at.the faa permits an appeal to be taken from a final decision with respect to an arbitration,but not from an interlocutory order staying the action or compelling arbitration.a,b,b.
supreme court and other precedent likewise support our conclusion.in green tree financial randolph,the supreme court held that a district court order dismissing an action in favor of arbitration under the faa is an appealable final decision.id.at.following green tree,the regional circuits have uniformly held that a district court order dismissing an action in favor of arbitration,without prejudice to after the completion of arbitration,is also an appealable final decision.see,hill rent a,cir finding appellate jurisdiction over a district court dismissal without prejudice in favor of arbitration westlake styrene trading,app x cir same mccaskill sci mgmt,cir same blair scott specialty gases,cir same salim oleochemicals shropshire,cir same interactive flight,swissair swiss air transp,cir same.
accordingly,we hold that the order terminating the investigation as to lg was an appealable final determination under c and that we therefore have jurisdiction under a.
we now turn to the merits.the alj analyzed lg motion to terminate the investigation under the framework outlined in our opinion in qualcomm.that case involved an appeal from a district court order on a motion to stay the district court action pending arbitration pursuant to section of the faa.we held that when presented with a motion to stay pending arbitration,the district court should first inquire as to who has the primary power to decide arbitrability under the parties agreement.qualcomm,at.if the parties did not clearly and unmistakably intend to delegate arbitrability decisions to an arbitrator,the district court should undertake a full arbitrability inquiry.id.on the other hand,if the parties to the agreement did clearly and unmistakably intend to delegate the power to decide arbitrability to an arbitrator,then the court should perform a second,more limited inquiry to determine whether the assertion of arbitrability is wholly groundless.id.if the assertion of arbitrability is not wholly groundless,then the district court should stay the action pending a ruling on arbitrability by an arbitrator.id.but if it is wholly groundless,then the district court should deny the request for a stay.we further instructed 
i n undertaking the wholly groundless inquiry,the district court should look to the scope of the arbitration clause and the precise issues that the moving party asserts are subject to arbitration.because any inquiry beyond a wholly groundless test would invade the province of the arbitrator,whose arbitrability judgment the parties agreed to abide by,the district court need not,and should not,determine whether the moving party defenses are in fact arbitrable.
in this case,in a conclusion not challenged on appeal,the alj first determined that the parties clearly and unmistakably intended to delegate the question of arbitrability to an arbitrator.initial determination at.the alj then turned to the question of whether lg request for arbitration was wholly groundless.the alj agreed with lg position that the wholly groundless inquiry does not extend to the merits of lg license defense.id.at.the alj then found that lg assertion of arbitrability was not wholly groundless,stating 
the undersigned finds that lg has met the low threshold of demonstrating that its arbitration claim is not wholly groundless.lg claims that it has a continuing license for the accused products under the terms of the agreement,a dispute arising under the agreement.interdigital and the staff argue that lg motion to terminate should be dismissed because the text of the agreement does not support lg license defense,but such a determination on the merits will be addressed and resolved by the arbitrator.
id.citations omitted.as a result,the alj terminated the investigation as to lg 
interdigital argues that the alj erred by failing to assess the text of the parties agreement to determine whether lg assertion of arbitrability was wholly groundless.we agree.
in qualcomm,we explained that the wholly groundless inquiry allows a court to stay an action based on an agreement among the parties to submit their disputes to arbitration,while also preventing a party from asserting any claim at all,no matter how divorced from the parties agreement,to force an arbitration.qualcomm,at.accordingly,even if the court finds that the parties intent was clear and unmistakable that they delegated arbitrability decisions to an arbitrator,the court may make a second more limited inquiry to determine whether a claim of arbitrability is wholly groundless.id.quoting dream theater,dream theater,d.because the wholly groundless inquiry is supposed to be limited,a court performing the inquiry may simply conclude that there is a legitimate argument that the arbitration clause covers the present dispute,and,on the other hand,that it does not and,on that basis,leave t he resolution of those plausible arguments for the arbitrator.agere,samsung elecs,cir applying the wholly groundless inquiry from qualcomm.nevertheless,the wholly groundless inquiry necessarily requires the courts to examine and,to a limited extent,construe the underlying agreement.dream theater,d at.
in conducting the wholly groundless inquiry,the alj recited lg arguments that i the agreement expressly grants lg a license to the asserted patents,ii the license covers the products accused in this investigation,and iii section,the grant clause,survived the expiration of the agreement.see initial determination at citing various provisions of the agreement see also lg br.however,the alj failed to construe the provisions in the agreement cited by lg to the limited extent necessary to assess whether its arguments were plausible.instead,the alj simply concluded,lg claims that it has a continuing license for the accused products under the terms of the agreement,a dispute arising under the agreement.initial determination at emphasis added.it was legal error for the alj to terminate the investigation without assessing whether lg license defense was at least plausible.
if the alj had performed the proper analysis,he would have found that lg license defense is not plausible.rather,a cursory review of the relevant provisions in the agreement confirms that lg no longer holds a license to interdigital patents for products.
section,the grant clause,provided lg with a license to interdigital patents for both and products during the term of the agreement.however,the agreement terminated on december.see agreement.after that date,only the provisions specified in the survival clause survived.relevant to the present dispute,the survival clause provides for the survival of section the last sente
