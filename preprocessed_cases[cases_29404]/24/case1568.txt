plaintiff dale wolschlager purchased a title insurance policy policy from defendant fidelity national title insurance company on the basis of a preliminary report he received and approved.the preliminary report did not state that the policy he would receive contained an arbitration clause however,the policy he received after the close of escrow did in fact have one.when defendant denied plaintiff subsequent claim,plaintiff filed suit and the defendant petitioned to compel arbitration.the trial court denied the petition.in this appeal,we are presented with the question of whether an arbitration clause found in a title insurance policy,which policy is incorporated by reference into the preliminary report,binds an insured who sees neither the policy nor the arbitration clause prior to approving the preliminary report.we hold that because the preliminary report sufficiently incorporated the arbitration clause by reference,the plaintiff is bound by the agreement to arbitrate.therefore,we reverse the order denying the petition to compel arbitration.
factual and procedural background 
prior to the close of escrow on his house,plaintiff sought to purchase title insurance from defendant.as is customary,plaintiff received a preliminary report from defendant which he read and approved.included in the preliminary report was an exhibit a,which contained selected portions of the proposed policy to be issued.the policy itself was not attached.the selected policy provisions in exhibit a do not include or make reference to any arbitration provisions and there are no arbitration provision anywhere in the preliminary report itself.however,exhibit a does not purport to contain all of the provisions of the policy,and the first page of the preliminary report states,in regular font,copies of the policy forms should be read.they are available from the office which issued this report.
approximately one month after escrow had closed,the plaintiff received the full policy,which contained an arbitration clause some time later,the plaintiff discovered that a lien encumbered the property he had purchased,although neither the preliminary report nor the policy had made reference to the lien.on april,plaintiff,through his attorney,filed a claim with defendant.on may,defendant sent plaintiff attorney a preliminary denial letter.subsequently,defendant attorney communicated directly with plaintiff several times regarding his claim without either the consent or knowledge of plaintiff counsel.after these discussions failed to resolve the matter,defendant sent the plaintiff a formal denial letter on august.the formal denial letter informed plaintiff that if he believed that the defendants claim determination had been incorrect,he could seek review by the california department of insurance.at no time during their interactions did the defendant or its attorney inform the plaintiff that his policy contained an arbitration clause or that he could seek to arbitrate the matter.nor did defendant subsequently make reference to the arbitration clause when informed that plaintiff would be filing a bad faith suit,when served with the suit,or even in filing their answer.it was not until the plaintiff served his discovery requests on june,that defendant first expressed its intention to seek arbitration.
on july,defendant formally demanded that plaintiff submit the controversies raised in the complaint to arbitration.after plaintiff refused,the defendant filed a petition to compel arbitration in the trial court.in denying the petition,the court explained,binding a party to a mandatory arbitration provision requires that a party has been clearly and unequivocally informed of the arbitration provision.here a reference to or incorporation of additional documents which were not not presented to the party,i should say,nor immediately available to a party and certainly were not attached to the documents,the original documents at the time of signing an agreement,without some specific note or some specific warning of adr provisions that would be contained in these referenced documents is inadequate to bind that party.i would also note that the plaintiff has not waived his ability to object to the arbitration clause by failing to raise any objection after receiving the policy.plaintiff has objected at the first opportunity,namely when the defendant raised the issue by demanding arbitration.the defendants have not waived their right to demand arbitration by failing to advise the plaintiff of arbitration rights in their rejection letter.this may be evidence of bad faith perhaps,but its not a waiver i would also note that this decision is not based on any finding of improper defense attorney communications with the plaintiff and the decision is not based on any theory that there was an adhesion contract.this appeal ensued.
discussion 
under code of civil procedure section,a court shall order parties to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists,unless it determines that a the right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner or b grounds exist for revocation of the agreement.here the trial court findings were.while it determined that neither party actions amounted to waiver,it held that no binding agreement to arbitrate existed between them in the first instance.

enforceability of the arbitration clause

defendant contends that the only actual contract between the parties is the policy itself because the preliminary report is nothing more than an offer.defendant further contends that plaintiff can not challenge the enforceability of the arbitration clause in the policy because he never objected to any of the terms therein even after receiving the policy.it is a general rule that the receipt of a policy and its acceptance by the insured without an objection binds the insured as well as the insurer and he can not thereafter complain that he did not read it or know its terms.it is a duty of the insured to read his policy.citations.citation.chase blue cross of california th,d.however,unlike a health or liability insurance policy,as was involved in chase,a title insurance policy has a premium and remains in effect so long as the insured owns the property.a purchaser may not cancel the policy and switch to another carrier without forfeiting his premium.
the process of obtaining title insurance,therefore,contemplates the receipt of a title report before the close of escrow,setting forth the conditions upon which the issuer is willing to issue its title policy.the insured approval and acceptance of the conditions set forth in the preliminary report create a binding contract based on the terms set forth in the report and any materials that are incorporated therein by reference.ibid.therefore,whether plaintiff was bound by an arbitration clause depends directly on whether that term was set forth in the preliminary report or incorporated therein by reference.
