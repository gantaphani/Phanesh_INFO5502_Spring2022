discussion 
section establishes mandatory disclosure requirements for health services plans that require binding arbitration.medeiros superior court th,d medeiros malek,supra,th at,d.we review de novo the trial court denial of the petition to compel arbitration based on the failure to comply with the requirements of section.robertson health net of california,th,d robertson.
because the statutory language is the linchpin to this appeal,we quote section in its entirety any health care service plan that includes terms that require binding arbitration to settle disputes and that restrict,or provide for a waiver of,the right to a jury trial shall include,in clear and understandable language,a disclosure that meets all of the following conditions 
a the disclosure shall clearly state whether the plan uses binding arbitration to settle disputes,including specifically whether the plan uses binding arbitration to settle claims of medical malpractice.
b the disclosure shall appear as a separate article in the agreement issued to the employer group or individual subscriber and shall be prominently displayed on the enrollment form signed by each subscriber or enrollee.
c the disclosure shall clearly state whether the subscriber or enrollee is waiving his or her right to a jury trial for medical malpractice,other disputes relating to the delivery of service under the plan,or both,and shall be substantially expressed in the wording provided in subdivision a of section of the code of civil procedure.
d in any contract or enrollment agreement for a health care service plan,the disclosure required by this section shall be displayed immediately before the signature line provided for the representative of the group contracting with a health care service plan and immediately before the signature line provided for the individual enrolling in the health care service plan.

next,in malek,supra,th,d,blue cross conceded that the enrollment form did not meet the requirement that the disclosure be displayed immediately before the signature line,and the court also concluded that the provision did not meet the prominence requirement.id.at,d.the arbitration provision is in the same type size and font as provisions authorizing deductions and release of medication information.while the arbitration provision constitutes a separate numbered paragraph,it does not stand out and was not readily noticeable from these other provisions.ibid.the malek court further held that a violation of section renders a contractually binding arbitration provision in a health service plan enrollment form unenforceable.id.at,d see also an arbitration provision in a health care service plan is unenforceable if it does not meet the mandatory disclosure requirements of section.malek also made clear that the purpose of section is to protect health care consumers from the consequences of unknowingly waiving their right to a jury trial.malek,at,d.
