dana corporation appeals from an order of the district court granting summary judgment to international union,united automobile,aerospace,and agricultural implement workers of america the uaw.in,the uaw filed a claim in federal district court against dana pursuant to of the labor management relations act,a,to enforce an arbitration award finding dana in breach of the collective bargaining agreement between dana and the uaw.dana filed a,alleging that the arbitration award was invalid because the arbitrator interpretation of a neutrality provision in the collective bargaining agreement differed from that of a previous arbitrator.both parties moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted the uaw motion.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court judgment.
background 
dana corporation,a manufacturer of automobile parts,and the uaw are parties to a collective bargaining agreement master agreement that covers several of dana plants the master agreement contains provisions for the arbitration of grievances,including the selection of a permanent arbitrator by agreement of the parties.in regard to decisions made by the permanent arbitrator,the master agreement provides that 
in deciding a case,it shall be the function of the arbitrator to interpret the agreement and all supplemental agreements thereto and to decide whether or not there has been a violation thereof.he shall have no right to change,add to,subtract from,or modify any of the terms of this agreement or any supplemental agreements thereto 
joint appendix at master agreement.the master agreement further provides that decisions of the permanent arbitrator shall be final and binding upon both the union and the company.at.a side letter to the master agreement,first negotiated in governs dana conduct when the uaw seeks to organize a dana plant whose employees are not represented by a union.in the letter,dana agreed that 
where the uaw becomes involved in matters relating to the representation of our employees,we intend to continue our commitment of maintaining a neutral position on this matter.the company its representatives will communicate with our employees,not in an manner,but in a positive manner.
at neutrality letter.dana also stated in the letter that w e have no objection to the uaw becoming or remaining the bargaining representative of our people as a result of such as sic election.at.but dana did stipulate that we reserve the right to speak out in any manner appropriate when undue provocation is evident in a representation campaign.at 
in arbitration awards in,and two in,permanent arbitrator richard mittenthal interpreted the neutrality provision of the side letter.the arbitration arose out of a grievance filed by the uaw,alleging that dana,through its wholly owned subsidiary wix,had violated the neutrality provision in opposing the uaw organizational campaign at wix plants in gastonia,north carolina.arbitrator mittenthal began his arbitration opinion by noting that 
dana concedes that where the uaw attempts to organize a dana facility,dana must maintain a neutral position on this matter true neutrality would mean,of course,that dana would take no stand on the question of union representation.it could not be for or against the uaw.but that kind of strict neutrality does not appear to have been contemplated by the parties.dana did not commit itself to silence.rather,it was permitted by the neutrality letter to communicate with employees,not in an manner,but in a positive manner.
at arbitration.he then stated that 
t he parties agree that dana is free to express opposition to the uaw provided its argument is not couched in language.
this may seem,at first blush,a contradiction in terms.but what the parties appear to have had in mind is that dana argue its case in an objective fashion without resort to the kind of threats and innuendos which have often accompanied employer speech in organizing campaigns.
at.because he found that dana,through wix,had expressed its opposition to the uaw in explicit terms and that the uaw had not unduly provoked dana,arbitrator mittenthal concluded that dana had violated the neutrality provision.
the arbitration arose out of a similar grievance filed by the uaw involving the organization of a dana plant in gordonsville,tennessee.in his arbitration opinion,arbitrator mittenthal cited extensively from his opinion,and he expanded on his earlier interpretation of the provision only by noting that means any or untruthful.at arbitration.arbitrator mittenthal again concluded that dana had violated the neutrality provision in making explicitly statements to its employees without undue provocation.the arbitrations involved dana plants in morganton,north carolina,and cape girardeau,missouri.in both,arbitrator mittenthal reiterated his earlier interpretation of the neutrality provision,and,as in the and arbitrations,he found that dana had violated the provision.
in,the uaw attempted to organize the dana plant in greensboro,north carolina.on september,the uaw filed a grievance with the new permanent arbitrator,paul glendon,charging dana with twelve violations of the neutrality provision.in april and june of,arbitrator glendon held hearings,and on september,he issued an award for the uaw on five of the twelve charges.arbitrator glendon began his arbitration opinion by discussing the arbitral history of the neutrality provision although he recognized that arbitrator mittenthal interpretation of the provision had been part of the parties collective bargaining relationship for seventeen years and that questions of whether the corporation violated the neutrality letter at greensboro must be answered with this arbitral history in mind,at arbitration,he stated that 
the corporation promises that it has no objection to the uaw becoming or remaining the bargaining representative of our people as a result of an nlrb election,will continue its commitment of maintaining a neutral position on this matter,and will communicate with employees,not in an manner,but in a positive manner indeed are clear and unambiguous,and to this arbitrator it is not just difficult,but impossible,to reconcile with sic them with any communication of outright opposition to the uaw becoming the bargaining representative of our people.
at arbitration.in regard to three of the five charges he sustained,though,arbitrator glendon expressly invoked the interpretation of the neutrality provision developed by arbitrator mittenthal.on the first charge,arbitrator glendon found that dana had violated the neutrality provision because it had communicated a link between union representation and loss of job security to its employees.at.arbitrator glendon cited arbitrator mittenthal february,arbitration opinion for the proposition that linking union representation with a loss of jobs can hardly be viewed as communica tion in a positive manner.it is a thinly veiled attempt to associate the uaw with inefficiency and poor productivity.it is.at arbitration quoting,arbitration,at.similarly,on the second and third charges,arbitrator glendon found that dana had violated the neutrality provision because it had made explicitly statements to its employees.at,arbitration.
in regard to the sixth charge,arbitrator glendon expressly rejected arbitrator mittenthal interpretation of the neutrality provision.the sixth charge involved a letter sent by the plant manager,ralph bash,to the employees stating that dana was absolutely opposed to the unionization of the employees at the plant and describing how joining the union would negatively affect the employees.at arbitration arbitrator glendon found that although the letter was not explicitly and would perhaps have been permissible under arbitrator mittenthal interpretation of the neutrality provision,it is not only difficult,but impossible,to reconcile such statements with the no objection pledge in particular and the commitment of neutrality in general.at emphasis in original.arbitrator glendon further concluded that 
it is certainly true that the corporation is not sentenced to silence in a uaw organizing campaign,but what the neutrality letter permits by way of communication is,at most,a statement by management to employees at a plant facing an organizational campaign that dana has no objection to the uaw representing them but wishes to remind them of the benefits they already enjoy without such representation.
at.finally,in regard to the twelfth charge,arbitrator glendon found that dana violation of the neutrality provision in its outright,absolute and strident opposition to the uaw representation of employees at the greensboro plant and by various communications to such employees effected the constructive discharge of employee crystal windsor.at.arbitrator glendon did not explain which interpretation he relied on in his conclusion regarding the twelfth charge,but it is possible that arbitrator mittenthal would not have come to the same conclusion.
on september,the uaw filed a claim in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio pursuant to the labor management relations act,a,to enforce arbitrator glendon award.dana counterclaimed to vacate the award on october,and the cases were consolidated in the district court.on december,the uaw moved for summary judgment,and on february,dana filed a cross motion for summary judgment.in its cross motion for summary judgment,dana argued that because arbitrator glendon interpretation of the neutrality provision diverged from arbitrator mittenthal interpretation of the provision,arbitrator glendon interpretation of the provision failed to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement and violated public policy.the district court concluded,however,that prior arbitration decisions are not binding on later arbitration decisions unless the collective bargaining agreement so stipulates.and the court further found that arbitrator glendon interpretation of the neutrality provision drew its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.on may,the district court granted the uaw motion for summary judgment and denied dana cross motion for summary judgment.dana timely appeals.

essence of the collective bargaining agreement 
on appeal,dana argues that the arbitration award by arbitrator glendon fails to draw its essence from the master agreement because arbitrator glendon rejected the interpretation of the neutrality provision adopted by arbitrator mittenthal in four prior,materially identical,arbitration proceedings.appellant br.at.first,dana claims that arbitrator mittenthal interpretation of the neutrality provision had effectively become part of the contract or,that,at least,because the parties had renewed the provision without amendment,the interpretation indicated the parties intent.in support of this proposition,dana cites an eighth circuit case in which the court held that an arbitration award that found a company no beard policy unreasonable did not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.trailways lines trailways.joint council,cir.the court in that case concluded that the no beard policy was a reasonable standard of personal appearance under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement,as a previous arbitrator had determined,and the court noted that a lthough an arbitrator generally has the power to determine whether a prior award is to be given preclusive effect,courts have also recognized that the doctrine of res judicata may apply to arbitrations with strict factual identities.id.at quotation omitted.dana also cites a fifth circuit case in which the court adopted a material factual identity test to determine if a prior arbitration award governed the conduct of parties to a collective bargaining agreement.oil workers int l union,local ethyl,cir and dana cites supreme court dicta stating that w here there is a clear and consistent pattern of arbitration decisions the parties,in some circumstances,may be said to have incorporated the decisions into their subsequent bargaining agreements.appellant br.at citing metropolitan edison nlrb,d.second,dana claims that the fact that arbitration under the master agreement is final and binding mandates prospective application of standards developed in arbitration.appellant br.at citing wilbur chocolate,bakery workers int l union,local,wl at.march,aff without opinion,cir.
in concluding that arbitrator glendon was not bound by arbitrator mittenthal interpretation of the neutrality provision,the district court judge stated that although the issue is not entirely resolved in the case law,i conclude that the best approach is to refrain,as a general rule,from requiring an arbitrator to give res judicata,collateral estoppel,or other preclusive effect to decisions in earlier arbitrations.at order granting pl.mot.for summ.we agree.although the eighth circuit and fifth circuit opinions cited by dana do still appear to be good law in those circuits the majority of other circuits that have examined this issue have held that arbitrators in labor disputes are not bound by the decisions of prior arbitrators unless the collective bargaining agreement so stipulates the supreme court has stated that b ecause the authority of arbitrators is a subject of collective bargaining,the scope of the arbitrator authority is itself a question of contract interpretation that the parties have delegated to the arbitrator.grace local union,int l union of rubber workers,d.other circuits have held that the preclusive effect of an earlier arbitration award is a determination to be made by the arbitrator.see,of maintenance of way employees burlington,cir in the world of labor arbitration,the preclusive effect of the first arbitrator decision is an issue for a later arbitrator to consider.comm.of adjustment,united transp.union.ry.csx,cir quoting butler armco indep.union armco,cir absent contractual language to the contrary,one arbitrator interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement is not binding on a subsequent arbitrator boston electrotypers union,cir absent a contractual provision to the contrary,an arbitrator is free to decide that rigid adherence to a prior award would impair the process of flexibly resolving current or future disputes.and a panel of the circuit has specifically held that where the agreement is silent,the arbitrator may decline to follow arbitral precedent when his judgment is that earlier decisions are erroneous.hotel ass of washington,hotel rest.employees union,local,quotations omitted.
