the campo band of mission indians the tribe entered into a compact with the state of california the state relating to its operation of gambling facilities in the state the compact in the compact,the tribe agreed to comply with certain standards relating to public health and safety at its facilities,to maintain certain public liability insurance for personal injury claims by patrons injured at the facilities and to adopt a tort liability ordinance setting forth the terms and conditions under which it would waive its sovereign immunity relating to such claims and the procedures for processing those claims.the tribe adopted a regulation that requires a claimant to comply with certain procedures and,subject to such compliance,provides for arbitration of the patron claim.
here,the tribe concluded that an injured patron failed to comply with the procedural prerequisites to arbitration and refused to participate in arbitration of her claim the patron filed this action seeking to compel arbitration,which the superior court granted.the fundamental issue in this case is whether the superior court had subject matter jurisdiction to order the tribe to arbitration.we find that the compact included a waiver of the tribe tribal sovereign immunity relating to patron claims for negligence resulting in personal injury up to specified limits,and thus the superior court had limited subject matter jurisdiction over the patron claim against the tribe,but the superior court erred in determining the compliance issue itself rather than submitting that issue for determination in arbitration.accordingly,we grant the petition in part.

in march,celeste bluehawk sued the tribe in superior court,alleging that she was injured in december,when she slipped and fell on a wet floor at the tribe golden acorn casino.the tribe moved to dismiss bluehawk action,arguing that it had sovereign tribal immunity from such a suit,that its promulgation of regulation did not constitute a waiver of its immunity to suit in state court and that accordingly the state court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.bluehawk argued that regulation included a waiver of the tribe sovereign immunity or,alternatively,that the court could and should exercise jurisdiction over the matter to permit discovery relating to the waiver issue.she also contended that the regulation was void because it conflicted with the claims requirement of the compact and unduly restrictive and an unconscionable abrogation of her legal rights.finally,she contended that in any event,she had complied with the procedures set forth therein.
the trial court agreed with the tribe contention that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over bluehawk claims and dismissed her complaint.it also held,however,that bluehawk had complied with the claims procedures set forth in regulation and that her opportunity to request arbitration thereunder had not run because the tribe insurer had never notified her of its final decision concerning her claim.the court indicated that the parties should engage in settlement negotiations and if those were unsuccessful,arbitration was the next step.
thereafter,bluehawk attempted to negotiate with the tribe insurer,but without success,and in september,she sent a letter requesting arbitration pursuant to regulation.the tribe responded that its executive committee was considering whether it was willing to waive bluehawk lack of compliance with regulation and that it would notify her of the decision by letter.in late december,the tribe sent bluehawk a letter stating that it had previously rejected her claim on the grounds that it was untimely,defective and with regulation.
several days later,bluehawk filed another lawsuit for premises liability against the tribe in state court,although she also requested that the tribe stipulate to submit the matter to arbitration.in february,the tribe filed a motion to dismiss bluehawk complaint,again on the basis of tribal sovereign immunity.bluehawk filed a motion to compel arbitration of her claim,which was calendared to be heard concurrently with the motion to dismiss.
based on a consideration of full briefing of both motions by the parties,the superior court granted bluehawk motion to compel arbitration,finding that by virtue of its agreement in the compact to waive its immunity from suits for money damages and to provide reasonable assurance that patron claims would be promptly and fairly adjudicated,the tribe waived its sovereign immunity for the purposes of a suit to compel arbitration.the court also concluded that although regulation provided no recourse or appeal for a claimant whose request for arbitration is denied or deemed denied,that aspect of the regulation was inconsistent with the tribe obligations under the compact to promptly and fairly adjudicate liability claims and pay legitimate claims.
the tribe filed a petition for a writ of mandate in this court,arguing the superior court lacked jurisdiction to make such an order or,alternatively,that the court erred in compelling arbitration of bluehawk claim because there was no evidence to support a finding that she had complied with the procedural requirements of regulation.we issued an order to show cause.

here,the superior court concluded that the tribe agreement with the state included its consent to or waiver of tribal sovereign immunity from a suit compelling arbitration of patron claims and insofar as regulation provides no recourse or avenue of appeal for a claimant whose request for arbitration is denied or deemed denied,it was inconsistent with the compact,which required the tribe to provide assurance that patron claims would be promptly and fairly adjudicated.the tribe contends that the compact does not include any waiver of its immunity from suits for money damages and that regulation contains only a limited waiver of immunity that is applicable only where the claimant has complied with the procedures specified in the regulation and obtained an award against it in arbitration.we find that the tribe consent was broader than it contends,but narrower than the superior court found.
a.did the tribe waive its tribal sovereign immunity 
as described above,in the compact the tribe agreed to comply with certain standards relating to public health and safety at its facilities,maintain specified public liability insurance for personal injury negligence claims by patrons claiming to have been injured at those facilities and adopt a tort liability ordinance setting forth the terms and conditions,if any,under which it would waive its sovereign immunity relating to such claims and the procedures for processing those claims.the compact specifically excludes liability for punitive damages,intentional acts not covered by the insurance policy and attorney fees,but specifies that otherwise the tribe agreement with the state did not waive its immunity to suit except to the extent of the policy limits and insurance coverage provided for therein.italics added.
by virtue of this language in the compact,the tribe unambiguously waived its immunity relating to patron claims for negligent acts to the extent of the insurance coverage it contractually obligated itself to obtain for such claims.any contrary interpretation would ignore the italicized language agreed to by the tribe in the compact.see c l enterprises,citizen band potawatomi indian tribe of,supra,at.holding that the inclusion of an arbitration clause providing for judicial enforcement of the resulting award in a contract entered into by a tribe necessarily constituted a waiver of its tribal immunity despite the absence of any express waiver of sovereign immunity in the contract because a contrary interpretation would render the arbitration clause meaningless.although this language clearly does limit the amount of damages for which the tribe can be held liable in an action against it,we disagree with the dissent assertion that that language which specifically refers to a waiver of immunity can be read as merely a limitation on such damages and nothing more.
the tribe argues,however,that other language in the compact requiring it to establish a tort liability ordinance setting forth the terms and conditions,if any,under which it waives immunity to suit specifically negates the existence of any waiver of sovereign immunity therein,instead leaving the issue of waiver to be left solely to th
