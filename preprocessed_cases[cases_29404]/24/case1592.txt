in this writ proceeding,we address whether the mediation privilege of evidence code sections and applies to raw data or evidentiary material.petitioners sought production and inspection of material produced by real parties in connection with a mediation held in prior litigation to which petitioners were not parties.the materials sought included raw data as well as a compilation of data prepared for the mediation.pursuant to the mediation privilege of evidence code section,the trial court held all material was protected from production.petitioners seek a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order and enter a new and different order compelling production of the materials.we conclude the mediation privilege does not apply to factual material and only provides qualified protection for amalgamated materials.
factual background and procedural history 
the underlying action and the mediation.
petitioners are the tenants of an apartment complex located at,and so.burlington street apartment complex owned by real parties in interest julie coffin,trustee of the erhlich investment trust and richard ehrlich collectively coffin.the apartment complex was built by ksf holdings,first city properties,fields silverman,and various other contractor and subcontractor entities collectively developers.coffin became the owner of the building in,and in december,coffin commenced an action against the developers alleging numerous construction defects that had resulted in water leakage,in turn causing the presence of toxic molds and other microbes on the property.the construction defects included problems with the plumbing,electrical,and ventilation systems.
in connection with the underlying action,the parties entered into a case management order cmo.the cmo provided that a special master would be appointed to oversee discovery discovery would be stayed specified documents would be deposited into and held at a document repository coffin would prepare a defect list the developers would be permitted to conduct destructive testing the matter would be submitted to mediation and the parties experts would meet to discuss the cost and scope of repair.the final defect list was required to contain the type,extent and location of defects,coffin contentions as to the cause of the defect,whether the defect was identified by visual inspection,invasive testing,extrapolation,or some other method,and a repair report setting forth in detail the necessary repairs and specific cost of each repair 
in april,coffin prepared a preliminary defect list,which identified defects in the structure of the apartment complex as well as mold infestation.in april,coffin began air testing at the apartment complex.sometime in late,one of the buildings so.burlington avenue at the apartment complex was closed,and some of those tenants moved into the other two buildings.fences were placed around the building,which remained closed until abatement efforts were completed.those abatement efforts included demolition of drywall and ceilings in all of the buildings and the installation of replacement drywall.antimicrobial agents were also applied,and plumbing was repaired.
in april,the underlying litigation settled.the settlement provided that t he terms of this agreement shall remain confidential as between the parties,their counsel,their consultants and their insurance carriers and their representatives.all parties,their counsel,insurance company representatives and consultants shall not take any action to facilitate,propagate and otherwise participate in the solicitation or prosecution of any claims by any tenant,current or future,with regard to their occupancy of the property.in addition,throughout this resolution of the matter,consultants provided defect reports,repair reports,and photographs for informational purpose which are protected by the case management order and evidence code and,and it is hereby agreed that such materials and information contained therein shall not be published or disclosed in any way without the prior consent of plaintiff or by court order.
the instant action and the motions to compel.
in august,petitioners,many of whom are children,commenced the instant action against coffin and the developers of the apartment complex petitioners contended that faulty plumbing,roofing,hvac heating,ventilation,and air conditioning,sheet metal and stucco work caused free water to circulate in the building,permitting microbes to infest the building.as a result,petitioners suffered numerous health problems.petitioners alleged that they did not become aware of the building defects until april,and alleged that coffin and the developers conspired to conceal the defects and microbe infestation from them.
first motion to compel,july.
in november,petitioners served a request for production of documents,in which petitioners sought production of,among other things,five categories that included all discovery and responses exchanged between the parties to the underlying litigation a ll actual physical evidence evidencing the condition of the buildings,including,without limitation,photographs,videotapes,test samples,test reports such as spore and colony counts,and any physical evidence that was removed from the buildings and saved drywall,plumbing,framing members,writings describing the buildings,including written notes of observations made during building inspections,and witness interviews t his category would also include notes describing what the witnesses did and saw while conducting inspections or repairs of the buildings and writings evidencing the opinions of expert consultants,both those communicated to the defendants and those not communicated to the defendants.
in july,petitioners brought a motion to compel production of documents,heard before judge mccoy.petitioners argued that purely evidentiary,or material,was not protected by work product.they contended that such material included the identity and location of physical evidence,and the identity and location of witnesses with knowledge of the facts of the case.derivative materials,which contained attorney interpretations or evaluations of the facts or law,were discoverable upon a showing of good cause,which existed in the instant case because there was no other means by which to obtain the requested discovery because coffin had remediated the property.petitioners sought all pleadings,discovery responses,photographs,samples,test results,correspondence,and documents identifying potential witnesses.petitioners contended that because of the remediation of the property,there was no other way they could obtain the information.
judge mccoy issued a statement of decision in which he ordered documents produced for an in camera inspection.coffin took the position that all documents had been prepared for the mediation and were therefore protected by the mediation privilege.the in camera inspection,conducted november,was held only in the presence of defense counsel,and the court ordered the transcript sealed after petitioners pointed out they could not effectively challenge the court ruling without a privilege log,the court directed that one be prepared,and coffin submitted a privilege log.
on january,the court ordered that documents submitted in compilation form for the mediation were privileged.in particular,the court stated that the court rulings only apply to the privileged nature of the compilations.the documents attached to the compilations were not submitted to the court separately,and the court ruled on the documents taken together for mediation purposes.
second motion to compel,march.
after reassignment of the matter to judge mohr,petitioners moved to compel the production of physical evidence,including photographs of the project,former tenants,and current tenants,including photographs provided in the underlying action as part of compilations.petitioners also requested videotapes of the project and videotapes of former and current tenants,including videotapes of the project that were utilized during the mediation.lastly,petitioners sought any and all raw data regarding air sampling for mold spores,raw data from bulk sampling for mold spores,raw data from destructive testing,any and all results from destructive testing,and all recorded statements of former and current tenants.petitioners contended judge mccoy ruling supported their argument that photographs and other raw material was not protected by the mediation privilege because judge mccoy had not ruled on individual photographs or other evidentiary material.
coffin opposed the motion on the grounds that the photographs and other raw evidence was prepared for the purpose of mediation and that in the absence of mediation confidentiality,they would not have produced the material,including the photographs and other raw data in the mediation binder.they relied on the cmo in the underlying litigation,in which any document prepared for the purpose of mediation was protected.furthermore,the mediation privilege did not support any distinction between documents or material that were part of a compilation and those which were not.coffin also contended that judge mccoy had concluded certain individual items were not producible because he had individually reviewed such items at the in camera proceedings.
petitioners responded that the changed conditions of the premises due to remediation,and their inability therefor to replicate the raw data and images recorded in the photographs,constituted good cause for the production of the materials sought.they pointed out that mold spore analyses did not constitute,without more,expert opinion that photographs do not contain attorney opinion,impression or analysis and that the court prior order mandated disclosure.
at the hearing,the court indicated it was troubled by applying the mediation privilege to raw evidence.the court stated that those photographs trouble me because this is not a summary of impressions of an expert or anything this is just a representation,fixed representation of the state of a particular place a particular time,and if there really no other way for the plaintiff to get have a concern that the mediation and litigation privilege were not meant as a device or subterfuge to block evidence.coffin argued that the photographs were advocacy in the sense that were taken to show impressions,and have arrows pointing out significant features.they also argued that the photographs were not just a mere group of photographs rather,they constituted a report of their experts,and because a photograph was worth a thousand words the photographs were more than just raw evidence.the court pointed out that you ca just put a piece of evidence in a mediation and make it disappear.coffin argued that the photographs were taken for the purposes of mediation and had only been taken because of the cmo.furthermore,particular photographs were taken because they were meant to depict a defect.
discussion 
mediation confidentiality does not protect raw physical evidence from discovery.
petitioners argue that the mediation confidentiality provisions of evidence code sections et do not shield physical evidence,such as photographs and raw test data,from discovery because such evidence is purely evidentiary in nature.they contend such evidence is therefore clearly otherwise admissible,pursuant to the provisions of section,and at the very least,any evidence prepared prior to the cmo,which commenced the mediation process,should be discoverable.petitioners point out that they have no other means by which to obtain any of this evidence,as most of it was destroyed or removed from the premises as a result of the remediation process.
coffin contends that the statutory language of section is plain,and there is no reason to read the doctrine of protection into the statute in order to determine the scope of the mediation privilege,which they contend is absolute documents and other materials prepared for purposes of a mediation are protected from discovery.see foxgate homeowners bramalea california,cal th,d.because the materials in question were never admissible or subject to discovery outside of the litigation,the materials do not fall within the statutory exception of section.lastly,coffin casts the issue as a fact question,and points out that the trial court conducted and determined after a inquiry that the materials were prepared for purposes of mediation,and we can not overturn that finding because it is supported by substantial evidence.
standard of review.
the trial court determination of a motion to compel discovery is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.bp alaska exploration,superior court d.however,at the outset,we must determine whether the court applied the correct legal standard to the issue in exercising its discretion,which determination is a question of law for this court.of course,t he scope of discretion always resides in the particular law being applied action that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion people parmar th,d.because our analysis of the issue involves the interpretation of a statute,we review the trial court ruling under evidence code sections and de novo.sutco construction modesto high school dist.d.
ii.sections and do not protect raw evidence.
sections and are clear and unambiguous.
evidence code section provides a privilege for certain communications made during mediation.in particular,and relevant to the materials sought in the instant case,evidence code section provides that n o writing,as defined in section,that is prepared for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation or a mediation consultation,is admissible or subject to discovery,writings are defined broadly in evidence code section and include photographs,videos,and tape recordings.see,jones city of los angeles th,d.in construing sections and,we are guided by well established principles of statutory construction.
the primary goal of statutory interpretation is to effectuate the legislature intent in enacting the statute.generally,statutory interpretation involves a process.we first turn to the words of the statute.in re littlefield cal th,d.if the meaning of the words is not clear,then we turn to legislative history.lastly,and only if we are unable to ascertain the statute meaning,we apply reason,practicality,and common sense to the language at hand.the language of the statute must be interpreted to make it workable and reasonable.halbert lumber,lucky stores,th,d.
if,however,the meaning of the statute words is unambiguous,then the language of the statute controls,and we need not resort to other construction aids.halbert lumber,lucky stores,supra,at,d lungren deukmejian cal d.a statute is ambiguous only where it is susceptible of two reasonable constructions.in such case,we will resort to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objectives of the statute,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme.wilcox birtwhistle cal th,d.
in reading the statute,we will not alter or amend the language of the statute to accomplish a purpose that does not appear to comport with the legislative purpose.people knowles cal d.we give the words their ordinary,everyday meaning,unless the statute specifically defines those words.wilcox birtwhistle,supra,cal th at,d.further,we read the various statutes concerning the mediation privilege as a whole to give effect to all of the provisions relating to this privilege,and will not read one section to contradict another or to contradict its overall purpose.city of huntington beach board of administration cal th,d.specific provisions are to be given effect over more general provisions consistent with the above rules of statutory construction.fremont comp.ins.superior court th,d.where two statutes address a common subject,we must construe them in reference to each other so as to avoid rendering any part of them surplusage.devita county of napa cal th,d.we must presume the legislature intended every word,phrase,and provision to have meaning and to perform a useful function.clements bechtel cal d.lastly,nothing in the rules above prevents us from determining whether a statute is internally consistent or whether the literal meaning of the statute is consistent with its legislative purpose.people brewer th,d.
fortunately,our supreme court has spoken on the legislative purpose behind the mediation privilege,which is to encourage mediation by providing for confidentiality of documents introduced therein.foxgate homeowners bramalea california,supra,cal th,d.t he purpose of confidentiality is to promote a candid and informal exchange regarding events in the past this frank exchange is achieved only if the participants know that what is said in the mediation will not be used to their detriment through later court proceedings and other adjudicatory processes.citations.foxgate homeowners bramalea california,supra,at,d.mediation is the preferred method for dealing with many disputes because it conserves resources and avoids subjecting the parties to unnecessarily costly,and complex court proceedings.the supreme court has stressed that confidentiality is essential to effective mediation,ibid and therefore,the statutory scheme unqualifiedly bars disclosure of communications made during mediation absent an express statutory exception.id.at,d.section is just such a statutory exception.section provides that evidence which is otherwise admissible is not protected simply because it was introduced or used during a mediation 
construing these statutes,we conclude that the language of sections and is clear and unambiguous and that the plain language of the statute privilege from disclosure does not apply to evidence.rather,sections and are meant to protect the substance of mediation,the negotiations,communications,admissions,and discussions designed to reach a resolution of the dispute at hand.these statutes do not protect pure evidence.
first,evidence code section defines evidence as testimony,writings,material objects,or other things presented to the senses that are offered to prove the existence or nonexistence of a fact.section thus covers both oral statements,written statements,and physical evidence.on the other hand,section breaks the evidence of section into two groups it protects evidence of anything said or admission made,which are oral or written statements,in tangible or intangible form.section also protects writings,which are defined very broadly to include all forms of tangible expression,including pictures and sound recordings.reports.nowhere does section say it protects hard evidence,what section defines as material objects,or other things presented to the senses that are offered to prove the existence or nonexistence of a fact.if the statute were meant to protect all evidence,including raw evidence,section would not specifically define the particularized types of evidence oral and written it does protect.section reiterates that a ll communications,negotiations,or settlement discussions occurring during the mediation shall remain confidential.thus,the language of section read alone supports the conclusion that it does not protect raw evidence,but only protects statements and writings.
furthermore,turning to section,it provides that e vidence otherwise admissible italics added or subject to discovery outside of a mediation shall not be or become inadmissible or protected from disclosure solely by reason of its introduction or use in a mediation or a mediation consultation.this section does not cover writings,statements,or communications it only covers evidence.this word choice implies that because writings,statements and communications are protected,something remains that is unprotected.that thing which is unprotected is evidence which is otherwise admissible.otherwise admissible evidence therefore is relevant evidence that is otherwise not covered by the mediation privilege and not subject to exclusion under some other rule or privilege set forth in the evidence code.
in addition,section excludes from protection evidence which is otherwise subject to discovery outside of mediation.evidence subject to discovery is very broad,and any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter,not privileged,that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in that action,if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence code civ,subd.a.again,this language,which is broader than just merely admissible evidence,implies that the scope of the mediation privilege does not cover absolutely everything that might happen to be used during a mediation.
section explicitly states that it does not protect from disclosure evidence solely by reason of its introduction or use in a mediation or mediation consultation.this reinforces our interpretation that mediation confidentiality is meant to protect the substance of the negotiations and communications in furtherance of the mediation,not the factual basis of those negotiations.thus,even if evidence is used or introduced in the mediation,it is not protected.
lastly,we point out our interpretation is not changed by the fact section itself provides for specific,enumerated exceptions to disclosure.these include agreements to mediate,agreements concerning defaults or the time within which actions must be taken in a civil proceeding,and the fact a mediator has served,is serving,will serve,or was contacted about serving in a mediation,subd.b.the enumeration of these particular items does not operate to limit the scope of the statute to them exclusively rather,because section refers to evidence and such items are writings within the meaning of section and therefore privileged pursuant to section,this portion of section further expands its scope,rather than restricting it.
in summary,we therefore reject coffin reading of sections and that all materials introduced at the mediation,or prepared for the mediation,including those of a purely evidentiary nature,are encompassed within the scope of the privilege because they were prepared for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,the mediation.such a reading would render section complete surplusage and foster the evils it is designed to prevent namely,using mediation as a shield for otherwise admissible evidence.if we were to read sections in this fashion,in isolation,without reference to section,parties such as the petitioners in the instant case would have no access to necessary and relevant factual materials with which to conduct their litigation.indeed,as stated in the law revision commission comments,section is designed to prevent materials from being introduced in mediation solely to protect them from later discovery or use in litigation.see cal.law com.com,pt,west ann.evid.code supp.foll,section limits the scope of section preventing parties from using a mediation as a pretext to shield materials from disclosure.both sections and make clear that the legislature intended to place some restrictions on the otherwise broadly stated mediation privilege.
work product doctrine guides the actual admissibility determination.
the doctrine.
if evidence is not protected,then what guidance may the court use to determine the scope of evidence protected under the work product doctrine,courts routinely have dealt with the distinction between unprotected factual material and protected mental processes.in california,work product is protected by statute and defined by case law as the product of the attorney effort,research,and thought in the preparation of his client case.it includes the results of his own work,and the work of those employed by him or for him by his client,in investigating both the favorable and unfavorable aspects of the case,the information thus assembled,and the legal theories and plan of strategy developed by the as reflected in interviews,statements,memoranda,correspondence,briefs,and any other writings reflecting the attorney impressions,conclusions,opinions,or legal research or theories,and in countless other tangible and intangible ways.bp alaska exploration,superior court,supra,d at,fn.california recognizes that the doctrine prevents attorneys from taking undue advantage of their adversary industry and efforts.code civ,subd.a.
in california,the distinction between derivative and material is the analytic framework applied to determining whether materials are protected by the attorney doctrine.three levels of protection exist.core work product,material solely reflecting an attorney impressions,conclusions,opinions,or legal research or theories,is entitled to absolute protection from discovery.izazaga superior court cal d,fn.qualified protection exists for work product which is an amalgamation of factual information and attorney thoughts,impressions,conclusions.nacht lewis architects,superior court th,d.such derivative material would include charts and diagrams,audit reports,compilations of entries in documents,records and other databases,appraisals,opinions,and reports of experts employed as consultants.derivative work product will be ordered disclosed if denial of discovery would unfairly prejudice the other party or result in an injustice.code civ,subd.b bp alaska exploration,superior court,supra,d at.the party seeking disclosure must demonstrate good cause,which involves a balancing of the need for disclosure against the purposes served by the doctrine.national steel products superior court d.lastly,purely factual material receives no work product protection.nacht lewis architects,superior court,supra,at,d rodriguez mcdonnell douglas d.
the mere fact that a lot of work has been put into preparing the materials does not entitle them to protection.thus,a list of witnesses showing their names and locations is not protected,even where the attorney has spent a lot of time investigating and compiling the list.transport indemnity insurance.th,d.however,where the list of witnesses contains tactical information because it is a list of potential witnesses,it becomes work product.such a list would tend to reveal counsel evaluation of the case by identifying the persons who claimed knowledge of the incident from whom counsel deemed it important to obtain statements.nacht lewis architects,superior court,supra,th at,d.the value of the list would be in those persons excluded and those persons included,even thought ostensibly the list itself was purely factual information.
the dissent,on the other hand,finds the mediation privilege absolute,pointing to the purpose of mediation,which is to encourage the resolution of disputes.however,were we to find all material introduced into a mediation covered by the privilege,this would render the language of section nugatory,and permit the parties to use mediation as a shield to hide evidence.we hardly think this was the legislature purpose in providing for the express language of section.most lawsuits are factual disputes,rather than legal ones,which is the reason discovery is often such a difficult and protracted process full of gamesmanship.to give the parties one more avenue where they could hide evidence and obstruct the process of litigation would be,in our view,disastrous and would not foster resolution of disputes,but hinder them.parties could simply agree to mediate,introduce all their evidence,and then refuse to settle,and claim privilege.what then there is no mechanism in the mediation statutes to deal with this inevitable result,as there is with discovery.we think the distinction between derivative and material accommodates the legislature intent in enacting section,and balances the need for confidentiality statements and communications are still protected with the need to keep pure evidence from being dishonestly hidden through the pretext of being introduced into a mediation 
mediation privilege protection is with the work product doctrine.
given that the framework of discoverable materials under the doctrine closely mirrors the express statutory privilege exception of section,which applies to evidence otherwise admissible or items subject to discovery outside of a mediation,we read it to protect materials in same manner as the doctrine.however,in order to effectuate the purposes of the mediation privilege,with respect to derivative materials,they are discoverable only upon a showing of good cause,which requires a determination of the need for the materials balanced against the benefit to the mediation privilege obtained by protecting those materials from disclosure.because petitioners were not parties to the underlying litigation and were not joined as parties to that litigation,they do not have access to much material that has been removed or destroyed.
applying this framework to the instant case,we find that material,such as raw test data,photographs,and witness statements,are not protected by section.to the extent any of the materials sought are part of a compilation prepared for the mediation or put together in such a manner that it discloses the attorneys or parties evaluations of the strengths and weaknesses of the case or discloses their negotiation posture,if it can be reasonably detached from the compilation,it must be produced.thus,photographs in a book labeled defects would be removed from the book and given to petitioners singly.if the photographs contain arrows or captions,such arrows or captions may be removed.we point out photographs are not protected simply because no pictures were taken of unblemished or portions of the apartment complex,and mold and air samples are not protected merely because samples may have only been taken inside the apartment complex or in areas where construction defects were located.it is axiomatic that most,if not all,of the pictures would depict defects in the instant case it is also inescapable that mold and air sampling would have more likely been done in damaged units.conversely,test data that is in a chart that in any fashion indicates the attorneys or parties evaluation of the case or their negotiation posture,it is protected.however,to the extent such test data may be extrapolated from the chart and given to petitioners,it must be produced.such determinations shall be made by the trial court after a careful in camera review of the materials.
lastly,petitioners have no other means of obtaining this information due to the fact they were not joined in the prior lawsuit and because the remediation efforts undertaken by coffin and the developers have eliminated most,if not all,of the relevant evidence.therefore,in certain instances,it may be appropriate that they be given amalgamated materials if such materials can not easily be broken into their protected and components.such a determination must be made in the trial court after a careful in camera inspection of the material sought.
disposition 
let a peremptory writ of mandate issue in the first instance directing the respondent superior court to vacate its order of march.consistent with the views expressed in this opinion,the trial court is directed to conduct an in camera review of all materials falling within petitioners document production requests to determine which materials are protected by the mediation privilege and those which are not so protected.

divining a distinction between derivative and materials nowhere found in the statutory scheme and acknowledging only a qualified protection from disclosure even for concededly privileged materials,the majority has now effectively eradicated any significance from the mediation privilege in california.because i believe the limited and qualified protection fashioned by the majority for materials prepared for mediation is inconsistent with the language and the legislative intent underlying section,i r
