welborn clinic entered into a contract with medquist,under which medquist agreed to perform medical transcription services for welborn.disputes quickly arose over the methods medquist used to count the lines it transcribed for billing purposes.eventually,welborn filed suit asserting breach of contract,fraud,deceptive trade practices,and conversion.the district court determined that all of welborn claims were subject to arbitration under the contract dispute resolution clause and dismissed the complaint.because we find that the narrow arbitration clause covers only some of welborn claims,we affirm in part and reverse the remainder of the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings.
to create the medical records necessary for patient care,a medical facility must transcribe the reports,notes,and summaries dictated by health care professionals.in december,welborn,which historically had transcribed,entered into a written contract with the mrc group,under which mrc agreed to perform all transcription services on behalf of welborn at a charge of cents per line transcribed.the form contract was supplied by mrc.under the heading payments and charges the contract included,labeled dispute resolution,which provided in its entirety 
in the event that any invoice amount is disputed by client,client shall deliver written notice of such disputed amount to vendor within ten days of receipt of the invoice by client.in the absence of client timely providing said written notice,client waives any right to dispute said invoice in the future.vendor shall promptly deliver to client any backup or other information which supports the correctness of such disputed amount.upon receipt of such information,client shall have ten days in which to examine such information and to pay to vendor any portion of such disputed amount which client,in its sole discretion,has determined to be substantiated.thereafter,if any dispute still remains with respect to any amount,vendor and client shall immediately enter into good faith negotiations to resolve it.in the event the parties are unable to resolve such dispute within ten days of entering into negotiations,the dispute shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association.such arbitration shall be conducted in the state of ohio.the decision reached through arbitration shall be final and binding on both parties.
soon thereafter,medquist acquired mrc and succeeded to all its rights and obligations under the contract.
medquist began performing under the contract on march.almost immediately,welborn challenged the methods medquist was using to count the number of lines transcribed and to calculate its charges.welborn believed both that medquist was inflating its line count and that it had misrepresented key elements of its counting and billing practices before entering into the contract.this prompted welborn to initiate the dispute resolution procedure by delivering written notice of its disputes to medquist and requesting backup information.medquist refused to provide any backup.when welborn subsequently withheld payment of the disputed invoices in october,medquist stopped performing under the contract and refused to return any medical records it had in its possession.after several rounds of squabbling,welborn exercised its right to cancel the contract.
on may,welborn filed a complaint in the district court alleging breach of contract count i,fraud counts ii,iii,and iv,deceptive trade practices count v,and conversion count vi.it also sought declaratory relief requiring medquist to return welborn medical records.at a pretrial conference,medquist agreed to turn over those records and then moved to dismiss the complaint and compel arbitration.the district court granted medquist motion in its entirety.welborn appeals,claiming both that medquist waived its right to arbitration through its conduct and that some of welborn claims are not subject to the narrow arbitration provision.
like any other contractual right,the right to arbitrate a claim may be waived.grumhaus comerica,cir.we will find waiver when based on all the circumstances,the party against whom the waiver is to be enforced has acted inconsistently with the right to arbitrate.id.at citations and internal brackets omitted.welborn contends that medquist has waived its right to arbitrate through a series of delay tactics and its refusal to participate in informal dispute resolution.
welborn first claims that medquist delay tactics are a form of that is inconsistent with the agreement otherwise valid arbitration clause.a party may waive its contractual right to arbitration either explicitly or through an implicit course of conduct.grumhaus,at hammes aamco transmissions,cir.welborn argues that medquist withholding of medical records,termination of service,and rejection of attempts informally to negotiate the dispute constitute implied waiver.the only two cases it cites for this proposition,however,are grumhaus and hammes,both of which involved situations where the party seeking arbitration had originally filed suit in a judicial forum.grumhaus,at hammes,at.litigating a claim is clearly inconsistent with any perceived right to arbitration we do not want parties to forum shop,taking a case to the courts and then,if things go poorly there,abandoning their suit in favor of arbitration.but medquist never sought to litigate this case in either state or federal court,never resisted any demands by welborn to submit to arbitration,and moved to compel arbitration less than two months after the lawsuit was filed.such conduct seems entirely consistent with a firm commitment to arbitrate.
it is true that lengthy delay can lead to an implicit waiver of arbitration.grumhaus,at.but such delay is normally evidenced by substantial participation in the opposing party litigation.see cabinetree of,kraftmaid cabinetry,cir removal of case to federal court mary med.ctr.of evansville,disco aluminum prods,cir five months of discovery.here medquist moved to compel on june,less than eight months after its initial demand for payment was refused and less than eight weeks after the complaint was filed.efforts,such as selling goods that another party has refused,have also been found to be consistent with a desire to arbitrate.southwest indus.import export,wilmod,cir.this suggests that even tactics like the withholding of important medical records while demanding payment are not automatically enough to constitute an implied waiver of the agreement arbitration provision.
welborn also argues that medquist failure to follow the explicit steps of dictates that it can not now move for arbitration.since medquist did not promptly deliver to welborn any backup information to support the correctness of its disputed amounts or enter into negotiations with welborn,welborn argues,it should not now be permitted to jump ahead to arbitration,the final step in the dispute resolution process.
the district court found that the other steps listed in were not conditions precedent to arbitration.as medquist points out,breach of a contract containing an arbitration clause does not amount to a waiver of arbitration.local union,united packinghouse,food allied workers,needham packing,d.while it is certainly true that an ordinary breach can not constitute a rejection of arbitration,needham and its progeny do not speak to the specific situation where the party seeking arbitration has allegedly breached a part of the arbitration clause itself.one could at least argue that when the party breaches that provision it is acting inconsistently with its right to arbitrate and therefore can not later obligate the party to arbitrate claims.in that respect,the steps in could be viewed as similar to steps in a labor grievance process,where unions and employers must either exhaust a complex range of internal procedures or demonstrate the futility of such remedies before either may seek resolution.see,clayton international union,united,aerospace agric.implement workers of,d hammer international union,united,aerospace agric.implement workers of,cir.based on the pleadings
