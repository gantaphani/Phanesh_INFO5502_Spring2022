a talent agency represented an actor for forty years,receiving a commission of ten percent of all compensation received by the actor under motion picture employment contracts negotiated or procured by the agency.after the actor death,his son,who succeeded to the actor rights under his motion picture employment contracts,ceased to pay the agency commission on profit participation payments received under the employment contracts.the talent agency sought to compel arbitration with the actor son and a loan out company through which the actor periodically provided his services.arbitration was sought under the talent agency contracts with the deceased actor,and under a collective bargaining agreement between the screen actors guild and the talent agency trade association.because neither the son nor the loan out company were parties to any of the agreements under which the talent agency sought arbitration,and because none of the legal principles under which a nonsignatory may be bound to another agreement to arbitrate applies,the trial court erred in granting the talent agency petition to compel arbitration.
factual and procedural background 
real party in interest william morris agency is a talent agency which represented actor walter matthau from until his death in.during the early years,their relationship was governed by written contracts,the last of which expired in.thereafter,the agency relationship continued as before,albeit without a written contract,with william morris receiving commissions equal to ten percent of the gross compensation received by matthau under contracts of employment entered into during the agency relationship.
matthau was a member of the screen actors guild sag,and william morris was and is a member of the association of talent agents ata and its predecessors.the relationship between matthau and william morris was governed by a collective bargaining agreement between sag and ata.the codification of the collective bargaining agreement is known as sag rule g or agency regulations.
rule g includes the basic contract between sag and ata,and governs all aspects of the relationship between an actor and the actor agent,including the form and content of any written contract between actor and agent covering representation in theatrical and television motion pictures.deviations require the written approval of sag.the regulations are extensive,and include provisions on compensation to the agent a percentage of all moneys or other consideration received by the actor,directly or indirectly,under contracts of employment entered into during the term of the agency contract,with a cap of ten percent,and many other matters.rule g,for example,requires all contracts to be in writing,and provides that contracts not in writing or not complying with the regulations are void.the form of contract in rule g provides that the agent is entitled to its commission after the expiration of the contract term for so long a period thereafter as the actor continues to receive moneys or other consideration under or upon employment contracts entered into by the actor during the term 
rule g also contains an arbitration clause,providing in pertinent part as follows 
all disputes and controversies of every kind and nature whatsoever between an agent and his client arising out of or in connection with or under any agency contract between the agent and his client as to the existence of such contract,its execution,validity,the right of either party to avoid the same on any grounds,its construction,performance,operation,breach,continuance,or termination,shall be submitted to arbitration regardless of whether either party has terminated or purported to terminate the same.
although matthau and william morris had no written agency contract after,matthau routinely paid william morris ten percent of his earnings under employment contracts procured and negotiated by william morris for the next thirty years.matthau also received compensation through certain loan out companies through which he rendered his acting services,and these companies likewise paid william morris commissions on monies they received for matthau acting services.after walter matthau death in,his surviving spouse,carol matthau,continued to pay william morris its ten percent commission on profit participation payments and residual interests received by matthau heirs or loan out companies in connection with matthau employment contracts.the loan out companies were combined after matthau death to form one company,called the matthau company tmc,whose president was the matthaus son,charles matthau.
in july,carol matthau died,and charles matthau charles succeeded to her rights in the profit participation payments under walter matthau employment contracts.charles continued to send william morris commissions on compensation received under matthau employment contracts until january.thereafter,charles stopped paying the commissions to william morris.
in december,william morris submitted a statement of claim and demand for arbitration to sag arbitration tribunal,naming as respondents charles matthau,executor of walter matthau estate,and one of the loan out companies.charles took the position no valid contract existed under which william morris could make a claim and declined the arbitration demand.
on june,william morris filed a petition to compel arbitration between william morris,on the one hand,and charles and tmc,on the other,before the sag arbitration tribunal.after a hearing,the trial court granted william morris petition to compel arbitration.its minute order does not state the rationale for its decision 
charles and tmc filed a petition for a writ of mandate,seeking an order directing the trial court to vacate its order compelling arbitration.this court directed william morris to file a preliminary response to the petition.after review of the preliminary response and a reply filed by petitioners,we issued an alternative writ,ordering the trial court to vacate its order or show cause why a peremptory writ requiring it to do so should not issue.william morris filed a written return to the petition,charles and tmc filed a reply,and the order to show cause was heard on march.
we now grant the writ petition.
discussion 
william morris attempt to compel charles and tmc to arbitrate william morris claim for commissions runs aground on a very simple obstacle.a petition to compel arbitration seeks specific performance of an agreement to arbitrate,and neither charles nor tmc is a party to any agreement with william morris.nor is there any legal principle under which they may be bound by walter matthau agreements to arbitrate disputes with william morris.accordingly,the trial court should have denied william morris petition to compel arbitration.we first discuss the legal terrain and then address the arguments raised by william morris.
none of the circumstances in which a nonsignatory may be bound by another person agreement to arbitrate exist in this case.
the applicable legal principles have been stated many times.the right to arbitration depends on a contract,and a party can be compelled to submit a dispute to arbitration only if the party has agreed in writing to do so.arbitration is a favored method of resolving disputes,but the policy favoring arbitration does not eliminate the need for an agreement to arbitrate and does not extend to persons who are not parties to an agreement to arbitrate.boys club of san fernando valley,fidelity deposit th,d boys club.
of course,circumstances exist under which persons who have not signed an agreement to arbitrate are nevertheless bound to do so.indeed,one court,reviewing the cases,observed that,in varying circumstances,california courts have repeatedly enforced arbitration agreements against and in favor of persons who never agreed to arbitrate the dispute.keller construction kashani d.keller.an agent,for example,may have implied authority to agree to arbitration on behalf of its principal.madden kaiser foundation hospitals cal d,an agent or fiduciary who contracts for medical treatment on behalf of his beneficiary retains the authority to enter into an agreement provid
