ernie ruiz brought a complaint against his employer,defendant and appellant sysco food services of san diego sysco,seeking damages for defamation and related tort theories.previously,ruiz,a driver by trade,had been terminated from sysco employment,but was reinstated after he prevailed in a grievance proceeding under the collective bargaining agreement applicable to union employees of sysco.
in response to the filing of this tort action,sysco brought a petition to compel arbitration,asserting that the collective bargaining agreement cba again applied and required arbitration of these tort claims,as inextricably intertwined with the termination,grievance,and reinstatement proceedings.code civ,all further statutory references are to the code of civil procedure unless otherwise noted.the trial court denied the petition,ruling that the arbitration provision in the subject cba did not mandate resolution of this type of claim by arbitration.sysco appeals the order,as well as a related order denying sysco request for monetary sanctions,subd.b.
insofar as the order on review denied the requested monetary sanctions,it was an appropriate application of the statute and is affirmed.however,the balance of the order,denying the petition to compel arbitration,is erroneous as a matter of law and must be reversed with directions to grant the petition to compel arbitration under california law.requiring arbitration under california law is within the scope of the cba arbitration provision and the scope of the original petition to compel arbitration as pled,and is consistent with general federal arbitration act faa policy in favor of arbitration faa et.
factual and procedural background 
as alleged in the complaint,ruiz started working for sysco as a driver in.ruiz had a sysco work jacket that had a rodeo patch which he had won sewed onto it.in,ruiz lent this jacket to a newly hired employee,albert gamez,when gamez was told not to wear a different logo jacket on the job.gamez did not return the jacket despite several requests by ruiz.
by april,gamez had become ruiz supervisor,and ruiz was the union shop steward.when ruiz again asked gamez to return the jacket,he first said it had been thrown away as a filthy rag.then,on april,at the workplace,gamez tossed the jacket onto a counter beside ruiz,made a comment about it not stinking anymore,and left the room.according to ruiz declaration filed during a removal and remand proceeding from federal court,he responded by removing a patch from the jacket with a knife,cutting two rips in the jacket,and then putting the knife and patch away in his briefcase.when gamez returned,he told him that he did not like or respect him and only had to work for him.he says he then tore the jacket with his hands and threw it in the trash,while the knife remained put away.
according to gamez,ruiz cut up the jacket in front of him in a threatening manner.as alleged in the ruiz complaint,gamez falsely stated to his supervisor,william robinson,that ruiz had brandished a knife at him and had cut the jacket with a knife in a slashing manner only a few feet away from him.gamez inquired of robinson whether immediate action was needed under the cba for him to make a complaint.a meeting was immediately held between gamez,ruiz,and the supervisor of robinson,richter.gamez repeated the brandishing allegations.ruiz returned to work and then went home.he was then contacted by richter and told he was suspended pending an investigation.
the complaint further alleges that after ruiz had gone home,sysco employees called the police and gamez repeated the brandishing and slashing allegations.the next day,ruiz was terminated from his position for alleged violent and threatening conduct.
through his union,ruiz filed a grievance,alleging that the discharge was made without just cause within the meaning of the cba.effective september,the arbitrator determined the investigation resulting in plaintiff termination had not been fair and complete under the standards of the cba so as to support the termination of employment.the arbitrator noted that the knife was never recovered and there was a dispute about how big it was and where and how it was used.ruiz was reinstated.
on april,ruiz filed his complaint for damages on theories of defamation,false light,public disclosure of private facts,and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress,all arising out of the investigation and its aftermath.sysco removed this action to federal court and then vigorously,although unsuccessfully,opposed ruiz motion to remand.the record includes a declaration filed by ruiz in support of remand,giving details of the entire jacket incident,including the office discussions and rumors about it,the jacket was hung on an office wall like a trophy,and attached a copy of a sheriff office investigative report filed after sysco reported the incident.the district court remanded the matter,ruling that the defamation and related claims did not arise under or require the interpretation of the cba,and hence there was no basis for jurisdiction in federal court.the district court rulings addressed both the investigation of the knife incident and also the allegation of sysco filing of a false police report on the incident.
back in state court,on january,sysco filed its petition to compel arbitration under the cba,as its first responsive pleading,in lieu of filing a formal answer.opposition was filed,one day late,and the matter went to hearing.sysco objected that the ruiz response should be stricken as untimely,and ruiz counsel explained that he was unable to attend to filing the response in a more timely manner because he was unforeseeably delayed by other business,and contended that no prejudice had ensued.
on march,the trial court issued its telephonic ruling denying the petition to compel arbitration,on the basis that the cba contains no language that compels arbitration of plaintiff claims,the cba does not contemplate resolution of such claims,and these claims arise from allegations outside the investigation conducted by defendant.thus,there is no valid agreement to arbitrate the instant matters.citation.the court also finds plaintiff claims are not subject to the federal arbitration act.faa et the trial court prepared an extensive statement of decision explaining these findings as follows.
first,the court quoted from the cba,article,as follows a grievance shall include any difference of opinion or dispute between the employer and the union or any employee covered by this agreement regarding the interpretation of this agreement.it shall also include any disputed layoff,suspension,dismissal or discharge of any employee who is entitled to contest such action.article then sets forth a process to resolve a grievance,beginning i f a representative of the employer and the union can not settle a grievance as outlined above,the matter may be referred to arbitration 
from that language,the trial court concluded that the arbitration provision in the cba did not mandate resolution of ruiz claims by arbitration,because these claims were of a different nature than the grievance about the termination and discharge.specifically,the trial court noted 
here the gravamen of the complaint does not concern conduct contemplated by the cba.further,a critical distinction exists in the instant matter because plaintiff alleges,and defendant does not dispute,statements regarding plaintiff were made to the police and employees outside defendant investigation.because these statements were unnecessary to perform the investigation they are reasonably characterized as falling outside defendant right to conduct an investigation in the resolution of a grievance.as such,plaintiff instant claims are not inextricably intertwined with consideration of the terms of the cba,and said claims are not contemplated by the cba.
in its ruling,the trial court made two further findings on issues not raised by the parties.it observed that no grievance had been filed by ruiz to invoke any arbitration proceedings on these particular claims.further,the court questioned whether sysco had waived any right to compel arbitration by its actions in originally removing this action to federal court and then vigorously,although unsuccessfully,opposing ruiz motion to remand,subd.a.
finally,in its ruling,the trial court also denied the request by sysco to strike the response to its petition,and to award it for attorney fees,made on the grounds that ruiz responsive papers were not properly before the court because they were unverified and served one day late,subd.b.the ruling states,the court is similarly not inclined to impose defendant requested sanction for filing plaintiff response one day late.there is no prejudice to defendant,and the court is unwilling to effectuate such a measure.
sysco appeals the orders of denial of its petition to compel and the monetary sanctions request.this court issued its original opinion to reverse and compel further proceedings on certain jurisdictional issues,but then granted the sysco petition for rehearing in this case.
discussion 
the parties agree that because the essential background and procedural facts are undisputed,the applicable standard of review for the legal questions presented here is de novo.metalclad ventana environmental organizational partnership th,d norcal mutual insurance newton th,d.whether an arbitration agreement applies to a controversy is a question of law to which the appellate court applies its independent judgment where no conflicting extrinsic evidence in aid of interpretation was introduced in the trial court.citation.brookwood bank of america th,d.
we first address certain foundational issues as already developed in this record,concerning the proper scope of coverage of the arbitration clause in the cba.in part ii,post,we will discuss the question of whether federal or state arbitration law should apply.finally,we address the order denying sysco request for sanctions.pt.iii,post.these resolutions of the issues reflect our grant of the sysco petition for rehearing and opposition received concerning the original opinion issued in this case.
underlying principles established by the record 
the parties have vigorously argued the merits of a number of preliminary procedural and substantive issues regarding the applicability and interpretation of the cba.the main issue is whether the allegations in ruiz complaint fall within the scope of the issues addressed by the cba,such that arbitration may be compelled due to an effective waiver of a judicial remedy.we are also required to dispose of certain preliminary procedural arguments raised by the parties.following that,we may turn to the question of whether any arbitration proceedings should properly take place in a federal or a state forum.
cba coverage 
under both the faa and section of the federal labor management relations act a referred to as section,not every dispute concerning employment or tangentially involving a collective bargaining agreement will be preempted by federal employment or arbitration law.lueck,d.the test to be applied is whether the alleged state law tort invokes nonnegotiable state law rights,independent of any right established by contract,or,instead,whether evaluation of the tort claim is inextricably intertwined with consideration of the terms of the labor contract.ibid.stated another way,to decide whether arbitration of a particular dispute must be compelled under a collective bargaining agreement,a court must determine whether the employee claims derive from,or require interpretation of,his collective bargaining agreement.if they do not,the court must determine whether permitting the state law claims to proceed would infringe upon the arbitration process established by the collective bargaining agreement.tellez pacific gas and,cir,tellez.
the trial court ruled that this grievance and arbitration provision of the cba did not compel the arbitration of ruiz claims defendant does not and can not point to any other provision in the cba which requires arbitration.there is no provision of the cba that contemplates the claims raised by plaintiff in this action.as such,these claims are not disputes regarding the interpretation of the cba,and therefore do not arise under the grievance and arbitration provision of the agreement.
ruiz has based all his causes of action upon alleged defamatory conduct and resulting emotional distress from the employer conduct of the investigation and interviews carried out in connection with the jacket ripping incident,and subsequent notification of the police of the alleged false accusations.these include gamez inquiry of robinson whether immediate action was needed under the cba,and a subsequent meeting between gamez,ruiz,and the supervisor of robinson,richter,at which gamez repeated his brandishing allegations.ruiz went home but was then contacted by richter and told he was suspended pending an investigation.then,sysco employees called the police and gamez repeated the brandishing and slashing allegations.other employees allegedly learned of the incident and heard derogatory comments about ruiz around the office.
because the cba required sysco to conduct a fair and complete investigation of the suspension and termination,to determine if just cause was present,we are required to address whether resolution of these derivative defamation and emotional distress claims will necessarily be inextricably intertwined with consideration of the terms of a labor contract.citation.moreau san diego transit d.moreau.using the procedure set forth in moreau,supra,d,the entire record may be examined,including the allegations in the complaint,as supplemented by the consistent,noncontradictory declarations filed in the removal and remand proceedings.id.at.these show the facts which the plaintiff believes support the finding of the tort and the facts which the defendant may assert in defense.citations.see ford shearson lehman american express,d.
the line between a tort actionable in court and an employment dispute actionable only in a grievance arbitration proceeding is not sharp,except in extreme cases.citation.detomaso pan american world airways,cal d,detomaso.determination of whether resolution of a state tort claim requires interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement,is a function of examining the terms of the agreement,the elements of the tort involved,the facts which the plaintiff believes support the finding of the tort and the facts which the defendant may assert in defense.citation.moreau,supra,d.both express and implied terms of the cba shall be considered.miller v.at t network systems cir,fn.
the definition in the cba,article,of a grievance that may be submitted to arbitration includes any difference of opinion or dispute between the employer and an employee regarding the interpretation of this agreement.specifically,to be supportable under the cba,a termination for just cause must be made after a fair and complete investigation.the arbitrator in the termination proceedings decided that the investigation was inadequate.however,that determination was not concerned with and did not dispose of the current defamation and emotional distress allegations,which address different primary rights.in his response to the petition to compel,ruiz mainly argued that his tort claims were not arbitrable under article of the cba,because it does not specifically address the subjects of defamation or emotional distress.however,this argument fails to recognize that an interpretation of the cba is required to evaluate those specific claims.the cba language is broad enough to cover the subject matter of this complaint.
thus,examination of these undisputed facts results in a conclusion that the express and implied terms of the cba must be considered in determining the merits of these defamation and emotional distress allegations,because they arose in connection with and are inextricable from the actual disciplinary or investigative procedures involved,as set forth in the cba.moreau,supra,d at.it will be necessary to engage in an interpretation of the cba to determine whether the investigation and publications are actionable under the stringent standards applicable to defamation claims actual malice and emotional distress conduct outside the bounds of what a civilized society will tolerate.detomaso,supra,cal d,moreau,supra,d at.because of the factual context and nature of the proceedings in which these claims arose,this is most appropriately done by an arbitrator,not the court system.in this case,evaluation of the tort claim is inextricably intertwined with consideration of the terms of the labor contract.lueck,supra,d.
even though ruiz alleges that sysco published this information beyond the scope of any personnel who were actually involved in personnel management and who therefore had a need to know about such disciplinary matters,he has still failed to make an adequate showing that his alleged injury did not derive from rights created by the cba,to a fair and complete investigation.whether sysco conduct was actionable in this respect must be determined through interpretation of that agreement terms.see tellez,supra,at,fn.as a preliminary matter,therefore,the record demonstrates that these allegations of the complaint generally fall within the scope of the arbitration clause in the cba.
procedural issues 
we next resolve certain other subsidiary arguments on the availability of arbitration,before turning to the federal or state jurisdiction question.contrary to an argument made by ruiz,the trial court was not required or allowed to accord any collateral estoppel effect to the federal district court remand order,which was not a final judgment but rather a procedural order concerning the appropriate forum.when a federal court grants a motion for remand in the present context,it does nothing more than determine the complaint fails,either directly or by operation of the artful pleading doctrine,to state a question arising under federal law.it does not determine whether a preemption defense can be successfully offered in state court when the entire case is considered.moreau,supra,d at.the trial court was not bound to follow the reasoning of the federal district court regarding remand in deciding the petition to compel arbitration.nor was there any waiver by sysco of any right to seek to compel arbitration merely because it opposed ruiz motion to remand the case from federal district court.
next,the trial court should not accept ruiz argument that there was no mandatory agreement to arbitrate,due to the permissive may language in the subject grievance process in the cba.the cba,article,sets forth the definition of a grievance,equivalent to the definition of an arbitrable issue,as follows a grievance shall include any difference of opinion or dispute between the employer and the union or any employee covered by this agreement regarding the interpretation of this agreement.emphasis added.article of the cba also provides i f a representative of the employer and the union can not settle a grievance as outlined above,the matter may be referred to arbitration emphasis added.these provisions in the cba,read in context of the entire agreement,do not provide an optional procedure,but rather set out a mandatory arbitration provision that is properly subject to this motion to compel.there has already been a grievance process and this is the next phase of the dispute.moreover,ruiz contention that there was no mandatory agreement to arbitrate appears to be a new argument on appeal,which is not appropriately addressed here.mayhew benninghoff th,d.
further,the trial court appropriately rejected sysco argument that an arbitrator must be given the initial opportunity to decide the scope of the arbitrable claims.there is no support for such an argument in the language of the cba grievance and arbitration provisions.see carpenters local desert palace,cir.as the trial court correctly noted in its ruling,the provision relied upon by defendant defines the term grievance,and the agreement does not support a clear and unmistakable intent to divest the court of its authority to determine whether arbitration is proper.the trial court properly had the arbitrability question before it.
jurisdictional question potential federal preemption of state law through the faa 
as reflected in our prior opinion,which was vacated upon the grant of the rehearing petition,the parties have acknowledged the record is vague concerning the nature of ruiz employment as a driver for sysco,and whether he drives only within california or participates in interstate commerce in some meaningful way.this factor could affect whether there is any basis to find federal preemption of state arbitration procedures in this case.circuit city stores,adams,d circuit city.on this point,the trial court ruling to deny the petition to compel arbitration was very limited in scope defendant maintains it is a company involved in interstate commerce,but ignores the fact defendant employs plaintiff as a truck driver.
in its petition for rehearing,sysco takes the position that arbitration under california law of these tort claims should be compelled,and no clarification of the type or extent of ruiz job duties is required for purposes of determining if faa or california arbitration law should apply.lagatree luce,forward,hamilton scripps th,d lagatree.in contrast,ruiz argues that no arbitration of his claims should be compelled under either federal or state law,since the faa may preempt state law proceedings,but even then,the faa exemption from arbitration requirements should arguably apply to him as a transportation worker in interstate commerce,leaving no enforceable arbitration agreement.faa.he also argues that the cba arbitration provision does not expressly refer to california law,so california state law is not incorporated into the cba.
we will examine these respective arguments with reference to the policies surrounding arbitration and the specific arbitration clause involved here.as already noted above,due to the nature of ruiz employment and the circumstances under which he was suspended,investigated,terminated,and reinstated,the defamation and tort causes of action asserted here are inextricably intertwined with interpretation of the cba and can not be resolved without reference to and interpretation of it.pt.ia,ante.we have also established that there is a binding and mandatory arbitration clause in the cba,covering the substantive issues.accordingly,the next issues to be addressed are procedural ones whether the faa,section coverage provision must preempt state law procedures which aspect of the faa,section coverage provision,governing procedure or the decision whether to arbitrate,may apply here whether an faa exemption for transportation workers in interstate commerce applies to any such preemption faa,or alternatively,whether california state law arbitration is available regardless of those matters.
types of federal preemption in arbitration context 
the purpose of the faa coverage provision,section,is to compel judicial enforcement of a wide range of written arbitration agreements,even though there was historically a resistance by american courts to the enforcement of arbitration agreements.circuit city,supra.for example,the faa will preempt state laws which require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration.citation.lagatree,supra,th,d.however,an individual may waive by agreement a constitutional right to a judicial forum for the resolution of disputes.id.at,d.
as further explained in volt information sciences leland stanford.university,d,even though the faa will preempt state laws requiring a judicial forum for the resolution of claims,where there is an effective arbitration agreement,it does not follow that the faa prevents the enforcement of agreements to arbitrate under different rules than those set forth in the act itself.indeed,such a result would be quite inimical to the faa primary purpose of ensuring that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their terms where,as here,the parties have agreed to abide by state rules of arbitration,enforcing those rules according to the terms of the agreement is fully consistent with the goals of the faa ibid.
in health net th,d,the appellate court addressed many issues,including choice of law provisions in arbitration agreements.the court identified two types of arbitration clauses referring to state law.in one type,the arbitration clause agreeing to apply state contractual arbitration law may be limited to that law which bears upon how the arbitration shall be conducted.in the second type,an arbitration agreement may state that the contract between the parties will be governed by state law for all purposes,including the determination as to whether or not arbitration is required.id.at,d.in,arbitration was compelled,due to faa preemption of a california statute,section,subdivision c,which would have allowed the california trial court the discretion to disregard an arbitration clause and order joinder of the arbitrable claim and a pending civil action,to avoid potential inconsistent rulings.the particular choice of law provision in the plan before the court expressly limited the application of california law to the manner in which the arbitration is to be conducted.thus,the court held the provision did not apply to the separate determination of whether arbitration would be required or compelled,supra,th,d.
in our case,sysco petition to compel arbitration raised requests both for arbitration under the faa as a federal labor law matter,and under the california arbitration act as a state law interpretation of the cba.sysco argues that ruiz,by being subject to the cba,has effectively waived any judicial forum for his claims,which are inextricably intertwined with matters governed by the cba,and therefore an arbitrator should interpret the cba in light of the facts to be relied on to support those claims,and the facts to be offered by sysco in its defense.moreau,supra,d at.
to analyze this claim,we seek to identify which aspect of the cba arbitration clause is involved here how the arbitration shall be conducted procedure or the initial determination as to whether or not arbitration is required,supra,th at,d.the cba arbitration clause does not refer to california law specifically.it generally provides at article that a grievance shall include any difference of opinion or dispute between the employer and the union or any employee covered by this agreement regarding the interpretation of this agreement.it shall also include any disputed layoff,suspension,dismissal or discharge of any employee who is entitled to contest such action.article then sets forth the process to resolve a grievance,beginning i f a representative of the employer and the union can not settle a grievance as outlined above,the matter may be referred to arbitration 
this arbitration provision clearly refers to the initial determination of whether arbitration shall be compelled,as to the substantive matters raised by the dispute.no specific issue is raised here concerning a california law defense to the compelling of arbitration,as in,supra,th,d,concerning section,subdivision c.rather,ruiz main objection is that his specific tort causes of action are not covered by the cba we have rejected that argument above.we will next discuss his secondary argument,that even if arbitration could otherwise be compelled by the coverage provision of the faa,section,he is nevertheless exempt from it as a transportation worker identified in the faa exemption provision,section.
no exemption under faa section 
the parties here have extensively briefed the issue of whether ruiz employment falls within a certain exemption for transportation workers to the overall applicability of the faa,as recently clarified in case law,circuit city,supra,d.this exemption will limit the scope of the otherwise broad reach of the faa,united states code section,which provides 
a written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction,or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof,or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract,transaction,or refusal,shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.
in reaching its conclusions in circuit city,supra,d,the supreme court analyzed not the basic coverage authorization under of the act,but the exemption from coverage under.the exemption clause provides the act shall not apply to contracts of employment of seamen,railroad employees,or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.most courts of appeals conclude the exclusion provision is limited to transportation workers,defined,for instance,as those workers actually engaged in the movement of goods in interstate commerce.citations.circuit city stores,supra,emphasis added.
in circuit city,supra,d,the supreme court adhered to a narrow interpretation of the faa,section exemption from coverage,by restricting its applicability to transportation workers,in line with most of the federal courts of appeals.this was intended to implement the strong federal presumption in favor of enforcing arbitration agreements.see farac permanente medical group d.as part of its reasoning,the high court took note that there are separate and extensive statutory schemes governing the employment of certain types of transportation workers,such as seamen and railroad workers.this bolstered its conclusion that the faa excludes from its reach contracts of employment of transportation workers.circuit city,supra,at.the court only comment about the scope of the transportation worker exemption was as follows 
it is reasonable to assume that congress excluded seamen and railroad employees from the faa for the simple reason that it did not wish to unsettle established or developing statutory dispute resolution schemes covering specific workers.as for the residual exclusion of any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce,congress demonstrated concern with transportation workers and their necessary role in the free flow of goods explains the linkage to the two specific,enumerated types of workers identified in the preceding portion of the sentence.it would be rational for congress to ensure that workers in general would be covered by the provisions of the faa,while reserving for itself more specific legislation for those engaged in transportation.citation.circuit city,supra,d.
in circuit city,supra,d,the supreme court was dealing with issues concerning a nontransportation employee a salesperson,and the enforceability of separate arbitration agreements.therefore,the court was not required to decide the scope of the transportation workers exemption from the coverage of the faa,and it did not do so.
as already observed,the sparse record in this case makes it difficult to apply this transportation worker exemption language.faa.however,as we will next discuss,whether or not it would be proper to compel arbitration under the faa coverage provision faa,a separate and dispositive issue is presented as to whether arbitration should be compelled under california law.
in some cases,the question of the faa applicability appears to be academic.as one court has recognized i t is unclear what difference it would make if this case were deemed to be outside the scope of the faa.the parties agreement would still be a contract that waives the employee right to a judicial forum for claims and agrees to submit those claims to arbitration.the employer would still have the right to seek enforcement of that contract.although the applicability of the faa may be significant in the sense that the statute prescribes certain procedural rules that might not otherwise obtain,we have little doubt that,even if an arbitration agreement is outside the faa,the agreement still may be enforced citation.assuming arguendo that the faa does not apply,we would assess the validity of the parties arbitration agreements under the california arbitration act caa citation.like the faa,the caa provides a written agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy thereafter arising is valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revoc
