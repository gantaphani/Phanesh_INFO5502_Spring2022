the important question presented in this appeal is whether the warranty act permits or prohibits the enforcement of binding arbitration clauses within written warranties.we hold that the warranty act permits binding arbitration and that a written warranty claim arising under the warranty act may be subject to a valid binding arbitration agreement.
background 
in october,michael shane davis and heather davis the davises purchased a manufactured home constructed by southern energy homes,southern.when the davises purchased the home,they signed a binding arbitration agreement contained within the manufactured home written warranty.the davises later discovered multiple defects in the home and notified southern of the problems.after southern failed to correct the defects to the davises satisfaction,the davises filed suit in the circuit court of lowndes county,alabama,asserting claims for breach of express and implied warranties,violations of the commission act mmwa or the act,negligent and wanton repair,and fraud.southern removed the case to federal court and,in lieu of an answer,filed a motion to dismiss or,in the alternative,to compel arbitration.the district court,relying on its prior decision in yeomans homes of legend,wl.march,which found that the mmwa prohibits binding arbitration,denied southern motion.southern timely appealed the district court order denying southern motion to compel arbitration.
whether southern waived its right to appeal the district court order denying its motion to compel arbitration when southern conceded that the district court was bound by its prior decision in yeomans.

iv.discussion 
waiver of right to appeal 
the davises contend that southern waived its right to appeal by acknowledging to the district court that the court was bound by its prior holding in yeomans.we disagree that southern waived its right to appeal.southern argued in its initial motion and brief to the district court that yeomans and the cases yeomans relies upon are incorrect.southern,therefore,maintained its position and did not waive its right to appeal.thus,we must consider the merits of this appeal.
b.the mmwa and binding arbitration of written warranty claims 
in this appeal,southern argues that,based upon the strong federal policy of enforcing valid arbitration agreements under the federal arbitration act faa,the davises must submit their written warranty claims to binding arbitration rather than file suit for breach of warranty.to support this argument,southern notes that the supreme court continually enforces binding arbitration agreements of statutory claims and argues that the mmwa is similar to these other statutes because nothing in the mmwa text,legislative history,or underlying purposes evinces that congress intended to preclude binding arbitration of written warranty claims.southern also asserts that the federal trade commission ftc regulations and interpretations,which prohibit binding arbitration of mmwa claims,are unreasonable,and thus,we should accord them no deference.
the davises,conversely,assert that arbitration is an improper forum for mmwa claims and that the act language,legislative history,and underlying purposes compel a conclusion that dispute settlement procedures can not be binding under the mmwa.the davises argue that a of the mmwa,which states that consumers must resort to a warrantor informal dispute settlement mechanism before commencing a civil action,necessarily implies that the decision of any informal settlement procedure may not be binding.they reason that congress use of different terminology to describe the settlement procedures of a throughout the mmwa text and legislative history,combined with the absence of any statutory definition for the terms,establishes that congress used the terms dispute settlement procedures and dispute settlement mechanisms only as generic terms,and thereby included binding arbitration as a type of alternative dispute resolution procedure.the davises also argue that this court must defer to the ftc regulations,which reject binding arbitration of written warranty claims arising under the mmwa,because the ftc reasonably interpreted the mmwa in these regulations.
we recognize that state and federal courts are sharply divided on whether the mmwa permits binding arbitration of written warranty claims.compare boyd homes of legend,remanded on jurisdictional grounds,cir,wilson waverlee homes,rhode e t,d,pitchford oakwood mobile homes,d,parkerson smith,so d,browne kline tysons imports,d,and borowiec gateway,d,with southern energy homes,ard,so d,results oriented,crawford,aff,in re american homestar of lancaster,and howell cappaert manufactured,so d.the fifth circuit is the only circuit court to directly address this issue and,in a divided panel decision,it held that the mmwa permits binding arbitration.see walton rose mobile homes llc,cir after a thorough review of the mmwa and its legislative history,the faa and the supreme court application of the faa to other federal statutes,we conclude that the mmwa permits the enforcement of valid binding arbitration agreements within written warranties.
congress passed the mmwa in in response to an increasing number of consumer complaints regarding the inadequacy of warranties on consumer goods.see,reprinted in.the purpose of the mmwa is to improve the adequacy of information available to consumers,prevent deception,and improve competition in the marketing of consumer products a.in order to advance these goals,d of the mmwa provides a statutory private right of action to consumers damaged by the failure of a supplier,warrantor,or service contractor to comply with any obligation under this chapter,or under a written warranty,implied warranty,or service contract id.d.consumers may sue for a mmwa violation in either state or federal court.id.
in order to encourage settlements by means other than civil lawsuits,a allows a warrantor to include a provision for an informal dispute settlement mechanism in a warranty.id.a see also,reprinted in,congress declares it to be its policy to encourage warrantors to establish procedures whereby consumer disputes are fairly and expeditiously settled through informal dispute settlement mechanisms.although the mmwa does not define informal dispute settlement procedure,it does provide that if a warrantor incorporates a a informal dispute settlement procedure into the warranty,the provision must comply with the minimum requirements that the ftc prescribes.a.if the informal dispute settlement procedure properly complies with the ftc minimum requirements,and if the written warranty requires that the consumer resort to such procedure before pursuing any legal remedy under this section respecting such warranty,the consumer may not commence a civil action under subsection d of this section unless he initially resorts to such procedure id.a.
congress enacted the faa in to reverse the longstanding judicial hostility towards arbitration and to place arbitration agreements on the same footing as other contracts.eeoc waffle house,d citing gilmer lane,d.section of the faa provides 
a written provision in any contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction,or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof,or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract,shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.
the supreme court has interpreted of the faa as a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.
generally,a court should enforce an arbitration agreement according to its terms,and no exception exists for a cause of action founded on statutory rights.mitsubishi motors soler,d holding that the act itself provides no basis for disfavoring agreements to arbitrate statutory claims by skewing the otherwise hospitable inquiry into arbitrability.in every statutory right case that the supreme court has considered,it has upheld binding arbitration if the statute creating the right did not explicitly preclude arbitration.see gilmer,at.at holding that courts should enforce binding arbitration agreements regarding claims arising under the adea rodriguez de quijas express,d holding that courts should enforce agreements to arbitrate claims under the securities act of express,mcmahon,d holding that courts should enforce agreements to arbitrate securities exchange act of claims and racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act claims mitsubishi motors,at.at holding that courts should enforce arbitration of sherman antitrust act claims in international transactions.having made the bargain to arbitrate,the party should be held to it unless congress itself has evinced an intention to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue.mitsubishi motors,at.at.thus,unless congress has clearly expressed an intention to preclude arbitration of the statutory claim,a party is bound by its agreement to arbitrate.id 
mcmahon test 
turning to whether congress intended to preclude arbitration of a statutory claim,we follow the supreme court mcmahon test.mcmahon,at.at.in mcmahon,the supreme court instructed us to consider three factors in deducing congress intent the text of the statute its legislative history and whether an inherent conflict between arbitration and the underlying purposes of the statute exists.id.at.at.the party opposing the enforcement of the arbitration agreement has the burden of showing that congress intended to preclude arbitration of the statutory claim.id.in applying the mcmahon test,questions of arbitrability must be addressed with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration.gilmer,at.at quoting moses cone mem l,at.at.thus,we analyze each factor in turn to determine whether congress clearly expressed an intention to preclude binding arbitration of mmwa claims.
mcmahon factor one mmwa text 
the mmwa text does not expressly prohibit arbitration and,in fact,fails to directly mention either binding arbitration or the faa.nevertheless,the davises argue that the mmwa reserves strictly a judicial forum for consumers by providing a private right of action for consumers.the supreme court,however,has held that a statute provision for a private right of action alone is inadequate to show that congress intended to prohibit arbitration.gilmer,at.at rejecting the argument that binding arbitration is improper because it deprives claimants of the judicial forum provided for by the adea.as the fifth circuit recently recognized,binding arbitration generally is understood to be a substitute for filing a lawsuit,not a prerequisite.walton,at citing mitsubishi motors,at.at by agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim,a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than judicial,forum.furthermore,the fact that the mmwa grants a judicial forum with concurrent jurisdiction in state and federal courts for mmwa claims is insufficient evidence that congress intended to preclude binding arbitration.see mcmahon,at.at rejecting the argument that compulsory arbitration under the securities exchange act of is improper because the statute provides that t he district courts of the united states shall have exclusive jurisdiction of violations of this title see also gilmer,at.at noting that congress grant of concurrent jurisdiction in state and federal courts for adea claims is consistent with binding arbitration because arbitration agreements,like the provision for concurrent jurisdiction,serve to advance the objective of allowing claimants a broader right to select the forum for resolving disputes,whether it be judicial or otherwise quoting rodriguez de quijas,at.at.
the davises also argue that because d lists only two exceptions to the private right of action,the internal dispute settlement procedure referenced in a and the class action exception referenced in e congress intended to preclude any other method of dispute resolution,including binding arbitration.see transamerica mortgage advisors,lewis,d w here a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies,a court must be chary of reading others into it.when a statute limits a thing to be done in a particular mode,it includes the negative of any other mode.internal quotations and citations omitted.the a exception to a consumer private right of action states that,if a warrantor establishes an informal dispute settlement procedure,a consumer must resort to the procedure before pursuing any legal remedy under this section respecting such warranty.a c.section a also states that the consumer may not commence a civil action unless he initially resorts to such procedure and that i n any civil action arising out of a warranty obligation and relating to a matter considered in such a procedure,any decision in such procedure shall be admissible in evidence.id.based on this language,the davises assert that congress intended to allow only alternative dispute resolution procedures.we disagree.
in cunningham fleetwood homes of,we noted that the district court erred in concluding that,standing alone,the presence of the mechanism in the statutory text requires the conclusion that claims may not be the subject of binding arbitration agreements,cir.the fact that the mmwa regulates a informal dispute settlement procedures does not mean that the act precludes a court from enforcing a valid binding arbitration agreement.see id.at noting that a statute provision for one settlement mechanism does not necessarily preclude the enforcement of all alternative mechanisms see also gilmer,at.at holding that the adea provision for dispute resolution is not inconsistent with permitting arbitration under the faa and that it even suggests that dispute resolution,such as arbitration,is consistent with the statutory scheme established by congress.thus,we are unpersuaded that congress intended to bar binding arbitration agreements in the language of the mmwa.
mcmahon factor two legislative history 
the second factor the supreme court instructs us to examine in determining congress intent to preclude the application of the faa is the mmwa legislative history.see mcmahon,at.at.like the mmwa text,its legislative history only addresses internal dispute settlement procedures it never directly addresses the role of binding arbitration or the faa.in trying to show that congress intended to bar binding arbitration,the davises rely on the mmwa house report,which notes that a n adverse decision in any informal dispute settlement proceeding would not be a bar to a civil action on the warranty involved in the proceeding,reprinted in,the davises argue that congress considered all methods of dispute resolution,including arbitration,before allowing warrantors to pursue only informal,settlement procedures.after a thorough reading of the mmwa legislative history,we disagree.
the davises have proved only that the mmwa legislative history is ambiguous at most.when considering a preliminary draft of the mmwa,the senate reflected that it is congress intent that warrantors of consumer products cooperate with government and private agencies to establish informal dispute settlement mechanisms that take care of consumer grievances without the aid of litigation or formal arbitration,at emphasis added.as the fifth circuit concluded,there is still no evidence that congress intended binding arbitration to be considered an informal dispute settlement procedure.therefore the fact that any informal dispute settlement procedure must be,does not imply that congress meant to preclude binding arbitration,which is of a different nature.walton,at.in mcmahon,the supreme court upheld binding arbitration even though the securities exchange act of legislative history implied t
