background 
the riches are residents of louisville,kentucky.as a employee of worldcom,worldcom,rich was provided with stock options as part of her compensation.beginning in,employees of worldcom desiring to exercise their stock options were required to do so through the atlanta,georgia office of ssb.on july,and again on july,rich exercised stock options and immediately sold the acquired shares.thereafter,ssb proposed an exercise and hold plan the plan for worldcom employees.through the plan,the employees would exercise their options and hold the shares for later sale pending anticipated increases in share prices.by holding the shares long enough,the employee shareholders would be able to have the increase in value taxed at capital gain rates.
in august of,the riches subscribed to the plan by opening an account with ssb.they allege that they were advised in all matters relating to their account by spartis and elias.on august,rich exercised options for shares of worldcom stock at for shares and for shares.the closing price for each share that day was.the riches held their shares after financing the acquisition with funds borrowed from ssb by means of a margin account.on october,rich exercised options for shares of worldcom stock at an acquisition cost of per share.the closing price per share on that date was.the riches again paid for the shares through the margin account that they had established and again held the acquired shares as they claim they were advised to do.
on august,rich sold shares of worldcom stock and used the proceeds to purchase shares of sprint,sprint on that date.allegedly,rich was advised that the exercise and hold strategy would be advanced by the sprint purchase,since it was anticipated that sprint would be merged into worldcom.on january,rich exercised options to purchase shares of worldcom at per share.the closing price per share on that day was.to finance this purchase,the riches again used their margin account to borrow the necessary funds from ssb.rich exercised options through the ssb plan one more time.on april,she exercised options for shares of worldcom at per share,with the closing price on that day being per share.this transaction also was financed through the margin account.
the riches received margin calls in august and september of and responded with cash and securities,including liquidation of securities held in their account,to meet the calls.they first liquidated their shares of sprint and then began to sell the worldcom shares to meet the margin calls.the riches sold a total of shares of worldcom between september and september.on september,they directed the sale,pursuant to a order,of the remaining shares of worldcom in their account.the stock was sold that day for per share.the riches paid ssb over in brokerage commissions and nearly in margin interest during the thirteen months they maintained their account at ssb.the riches saw their worldcom stock fall from to per share during that period.they saw the price of their sprint stock fall from per share on the date of purchase to on the date of sale,august.attributing their losses to the investment advice provided by ssb and its registered representatives,spartis and elias,the riches demanded arbitration of their claims for the losses sustained by filing a statement of claims against ssb with nasd dispute resolution.named as respondents in the arbitration were ssb,spartis,elias,and three other employees of ssb who were dismissed as respondents prior to the arbitration award.
the statement of claims was filed on june,and included,generally,the historical facts described above.as claimants in the arbitration,the riches sought compensation from the respondents for failing to advise them,inter alia,as to the facts that would enable them to adequately assess the risks of the ssb option plan the risks of drops in the stock prices of worldcom and sprint presented by the plan the risks posed by failing to diversify their stock holdings the risks of utilizing a margin account a suitable investment strategy other than the ssb option plan and the conflict of interest stemming from the relationship between worldcom and ssb as underwriter,market maker,and employer of telecommunications analyst jack grubman.the riches also charged ssb and the manager of the atlanta office with failing to adequately supervise spartis and elias.detailed bases for the riches claims were set forth in six separate counts of the statement of claims.they included i lack of suitability ii lack of supervision iii dishonest and unethical practice iv breach of fiduciary duty v negligence and vi gross negligence.compensatory damages of were claimed,along with punitive damages,attorneys fees and costs,and interest.
substantially denying the allegations made in the statement of claims,ssb filed its statement of answer with affirmative defenses on september.a statement of answer with motion to dismiss and,filed by spartis and elias on september,included affirmative defenses,denials of the allegations in the statement of claims,an application for dismissal of the claim,and a request for indemnification relief from ssb.all parties concerned executed uniform submission agreements submitting the riches claims to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the nasd.on april,the nasd convened a arbitration panel in louisville,kentucky.the panel,constituted according to nasd rules,consisted of robert ross,designated public arbitrator,presiding chair,amelia adams,designated public arbitrator,and todd parker lowe,designated arbitrator.testimony was taken and various motions were made at hearings that were held from april to april,and on december and.sworn as witnesses were spartis elias william hobby and michael grace,employees of ssb rich craig mccann,a securities consultant and john fazio,senior vice president of citigroup.
on december,counsel for spartis and elias brought to the panel attention the lack of any evidence that rich had opted out of the worldcom securities class action,a necessary element to succeed in her arbitration claim.see in re worldcom sec,wl,at.the district court had certified the plaintiff class in the worldcom securities litigation on october.see in re worldcom.sec.a notice of class action was disseminated to the plaintiff class on december.the citigroup defendants,including ssb,entered into a proposed class settlement with the lead plaintiff on or about july,and a notice of proposed settlement was distributed to the class on august.the district court in the southern district of new york ultimately set september,as the firm date for potential class members to seek exclusion from the plaintiff class.
on november,approximately one month prior to the final session of the arbitration panel considering the claims of the riches,the district court issued its judgment approving settlement and dismissing action against the citigroup defendants in the securities class action case.see in re worldcom sec.the judgment enjoined class members from instituting,commencing or prosecuting,either directly or in any other capacity,any claim arising out of the matters giving rise to this action.id.at.released claims is defined in the judgment to include 
a ll claims arising out of or relating to investments including,but not limited to,purchases,sales,exercises,and decisions to hold in securities issued by worldcom,in options or derivative instruments based in whole or in part on the value of securities issued by worldcom,including without limitation all claims arising out of or relating to any analyst research reports or other statements made or issued by the citigroup defendants concerning worldcom 
id.at a.released parties was defined to include ssb as well as its former employees.
after hearing arguments on december,regarding the effect of the foregoing judgment on the arbitration proceeding,the presiding chair of the arbitration panel stated as follows 
here my ruling we go ahead,and we will finish this arbitration and we will reach a decision.i presume that the respondents can go to the court in the class action and say,here the arbitrators decision hold it void,because she a member of the class.that being so,we will attempt to reach our decision based upon,one,it not be void and,two,it being void.so we will thinking right now,we are going to reach a decision,and i thinking right now we will have two decisions.one as it relates to worldcom and everything else in the account one as it relates not to worldcom and the class action suit,so that if they do go to void,there will be a remainder of the decision that remains valid.
the arbitration panel issued its award on january,finding ssb,spartis,and elias jointly and severally liable to the riches for in compensatory damages,in prejudgment interest,in attorneys fees,and in costs,with interest to be paid at the rate of per annum if the award were not paid within days.the panel dismissed with prejudice the of spartis and elias for indemnification.although the panel did not provide a statement of the reasoning behind its compensatory damages determination,it did include in its award a case summary that included the following language claimants alleged that respondents gave them unsuitable investment advice to purchase worldcom stock by means of a margin account with money borrowed from salomon smithy sic barney.claimants also alleged that respondents never discussed the risks associated with the holding of the worldcom shares.
by an action filed in the circuit court of the commonwealth of kentucky,jefferson county,on january,the riches sought confirmation of the award.on february,the action thereafter was removed to the united states district court for the western district of kentucky at the behest of spartis and elias.on february,while the action to confirm was pending in federal court in kentucky,counsel for spartis and elias,by letter to judge cote of the southern district of new york,who had directed the entry of judgment approving the settlement in the worldcom class securities action,advanced the argument that the judgment barred the enforcement of the arbitration award and requested the court to schedule a conference.in response,the district court in new york on february,ordered the riches to show cause why they should not be enjoined from enforcing their nasd arbitration award against spartis and elias.by letter dated february,citigroup sought to join in the application made by spartis and elias.
at the show cause hearing held before the district court on february,the riches conceded that they should be enjoined from enforcing any portion of their award that related to their investments in worldcom securities.accordingly,the district court,by order dated march,enjoined the riches from seeking to enforce the award with respect to all claims of every nature and description,known and unknown,arising out of or relating to investments including,but not limited to,purchases,sales,exercises,and decisions to hold in securities issued by worldcom.the injunction order included the following provision it is hereby ordered that the arbitration panel that issued the award is not enjoined from clarifying whether any portion of the award relates to claims not covered by the rich injunction.
it appears that the nasd provided the panel with a copy of the foregoing order.upon application of citigroup,and after receiving the submissions of the parties in connection with their quest for clarification as permitted by the district court,the panel on march,issued,without explanation,a decision determin ing that the motion for clarification is denied.thereafter,the united states district court for the western district of kentucky,where the action to confirm the award remained pending,transferred the action to the southern district of new york by order dated april.the kentucky court,citing,determined that the interest of justice and the convenience of parties would be served by the transfer because the new york court could decide both issues of whether to confirm the award and whether confirmation violates the injunction.it would be inconvenient and a waste of the parties time to litigate these issues in two separate cases.
spartis and elias thereafter moved in the southern district of new york to vacate the arbitration award in its entirety.on march,the district court issued its memorandum,order and opinion vacating the award insofar as it provided for recovery of damages by the riches and confirming the award insofar as it denied the of spartis and elias.the district court determined that the award to the riches was intended to compensate them only for losses arising out of the advice that rich exercise her options and hold the stock in worldcom.see in re worldcom sec,wl,at.according to the district court,that advice was the focus of the claim,the evidence at the hearing,and the summation arguments of counsel.id.
turning to the award itself,the district court found that t he award own description of the claims focused exclusively on worldcom and described no other stock.id.in the opinion of the district court,the decision of the arbitration panel to issue just one award,having recognized its power to issue two awards,and then to decline to clarify the award after the arbitrators were informed that no recovery could be had for worldcom losses,provided further evidence that the entirety of the award was for worldcom trading losses.id.the district court concluded that the award of damages to the riches must be vacated on the ground that the arbitrators exceeded their authority when they granted damages to the riches based on their worldcom trading losses.id.in confirming the dismissal of the of spartis and elias,the district court concluded that,g iven the strong presumption of regularity to which an arbitration award is entitled,spartis and elias have not shown that the panel lacked authority to issue an award and that the dismissal of their should be vacated.id.
this timely appeal and from the judgment of the district court followed.
on appeal,the riches again acknowledge that they can not recover for their losses in worldcom,but they contend that other losses in their ssb account justify the award made by the arbitration panel.although ultimately vacating the arbitration award in their favor,the district court recognized that as a theoretical matter,the losses sustained by the riches were large enough to permit the to be attributed to losses.id.but there is more than a theoretical basis for seeing the award as encompassing losses attributable to securities in the riches account other than worldcom.for one thing,mccann,damages expert for the riches,testified before the panel that his report,with exhibits showing the losses in the riches account,would enable the panel to separate the worldcom losses from losses
