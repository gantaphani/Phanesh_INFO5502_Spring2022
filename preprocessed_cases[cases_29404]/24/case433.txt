this appeal arises from a civil suit initiated by the government in november in the district of maryland,on behalf of the federal emergency management agency fema,against bankers insurance company.in its complaint,the government asserts three common law theories of recovery,plus a separate statutory claim under the false claims act,fca.bankers sought to stay the litigation proceedings pending arbitration,but the district court denied its stay request.bankers has appealed the district court ruling pursuant to a a authorizing interlocutory appeals to review denials of motions to stay proceedings pending arbitration.for the reasons explained below,we reverse and remand.
bankers is a private insurance company that sells and administers flood insurance policies through the national flood insurance program nfip in,the federal insurance administration fia,which is charged by fema with administration of the nfip,see,established the wyo program,under which commercial insurance companies sell and administer flood insurance policies to the public.see.bankers has been a participant an insurer and a wyo company in the wyo program since its inception,when bankers entered into a financial arrangement arrangement with fema and the fia.according to the complaint,bankers and the government renewed the arrangement annually from until.the arrangement,which tracks a form agreement promulgated and mandated by fema in the code of federal regulations,governs the terms and conditions of all wyo program insurers in their sale and administration of federal flood insurance.see app.of significance to this appeal,both the arrangement and the form agreement contain the following arbitration provision 
if any misunderstanding or dispute arises between the company bankers and the fia with reference to any factual issue under any provisions of this arrangement such misunderstanding or dispute may be submitted to arbitration for a determination that shall be binding upon approval by the fia.
in its complaint,the government has sued bankers for a variety of alleged contract breaches stemming from a course of conduct beginning in fiscal year and lasting until september.the complaint asserts,inter alia,that bankers failed to turn over to the government all interest earned on nfip funds under the arrangement,and also that bankers failed to provide the fia with true and accurate information regarding administration of the nfip and the interest earned on nfip funds.the four bases for recovery embodied in the complaint are violation of the false claims act count i,breach of contract count ii,negligent misrepresentation count iii,and unjust enrichment count iv bankers responded to the complaint by filing its motion to stay the proceedings pending arbitration under article viii of the arrangement.the district court,by letter opinion of march,the order,denied the stay request and allowed the government suit to proceed without arbitration of its claims.
in the order,the district court correctly observed that,as a general proposition,there is a heavy presumption of arbitrability.order,at citing american recovery computerized thermal imaging,cir.the court ruled,however,that traditional principles governing arbitration have no application to a suit brought by a federal agency asserting,inter alia,a claim under the false claims act.order,at.while this appeal appears to present a question of first the existence of an fca claim precludes arbitration of a contract dispute involving the address this issue with substantial guidance.the federal courts have on numerous occasions spoken on issues relating to arbitration and the obligations of the government when it enters into contracts with private parties.
bankers advances several contentions in support of its position that the arbitration provision contained in the arrangement is binding in this case.first,bankers asserts that the applicable authorities prescribe that arbitration clauses similar to that in this that speak permissively,may be submitted to arbitration are in fact typically construed as mandatory arbitration clauses.second,bankers contends that the district court erred when it ignored the heavy presumption of arbitrability simply because this litigation involves the assertion of an fca claim.finally,bankers stresses that,since all claims in the complaint arise from the arrangement,each including the fca claim must be submitted to arbitration pursuant to the arbitration agreement.
the government counters by echoing the reasoning of the district court,and it revives an argument presented not addressed court below sovereign immunity.the government contends that sovereign immunity precludes application of the arbitration agreement absent the government current consent to arbitrate.additionally,the government opposition to arbitration is premised on the permissive nature of the arbitration provision and the nfia specific statutory prohibition against binding arbitration finally,the government asserts that since the attorney general was not a party to the arrangement,he can not be bound to arbitrate an fca claim arising thereunder.
under the federal arbitration act faa,a court is required to stay any suit or proceeding pending the arbitration of any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration.because ascertaining the scope of an arbitration agreement is primarily a task of contract interpretation,we review de novo a district court determination of the arbitrability of a dispute.see cara notions,hallmark cards,cir.however,in applying common law principles of contract interpretation to the interpretation of an arbitration agreement within the scope of the faa,due regard must be given to the federal policy favoring arbitration,and ambiguities as to the scope of the arbitration clause itself resolved in favor of arbitration.volt info.sciences,bd.of trustees of leland stanford,d internal citations omitted see also moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d a ny doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.if the issues in the case are within the contemplation of the arbitration agreement,the faa provision is mandatory,and there is no discretion vested in the district court to deny the stay.in re complaint of hornbeck offshore,cir see also hooters of,phillips,cir.
the government first contends that it has not waived its sovereign immunity,and therefore it can not be forced to engage in the arbitration process contemplated in the arrangement.we see the government reliance on the doctrine of sovereign immunity as misplaced,and in these circumstances it borders on frivolous.the government prepared the terms of the its arbitration imposed them,through its wyo program,on bankers the government now purports not to be bound by its own words,leaving it free to litigate at its whim.sovereign immunity is not a sword,but a shield and as a shield it means simply that the united states can not be sued at all without the consent of congress.block north dakota,d.sovereign immunity does not permit the government to sue a third party and then pick and choose the judicial constraints and contractual obligations with which it will abide.see guaranty trust united states.by voluntarily appearing in the role of suitor the sovereign abandons its immunity from suit and subjects itself to the procedure and rules of decision governing the forum which it has sought.
put simply,the doctrine of sovereign immunity is not in any way implicated or threatened by the government compliance with its contract obligations.when the government chooses to seek damages in a civil action,all abide by the law,including an arbitration process to which it is contractually bound.
because sovereign immunity does not apply here,our ultimate question is simply phrased must the government comply with its contract responsibilities under the arbitration agreement in the arrangement in addressing this question we focus on and analyze several issues.
first of all,the arbitration agreement in question does not specify that arbitration must occur,but instead uses permissive language any such misunderstanding or dispute may be submitted to arbitration emphasis added.the use of the term may in article viii of the arrangement requires us to determine whether arbitration is mandatory when it is sought prior to litigation.second,we must decide whether the arbitration agreement is enforceable notwithstanding that the arbitration proceeding provided the arrangement and in the statutory provisions of the on the government.third,we consider whether the existence of the fca claim precludes arbitration in this case,in light of the attorney general special authority to enforce the statute.
although the arbitration provision of the arrangement is framed in permissive terms,its use of permissive phraseology is not dispositive.in austin glass container,cir,we had occasion to review and interpret a similar arbitration provision.we held that a clause providing that disputes may be referred to arbitration has the effect of giving an aggrieved party the choice between arbitration and abandonment of his claim,he may either arbitrate or abandon the claim.id.at.as judge widener properly observed,the contrary interpretation would render the arbitration provision meaningless for all practical purposes,since parties could always voluntarily submit to arbitration.id.
second,other courts have had the opportunity to construe comparable permissive arbitration agreements and have reached similar conclusions.see american italian pasta austin,cir holding the phrase if both parties agree to be a mandatory arbitration provision ceres marine terminals,int l longshoremen ass n,cir may refer the grievance to arbitration is mandatory local,rko,cir may submit to arbitration is mandatory bonnot cong.of indep.unions local,cir blackmun,the obvious purpose of the may language is to give an aggrieved party the choice between arbitration or the abandonment of its claim.
it is well settled that,when the united states is a party to a contract,ordinary principles governing contracts and their interpretation remain applicable.see lynch united states.indeed,the supreme court recently reaffirmed this principle in united states winstar,d.as justice souter succinctly stated w hen the united states enters into contract relations,its rights and duties therein are governed generally by the law applicable to contracts between private individuals.id.quoting lynch,at.our decision in austin was premised on the ordinary principles of contract interpretation referred to by the court in winstar,which apply regardless of the identity of the parties to the arbitration agreement.we have no reason not to apply those principles in this case 
in asserting that the arbitration agreement should not be applied here,the government also points out that the nfia specifically precludes arbitration that is binding on the government.see b.an arbitration agreement under the nfia is therefore fia director must approve an arbitration award,decision,or recommendation before it is permitted to become final.id.hence,the government claims that the arbitration agreement embodied in the arrangement should not be enforced because it will not resolve its dispute with bankers.
in addressing this contention,we first observe that the nfia does not preclude mandatory arbitration it only precludes arbitration from being binding on the government.mandatory arbitration,as a prerequisite to initiation of litigation,and binding arbitration,where the parties must accept an award or decision of the arbitrator,are two different things.although arbitration may turn out to be a futile the fia can ultimately reject an arbitrator fact does not,as a legal matter,preclude a arbitration agreement from being enforced.see wolsey,foodmaker,cir holding arbitration clause to be enforceable amf brunswick,court could compel the parties to submit their dispute to third party for an advisory opinion under the faa.the government,however,contests this point also,asserting that arbitration unlikely or unable to resolve the issue fully is,by its very nature,unenforceable.see brennan king,cir refusing to enforce arbitration clause because arbitrator lacked authority to resolve substantive issues dividing the parties and because,even if the arbitrator were able to resolve the issue in the employee favor,the employer could reject the decision.
whether an agreement to enter into a arbitration process is enforceable under the faa is a matter not in the federal courts,and we have not yet directly addressed the question.see wolsey,at noting that issue is unsettled,but favoring the view that the faa applies to arbitration.some courts have chosen to focus on whether the arbitration process is likely to resolve the issues,and whether the parties agree not to pursue litigation until the process is completed.id.quoting harrison nissan motor,cir.in evaluating a similar issue,judge weinstein observed,the arbitrator decision need not be binding as long as there are reasonable commercial expectations that the dispute will be settled by this arbitration.amf.at.
the foregoing discussion,however,simply emphasizes the unusual nature of the circumstances underlying this appeal.on the one hand,bankers asserts that the arbitration process will likely resolve this case,in part because the arbitration proceeding will include the fia.bankers points out that the fia has intimate knowledge of the programs at issue,and it is familiar with bankers practices over the years.appellant reply,at.on the other hand,the to avoid believe either that arbitration will be unsuccessful or that any resort to the arbitration process weakens its bargaining position 
the government position,viewed in a pragmatic manner,makes some sense.if the government is opposed to arbitration and can reject an arbitration award or decision,the arbitration process is unlikely to provide a resolution to this case.american.communication workers of,cir refusing to enjoin union protest activities pending arbitration,because in addition to failing to provide a resolution to the dispute,it would delay the union exercise of meaningful activities.however,because the government would presumably act reasonably and rationally,and would approve an arbitration award or decision that it found favorable,we are unable to conclude that arbitration proceedings would be futile.
finally,the government contends that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable because of the peculiar nature of an fca claim,and also because the attorney general was not a party to the arrangement.the government argues that,as a to the arrangement,the attorney general is not bound by the terms of the arbitration provision,in light of his exclusive statutory authority to enforce the fca and the permissive nature of the arbitration agreement.the district court accepted this rationale,concluding that,notwithstanding the rule that arbitration agreements are to be construed liberally,the government involvement as a plaintiff in this case mandated that the arbitration provision be construed narrowly.order,at.
because ordinary principles of contract law must be applied,the attorney general involvement in this case does not mandate the result sought by the government.first,the role of the attorney general relates not only to his obligations under the fca,but also to his more general obligation to bring actions on behalf of the united states in support of government agencies.see granting the attorney general and the department of justice exclusive power to direct litigation involving the united states.at bottom,the attorney general rights and responsibilities under the arrangement are derivative of fema and the fia,and he possesses no right to ignore the arbitration agreement that these agencies do not also possess.
second,if we were to rely on the attorney general presence as counsel in this litigation to allow him to ignore the arbitration agreement,we would run afoul of applicable precedent.for example,no party suing on a contract should be able to enforce certain contract provisions while simultaneously attempting to avoid the terms of an arbitration provision contained therein.see int l paper schwabedissen maschinen anlagen gmbh,cir holding that it would both disregard eq
