this matter comes to us after the court of appeal reversed an order of the trial court that denied the petition of defendant pacificare of california pacificare to compel arbitration.the central issue is whether pacificare waived its contractual right to arbitration pursuant to a clause contained in a health services contract with plaintiff saint agnes medical center saint agnes.relying on bertero superior court d.bertero,the trial court found that a waiver occurred when pacificare filed a separate lawsuit that purported to repudiate the health services contract.the court of appeal disagreed,finding bertero unpersuasive in light of subsequent case law.
we agree that bertero analysis is outdated and should be disapproved to the extent it holds that a party repudiation of a contract categorically precludes it from invoking an arbitration clause therein.we also find that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the undisputed facts here is that pacificare did not waive its contractual right to arbitration and that therefore its petition to compel arbitration should have been granted.we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
factual and procedural background 
in march,pacificare filed a lawsuit in los angeles county superior court against saint agnes and others to resolve disputes about the parties contractual rights and obligations under a health services agreement entered in the hsa and a second health services agreement entered in june the june hsa pacificare complaint alleges that the june hsa is void ab initio due to a condition subsequent.among other things,the complaint seeks a judgment declaring the june hsa void ab initio and declaring its rescission,and enforcement of the parties rights under the hsa as if the june hsa never existed.
in april,saint agnes responded by filing the instant action in fresno county against pacificare and others,seeking damages and other relief for pacificare wrongful conduct in allegedly breaching the june hsa.
in june,over pacificare objections,saint agnes prevailed on its motion to transfer the venue of pacificare los angeles lawsuit to fresno county meanwhile,pacificare unsuccessfully moved to transfer the venue of saint agnes fresno action to orange county.
as relevant here,the june hsa contains a clause providing that a ny controversy,dispute or claim arising out of the interpretation,performance or breach of this agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration at the request of either party.the hsa contains no such clause.
on july,pacificare sent a letter to saint agnes requesting that saint agnes voluntarily submit seven of the causes of action in its fresno complaint to arbitration on the ground that they arose out of the interpretation,performance or breach of the june hsa and therefore fell within the scope of that contract arbitration clause.pacificare offered,on the same ground,to arbitrate six of the causes of action in its los angeles lawsuit.saint agnes responded it could not agree to arbitration at that time.
on july,some four months after it initiated the los angeles lawsuit,pacificare filed a petition to compel arbitration of portions of the fresno action and to stay proceedings.pacificare grounded its petition in the california arbitration act code civ,et all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise indicated,the federal arbitration act et the faa,and the arbitration clause in the june hsa.saint agnes opposed arbitration,contending that pacificare had waived its right to invoke arbitration by expressly repudiating the june hsa and seeking its judicial rescission on the ground it was void ab initio.saint agnes also claimed that pacificare delay in seeking arbitration caused it to incur substantial legal fees and costs with respect to both the fresno and los angeles lawsuits.
the trial court denied the petition to compel arbitration,finding that pacificare los angeles complaint show ed a clear attempt to repudiate the june hsa and that its filing of suit was inconsistent with any intent to invoke arbitration.because pacificare initiated the los angeles action before seeking to compel arbitration,the trial court concluded that saint agnes could seek relief in the courts,and that once it did so,pacificare may not retract its repudiation of the contract and insist on arbitration.
the court of appeal reversed the trial court judgment and remanded with directions to grant pacificare petition.concluding that the record does not establish as a matter of law that pacificare waived its right to compel arbitration,the appellate court held the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to stay proceedings and order arbitration.we granted saint agnes petition for review.
discussion 
the court of appeal determined the record sufficiently establishes that the june hsa involves interstate commerce and therefore falls within the provisions of the faa.see.saint agnes does not dispute that determination,and pacificare expressly agrees with it.although the faa generally preempts any contrary state law regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements rosenthal great western fin.securities cal th,d,the federal and state rules applicable in this case are very similar.
as relevant here,the faa provides a written provision in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction,or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.a district court,upon being satisfied that the issue in controversy is arbitrable,shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement,providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.
in california,section similarly provides a written agreement to submit to arbitration a controversy thereafter arising is valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.section provides in relevant part on petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy,the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists,unless it determines that a the right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner or b grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement 
for purposes of this case,there is no dispute that authorized agents of saint agnes and pacificare signed the june hsa on their behalf,and no dispute that those entities,by signing that contract,agreed to its written terms,including the arbitration clause the principal question is whether or not pacificare waived its contractual right to arbitration we start by setting forth the rules governing waiver of arbitration agreements and the appropriate standard of review.
as mentioned,the faa permits a party to obtain a stay of judicial proceedings pending arbitration unless such party is in default of that right.although this principle of default is akin to waiver,the circumstances giving rise to a statutory default are limited and,in light of the federal policy favoring arbitration,are not to be lightly inferred.microstrategy,lauricia cir.accordingly,a party who resists arbitration on the ground of waiver bears a heavy burden id.at walker bradford cir,and any doubts regarding a waiver allegation should be resolved in favor of arbitration see moses cone hospital mercury constr,d.
our state waiver rules are in accord.state law,like the faa,reflects a strong policy favoring arbitration agreements and requires close judicial scrutiny of waiver claims.christensen dewor developments cal d.although a court may deny a petition to compel arbitration on the ground of waiver,subd.a,waivers are not to be lightly inferred and the party seeking to establish a waiver bears a heavy burden of proof.christensen dewor developments,supra,cal d at,see also doers golden gate bridge.dist.cal d,doers.
both state and federal law emphasize that no single test delineates the nature of the conduct that will constitute a waiver of arbitration,engalla,supra,cal th at,d,martinez scott specialty gases,th,d adams merrill lynch pierce fenner smith cir,timothy mccarthy construction cir,brownyard maryland casualty.in the past,california courts have found a waiver of the right to demand arbitration in a variety of contexts,ranging from situations in which the party seeking to compel arbitration has previously taken steps inconsistent with an intent to invoke arbitration citations to instances in which the petitioning party has unreasonably delayed in undertaking the procedure.citations.the decisions likewise hold that the bad faith or wilful misconduct of a party may constitute a waiver and thus justify a refusal to compel arbitration.citations.engalla,supra,cal th at,d,quoting davis blue cross of northern california cal d.
in sobremonte superior court th,d,the court of appeal referred to the following factors in determining waiver,a court can consider whether the party actions are inconsistent with the right to arbitrate whether the litigation machinery has been substantially invoked and the parties were well into preparation of a lawsuit before the party notified the opposing party of an intent to arbitrate whether a party either requested arbitration enforcement close to the trial date or delayed for a long period before seeking a stay whether a defendant seeking arbitration filed a counterclaim without asking for a stay of the proceedings whether important intervening steps,taking advantage of judicial discovery procedures not available in arbitration had taken place and whether the delay affected,misled,or prejudiced the opposing party.sobremonte superior court,supra,th at,d,quoting peterson,cir.we agree these factors are relevant and properly considered in assessing waiver claims.
generally,the determination of waiver is a question of fact,and the trial court finding,if supported by sufficient evidence,is binding on the appellate court.platt pacific,andelson,supra,cal th at,d,see also engalla,supra,cal th at,d.when,however,the facts are undisputed and only one inference may reasonably be drawn,the issue is one of law and the reviewing court is not bound by the trial court ruling.platt pacific,andelson,supra,cal th at,d.in the case before us,the essential facts are not disputed.
as reflected by its order,the trial court waiver finding was based on the circumstances that by seeking declaratory relief that the june hsa is void ab initio,pacificare essentially contends and asserts that the contract is invalid and unenforceable and although pacificare did not initiate the fresno action,it initiated the los angeles lawsuit and at no time sought to invoke the contractual right to arbitration before doing so.
saint agnes agrees that a waiver occurred,observing that pacificare total repudiation of the june hsa,its initiation of the los angeles action,and its attempts to force litigation in the judicial venues it preferred,all amounted to conduct inconsistent with a right to arbitrate.saint agnes also contends the court of appeal erred when it reversed the trial court order on the ground that saint agnes had not established prejudice resulting from pacificare delay in seeking to compel arbitration.
we address these matters below.
pacificare challenge to the validity of the june hsa 
the trial court order states pacificare essentially contends and asserts that the june hsa is invalid and unenforceable.pacificare acknowledges that it seeks to have the june hsa declared void ab initio and to have the parties rights under the hsa enforced as if the later contract never existed.
under the authority of bertero,supra,d,the trial court ruled that pacificare waived its arbitration rights by repudiating the very contract from which those rights originated.bertero,apparently,has never been disapproved or criticized by any subsequent decision or secondary authority.
in bertero,an employee and his employer signed a written employment contract and a written modification of that contract,both of which contained an arbitration clause.although they adhered to the contractual terms for several years,the employer eventually sent the employee a letter claiming the modified contract was invalid and unenforceable.the employee sued to enforce the contract and the employer sought to compel arbitration.bertero,supra,d at.
relying on corbin on contracts and decisions from other states,bertero held that the employer repudiation of the entire employment contract deprived it of any right to rely on any provision of the contract,including its arbitration clause t o say in a letter that the contract is invalid and unenforceable could mean only that it created no rights or duties which either party could stand upon.bertero,supra,d at.bertero rejected the argument that the letter meant that the employee asserted right to contract benefits was invalid but that the employer right to arbitration was not invalid,remarking,no more precise and emphatic language could have been chosen to notify bertero that the company was declaring its independence without qualification or reservation.when national said the agreement was not enforceable,it was saying that the portion relating to arbitration was not enforceable.id.at.thus it is not because national has repudiated its promise to pay bertero salary,but because it has repudiated its promise to arbitrate,that bertero was justified in resorting to the courts.id.at.
although bertero appears to support a waiver finding here,significant developments in the law have occurred since when that case was decided.both federal and california law now hold that,in the absence of a specific attack on an arbitration agreement,such agreement generally must be enforced even if one party asserts the invalidity of the contract that contains it.
significantly,a few years after bertero the united states supreme court decided prima paint flood conklin,d prima paint.that decision recognized the principle that except where the parties otherwise clauses as a matter of federal law are separable from the contracts in which they are embedded,and that where no claim is made that fraud was directed to the arbitration clause itself,a broad arbitration clause will be held to encompass arbitration of the claim that the contract itself was induced by fraud.prima paint,supra,at.quoting and thereafter adopting the view of the second circuit court of appeals.in concluding that federal courts may consider a claim of fraud in the inducement of an arbitration clause itself,but not a claim of fraud in the inducement of the contract generally,the high court sought to honor the plain meaning of the faa and also the unmistakably clear congressional purpose that the arbitration procedure,when selected by the parties to a contract,be speedy and not subject to delay and obstruction in the courts.prima paint,supra,at.
the logic of prima paint has led many courts,including this one,to hold that contractual arbitration clauses generally must be enforced where one of the parties seeks rescission of the entire contract on the basis that it allegedly was induced by fraud,mistake,or duress,or where an alleged breach of a warranty or other promise justifies the aggrieved party in putting an end to the contract,ericksen,arbuthnot,mccarthy,kearney walsh,oak street cal d,fraudulent inducement claim is subject to arbitration large conseco finance servicing cir,mere assertion of statutory right of rescission does not undo obligation to take rescission claim to arbitration burden check into cash of kentucky,llc cir,claim of illegality coleman prudential bache securities,cir,claims of fraudulent inducement and coercion mesa operating.partnership louisiana intrastate gas cir,claim of illegality see also rosenthal great western fin.securities,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
as we explained,the central rationale of prima paint was that an arbitration clause is separable from other portions of a contract,such that fraud in the inducement relating to other contractual terms does not render an arbitration clause unenforceable,even when such fraud might justify rescission of the contract as a whole.rosenthal great western fin.securities,supra,cal th at,d.by entering into the arbitration agreement,the parties established their intent that disputes coming within the agreement scope be determined by an arbitrator rather than a court this contractual intent must be respected even with regard to claims of fraud in the inducement of the contract generally.ibid.in light of prima paint and its progeny,we disapprove bertero superior court,supra,d,to the extent it holds that a party assertion of the invalidity of an entire contract categorically waives that party right to arbitrate pursuant to a provision in that contract.
here,the june hsa names pacificare and saint agnes as contracting parties and reflects the signatures of both parties agents.neither party challenges its assent to the june hsa nor does either specifically challenge the arbitration clause contained therein.indeed,pacificare filed a declaration claiming it had performed its obligations according to the terms of the june hsa prior to notifying saint agnes and others in march that it considered the contract terminated due to a condition subsequent.consequently,the record makes reasonably clear pacificare position that it could properly view the june hsa as terminated or void due to an event transpiring after its effective date.on this record,prima paint recognition of the separable nature of arbitration agreements compels us to conclude that the arbitration clause in the june hsa is sufficient to require arbitration of saint agnes claims relating to that contract.
seizing on pacificare allegations in the los angeles lawsuit that the june hsa is void ab initio and pacificare concession that it seeks damages for breach of the hsa as if the later contract never existed,saint agnes argues this situation falls within an exception to the prima paint line of cases.specifically,saint agnes points to authorities holding or recognizing that because arbitration is a matter of contract,a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute that it did not agree to so submit,rosenthal great western fin.securities,supra,cal th,d,banner entertainment,superior court th,d sandvik ab advent international cir three valleys municipal water district hutton,cir.in those cases,the issue was not whether the underlying contract was merely voidable,but rather whether any contract had ever existed.rosenthal great western fin.securities,supra,cal th at,d,parties opposing arbitration claimed contracts were void for fraud in their execution or inception banner entertainment,superior court,supra,th at,d while evidence showed plaintiff oral agreement to specified dealings with defendant,it failed to show any agreement,oral or otherwise,to arbitrate sandvik ab advent international,supra,at party moving for arbitration alleged that individual who signed agreement on its behalf lacked authority to do so three valleys municipal water district hutton,supra,at party resisting arbitration claimed contract was invalid because unauthorized individual signed it.
the decisions saint agnes cites have a logical rationale if a party can show that it did not know it was signing a contract,or that it did not enter into a contract at all,both the contract and its arbitration clause are void for lack of mutual assent.see rosenthal great western fin.securities,supra,cal th at,d,banner entertainment,superior court,supra,th at,d sandvik ab advent international,supra,at three valleys municipal water district hutton,supra,at.but that rationale has no application here because,notwithstanding pacificare use of certain legal terminology,neither pacificare nor saint agnes denies its knowing and voluntary agreement to the june hsa and the terms it contained.moreover,pacificare petition to compel arbitration reflects its apparent position that it considered itself bound to perform under the june hsa at least until march,when it notified saint agnes that the contract was terminated.accordingly,this is not a case where mutual assent to the subject contract and its terms was lacking.
in sum,we conclude that pacificare legal challenge to the validity of the june hsa is not inconsistent with an intent to invoke arbitration pursuant to that contract.contrary to saint agnes contentions,pacificare repudiation as such does not amount to a waiver of its contractual arbitration rights.
pacificare initiation of the los angeles lawsuit 
doers,supra,cal d,held that the mere filing of a lawsuit does not waive contractual arbitration rights.doers,at,see also kalai gray th,d johnson siegel th,d accord,merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith lecopulos cir,chatham shipping fertex steamship cir,realco enterprises,merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,and cases cited therein.although doers phrased the issue as one of waiver,we more recently characterized the critical issue there as whether a party filing of a lawsuit in the face of an agreement to arbitrate was conduct so inconsistent with the exercise of the right to arbitration as to constitute an abandonment of that right.platt pacific,andelson,supra,cal th at,d.
in finding that the filing of a lawsuit,without more,does not result in a waiver and is not so inconsistent with the exercise of the right to arbitration as to constitute an abandonment of that right,doers disapproved several court of appeal decisions that had misinterpreted other precedents holding only that waiver occurs when the parties have litigated the merits of the arbitrable dispute.doers,supra,cal d at.doers reiterated the rule that a waiver generally does not occur where the arbitrable issues have not been litigated to judgment.id.at.
here,pacificare did not initiate the instant fresno action,in which it seeks to compel arbitration.pacificare did,however,initiate the los angeles action to have the june hsa declared void ab initio and to enforce its rights under the hsa,a contract that contains no arbitration clause and that allegedly governs the parties rights and obligations if the june hsa were to be found unenforceable.significantly,saint agnes arbitrable causes of action have not been litigated to judgment or judicially addressed on their merits.consistent with doers,we conclude that pacificare mere filing of the los angeles action did not constitute a waiver of its right under the june hsa to seek arbitration in this fresno action.accord,american recovery computerized thermal imaging,cir,lawrence comprehensive business services cir,christensen dewor developments,supra,cal d at,waiver found where plaintiff knew of existence of arbitration clause and arbitrability of its claims,but filed suit without first demanding arbitration and pursued litigation through several demurrers for admitted purpose of obtaining verified pleadings from defendants that would reveal their legal theories,resulting in lost evidence.
charles rounds joint council of teamsters cal d,charles rounds does not compel us to hold otherwise.in that case,the trial court had dismissed a plaintiff employer contract action against a defendant union on the ground that the dispute at issue was covered by an arbitration clause in the agreement.as relevant here,the issue presented was whether the relief granted was proper in this of the whether a stay of judicial proceedings pending arbitration should have been granted.charles rounds,supra,cal d at.we upheld the dismissal,observing that the only matter in dispute came within the scope of the arbitration clause,that the plaintiff had never attempted to pursue its arbitration remedy despite the defendant efforts to obtain arbitration,and that because the plaintiff sought relief that traditionally was within an arbitrator power to award,dismissal of the action,rather than a mere stay of proceedings,was proper.id.at.
saint agnes appears to read charles rounds as precluding any party who repudiates arbitration by filing a lawsuit from ever enforcing its contractual arbitration rights.in particular,saint agnes relies on a passage i
