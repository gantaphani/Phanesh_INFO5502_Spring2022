the legislature recently enacted senate bill reg.sess.senate bill,which requires counties and other local agencies to submit,under certain circumstances,to binding arbitration of economic issues that arise during negotiations with unions representing firefighters or law enforcement officers.code civ,et we must determine whether this legislation violates either or both of two provisions of article xi of the california constitution section,subdivision b,states that a county governing body shall provide for the compensation of employees.section,subdivision a,forbids the legislature to delegate to a private person or body power to interfere with county or municipal corporation money or perform municipal functions.
we conclude,as did the court of appeal,that senate bill violates both constitutional provisions.it deprives the county of its authority to provide for the compensation of its employees,subd.b and delegates to a private body the power to interfere with county financial affairs and to perform a municipal function,subd.a.
facts and procedural history 
riverside county the county and the riverside sheriff association sheriff association engaged in negotiations over compensation for employees of the probation department.in may,they reached an impasse.the sheriff association requested that the dispute be submitted to binding arbitration pursuant to code of civil procedure section et.the county refused,claiming that those provisions violate the california constitution.the sheriff association filed an action in the superior court to compel arbitration.the court ordered arbitration.it found the binding arbitration law constitutional,explaining,the matters at issue,to wit,the possible disruption of law enforcement and firefighter services,are not matters of purely local concern but rather are of statewide concern.this statewide concern authorizes the legislature to act and supports the constitutionality of this legislation.
the county filed a petition for a writ of mandate in the court of appeal asking that court to order the superior court to set aside its order compelling arbitration and enter a new order denying the motion to compel arbitration.the court of appeal granted the petition.it found that senate bill violates both section,subdivision b,and section,subdivision a.we granted the sheriff association petition for review.
ii.discussion 
background 
senate bill,entitled arbitration of firefighter and law enforcement officer labor disputes,added section et to the code of civil procedure.stats,ch.the court of appeal opinion describes the bill senate bill empowers unions representing public safety employees to declare an impasse in labor negotiations and require a local agency to submit unresolved economic issues to binding arbitration.each party chooses an arbitrator,who together choose the third arbitrator.the panel then chooses,without alteration,between each side last best offer,based on a designated list of factors.code civ.the bill applies to any local agency or any entity acting as an agent of a local agency,but it does not apply to the state of california even acting as such an agent.code civ,subd.c.
senate bill includes legislative findings.the legislature hereby finds and declares that strikes taken by firefighters and law enforcement officers against public employers are a matter of statewide concern,are a predictable consequence of labor strife and poor morale that is often the outgrowth of substandard wages and benefits,and are not in the public interest.the legislature further finds and declares that the dispute resolution procedures contained in this title provide the appropriate method for resolving public sector labor disputes that could otherwise lead to strikes by firefighters or law enforcement officers.it is the intent of the legislature to protect the health and welfare of the public by providing impasse remedies necessary to afford public employers the opportunity to safely alleviate the effects of labor strife that would otherwise lead to strikes by firefighters and law enforcement officers.code civ.
the county argues that the legislature compelling it to enter into binding arbitration of compensation issues violates section,subdivision b,and section,subdivision a.at the outset,we emphasize that the issue is not whether a county may voluntarily submit compensation issues to arbitration,whether the county may delegate its own authority,but whether the legislature may compel a county to submit to arbitration involuntarily.the issue involves the division of authority between the state and the county,not what the county may itself do.see adams wolff d,the predecessor version of section,subdivision a,is a restraint on the state legislature right to interfere with municipal affairs and in no way regulates what may be done by a municipal corporation by charter provision.
in deciding whether the legislature has exceeded its power,we are guided by well settled rules of constitutional construction.unlike the federal constitution,which is a grant of power to congress,the california constitution is a limitation or restriction on the powers of the legislature.citations.two important consequences flow from this fact.first,the entire authority of the state,except the people right of initiative and referendum,is vested in the legislature,and that body may exercise any and all legislative powers which are not expressly or by necessary implication denied to it by the constitution.citations.in other words,we do not look to the constitution to determine whether the legislature is authorized to do an act,but only to see if it is prohibited.citation.secondly,all intendments favor the exercise of the legislature plenary authority if there is any doubt as to the legislature power to act in any given case,the doubt should be resolved in favor of the legislature action.such restrictions and limitations imposed by the constitution are to be construed strictly,and are not to be extended to include matters not covered by the language used.methodist hosp.of sacramento saylor cal d,accord,pacific legal foundation brown cal d.on the other hand,we also must enforce the provisions of our constitution and may not lightly disregard or blink at a clear constitutional mandate.amwest surety ins.wilson cal th,d.
we discuss the two provisions in the order in which they appear in the california constitution,mindful,however,that ultimately we must view them together as a whole and not in isolation.lungren deukmejian cal d.
section,subdivision b 
section,subdivision b,provides as relevant the governing body of each county shall provide for the number,compensation,tenure,and appointment of employees.the county argues that senate bill violates this provision by compelling it to submit to binding arbitration of compensation issues.we agree.the constitutional language is quite clear and quite specific the county,not the state,not someone else,shall provide for the compensation of its employees.although the language does not expressly limit the power of the legislature,it does so by necessary implication.methodist hosp.of sacramento saylor,supra,cal d at.an express grant of authority to the county necessarily implies the legislature does not have that authority.but senate bill compels the county to enter into mandatory arbitration with unions representing its employees,with the potential result that the arbitration panel determines employee compensation.senate bill permits the union to change the county governing board from the body that sets compensation for its employees to just another party in arbitration.it thereby deprives the county of the authority that section,subdivision b,specifically gives to counties.
any doubt in this regard is dispelled on reviewing the history behind section,subdivision b.see estate of griswold cal th,d.that provision was originally enacted in june of,as part of a comprehensive revision of article xi,governing the constitutional prerogatives of and limitations on california cities and counties.voters for responsible retirement board of supervisors cal th,d.its immediate predecessor,former section,had been amended in to give greater local autonomy to the setting of salaries for county officers and employees,removing that function from the centralized control of the legislature.voters for responsible retirement board of supervisors,supra,at,d,italics added.the amendment transferred control over the compensation of most county employees and officers from the legislature to the boards of supervisors.cal th at,d.the court of appeal in this case explained further the ballot argument in favor of the amendment put to the voters as proposition informs the voters that,this is a county home rule measure,giving the county board of supervisors complete authority over the number,method of appointment,terms of office and employment,and compensation of all employees.ballot,special june,argument in favor of.the ballot argument adds that taking these powers from the state legislature will bring the matter closer home,and will make possible adjustments of salaries and personnel in accordance with local desires ballot,special june,argument in favor of.
the sheriff association argues that senate bill is valid because it involves a matter of statewide concern.it cites the legislative findings in support of the bill,including that strikes taken by firefighters and law enforcement officers against public employers are a matter of statewide concern,and that the dispute resolution procedures the bill establishes provide the appropriate method for resolving public sector labor disputes that could otherwise lead to strikes by firefighters or law enforcement officers.code civ.these findings are entitled to great weight.baggett gates cal d.but they are not controlling.a court may not simply abdicate to the legislature,especially when the issue involves the division of power between local government and that same legislature.the judicial branch,not the legislative,is the final arbiter of this question.san francisco labor council regents of university of california cal d,sonoma county organization of public employees county of sonoma cal d,fn.i t may well occur that in some cases the factors which influenced the legislature to adopt the general laws may likewise lead the courts to the conclusion that the matter is of statewide rather than merely local concern.bishop city of san jose cal d.but the legislature view is not determinative of the issue as between state and municipal affairs t he legislature is empowered neither to determine what constitutes a municipal affair nor to change such an affair into a matter of statewide concern.ibid.
the sheriff association cites two cases that permitted the legislature to regulate relations between local governmental entities and their employees.in baggett gates,supra,cal d,we held that the public safety officers procedural bill of rights act,which,as its name suggests,provides procedural protections to public safety officers,applies to chartered cities despite the home rule provisions of the current section,subdivision b citing professional fire fighters,city of los angeles cal d,we said that general laws seeking to accomplish an objective of statewide concern in that case,creating uniform fair labor practices may prevail over conflicting local regulations even if they impinge to a limited extent upon some phase of local control.baggett gates,supra,at,italics added.we found that the maintenance of stable employment relations between police officers and their employers is a matter of statewide concern.id.at.similarly,in people ex rel.seal beach police officers city of seal beach cal d,we held that a charter city is subject to the requirements of the act,et.
the sheriff association argues,it is well established that the legislature may regulate labor relations in the public sector because it is a matter of statewide concern.we agree that the legislature may regulate as to matters of statewide concern even if the regulation impinges to a limited extent baggett gates,supra,cal d at,on powers the constitution specifically reserves to counties or charter cities.however,regulating labor relations is one thing depriving the county entirely of its authority to set employee salaries is quite another.
in sonoma county organization of public employees county of sonoma,supra,cal d at page,we noted that section expressly gives charter cities authority over their employees compensation.because of this constitutional mandate,as well as prior authority,we held that the determination of the wages paid to employees of charter cities as well as charter counties is a matter of local rather than statewide concern.sonoma county organization of public employees county of sonoma,supra,at.accordingly,we found unconstitutional government code section,which prohibited the distribution of certain state funds to local public agencies that granted their employees increases,despite a legislative declaration that the statute was a matter of statewide concern.sonoma county organization of public employees county of sonoma,supra,at.for similar reasons,and despite a similar legislative declaration,we later invalidated legislation requiring the university of california to pay its employees at least prevailing wages.san francisco labor council regents of university of california,supra,cal d at.
sonoma county organization of public employees county of sonoma,supra,cal d,and san francisco labor council regents of university of california,supra,cal d,control this case.in baggett gates,supra,cal d at page,we distinguished those two cases by noting that the public safety officers procedural bill of rights act,which was limited to providing procedural safeguards,impinges only minimally on the specific directives of section,subdivision b.especially pertinent here,we stressed that the act does not interfere with the setting of peace officers compensation.ibid.by contrast,senate bill does not minimally impinge on a specific constitutional directive it contravenes that directive entirely.section,subdivision b,specifically directs that counties have authority over the compensation of their employees senate bill takes that authority away from counties.
similarly,in people ex rel.seal beach police officers city of seal beach,supra,cal d,the law in question did not establish a binding process but merely imposed procedural requirements.while the legislature established a procedure for resolving disputes regarding wages,hours and other conditions of employment,it did not attempt to establish standards for the wages,hours and other terms and conditions themselves.id.at.we found no conflict between the city constitutional powers and the limited state regulation.although the law in issue encourages binding agreements resulting from the parties bargaining,the governing body of the agency retains the ultimate power to refuse an agreement and to make its own decisions.id.at.here,the county governing body does not retain the ultimate power senate bill gives that power to an arbitration panel at the behest of the union.
we have emphasize d that there is a clear distinction between the substance of a public employee labor issue and the procedure by which it is resolved.thus there is no question that salaries of local employees of a charter city constitute municipal affairs and are not subject to general laws.sonoma county organization of public employees county of sonoma,supra,cal d at.nevertheless,the process by which the salaries are fixed is obviously a matter of statewide concern and none could,at this late stage,argue that a charter city need not meet and confer concerning its salary structure.people ex rel.seal beach police officers city of seal beach,supra,at,fn,accord,voters for responsible retirement board of supervisors,supra,cal th at,d.senate bill is not merely procedural it is substantive.it permits a body other than the county governing body to establish local salaries.
the sheriff association also notes that section,subdivision b,states that the governing body shall prescribe the compensation of its members subject to referendum but shall provide for the compensation of its employees.it argues that the word prescribe empower s the designated entity to determine the amount of compensation for the designated officials.however,provide means to compensate so they are available for use,and not necessarily determine the amount of compensation.thus,the sheriff association appears to argue that the legislature,or someone else,may set salaries for county employees,and section,subdivision b,merely empowers the county to pay those salaries.it relies on historical evidence indicating that the constitution revision commission had used the words prescribe and provide rather than regulate,as in the amendment to former section differentiate between those matters that may,and those that may not,be delegated.see county of madera superior court d,fn.the argument fails.
whether the county may delegate its own authority is irrelevant here.this county has chosen not to delegate its authority over employee salaries.as noted,the issue involves the distribution of authority between county and state,not what the county itself may do.use of the words prescribe and provide did not change the previous law regarding the respective powers of the legislature and counties.section,adopted at the same time as section,subdivision b,provides the provisions of sections b except for the second sentence of this article relating to matters affecting the distribution of powers between the legislature and cities and counties shall be construed as a restatement of all related provisions of the constitution in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this amendment,and as making no substantive change.italics added.the language of section,subdivision b,empowering the county to provide for the compensation of employees,is in its last sentence,not its second.accordingly,section,subdivision b,did not change the law regarding the distribution of power between the counties and the legislature.see voters for responsible retirement board of supervisors,supra,cal th at,d.former section used the single word regulate,which,as its history demonstrates,includes the setting of salaries.
the sheriff association also cites an unpublished decision by the court of appeal that decided this case that it believes somehow supports its position.unpublished opinions,however,generally may not be cited or relied on in another action.cal.rules of court,rule a.the sheriff association invokes an exception to this general rule,claiming the opinion is relevant under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.cal.rules of court,rule b.however,for collateral estoppel to apply,the issue necessarily decided in the previous action must be identical to the one in the current action.county of santa clara deputy sheriffs cal th,fn,d,people sims cal d.the issue here is whether senate bill is constitutional.that bill,or anything like it,did not even exist in.although the opinion contains some language that might be pertinent to this case,and that either party might have cited had the opinion been published,the issue it the local referendum quite different than the one here.accordingly,collateral estoppel does not apply,and the unpublished opinion may not be cited.
for these reasons,we agree with the court of appeal senate bill removes from local jurisdictions,at the option of public safety unions,the authority to set the compensation of public safety employees that is expressly given to them by section,subdivision b.this clearly violates section,subdivision b.
section,subdivision a 
section,subdivision a,provides the legislature may not delegate to a private person or body power to make,control,appropriate,supervise,or interfere with county or municipal corporation improvements,money,or property,or to levy taxes or assessments,or perform municipal functions.the county argues that in enacting senate bill,the legislature has impermissibly delegated to a private arbitration power to interfere with county money by potentially requiring the county to pay higher salaries than it chooses and to perform municipal functions determining compensation for county employees.again,we agree.this constitutional provision expressly denies the legislature the power to act in this way.methodist hosp.of sacramento saylor,supra,cal d at.
the sheriff association primarily argues that this delegation of authority to the arbitration panel is permissible because the delegation does not involve a purely municipal function but a matter of statewide concern.in people ex rel.younger county of el dorado cal d,we upheld legislation designed to encourage regional planning in the lake tahoe area,including creation of the tahoe regional planning agency with jurisdiction over the entire multicounty region.the county of el dorado contended,among other things,that the legislation violated former section,the predecessor version of section,subdivision a,by impermissibly delegating authority to a special commission noting that the lake tahoe region crosses county lines,we stated that our cases have recognized that former section was intended to prohibit only legislation interfering with purely local matters.people ex rel.younger county of el dorado,supra,at.it does not invalidate delegation to accomplish purposes of more than purely local concern.id.at.
the sheriff association argues that because of the threat to the public safety caused by work stoppages,all matters concerning firefighters and peace officers are of statewide concern that the state may delegate as it thinks best.we disagree.section,subdivision a,gives charter cities general authority over municipal affairs.although the term municipal affairs is slightly different than section,subdivision a term municipal functions,we believe that cases interpreting what are municipal affairs provide guidance in deciding what are municipal functions.we have stated that the various sections of article xi fail to define municipal affairs,and,accordingly,the courts must decide,under the facts of each case,whether the subject matter under discussion is of municipal or statewide concern.professional fire fighters,city of los angeles,supra,cal d at,accord,baggett gates,supra,cal d at,fn.by this we meant that article xi contains no global definition of what are municipal affairs or functions.but it is not entirely silent on the subject,and it is not silent here.t his is not the usual case in which the courts are without constitutional guidance in resolving the question whether a subject of local regulation is a municipal affair ector city of torrance cal d,quoted in sonoma county organization of public employees county of sonoma,supra,cal d at.section,subdivision b,states that the county shall provide for employee compensation.viewing,as we must,sections,subdivision b,and,subdivision a,together and not in isolation,they clearly provide that compensating county employees is a municipal function.
in ector city of torrance,supra,cal d at page,we had the benefit of a specific directive in subdivision b of section,which grants plenary authority to charter cities to prescribe in their charters the qualifications of their employees.accordingly,we said that questions involving the qualifications of city employees are municipal affairs with which the legislature may not interfere.id.at.similarly,in sonoma county organization of public employees county of sonoma,supra,cal d at page,we cited section reference to compensation of employees to conclude that determining the wages of employees of charter cities and counties is a matter of local rather than statewide concern.thus,establishing compensation for its employees is for the county to do,and section,subdivision a,prohibits the legislature from delegating that function to a private body.
in people ex rel.younger county of el dorado,supra,cal d,the legislature had established a special commission with jurisdiction over a regional problem.at that time,although no longer,the constitution prohibited the delegation of authority to a special commission as well as to a private party.see fn,ante.we upheld commissions that performed a function that would be impossible for any one of the constituent municipal or suburban units to perform.people ex rel.younger county of el dorado,supra,at.no single county or other local agency could coordinate planning for the entire lake tahoe region.by contrast,a county may easily provide for the compensation of its own employees.thus,neither the constitutional language nor the rationale of people ex rel.younger county of el dorado applies here.
as with section,subdivision b,the sheriff association argues that the legislature power to regulate labor relations as to matters of statewide concern permits it to delegate this regulatory authority to an arbitration panel.the argument fails for the same reasons senate bill does not just permit the arbitration panel to impinge minimally on the county authority it empowers the panel actually to set employee salaries.the sheriff association also argues that binding arbitration is a quid pro quo for the lack of a right to strike.see,county sanitation dist.los angeles county employees cal d.this may or may not provide a policy argument in favor of binding arbitration,but it provides no reason to disregard a clear constitutional mandate.moreover,like the court of appeal,we note that the state has exempted itself from this binding arbitration requirement.code civ,subd.c.we are skeptical that awarding binding arbitration as a quid pro quo can be of statewide concern to everyone except the state.
the sheriff association argues that the arbitration panel is a public,not private,body within the meaning of section,subdivision a.we disagree.the statute requires the two parties to select a person to be a member of the panel.these two then select an impartial person with experience in labor and management dispute resolution to act as chairperson of the arbitration panel.code civ,subd.b.if the two do not agree on the third person,the statute has other provisions for selecting that person,but it continually uses the word person or persons to describe who may be the chairperson.code civ,subd.c.nothing in the statute requires the arbitrators to be public officials indeed,the statute appears to contemplate,and the parties assume,they will be private persons.
the sheriff association agrees that the members of the arbitration panel may be private persons,but it argues that empowering them to render binding arbitration decisions makes them a public body.it relies on a rhode island case that involved a similar mandatory arbitration law.city of warwick warwick regular firemen ass.in that case,the court reasoned that the legislature gave the arbitration panel the power to fix the salaries of public employees without control or supervision from any superior,and,therefore,each member of the panel is a public officer and collectively the three constitute a public board or agency.id.at.the sheriff association seeks to apply this reasoning here.but the constitutional provision in that case was very different from the one here.the rhode island constitution merely stated that the legislative power shall be vested in the senate and house of representatives.city of warwick warwick regular firemen ass n,supra,at,fn.it contained no language limiting the legislature delegation power like that of section,subdivision a.as pointed out in a case involving the power to tax,if delegating to private persons the power to do a public act makes them a public body for purposes of section,subdivision a,then the constitutional provision would never be violated.anyone to whom the legislature delegated the power to tax or any other power specified in section,subdivision a would automatically cease being a private person or body.howard jarvis taxpayers fresno metropolitan projects authority th,d.section,subdivision a,is not.the act of delegation does not change a private body into a public body and thereby validate the very delegation the section prohibits.the legislature has,indeed,delegated authority to a private body.
both parties cite decisions from other states in support of their positions.the only cases that are relevant are those that involve statutory and constitutional provisions comparable to california.these cases generally support the county.section,subdivision a,was taken from article iii,section of the pennsylvania constitution.howard jarvis taxpayers fresno metropolitan projects authority,supra,th at,d,citing peppin,municipal home rule in california iv.the pennsylvania courts originally invalidated binding arbitration legislation under their constitutional provision.erie firefighters local gardner.as the sheriff association notes,the pennsylvania supreme court has since upheld binding arbitration.harney russo.but that was after the pennsylvania constitution was amended specifically to permit such arbitration.id.at see also city of washington police department,fn.a constitutional amendment was necessary for this provision because it had previously been held that a statute making an arbitration award binding on a public employer would be an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.the california constitution has not been amended to permit the legislature to impose binding arbitration on counties.thus,the pennsylvania experience supports the county position.
two other states have also invalidated arbitration provisions under constitutional provisions similar to section,subdivision a.city of sioux falls sioux falls,binding arbitration salt lake city of firefighters.utah arbitration that is partially binding,but advisory only as to salary and wage matters.one court reached a contrary result,but it was unable to achieve a majority opinion.state city of laramie.we find the wyoming case unconvincing.as recognized in city of sioux falls sioux falls,supra,at page,the wyoming court cited pennsylvania law but failed to note that the pennsylvania constitution had been amended to permit binding arbitration.in any event,california constitutional history,including that behind section,subdivision b,distinguishes california from wyoming.this history,and the two california constitutional provisions,read together,make clear that,in california,the county,not the state or anyone else,sets compensation for its employees.
the sheriff association also cites our opinion in fire fighters union city of vallejo cal d.in that case,we interpreted a provision for arbitration in a city charter affecting public employees.id.at.we summarily rejected an argument by an amicus curiae that the disputed issues are not arbitrable because submission of them to arbitration constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.arbitration of public employment disputes has been held constitutional by state supreme courts in state city of laramie and city of warwick warwick regular firemen ass,supra.to the extent that the arbitrators do not proceed beyond the provisions of the vallejo charter there is no unlawful delegation of legislative power.id.at,fn.that case does not aid the sheriff association.as noted,this case involves the division of authority between state and county,not what a local agency may itself choose to do.our citations to the wyoming and rhode island decisions can not be read as a blanket endorsement of everything in those cases,including matters irrelevant to the issue before us.our opinion did not even mention section,subdivision b,or section,subdivision a.
iii.conclusion 
john donne wrote,no man is an island,entire of itself.donne,devotions upon emergent occasions.so,too,no county is an island,entire of itself.no doubt almost anything a county does,including determining employee compensation,can have consequences beyond its borders.but this circumstance does not mean this court may eviscerate clear constitutional provisions,or the legislature may do what the constitution expressly prohibits it from doing.
the court of appeal correctly held that senate bill violates sections,subdivision b,and,subdivision a.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
i agree that the legislation before us is constitutionally impermissible in light of article xi,section,subdivision a,of the california constitution article xi,section a,which prohibits the legislature from delegating to a private person or body a county power to perform municipal functions.in my view,however,the majority should base its decision solely upon that relatively narrow constitutional provision,and need not and should not reach out to decide the distinct and potentially much more question whether the legislation also violates article xi,section,subdivision b,of the california constitution article xi,section b,which provides simply and generally that t he governing body of a county shall provide for the number,compensation,tenure,and appointment of employees.as i shall explain,the issue whether the general home rule provisions of article xi,section b preclude the legislature from adopting the legislation at issue presents a much closer question than the majority acknowledges,and i believe that traditional principles of judicial restraint should lead the court to refrain from prejudging that broader constitutional issue when there is a narrower and fully adequate alternative ground upon which to rest its decision.accordingly,i can not join the majority opinion.
article xi,section b,provides in relevant part the legislature shall provide for county powers,an elected county sheriff,an elected district attorney,an elected assessor,and an elected governing body in each county the governing body shall provide for the number,compensation,tenure and appointment of employees.italics added.
the majority states that the language of article xi,section b is quite clear and quite specific the county,not the state,not someone else,shall provide for the compensation of its employees,ante,d at,and concludes that the legislation in bill reg.sess.enacting code civ,et hereafter senate bill conflicts with this language because it compels the county to enter into mandatory arbitration with unions representing its employees,with the potential result that the arbitration panel determines employee compensation,ante,at.
in my view,the issue is not nearly as simple or as the majority suggests.although article xi,section b gives all counties including noncharter counties the authority to control the appointment and compensation of their own employees prior to,the legislature exercised that authority over the employees of noncharter counties,other sections of article xi provide that charter counties and charter cities have similar or even broader authority to control the appointment,compensation,and dismissal of their employees.see cal,art.xi,subd.f,subd.b.despite these explicit constitutional provisions establishing broad home rule authority of charter counties and charter cities over their own public employees,over the last the legislature has enacted a host of laws that govern various aspects of the labor relations of local public entities,and numerous cases have upheld the right of the state to enact such takes precedence over contrary rules established by local entities.
for example,the california fair employment and housing act,et prohibits counties and other local entities along with most other employers,subd.c from discriminating in employment on the basis of the categories enumerated in the act,and the provisions of that example those barring discrimination on the basis of disability or marital limit a local entity authority over the appointment or tenure of its employees.perhaps most relevant to the present case is the act,et mmb act,which places upon local entities the obligation to meet and confer in good faith with their employees on wages and other conditions of employment,and which grants public employees a variety of remedies to enforce such protections.as the majority recognizes,in people ex rel.seal beach police officers city of seal beach cal d,this court specifically upheld the validity of the mmb act as applied to a charter city,concluding that in light of the statewide concern addressed by the establishment of f air labor practices,uniform throughout the state id.at,application of the act did not violate the home rule provisions of california constitution,article xi,section,subdivision b.of course,the majority does not suggest that the provisions of article xi,section b setting forth the home rule authority of noncharter any greater restrictions on the legislature authority than the even broader constitutional home rule provisions applicable to charter counties and charter cities.
once it is recognized that the provisions of article xi,section b do not preclude the legislature from promulgating a detailed collective bargaining regime that counties are required to follow in negotiating over compensation with all of their type of structure set forth in the mmb seems evident that the question whether the legislation at issue in this case violates article xi,section b,is not as clear as the majority suggests.although the majority asserts emphatically that senate bill is not merely procedural it is substantive,ante,d at,that characterization of the legislation is hardly.in enacting senate bill,the legislature did not undertake itself to set the compensation for county firefighters or police officers,but instead prescribed a dispute resolution procedure that is to be employed when the county and its firefighters or police officers are unable to reach agreement on economic issues that fall within the meet and confer requirement of the mmb act.furthermore,although the procedure set forth in the act calls for binding arbitration,the particular form of binding arbitration prescribed by the act does not afford the arbitrators free rein to resolve the dispute by setting compensation at whatever level the arbitrators deem appropriate.instead the act limits the arbitrators discretion to choosing between the last best offer of each of the parties on each unresolved issue.code civ.
it is true,of course,that the binding arbitration procedure established in senate bill impinges directly upon the county general authority to retain the last word on employee compensation.but it is not at all clear that this circumstance is necessarily fatal to the validity of state legislation under article xi,section b.as noted above,the relevant language of this constitutional provision provides that t he governing body of the county shall provide for the number,compensation,tenure,and appointment of employees,italics added.thus,under article xi,section b,a county constitutionally granted authority over the compensation of its employees appears no greater than the county authority over the appointment or tenure of its employees.under the california fair employment and housing act feha,the fair employment and housing commission fehc is granted the authority to resolve a claim that a county has engaged in unlawful employment discrimination in the appointment or dismissal process,et,and a decision of the fehc against the county clearly has the effect of trumping the authority the county otherwise would have to refuse to appoint or dismiss a person on the basis,for example,of his or her marital status or sexual orientation.see.the circumstance that the fehc has the authority in such instances to displace the ultimate decision that a county otherwise would be empowered to make regarding the appointment or tenure of a particular applicant,however,never has been viewed as casting any constitutional doubt on the application of the feha to counties or other local public entities.if the state properly may impinge upon a county power to appoint or dismiss employees in order to serve the statewide concern of protecting employees from discrimination,it is not immediately apparent why the state,to serve the statewide concern of protecting the public from the widespread risks posed by strikes by firefighters or police officers,may not similarly impinge upon a county authority to have the last word on employee compensation.
for these reasons,i find the question whether senate bill violates article xi,section b to be much closer and more difficult than the majority acknowledges.
moreover,as noted at the outset,there is no need for the majority to resolve the question whether senate bill violates article xi,section b,in light of the majority conclusion that senate bill violates the entirely distinct provisions of article xi,section a.the majority holding under article xi,section a clearly is sufficient in itself to resolve this case.and because article xi,section a is a more focussed provision than
