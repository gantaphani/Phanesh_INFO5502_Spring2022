international medical group,img and sirius international insurance corporation sirius were so displeased at being drawn into an arbitration proceeding that they sued not only the claimant who drew them in but his lawyers,their law firm,the american arbitration association aaa and a few hapless employees of the aaa.after this indiana state court proceeding was removed to federal court,the district court dismissed the complaint,in part for lack of personal jurisdiction over most of the defendants and in part because of arbitral immunity,failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,and because aaa had been improperly joined.img and sirius appeal and we affirm.
michael ogdon,a citizen of great britain and resident of florida,purchased a health insurance policy from sirius in late.sirius,a swedish corporation,designated img,an indiana company,as the policy administrator and general underwriter.in january,ogdon received emergency medical treatment at a florida hospital and subsequently submitted bills totaling approximately to img as plan administrator.img investigated the claim and refused to pay any of the bills on the ground that all of the charges related to a condition that was not covered by the policy.ogdon filed a complaint with the indiana department of insurance,alleging that his illness was not a condition at the time the policy was issued and that denial of his claim was improper,pretextual and in bad faith.the record does not reveal how or whether the indiana department of insurance resolved that claim,but eventually ogdon requested cancellation of the policy and a return of his premium.img obliged by cancelling the policy as of february,and returning a pro rata share of the premium ogdon had paid for the policy.
in the meantime,ogdon,through his attorneys hilda piloto and juan rodriguez of the firm rodriguez machado,filed a statement of claim and a demand for arbitration demand with the aaa in miami,florida.the insurance policy provided that certain disputes under the policy would be subject to arbitration 
if any dispute shall arise as to the amount to be paid under this insurance liability being otherwise admitted,such dispute shall be referred to arbitration in accordance with procedures of the american arbitration association.where any dispute is by this provision referred to arbitration,the making of an award shall be a condition precedent to any right of action against the company.
complaint,ex.b.the demand named both img and sirius as respondents.according to the demand,ogdon purchased insurance from sirius,and img was the plan administrator.the demand stated that img and sirius had wrongfully refused to pay out ogdon claim.the aaa assigned janella brown as the case manager.brown worked in the aaa southwest case management center in atlanta,georgia,a facility that administered arbitrations that take place in miami,florida.on march,brown sent a letter to thomas dawson,a new york lawyer that ogdon had identified as the representative for img and sirius.the letter informed dawson that ogdon had made a demand for arbitration,and set out preliminary procedural matters,complaint,ex.
dawson forwarded the letter to jonathon zusy,the general counsel for img located in indiana.zusy responded to brown letter on behalf of both img and sirius,denying that the arbitration was authorized by the insurance contract and declining to provide any of the information requested by the aaa.he explained that the contract provided for arbitration only if liability had been admitted,and that img and sirius had never admitted liability.zusy objected to an arbitration being held in florida or anyplace else and asked the aaa to cancel the arbitration,complaint,ex.brown replied by a letter addressed to ogdon lawyers and dawson she requested that ogdon respond to zusy letter by april,complaint,ex.j.when ogdon did not respond,brown sent a letter to both ogdon counsel and zusy stating that ogdon had met the filing requirements of the aaa rules and therefore the aaa intended to go forward with the arbitration 
accordingly,in the absence of an agreement by the parties or a court order staying this matter,the association will proceed with further administration.the parties may wish to raise this issue with the arbitrator at or prior to the hearing.
complaint,ex.
zusy sent another letter reiterating the positions previously taken by img and sirius,complaint,ex.ogdon lawyers stated their belief that the dispute was subject to arbitration,complaint,ex.brown wrote another letter to the parties indicating that the aaa had reviewed the various positions of the parties regarding the arbitrability of the matter and had concluded that the arbitration would proceed absent an agreement by the parties or a court order staying the proceedings,complaint,ex.brown repeated that the aaa could not determine issues of arbitrability and informed the parties that the arbitrator had the power to determine the existence or validity of a contract of which an arbitration clause forms a part,complaint,ex.
shortly thereafter,img and sirius filed suit in indiana state court,requesting a stay of the arbitration proceeding and seeking a declaratory judgment clarifying the rights and obligations of the parties under the insurance contract.they alleged abuse of process,malicious prosecution and arbitration.their ex parte request for a temporary restraining order was granted.the state court later granted sirius and img request for a preliminary injunction and entered findings on several of the matters raised in the request for declaratory relief.the aaa suspended the arbitration on learning of the state court order.ogdon,piloto,rodriguez,and the firm of rodriguez machado,collectively the defendants removed the state court lawsuit to the federal district court.sirius moved to dismiss all of the claims it raised against the aaa,brown and her supervisor,john germani collectively the aaa defendants.the district court granted that motion.
all of the defendants then moved to dismiss the remaining claims under rules b and b.the district court dismissed the claims against brown and germani,the aaa employees,because their contacts with the state of indiana were insufficient to confer personal jurisdiction.in particular,germani had no contacts with indiana at all and had merely advised brown on how to proceed with the arbitration.brown only contacts with indiana were the five letters she mailed to zusy after zusy insisted that all mail pertaining to the arbitration be sent to him rather than to dawson,sirius registered agent in new york.the court noted that all of the correspondence related to a proceeding that was never intended to occur in indiana.the court concluded that asserting personal jurisdiction over germani and brown in indiana would violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.the court therefore dismissed all claims against those two defendants.
the court next considered the aaa itself.the complaint raised three claims against the aaa.count i sought damages for tortious actions of abuse of process,malicious prosecution and arbitration.count ii sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to stay the arbitration.count iii requested a declaratory judgment specifying that the arbitration was improper and defining the rights and obligations of the parties to the insurance contract.because the insurance contract provided that any arbitration would proceed under the aaa own rules and procedures,the court first referred to those rules.the aaa rules specified that neither the aaa nor any arbitrator is a necessary party in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration.the rules also provided that neither the aaa nor any arbitrator shall be liable to any party for any act or omission in connection with an arbitration conducted under the aaa rules.the court noted that these provisions might release aaa from any liability to sirius,but that img was not a party to the insurance contract and thus was not bound by the aaa rules.the court instead dismissed counts ii and iii against the aaa because the aaa was unnecessary to the resolution of any claim directed at the propriety of arbitration and because the aaa and its agents were entitled to arbitral immunity,an extension of judicial immunity.
the district court addressed count i as if it were comprised of three separate claims,for malicious prosecution,abuse of process and arbitration.the court first noted that the claim of arbitration had not been recognized by the indiana courts or by the courts of any other jurisdiction.because img failed to identify the elements of this novel cause of action and because it appeared duplicative of the other two tort claims in count i,the court dismissed the claim for arbitration.the court next noted that a claim for malicious prosecution was traditionally intended to provide recourse to criminal defendants who were wrongfully charged but that a parallel action existed for civil claims,wrongful use of civil proceedings.the court noted that the elements of the civil claim are substantially similar to those in the criminal context and that img failed to allege facts sufficient to make out two of those elements.in particular,img failed to allege that the aaa initiated or caused to be initiated a cause of action against img.moreover,img could not show that the cause of action terminated in img favor the court found that the claim was thus not yet ripe and dismissed it.
on img abuse of process claim,the court noted that this cause of action required a showing of misuse or misapplication of process,for an end other than that which it was designed to accomplish.the process involved in img claim was the arbitration initiated by ogdon and the defendants.the court noted that the aaa role was analogous to that of a court clerk who has placed on the docket a case filed by a claimant.although the aaa rules required it to make a preliminary determination that a claim for arbitration is made pursuant to a contract authorizing arbitration,no rule or principle required the aaa to make a searching analysis of the claim merits prior to docketing.rather,the aaa was entitled to docket the claim and have it proceed until a judicial or determination was made that the cause failed for lack of jurisdiction or on the merits of the claim.the court thus concluded that in the absence of process initiated or caused to be initiated by the aaa,the claim of abuse of process warranted dismissal for failure to state a claim.
the court similarly dismissed the claims against all of the defendants because none of those defendants had sufficient contacts with the state of indiana to justify an exercise of personal jurisdiction over them in that state.recall that the defendants were ogdon,his lawyers hilda piloto and juan rodriguez,and their law firm,rodriguez machado,rodriguez had the fewest contacts with indiana,consisting only of a letter to img to inform the company that ogdon would submit his claim to arbitration if img refused to pay his hospital bills.the court found that contact too attenuated to serve as a basis for personal jurisdiction over rodriguez.piloto had more contacts with indiana,some relating to the florida arbitration and some relating to the filing of ogdon complaint with the indiana department of insurance.although piloto contacts relating to the arbitration were slightly more numerous than rodriguez,the court found that filing the miami arbitration and mailing notices to img in indiana was too attenuated to subject piloto or her firm to personal jurisdiction in indiana.the court found the filing of the administrative complaint with the department of insurance insufficient because that action was unrelated to the claims filed in the instant case and because the contacts were few and were qualitatively insignificant.
finally,the court considered the claims against ogdon himself and whether personal jurisdiction could be exerted over him in indiana.the court noted that ogdon was never physically present in indiana and was fortuitously involved with that state only because sirius selected img as the plan administrator.ogdon communicated with img in indiana when submitting his claim for coverage and when he requested cancellation of his policy.he also caused a complaint to be filed with the indiana department of insurance.all of these contacts were unconnected to the florida arbitration,and the district court found they were insufficient to conclude that ogdon had purposefully availed himself of the privileges and protections of indiana law.because ogdon could not reasonably anticipate being haled into court in indiana,the court concluded that an exercise of in personam jurisdiction over him would not comport with due process.the court therefore dismissed all claims against ogdon.img and sirius appeal.
on appeal,img and sirius raise three issues whether the complaint states a viable claim against the aaa and brown whether brown contacts with indiana are sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over her in indiana and whether the defendants contacts with indiana are sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over them in indiana.sirius asked the district court to dismiss with prejudice all of its claims against the aaa defendants and so does not appeal those dismissals.img does not appeal the dismissal of all claims against germani.otherwise,img and sirius appeal all other dismissals.
we begin with the district court dismissal of the claims against the aaa and brown on the basis of arbitral immunity and for failure to state a claim we will affirm a dismissal under rule b only if it is clear that the plaintiffs can not establish any set of facts that would entitle them to the relief requested.panaras liquid carbonic indus,cir mosley klincar,cir gibson city of chicago,cir.in making this assessment,we read the complaint liberally and accept as true all allegations and the inferences that may be reasonably drawn from them.panaras,at mosley,at gibson,at.
img argues that arbitration is a matter of contract.because the aaa concedes that img was not a party to the insurance contract between ogdon and sirius,img contends that the aaa engaged in tortious conduct by asserting jurisdiction over img.img contends that arbitral immunity should not apply when the sponsoring body in this case,the aaa has acted in the clear absence of jurisdiction.img acknowledges that it was unable to find any authority defining a cause of action against an arbitrator or sponsoring organization for the harm caused when that arbitrator or organization acts in the clear absence of jurisdiction.img asks this court to name this new cause of action and define its parameters.the aaa maintains that it is not a proper party to any suit regarding the arbitration and that it is protected by arbitral immunity.
the aaa does not dispute that arbitration is a matter of contract.a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.at t,communications workers of america,d quoting united steelworkers of america warrior gulf navigation,d.this is because arbitrators derive their authority to resolve disputes from the prior agreement of the parties to submit their grievances to arbitration.at t,at.but it is not the responsibility of the aaa or even the arbitrator to determine whether a particular agreement creates a duty for the parties to arbitrate a particular grievance.at t,at.unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise,the question of arbitrability is to be decided by a court,not by an arbitrator.id.
img insists that the aaa violated that principle and decided the arbitrability of the case when it purported to assert jurisdiction over img and attempted to move the matter forward through arbitration.under img logic,the aaa would have been deciding the arbitrability of the case no matter what it did after the demand was filed.once img objected to the arbitration,the aaa had only two choices,to proceed or not to proceed.the aaa proceeded after determining that its filing requirements had been met and after informing img that it could ask a court to determine the arbitrability of the matter.indeed,the very documents img relies upon to show the aaa decided the arbitrability of the matter contradict its position.the aaa,through brown,expressly declined to decide the arbitrability of the matter.after informing img that it would stop the arbitration if directed by a court to do so,the aaa halted the process at once when img obtained a state court order.until that time,the aaa was well within its rights to proceed with the arbitration,and was acting in a manner similar to a clerk of court upon receiving a filing that complies with the court rules.
the cases uniformly support arbitral immunity in situations such as occurred here.we have held,for example,that arbitral immunity should extend to cases where the authority of an arbitrator to resolve a dispute is challenged.tamari conrad,cir.in tamari,the plaintiff argued that arbitrators are not entitled to immunity if they have no right to arbitrate the dispute in the first place.at.we held that arbitral immunity should apply when the arbitrator authority is challenged because arbitrators will be dissuaded from serving if they can be caught up in the dispute and be saddled with the burdens of defending a lawsuit.see jain demere,cir,cert.denied,d noting that the federal arbitration act creates a strong presumption in favor of arbitration.we noted that arbitrators have no interest in the outcome of the matter,and thus should not be compelled to become parties to the dispute.tamari,at.we found suing an arbitrator to be comparable to suing jurors when a litigant is dissatisfied with the outcome of a lawsuit.such a suit would place an unfair burden on jurors and would discourage others from jury service.moreover,the suit would not be necessary for a litigant to obtain relief.the composition of a jury,for example,can be challenged through appellate review of the original action.similarly,img or any party to an arbitration can obtain relief by seeking a stay against the party bringing the arbitration.there is no need to seek a stay against the sponsoring organization.tamari,at.see also new england cleaning,american arbitration ass n,cir sponsoring organization immunity extends to all administrative tasks it performs and will apply unless the demand for arbitration is so deficient on its face as to signal a clear absence of jurisdiction hawkins national ass of sec.dealers,cir arbitrators and sponsoring organizations are immune from civil liability arising from actions taken in the course of conducting arbitration proceedings olson national ass of sec.dealers,cir a sponsoring organization is immune from civil liability for improperly selecting an arbitration panel even if the selection violates the organization internal rules because immunity applies to both sponsoring organizations and arbitrators immunity protects decision makers from undue influence and protects the process from attack by dissatisfied litigants austern chicago bd.options,cir,cert.denied,d arbitrators in contractually agreed upon arbitration proceedings are absolutely immune from liability in damages for all acts within the scope of the arbitral process.
img complains that arbitral immunity does not apply here because it was never a party to a contract authorizing arbitration and the aaa therefore acted in the clear absence of jurisdiction.img relies on our reasoning in caudle american arbitration ass n,cir.caudle sued the aaa for breach of contract because he believed the aaa was charging an unreasonably high fee to conduct an arbitration.the district court dismissed the suit after finding that the aaa was entitled to immunity.we vacated and remanded with instructions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction after determining there was no basis for caudle to bring the suit in federal court.before vacating on this ground,however,we discussed arbitral immunity,questioning whether the principle was properly understood as immunity rather than a conclusion that arbitrators and sponsoring organizations are not the real parties in interest.at.we hypothesized a scenario in which the aaa might be held liable for its actions.if caudle had paid the entire amount requested by the aaa to conduct the arbitration and the aaa had then pocketed the money without arbitrating the dispute,we speculated that it was unlikely the aaa could claim immunity in response to a demand for a refund.id.we declined to decide the issue,however,because we determined that there was no jurisdiction for caudle to bring the case in federal court.at.
img now seizes upon the caudle hypothetical and argues that the aaa assertion of jurisdiction over it when it was not a party to the insurance contract authorizing arbitration is outside the scope of arbitral immunity.img misses an important distinction between the caudle hypothetical and the circumstances presented here.in the caudle hypothetical,the facts giving rise to the potential claim have nothing to do with arbitrability or with the administrative duties of the aaa.the claim that one may not retain a payment for services that are never rendered can be stated entirely without reference to the arbitration.here,however,the claim is integrally related to the administrative tasks of the aaa,as noted previously,similar to the administrative tasks of a court clerk accepting a complaint for filing.see tamari,at arbitral immunity should extend to cases where the authority of the arbitrator to resolve a dispute is challenged new england cleaning,at a sponsoring organization immunity extends to the administrative tasks it performs,insofar as these are integrally related to the arbitration.the appropriate remedy for an administrative mistake by the aaa and we are not finding here that the aaa erred in accepting the demand and proceeding with the arbitration would be for the wronged party to seek injunctive relief against the party initiating the arbitration in an appropriate court.the aaa need not be a party to that action and should be spared the burden of litigating the appropriateness of its exercise of jurisdiction.
because we are holding that aaa is immune from a suit based on wrongful exercise of jurisdiction,we need not explore the parameters of the new cause of action img seeks to define moreover,we agree with the district court that img has failed to state a claim for abuse of process,malicious prosecution and arbitration a claim that img concedes has never been recognized by any court.see international med.group,american arbitration ass n,d.for the claim of malicious prosecution,a plaintiff must show,among other things,that the prosecution terminated in the plaintiff favor.hammond lead,american cyanamid,cir.img can not show that the arbitration terminated in its favor and thus the arbitration may not serve as the basis of a malicious prosecution claim.similarly,to make out a claim for abuse of process,img must show a wilful act in the use of the process not proper in the regular conduct of the proceedings.groen elkins.img pleadings reveal that ogdon,not the aaa,initiated the arbitration process and that the aaa did nothing more than docket a properly filed demand for arbitration.we have already established that only the courts may decide issues of arbitrability and so the aaa did not abuse the process when it declined img invitation to determine that the arbitration should not go forward.in sum,the aaa neither initiated nor caused to be initiated any process at all,and thus can not be held liable for abuse of process.international med.group,d at.arbitration is the name coined by img for the new cause of action it asks us to recognize and define.as we explained above,however,the aaa enjoys immunity from suit in these circumstances and we thus decline to recognize or define this new action.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of all claims against the aaa and brown.
that brings us to the claims against the defendants.the district court dismissed these claims because it lacked personal jurisdiction over these defendants.the defendants are ogdon,his lawyers piloto and rodriguez,and their law firm rodriguez machado.the question of whether the court had personal jurisdiction over ogdon lawyers and their law firm is not a close call and we summarily affirm the district court finding that an exercise of personal jurisdiction over
