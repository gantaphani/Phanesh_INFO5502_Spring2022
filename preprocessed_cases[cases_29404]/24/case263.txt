this case,in which the amount in controversy is less than,once again requires us to examine the arbitration provisions of a collective bargaining agreement.we agree with appellant employer that the language used in the collective bargaining agreement cba created a condition precedent to be satisfied before the employer had a duty to arbitrate,a condition that was not satisfied in this case.however,because we also find that costs of cancellation in the cba does not include expenses incurred in preparation for arbitration,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to appellee union.
background 
in january,adirondack transit lines,atl or company,a company that provides passenger motorcoach service primarily in upstate new york,filed suit in the united states district court for the northern district of new york against the union of bus drivers it employs,united transportation union,local utu or union.the suit alleged that utu breached the collective bargaining agreement to which both atl and the union are parties by unilaterally canceling a scheduled arbitration and refusing to pay atl costs in preparing for the aborted arbitration.atl maintains that it incurred in attorney fees in preparation for the hearing.complaint at para.
the origins of this dispute date back to the winter of,when atl refused to grant two of its bus drivers leaves of absence for the.because the union believed that atl refusal to grant such leave constituted a violation of the cba,it instituted a grievance against the company in january.article of the cba,entitled grievance and time claims,provides that 
a grievance is a dispute involving the interpretation or application of any provision of this agreement 
the primary purpose of the grievance procedure is to secure at the earliest possible step,equitable solutions to grievances.
all grievances shall be presented in writing by the general chairman or committee chairman to the supervisor designated by the company to handle such matters 
the designated company supervisor will schedule a meeting with the union representative to discuss the grievance the company supervisor will render a written decision 
appeals may be taken on decisions to the highest officer of the company or representative 
the appeal hearings will be held a written decision on the appeal will be rendered by the company.
the union shall have the right to submit grievances or claims and such submission will be recognized by the company 
by march of that year,atl had denied the union relief pursuant to the grievance procedure outlined above,and the union asserted its right to arbitration under article of the cba that provides 
a if the matter is submitted and carried froward sic in accordance with the foregoing procedure and it is not satisfactorily resolved,then the union or the company may,within thirty calendar days,invoke binding arbitration by written request.
g the parties shall share the costs of panel arbitration equally.if one party unilaterally withdraws the arbitration,it shall bear all costs of cancellation.
the company and the union shall equally share the cost and expenses of the arbitrator.
each party will pay its own costs and expenses incurred in presenting its case.
an arbitrator was appointed to hear the union grievance,and the hearing date was set for july.after the arbitrator denied utu request for a postponement on june,the union unilaterally withdrew the grievance from arbitration on july,the day before the hearing was scheduled to begin.
this brings us to the instant dispute.atl attorneys prepared for the arbitration,charging atl for services rendered on the grievance until utu withdrew from arbitration.relying on article g of the cba,atl sought to have the union reimburse the company for these costs.the union refused to pay atl legal fees for preparation,disagreeing with atl position that article g contemplated atl attorney fees as costs of cancellation.
upon the union refusal to pay atl attorney fees,the company sought relief by filing suit in federal district court pursuant to section a of the labor management relations act.see.in the lawsuit,atl accused utu of breaching article g of the cba by failing to repay atl its preparation costs upon utu unilateral withdrawal.
the union responded,in a motion to dismiss or in the alternative for summary judgment,by arguing that atl was required to first arbitrate its claim for the attorney fees as a grievance as that term is defined by article of the cba.atl argued below,as it does here,that the arbitration clause in the cba is triggered exclusively by grievances,and,thus,atl had no duty to submit the issue to arbitration before filing suit.the district court found that because the cba could plausibly be read to allow the company to arbitrate a grievance that it initiated,atl was required to arbitrate the dispute over the attorney fees.thus,the lower court granted summary judgment to the union.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the proper interpretation of an unambiguous contract is a question of law for the court,and a dispute on such an issue may properly be resolved by summary judgment.we review de novo questions as to the ambiguity and meaning of the language of a contract,and as to the propriety of summary judgment.omni quartz,cvs,cir citations omitted.summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.moreover,here the district court grant of summary judgment for the union served as a decision that the dispute must be arbitrated under the terms of the cba,which also would call for de novo review.bottling of,soft drink brewery workers union local,cir.we are thus tasked with determining whether the cba between atl and utu required atl to submit the dispute to arbitration before bringing suit in federal court.
it has long been the law that before a plaintiff may file a claim in federal court under section,it first must exhaust the grievance and arbitration procedures found within the cba to which the litigants are parties.see republic steel maddox,d.however,arbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.at t,communications workers of,d quoting united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf navigation,d.a duty to arbitrate a particular grievance can stem only from a contractual agreement to arbitrate,and a determination of the scope of such a contractual term is peculiarly within the purview of the judiciary.truck drivers local,regional imp.exp.trucking,cir.an order to arbitrate should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute,resolving any doubts in favor of coverage.warrior gulf,at.
atl argues that it properly sought relief in the courts without first arbitrating because it is not required to arbitrate the dispute.the company position is that the arbitration clause is triggered only by grievances.the union,on the other hand,urges that the clause merely describes when a claim is ready for arbitration and clarifies that employees can not bypass the grievance procedure.red at.
the union relies heavily on two of our cases in which we interpreted an arbitration clause within a cba and held that the employer was required to arbitrate the dispute,at and itt world communications,communications workers of,cir.both were actions by employers under section against unions for violations of clauses in a cba.in both cases,as in the instant one,the grievance procedures were narrowly tailored to employee grievances,and the arbitration clauses referred to the grievance procedures.however,unlike this case,the arbitration clauses in and itt were sufficiently broad to encompass more than employee grievances.
