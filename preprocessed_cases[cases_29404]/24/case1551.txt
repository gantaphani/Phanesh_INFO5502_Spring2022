the court dismissed plaintiff daphne miranda underinsured motorist arbitration because she refused to obey a prior discovery order.plaintiff contends the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to dismiss the arbitration proceeding,and also lacked personal jurisdiction to make any orders against her.in the alternative,plaintiff contends the court abused its discretion by imposing a terminating sanction without first imposing a lesser sanction.we disagree with all of plaintiff arguments and affirm the judgment of dismissal.
factual and procedural background 
on november,plaintiff sustained injuries in an automobile accident with an underinsured motorist,marisela mondragon.she filed an action against mondragon in superior court and,about six months later,she demanded arbitration of her underinsured motorist claim against her insurer,defendant century insurance company.shortly after demanding arbitration with defendant,plaintiff settled her superior court action with mondragon.the demand for arbitration with defendant remained pending.
defendant commenced discovery in connection with the underinsured motorist claim,including service of demands for production of documents,specially drafted interrogatories,form interrogatories,and subpoenas to the medical providers who treated plaintiff for her accident injuries.on december,plaintiff served responses to defendant form interrogatories in which she stated,inter alia,that she was treated for postconcussion symptoms by a neurologist with kaiser permanente in baldwin park from the day after the accident through july.
from a review of the medical records provided in discovery,defendant learned that plaintiff had also been treated at medical facilities known as kaiser pasadena and kaiser.defendant followed up with a subpoena directed to those facilities requesting plaintiff medical records.both kaiser facilities responded that,because of the nature of the records,they would need signed authorizations from plaintiff before they could release the records thus began a series of letters to plaintiff counsel requesting plaintiff to sign the authorizations,culminating in a letter confirming a phone conversation in which plaintiff counsel told defendant counsel that plaintiff will not be signing the medical release s.
meanwhile,defendant took plaintiff deposition in late february.at the deposition,plaintiff testified she had been treating with the neurologist at the kaiser baldwin park facility for lightheadedness and dizziness beginning one month before the accident.she also testified she had experienced dizziness since,and had sought treatment many times for the condition because she was so frustrated.she acknowledged she had consulted physicians with kaiser pasadena and kaiser with respect to her problem.plaintiff also testified she had been tested with the first eeg,the first cat scan and the first mri before the accident,leading to an ultimate diagnosis of epilepsy.
unable to obtain plaintiff authorization for release of her records,defendant filed an application to commence discovery in underinsured motorist matter in the superior court,together with a motion to compel compliance with the subpoenas for medical records.the compliance defendant requested was an order compelling plaintiff to sign the authorizations for release of her medical records from kaiser pasadena and kaiser.defendant asserted it was entitled to seek discovery orders from the court pursuant to section,subdivisions f and p of the insurance code 
the application to commence discovery and the motion to compel compliance with the subpoenas were served by mail on counsel for plaintiff,the same lawyer who had responded to earlier discovery served by defendant,and who had been representing plaintiff in the arbitration,including the ongoing dispute concerning the medical records.the record on appeal does not contain any written opposition to the motion to compel.the minute order for the date of the hearing reflects only that counsel for plaintiff was specially appearing.the parties did not supply this court with a reporter transcript for this hearing.but a reporter transcript for the hearing on the motion to compel is included in the clerk transcript as an exhibit to the subsequent motion to dismiss.there,counsel stated,i just here to argue that the court does have jurisdiction over them.counsel continued,our defendant was personally served.no evidence was offered to establish lack of personal service,although,as noted,the proof of service filed with the motion indicates it was served by mail on plaintiff counsel.
the court granted the motion to compel by ordering plaintiff to sign the authorizations for release of her medical records.defendant counsel sent to plaintiff counsel a copy of the order together with blank authorizations for plaintiff signature.after several unanswered telephone calls,plaintiff counsel finally announced that her client would not be signing the authorizations.defendant again made written demand for compliance with the order,and,when no response was received,filed a motion requesting the terminating sanction of dismissal.this time,plaintiff filed written opposition,which had a title that explained her entire argument c laimant special appearance for the purpose of opposing respondent motion for dismissal and sanctions on the grounds that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over the claimant on august,therefore said order is void and that the court still lacks personal jurisdiction over the claimant to hear the instant motion.the court was not impressed with plaintiff argument,granted the motion to dismiss,and granted monetary sanctions against plaintiff and her counsel.
plaintiff filed a premature notice of appeal from the nonappealable minute order granting the motion to dismiss but a signed judgment of dismissal was entered four weeks after the minute order.we treat the notice of appeal as having been filed immediately after entry of judgment.cal.rules of court,rule d.
discussion 
the superior court has exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over discovery disputes arising in uninsured motorist arbitrations 
plaintiff first contention,that the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to enter discovery orders and to dismiss the uninsured arbitration proceeding,is raised for the first time on appeal.fortunately for plaintiff,subject matter jurisdiction is one of the few issues not waived for failure to raise it in the trial court.although the subject matter jurisdiction of the court was not questioned during the trial,it is well established that questions of subject matter jurisdiction are never waived and may be raised for the first time on appeal.costa banta d.accordingly,we consider plaintiff argument on the merits.
stripped to its essentials,plaintiff argument asserts section,subdivision f,provides for contractual arbitration of her uninsured motorist claim the superior court lacks jurisdiction to dismiss a contractual arbitration because only the arbitrator has that power and the superior court lacked jurisdiction to make rulings on discovery,and for that reason had no authority to impose a terminating sanction.while plaintiff first premise is statute provides for contractual conclusions are wrong.plaintiff fails to address,or even to mention,the text of the entire that dooms her argument by expressly committing the resolution of discovery disputes in uninsured motorist arbitrations to the jurisdiction of the superior court.
section,subdivision a requires all automobile insurance policies delivered in california,and which cover bodily injury liability,to include insurance for amounts the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or wrongful death from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle t he determination as to whether the insured shall be legally entitled to recover damages,and if so entitled,the amount thereof,shall be made by agreement between the insured and the insurer or,in the event of disagreement,by arbitration,subd.f.the statute also permits the attorney of a party to the arbitration to issue subpoenas pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure.importantly,the statute then adopts the california civil discovery act in its entirety.article commencing with section of chapter of title of part of the code of civil procedure shall be applicable to these determinations,and all rights,remedies,obligations,liabilities and procedures set forth in article shall be available to both the insured and the insurer at any time after the accident,both before and after the commencement of arbitration,if any,subd.f,italics added.
after the wholesale incorporation of all the discovery procedures from the code of civil procedure,section,subdivision f,then carves out certain limitations.one encounters some difficulty in reading these limitations because the statute makes reference to specific sections of article of the code of civil procedure that do not correspond to existing law.section was enacted in and,except for a amendment substituting the word that for which in two places in subdivision f,it has not been otherwise amended.in,however,article of the code of civil procedure was rewritten and reorganized as the civil discovery act of.the legislature has never adopted legislation to conform section,subdivision f,to the newly numbered sections in article of the code of civil procedure.this omission requires the practitioner to research the discovery statutes as they existed in to determine the substantive effect of the specific references made in section,subdivision f.for the purpose of resolving the instant case,however,this legislative gap poses no insurmountable hurdle.the substance of the specific statutory references,and the effect of the corresponding limitation thereby contained in section,is found by consulting the civil discovery act.if the corresponding provision of the discovery act of is not inconsistent with the former version,the legislative intent is not in doubt.fortunately,that is the case.
the provision most germane to this appeal is found in section,subdivision f,which states whenever in article of the code of civil procedure,reference is made to the court in which the action is pending,or provision is made for application to the court or obtaining leave of court or approval of court,the court that shall have jurisdiction for the purposes of this section shall be the superior court of the state of california,in and for any county that is a proper county for the filing of a suit for bodily injury arising out of the accident,against the uninsured motorist,or any county specified in the policy or an endorsement added thereto as a proper county for arbitration or action thereon.italics added.this provision would have no meaning whatever had the legislature intended,as urged by plaintiff,to preclude the superior court from exercising jurisdiction to resolve discovery disputes in connection with uninsured motorist arbitrations.
we have found only two reported cases dealing with a discovery dispute in connection with an uninsured motorist arbitration,and neither discusses the jurisdictional jurisdiction of the superior court to act in such matters apparently was not questioned in the face of the unambiguous language of the statute thus,in workman superior court,supra,d,the court of appeal issued a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order relieving the insurance carrier from its default in failing to timely respond to requests for admissions served in connection with an uninsured motorist arbitration.id.at.no issue was raised about the jurisdiction of the superior court to hear the matter,and to grant discovery sanctions.to the contrary,the court of appeal commanded the superior court to exercise its jurisdiction by imposing a discovery sanction,finding the superior court had no authority to deny the sanction by the terms of the then existing discovery statute.
on point to the instant case is kaplan eldorado ins,supra,d,where the court affirmed the dismissal of an uninsured motorist arbitration as a discovery sanction.the later criticism of the kaplan decision in brock kaiser foundation hospitals th,d,is not persuasive.the brock court criticized the kaplan decision for allowing the court to dismiss a contractual arbitration proceeding as a discovery sanction.but in doing so,the brock court characterized the kaplan case as a contractual arbitration proceeding relating to a personal injury controversy brock at,d,failing to mention that it was an uninsured motorist arbitration between the insured and the insurer governed by the explicit provisions of section.
plaintiff nevertheless reasons the superior court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because section requires auto insurance policies to provide for arbitration of uninsured motorist claims an insurance policy is a contract and,therefore,arbitrations are contractual arbitrations governed by the code of civil procedure section et.plaintiff is mostly right.section et of the code of civil procedure,and the common law applicable to arbitrations,surely do apply to uninsured motorist arbitrations.mercury ins.group superior court cal th,d,contractual arbitration law is implicated because the uninsured motorist coverage law requires an automobile liability insurance policy,which is a contract,to provide for arbitration.but that does not mean we are free to ignore the statutory directive that commits discovery disputes arising in uninsured motorist arbitrations to the superior court.
there are,to be sure,several inconsistencies between the general law governing contractual arbitrations and the specific law governing uninsured motorist arbitrations.for example,although discovery in contractual arbitrations is always permitted in disputes arising out of injury or death caused by the wrongful act of another code civ,subd.a,it may only be commenced after the appointment of the arbitrator.code civ,subd.a.on the other hand,in uninsured motorist arbitrations,discovery may be commenced both before and after the commencement of arbitration,subd.f.further,in contractual arbitrations,depositions for discovery may not be taken unless the arbitrator grants permission to do so.code civ,subd.e.in uninsured motorist arbitrations,however,depositions may be taken for discovery as permitted in any court action,without obtaining prior approval of the arbitrator,subd.f.significantly,in contractual arbitrations,the arbitrator has the power to enforce the rights,remedies,procedures,duties,liabilities,and obligations of discovery by the imposition of the same terms,conditions,consequences,liabilities,sanctions,and penalties as can be or may be imposed in like circumstances in a civil action by a superior court of this state under the provisions of the code of civil procedure,except the power to order the arrest or imprisonment of a person.code civ,subd.b.but in uninsured motorist arbitrations,the civil discovery act shall be applicable and all rights,remedies,obligations,liabilities and procedures set forth in article of the civil discovery act shall be available to both the insured and the insurer w henever provision is made for application to the court or obtaining leave of court or approval by the court,the court that shall have jurisdiction for the purposes of this section shall be the superior court of the state of california,subd.f.
in recognition of the courts constitutional role to construe,not write,statutes,a ll presumptions are against a repeal by implication.it is the duty of this court to harmonize statutes on the same subject,giving effect to all parts of all statutes if possible w e will find an implied repeal only when there is no rational basis for harmonizing the two potentially conflicting statutes,and the statutes are irreconcilable,clearly repugnant,and so inconsistent that the two can not have concurrent operation.significantly,whether the canon invoked is that the specific statute prevails over the general or that the latest statutory expression prevails,such canons share the requirement that the enforcement of one duly enacted statute at the expense of another on the same subject only applies when the two statutes can not be reconciled.restraint of judicial trespass into the legislative province is no doubt the reason for the rule that a judicially determined repeal requires a repugnancy between the two statutes that prevents their concurrent restraint that has constitutional underpinnings premised on the separation of powers.medical board superior court th,d,fns.omitted.
thus,the contractual arbitration statute,giving an arbitrator the statutory power to exercise remedies under the civil discovery act,must be reconciled,if possible,with the uninsured motorist law,which not only makes the civil discovery act applicable,but expressly requires that whenever the civil discovery act makes reference to a court,the court that has jurisdiction shall be the superior court.we may harmonize these conflicting provisions by reading the discovery provisions governing uninsured motorist arbitrations as an exception to the discovery provisions governing contractual arbitrations generally.we will not presume the legislature intended to allow concurrent jurisdiction to resolve discovery disputes,both by the arbitrator and by the court,each having essentially coextensive powers to rule in the same matter.the potential for inconsistent and competing rulings in such an environment can not be gainsaid.i t is a settled principle of statutory interpretation that language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the legislature did not intend.people pieters cal d.
in reading the discovery provisions for uninsured motorist arbitrations as an exception to the discovery provisions in contractual arbitrations generally,we invoke a principle of statutory construction,often applied where statutes can not otherwise be reconciled.w hen a general and particular provision are inconsistent,the latter is paramount to the former.so a particular intent will control a general one that is inconsistent with it.code civ.it is the general rule that where the general statute standing alone would include the same matter as the special act,and thus conflict with it,the special act will be considered as an exception to the general statute whether it was passed before or after such general enactment.where the special statute is later it will be regarded as an exception to or qualification of the prior general one and where the general act is later the special statute will be considered as remaining an exception to its terms unless it is repealed in general words or by necessary implication.in re williamson cal d,see also mclaughlin state bd.of education th,d tapia pohlmann th,d.
here,the arbitration provisions in the code of civil procedure have general application,governing all types of contractual arbitrations.and the discovery rights provided by sections and of the code of civil procedure have general application,governing all arbitrations arising out of or resulting from injury or wrongful death,and,to the extent the contract to arbitrate incorporates these provisions,other arbitrations as well.on the other hand,the right to an uninsured motorist arbitration is available only to an insured under a policy of auto insurance covering liability who is entitled to recover damages for bodily injury or wrongful death from the owner or operator of an uninsured vehicle and the insurer issuing the insurance policy.further,the only issue for which the right to arbitrate is assured in an uninsured motorist arbitration is the determination whether the insured is legally entitled to recover damages from the uninsured motorist,and,if so,the amount.thus,the statute providing for uninsured motorist arbitrations is but a special statute having narrower application than the general contractual arbitration statutes.
the uninsured motorist arbitration statute,section,subdivision f,was enacted in.section of the code of civil procedure was also enacted in,and provided that depositions were permitted in arbitration proceedings only for use as evidence,and not for discovery,and only if the witness could not be compelled to attend the arbitration,and then only with the permission of the arbitrator.sections and of the code of civil procedure,the provisions allowing broad discovery in arbitrations arising in injury and wrongful death actions,and giving the arbitrator broad powers to rule on discovery disputes,were not enacted until.thus,at least with respect to the jurisdictional conflict here at issue,the broad grant of discovery authority to the arbitrator under the code of civil procedure was enacted later than the uninsured motorist provisions placing jurisdiction in the court.thus,under the williamson rule the special statute,section,subdivision f,is considered as a remaining exception to the terms of the general statute,code of civil procedure section et.section,subdivision f has not been repealed by the general contractual arbitration statutes either in words or by necessary implication.the discovery rules governing uninsured motorist arbitrations coexist with the discovery rules governing all other contractual arbitrations.absent an express declaration of legislative intent,we will find an implied repeal only when there is no rational basis for harmonizing the two potentially conflicting statutes,and the statutes are irreconcilable,clearly repugnant,and so inconsistent that the two can not have concurrent operation.garcia mccutchen cal th,d.
we conclude the court had the power to rule on the discovery dispute.and because we conclude the legislature could not have intended the arbitrator and the court to possess concurrent power,the uninsured motorist law grants the superior court the exclusive jurisdiction to hear discovery matters arising under uninsured motorist arbitrations.invested with the exclusive power to rule,and because the uninsured motorist statute makes available all rights,remedies,obligations,liabilities and procedures set forth in the civil discovery act,subd.f,the court necessarily had the power to dismiss the case as a terminating sanction.code civ,subds.a b c.
we see no need to discuss in detail the cases cited by plaintiff in support of her contention that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to rule on the discovery dispute and dismiss the arbitration.none of them is on point.each case relied upon by plaintiff arose in a contractual arbitration not involving an uninsured motorist claim,and did not arise from the enforcement of a discovery obligation 
plaintiff was subject to the personal jurisdiction of the court 
plaintiff also contends the superior court never acquired in personam jurisdiction over her because defendant moving papers on both motions were served by mail on her attorney,and not delivered to her personally.for that reason,she argues the court lacked the power to rule on the discovery motion or to dismiss her arbitration.we disagree.
in making her argument regarding lack of personal jurisdiction,plaintiff ignores an important commenced the arbitration.a demand for arbitration is a pleading analogous to a complaint in a civil lawsuit.blatt farley d.defendant did not contest plaintiff right to arbitrate.instead,it proceeded to take discovery in a normal fashion,and plaintiff responded to discovery in a normal mail addressed to the respective attorneys for the parties.
as we have discussed,section,subdivision f,makes applicable to uninsured motorist arbitrations all rights,remedies,obligations,liabilities and procedures set forth in the civil discovery act.italics added.the procedure for obtaining a discovery sanction is set forth in section,subdivision b of the code of civil procedure.t he court,after notice to any affected party,person,or attorney,and after opportunity for hearing,may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process.italics added.to whom,and by what means,must the notice of a discovery motion be given section of the code of civil procedure requires in all cases where a party has an attorney in the action or proceeding,the service of papers,when required,must be upon the attorney instead of the party,except service of subpenas,of writs,and other process issued in the suit,and of papers to bring him into contempt.section of the code
