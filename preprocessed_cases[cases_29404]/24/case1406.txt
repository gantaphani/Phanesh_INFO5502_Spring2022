plaintiffs purchased homes,which came with what they were told was an added bonus or extra protection an express limited warranty.actually,the warranty provided coverage,subject to sweeping exclusions,for the whole home for just one year,and for the electrical,plumbing and mechanical systems for just two years after that,the only coverage it provided was for elements,and then only if the damage to them made the home unsafe,unsanitary,or otherwise unlivable.some versions of the warranty purported to relieve the builder of any liability except under the warranty.warranty included arbitration provisions,purporting to require the purchaser to arbitrate disputes arising from or related to not only the warranty,but also the home,the sale of the home,and the arbitration provisions themselves.
when plaintiffs filed suit against the alleged builders,alleging construction defects,the builders moved to compel arbitration.the trial court denied the motions,because it found that this agreement was unconscionable.
the builders appeal.they contend that 
pursuant to the arbitration provisions,the question of whether the arbitration provisions are unconscionable must be decided by the arbitrator,not by the trial court.
assuming the trial court was even allowed to consider whether the arbitration provisions are unconscionable,it had to consider them by themselves,not together with the overall warranty.
the arbitration provisions,when considered by themselves,are not unconscionable.
even assuming some of the arbitration provisions are unconscionable,the trial court should have severed them and enforced the remaining arbitration provisions.
even assuming the trial court could consider the overall warranty,the overall warranty is not unconscionable or otherwise unenforceable.
we will hold that because plaintiffs are claiming,under the general rubric of unconscionability,that they never knowingly agreed to the arbitration provisions,the trial court,and not the arbitrator,had to resolve the unconscionability claim.we will further hold that the arbitration provisions were unconscionable because they were contained in a contract of adhesion,and they violated plaintiffs reasonable expectations 
procedural background 
in may,gabriel and josephine bruni and other individuals filed a complaint against james didion,didion.the plaintiffs alleged that in,they or their predecessors in interest purchased from didion a total of homes that didion had built in heritage,a development in yucaipa.the plaintiffs later discovered that these homes were defective.the defects allegedly included defective installation of windows,waterproofing,short roof underlayerment and excessive stucco cracking,which resulted in water intrusion,water damage,and other property damage.they asserted causes of action for breach of contract,breach of implied warranties,negligence,strict liability,and intentional and negligent misrepresentation.
also in may,james and pamela alvarado and other individuals filed a similar complaint against howard roberts development hrd and didion collectively defendants,alleging that didion was hrd joint venturer and alter ego.the plaintiffs alleged that in and,they or their predecessors in interest purchased a total of homes from defendants that defendants had built in the groves at chapman heights,a development in yucaipa.the plaintiffs later discovered that these homes had various defects.they asserted causes of action for breach of contract,breach of implied warranties,negligence,strict liability,and intentional and negligent misrepresentation.in addition,they asserted statutory causes of action based on business and professions code sections unlicensed contractor,unfair competition,and false advertising and civil code section building standards for new homes.
the same law firm represented both the bruni plaintiffs and the alvarado plaintiffs.
in march,defendants filed motions to compel arbitration in both actions plaintiffs opposed the motions on a number of grounds,including that the arbitration provisions were unconscionable.
in june,the trial court denied the motions.it explained t he protections provided to the builder under this agreement far exceed those benefits provided to the home purchaser.circumstances of the explanation and execution of this agreement dictate a finding that a minimum le vel of integrity in the process was not reached here.see the case of graham,incorporated,a case,at cal d.the results of this agreement are too not to be found unconscionable.see pardee construction company superior court,a case,at th,d.
furthermore,the circumstances of its execution indicate that it is a contract of adhesion.the court finds that the arbitration agreements are both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.for the record,the court decision is not based upon whether or not the plaintiffs read the agreement or understood it.
defendants counsel asked the trial court to specify the provision or provisions that were substantively unconscionable,but it declined to do so.
defendants filed notices of appeal in both actions.see code civ,subd.a order denying a petition to compel arbitration is appealable mercury ins.group superior court cal th,d.we granted defendants unopposed motion to consolidate the two appeals.
factual background 
hrd,a home builder,provided a warranty program created and administered by home buyers warranty corporation hbw,a colorado corporation.to enroll a home in the warranty program,hrd sent hbw an enrollment fee and an application form,signed by both the homebuyer and hrd.hbw then sent the homebuyer a certificate of warranty coverage and a warranty booklet.
the provisions of the application form were in approximately type.the form stated,by signing below,you acknowledge that you have read a sample copy of the warranty booklet and consent to the terms of these documents including the binding arbitration provision contained therein.you further understand that when the warranty is issued on your new home it is an express limited warranty and that all claims and liabilities are limited to and by the terms and conditions of the express limited warranty as stated in the b ooklet.
the warranty booklet,entitled home buyers warranty the warranty,was pages long.most of its provisions were in approximately type.the warranty was a contract between hrd and the homebuyer.hrd liability under the warranty was limited to the original sales price of your home some or all of hrd potential liability was covered by risk retention insurance.
the warranty provided three categories of coverage.first,under the workmanship coverage,the home was warranted for one year to be free from defects in material and workmanship as defined in the construction quality standards the construction quality standards took up of the pages of the warranty.they specified performance standards for different aspects of the construction however,in the course of doing so,they also set forth additional limitations and exclusions.for example,next to cracking of attached garage floor slab,they provided,no coverage.
second,under the systems coverage,the home was warranted for two years to be free from defects in the electrical,plumbing,and mechanical systems to the extent stated in the same construction quality standards.
finally,the home was warranted for years against a structural defect.structural defect was defined as actual physical damage to the designated elements of the home caused by failure of such elements which affects their functions to the extent that your home becomes unsafe,unsanitary,or otherwise unlivable.
the warranty excluded any coverage for d amage to swimming pools driveways boundary walls,retaining walls,and bulkheads except where boundary walls,retaining walls and bulkheads are necessary for the structural stability of the home fences landscaping sprinkler systems patios,decks,stoops,steps and porches,outbuildings and detached carports it also excluded any coverage for n oncompliance with plans and specifications or violations of local or national building codes,ordinances or standards.
the and versions of the warranty further provided this is an express limited warranty.all other express or implied warranties,including any oral or written statements or representations made by your builder or any other person,and any implied warranty of habitability,merchantability or fitness,are hereby disclaimed by your b uilder and are hereby waived by you.in addition,you are waiving the right to seek damages or other legal or equitable remedies from your builder under any other common law or statutory theory of liability,including but not limited to negligence or strict liability.your only remedy in the event of a defect in or to your home is the coverage provided to you under this express limited warranty.
the version of the warranty,however,provided the protection provided to you under this warranty is not in limitation of,but is in addition to,any other rights provided to you under california law.emphasis omitted.
finally,the warranty included the following arbitration provisions 
arbitration any and all claims,disputes and controversies by or between the homeowner and the builder arising from or related to this warranty,to the subject home,to any defect in or to the subject home,or the sale of the subject home by the builder,including,without limitation,any claim of breach of contract,negligent or intentional misrepresentation or nondisclosure in the inducement,execution or performance of any contract,including this arbitration agreement,and breach of any alleged duty of good faith and fair dealing,shall be submitted to arbitration by and pursuant to the rules of construction arbitration services,inc,or by such other arbitration service as hbw shall,in its sole discretion,select,and pursuant to the rules of that arbitration service 
this arbitration agreement shall inure to the benefit of,and be enforceable by,the builder agents and any other person whom sic the homeowner contends is responsible for any defect in or to the subject home the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding 
this arbitration agreement shall be deemed to be a arbitration agreement.any disputes concerning the interpretation or the enforceability of this arbitration agreement,including,without limitation,its revocability or voidability for any cause,the scope of arbitrable issues,and any defense based upon waiver,estoppel or laches,shall be decided by the arbitrator.
the parties expressly agree that this warranty and this arbitration agreement involve and concern interstate commerce and are governed by the provisions of the federal arbitration act,et,to the exclusion of any different or inconsistent state or local law,ordinance or judicial rule 
if any provision of this arbitration agreement shall be determined by the arbitrator or by any court to be unenforceable or to have been waived,the remaining provisions shall be deemed to be severable therefore and enforceable according to their terms.
construction arbitration services,cas is the largest alternative dispute resolution service in the united states that specializes in residential construction disputes.it has a panel of approximately professional arbitrators throughout the united states.
under cas rules,the arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction,including any objections with respect to the existence,scope,or validity of the arbitration agreement.the arbitrator shall have the power to determine the existence or validity of a contract of which the arbitration clause forms a part.such an arbitration clause shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract.a decision by the arbitrator that the contract is null and void shall not,for that reason alone,render the arbitration clause invalid.
when plaintiffs purchased their homes,they met with an hrd salesperson to sign the necessary documents.the salesperson provided a brief overview of the documents and told plaintiffs where to sign or initial.
the documents were preprinted and voluminous.there was no negotiation.plaintiffs understood that the documents were being presented to them on a take it or leave it basis.while some of them had purchased a home before,plaintiffs generally were not familiar with real estate documents or with legalese.
plaintiffs were not told to read the warranty before signing.the signing process was pretty quick,typically to minutes there was not enough time to read the warranty or any of the other documents.usually,plaintiffs received a copy of the warranty,along with the other documents,after they were finished signing.some,however,claimed that they did not receive it until after they had moved in.a few did not receive it at all.
some plaintiffs were told that the warranty was a benefit,an added bonus,extra protection,or a huge gift from the builder.others were told that it would cover any problems with the home.plaintiffs were never told how the warranty would affect their legal rights.

the petitioner bears the burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement by the preponderance of the evidence,and a party opposing the petition bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence any fact necessary to its defense.citation.in these summary proceedings,the trial court sits as a trier of fact,weighing all the affidavits,declarations,and other documentary evidence,as well as oral testimony received at the court discretion,to reach a final determination.citation.engalla permanente medical group,cal th,d.

in this case,there was no dispute as to the historical facts,only as to the legal conclusions to be drawn from those facts however,in one instance,it was possible to draw conflicting inferences from the otherwise uncontradicted evidence.not the plaintiffs filed declarations in opposition to the motions,stating that they did not read the purchase documents,that there was no negotiation.one could infer that the nontestifying plaintiffs experiences were similar on the other hand,from their very failure to testify,one could infer that their experiences were different.in this one instance,then,we presume that the trial court drew the inference most favorable to plaintiffs.otherwise,we will apply a de novo standard of review.
prima paint and the severability doctrine.
w hen considering a motion to compel arbitration,the court must initially determine whether the parties agreed to arbitrate the dispute in question.citation.this determination involves two considerations whether there is a valid agreement to arbitrate between the parties and whether the dispute in question falls within the scope of that arbitration agreement.citation.banks mitsubishi motors credit of america,cir,quoting webb investacorp,cir,see also code civ,subd.b.
ordinarily,the court can not consider any claim that the contract as a whole is invalid.under prima paint flood conklin,d prima paint,when the federal arbitration act,et faa applies,arbitration clauses as a matter of federal law are separable from the contracts in which they are embedded prima paint,at,fn.omitted.as a result,an arbitration clause may be enforceable regardless of whether the contract surrounding it is enforceable.id.at.
for example,in prima paint itself,the party resisting arbitration claimed that it had been fraudulently induced to enter the contract.prima paint,supra,at.the court held that,if the party had been claiming fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause itself,a court would have to adjudicate that claim before it could compel arbitration.id.at.however,the party could be compelled to arbitrate a claim of fraud in the inducement of the contract generally.id.at.
recently,in buckeye check cashing,cardegna,d buckeye,the supreme court held that prima paint applies to void as well as voidable contracts.buckeye,at.there,the parties resisting arbitration claimed that the contract was illegal because it was usurious and violated various state lending and laws id.at.
the supreme court held that the faa required the illegality claim to be submitted to the arbitrator challenges to the validity of arbitration agreements can be divided into two types.one type challenges specifically the validity of the agreement to arbitrate.citation.the other challenges the contract as a whole respondents claim is of this second type.buckeye,supra.at.under prima paint,it concluded,unless the challenge is to the arbitration clause itself,the issue of the contract validity is considered by the arbitrator in the first instance.buckeye,at.
the court observed it is true that the prima paint rule permits a court to enforce an arbitration agreement in a contract that the arbitrator later finds to be void.but it is equally true that the opposite approach permits a court to deny effect to an arbitration provision in a contract that the court later finds to be perfectly enforceable.prima paint resolved this resolved it in favor of the separate enforceability of arbitration provisions.buckeye,supra.at.
a court,however,still must consider one type of challenge to the overall contract a claim that the party resisting arbitration never actually agreed to be bound.see buckeye,supra.at,fn.noting that o ur opinion today does not speak to the issue of whether any agreement between the alleged obligor and obligee was ever concluded.a rbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.citation.howsam dean witter reynolds,d,quoting steelworkers warrior gulf nav,d.where a party apparent assent to a written contract is negated,there is simply no arbitration agreement to be enforced.rosenthal great western fin.securities cal th,d.there would be a severe problem of bootstrapping if a party to a contract could be forced to arbitrate the question whether he had been coerced or deceived into agreeing to arbitrate disputes arising under the contract.matterhorn,ncr cir.

agreement to arbitrate issues of arbitrability.
defendants contend that plaintiffs unconscionability claim challenged the warranty as a whole,and hence,under prima paint,the trial court should have compelled arbitration without even considering unconscionability.plaintiffs respond that,at least for purposes of the motion to compel arbitration,their unconscionability claim was directed solely at the arbitration provisions.
defendants,however,also contend that,even assuming plaintiffs are challenging only the arbitration provisions,the trial court still should have compelled arbitration.they note that,under the arbitration provisions here,it was up to the arbitrator to decide whether the arbitration provisions themselves were valid.they argue that such a greements to arbitrate issues of arbitrability are enforceable.
because the parties are the masters of their collective fate,they can agree to arbitrate almost any a dispute over whether the underlying dispute is subject to arbitration.however,there is a presumption that they have not agreed to this.the question whether the parties have submitted a particular dispute to arbitration,the question of arbitrability,is an issue for judicial determination u nless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise.citations.howsam dean witter reynolds,supra,at,quoting at t technologies,communications workers of america,d.
regrettably,arbitrability is an ambiguous term that can encompass multiple distinct concepts.see howsam dean witter reynolds,supra,at.it seems clear that the parties can agree to have arbitrability in the sense of the scope of the arbitration by the arbitrator.for example,in dream theater,dream theater th,d,there was no dispute that the parties had entered into a valid and binding arbitration agreement see id.at,d the parties resisting arbitration merely disputed the scope of that agreement.they argued that one of the other side claims was not arbitrable because it arose under a different contract,which did not have an arbitration clause they also argued that the other side had waived one of its claims.id.at,d.the appellate court held that the parties had clearly and unmistakably agreed that the arbitrator will decide the scope of the arbitration agreement.id.at,d,italics added,capitalization altered see also id.at,d accord,rodriguez american technologies,th,d.
similarly,in qualcomm nokia,there does not seem to have been any dispute that the parties had entered into a valid and binding arbitration agreement.see id.at.rather,the parties resisting arbitration argued that the underlying dispute did not arise out of or relate to the particular contract that contained the arbitration clause.id.at see also id.at.the appellate court held that the arbitration agreement clearly and unmistakably shows the parties intent to delegate the issue of determining arbitrability to an arbitrator.id.at see also mercedes homes,rosario.dist so d,parties agreed that scope of arbitrable issues was to be decided by arbitrator.
but can the parties agree to have arbitrability in the sense of whether the arbitration clause is valid,binding,and by the arbitrator at first glance,this appears hopelessly circular it presumes that the parties are bound by the arbitration clause,even though this is the very issue that has yet to be decided.however,the only way to avoid such circularity is to presume that the parties are not bound by the arbitration clause,even though it may yet be decided that they are.
thus,an agreement to arbitrate the validity of an arbitration clause presents the same conundrum that was noted in buckeye,supra.at page.according to buckeye,prima paint resolved this resolved it in favor of the separate enforceability of arbitration provisions.ibid.we therefore conclude that prima paint,and the cases following it,provide the solution to the conundrum here,as well.
under these circumstances,a court must look to the precise nature of the claim that the party resisting arbitration is making.if it is claiming that it never agreed to the arbitration clause at,if it is claiming forgery or fraud in the the court must consider that claim.on the other hand,if it is not denying that it agreed to the arbitration clause,but instead it is claiming some other defense to enforcement of the arbitration,illegality or fraud in the the court must enforce the arbitrability portion of the arbitration clause by compelling the parties to submit that defense to arbitration.this approach is consistent with the supreme court direction that c ourts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is clea r and unmistakabl e evidence that they did so.citations.first options of chicago,kaplan,d.
defendants rely on terminix intern.palmer ranch.partnership cir.there,terminix sought to compel arbitration of its dispute with palmer ranch.palmer ranch argued that the applicable arbitration clauses were illegal and unenforceable because they purported to limit its statutory rights and remedies,including its right to recover punitive damages,treble damages,attorney fees,and injunctive and declaratory relief.id.at.
the appellate court noted that the arbitration clause incorporated american arbitration association rules and that these rules provide d that t he arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction,including any objections with respect to the existence,scope or validity of the arbitration agreement.citation.terminix intern.palmer ranch.partnership,supra,at.thus,the parties had clearly and unmistakably agreed that the arbitrator should decide whether the arbitration clause is valid.ibid.the court concluded because the parties have agreed that the arbitrator should decide this ultimate question,there is no reason for us to decide the subsidiary,antecedent questions regarding the validity of the remedial restrictions that palmer ranch now challenges.id.at.
significantly,in terminix,supra,palmer ranch was not claiming that it had not knowingly agreed to the arbitration clause.instead,it was asserting a claim of illegality,much like the one in buckeye.thus,terminix is not inconsistent with our view that,if the parties have agreed to arbitrate issues regarding the validity of the arbitration clause,a party that is claiming illegality can be compelled to arbitrate that defense.
application to plaintiffs unconscionability claim.
we now apply these general principles to plaintiffs unconscionability claim.
general unconscionability principles.
unconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element.citation.both elements must be present for a court to invalidate a contract or clause,although the degree to which each must exist may vary.citation.
the procedural element of unconscionability focuses on two factors oppression and surprise.citation.oppression arises from an inequality of bargaining power which results in no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice.citation.surprise involves the extent to which the supposedly terms of the bargain are hidden in a prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce the disputed terms.citation.
the substantive element of unconscionability focuses on the actual terms of the agreement and evaluates whether they create overly harsh or results as to shock the conscience.citations.aron of california th,d,quoting a m produce fmc d.kinney united healthcare services,th,d.
the procedural element of an unconscionable contract generally takes the form of a contract of adhesion discover bank superior court cal th,d.however,a dhesion is not a prerequisite for unconscionability.harper ultimo th,d.a contract term may be held to be unconscionable even if the weaker party knowingly agreed to it,mercuro superior court th,d.
contracts of adhesion.
the term contract of adhesion signifies a standardized contract,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.citation.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,quoting neal state farm ins.d.adhesion contracts are,of course,a familiar part of the modern legal landscape they are also an inevitable fact of life for all and consumer alike.graham,cal d,fns.omitted.
although contracts of adhesion are generally enforceable according to their terms,a provision contained in such a contract can not be enforced if it does not fall within the reasonable expectations of the weaker or adhering party.citations.fischer first internat.bank th,d.
it is not entirely clear whether this principle is a subspecies of the doctrine of unconscionability or a separate doctrine.see perdue crocker national bank cal d,fn,graham,supra,cal d at.some cases have invalidated adhesion contract terms as beyond the reasonable expectations of the weaker party without any discussion of whether the terms were unconscionable,fischer first internat.bank,supra,th at,d dragnet clause in preprinted form trust deed.nevertheless,failure to pass the reasonable expectations test is generally treated as the equivalent of substantive unconscionability.see armendariz foundation health psychcare services,supra,cal th at,d.
the arbitrability of unconscionability claims.
as we discussed in part,ante,ordinarily,a court must decide whether there is a valid agreement to arbitrate between the parties.hence,if the party resisting arbitration is claiming that the arbitration clause itself is unconscionable,a court must decide this claim.discover bank superior court,supra,cal th at,d,higgins superior court,supra,th at,d nagrampa mailcoups,cir,en banc see also doctor associates,casarotto,d generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening the faa.however,provided the court concludes that the arbitration clause itself is not unconscionable,it must compel arbitration,leaving it up to the arbitrator to determine whether the contract as a whole is unconscionable.nagrampa,at jenkins first american cash advance of georgia cir.
the case before us is not ordinary,however,because the arbitration provisions here empower the arbitrator to determine arbitrability.accordingly,as we discussed in part,ante,we must look to the precise nature of plaintiffs claims.
we may assume,without deciding,that if plaintiffs were admitting that they knowingly agreed to the arbitration provisions,they could be required to arbitrate an unconscionability claim.for example,in stewart paul,hastings,janofsky walker,llp d,it was undisputed that the plaintiff,as a condition of commencing her former employment,had signed a broad arbitration agreement with defendant id.at.the plaintiff argued,however,that the arbitration clause was unconscionable because arbitration before the aaa,the forum selected by the clause,would be an uneven playing field,the plaintiff must foot half the bill,the forum is biased,the plaintiff has less time to file a claim,the opportunities for discovery are more limited,and any recovery inevitably would be smaller.ibid.the court held that the issue of enforceability of the clause in the first instance is for the arbitrator,as the arbitration clause explicitly provides that the arbitrator has exclusive jurisdiction to resolve any dispute as to whether all or any part of this agreement is void or voidable,fn.omitted.
here,however,plaintiffs are claiming that they never knowingly agreed to the arbitration provisions.as in most,if not all,adhesion contract cases,they deny ever reading them.the general rule that one who signs an instrument may not avoid the impact of its terms on the ground that he failed to read the instrument before signing it applies only in the absence of overreaching stewart preston pipeline th,d or imposition jefferson department of youth authority cal th,d.thus,it does not apply to an adhesion contract.madden kaiser foundation hospitals cal d,ramirez superior court d.bauer jackson d.indeed,failure to read the contract helps establish actual surprise patterson itt consumer financial th,d.
defendants argue that,under evidence code section,plaintiffs are bound by the recital in the application form that they had read a sample copy of the warranty booklet evidence code section,however,does not bar an assertion of fraud or other grounds for rescission.miller criswell d,dealing with former code civ,statutory predecessor of.this would be impermissible bootstrapping.for similar reasons,it should not apply to recitals in an adhesion contract.see city of santa cruz pacific gas electric th,d,is inapplicable in the p
