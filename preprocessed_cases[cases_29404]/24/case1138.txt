lessin contends that the arbitration panel engaged in misconduct by refusing to hear pertinent and material evidence from one of his designated expert witnesses.in considering this contention,the court is mindful of the fact that i n making evidentiary determinations,an arbitrator need not follow all the niceties observed by the federal courts.tempo shain bertek,cir quoting bell aerospace.div.of textron local,uaw,cir.the arbitrator need only grant the parties a fundamentally fair hearing.bell aerospace,at accord sheldon vermonty,cir see hoteles condado beach,la concha convention ctr.union de tronquistas local,cir.post office mailhandlers postal,cir totem marine tug barge am.towing,cir newark stereotypers union newark morning ledger,cir.it is well within an arbitrator authority to refuse to hear evidence that is cumulative,see,hoteles condado beach,at post office mailhandlers,at,or of little relevance,see,hoteles condado beach,at grahams serv.teamsters local,cir see also sec.indus.conference on arbitration,the arbitrator manual may.
at the arbitration proceedings,lessin testified that bernstein had misrepresented his experience as a broker and had never cautioned him regarding the excessive risk in his accounts.lessin also elicited testimony that merrill lynch had failed to supervise bernstein,and he presented evidence that both bernstein and merrill lynch had encouraged the use of excessive margin loans,and that merrill lynch had maintained a buy recommendation on during the period when lessin lost million on the stock.according to lessin,this loss was compounded by a million loss on be beos,a stock that bernstein had continuously recommended.while acknowledging that he had received monthly statements on the status of his account and written confirmations of each security trade,and that he had tracked his stocks on merrill lynch website,lessin claimed that he did not study these materials and only did what bernstein recommended.
both bernstein and robert jones,lessin broker at ferris,testified that they had advised lessin to diversify his account.jones testified that lessin had said from the beginning that he wanted to trade on margin and did not want to sell the stock.jones had advised lessin that he had too much stock,but lessin loved and he thought it was going higher in value.bernstein testified to the same effect and that he had advised lessin to pay off some of his margin debt,but that lessin had repeatedly made it very clear he did not want to sell it was an option.bernstein also testified that he had made notations of his advice to lessin on his computer in a program called gold mine.those notations included an entry dated october,that 
howard rothman,another merrill lynch broker and i had spoken to lessin numerous times about being so aggressive,especially on margin.also,we were discussing that he would take losses on the stocks that were on margin because he felt they would come back.now,after a large margin call,he was forced to sell them.he thought he knew it all.
lessin proffered two expert witnesses in an attempt to show that the gold mine notes were fabricated after the fact.the first was kenneth bradley,an independent computer forensic examiner trained at the defense department in techniques of evidence recovery.he opined,based on his examination of the hard drive on bernstein computer,that many of the gold mine entries appeared to have been made at the same time.merrill lynch expert,michael william finnie,who also had examined the hard drive,testified that a maintenance function,which indexes a database by sorting entries into files,had been run on the hard drive and explained the compression of the gold mine data.while both experts ultimately agreed that certain gold mine entries were genuine,they disagreed regarding the genuineness of the october,note.
after hearing a full day of testimony from each party expert,the panel announced the following morning that it had decided it did not need to hear from lessin second expert,art ehuan,a certified forensics computer examiner with experience in the private and public sectors,who taught at georgetown and george washington universities.the panel chairman explained that the panel members thought they had sufficient information about what had happened and how the gold mine program worked.they also did not want to face the possibility of hearing from a rebuttal expert witness called by merrill lynch if lessin were allowed to call a se
