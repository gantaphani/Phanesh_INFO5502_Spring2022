as we observed three years ago,the mandatory fee arbitration act mfaa,under business and professions code section et,provides a quick and inexpensive method for clients,at their option,to resolve fee disputes with their attorneys.law offices of dixon howell valley th,d,fn.omitted.in the fee dispute before arose out of federal litigation that was settled years resolution of the dispute has proved neither quick nor inexpensive.
appellant elvia grajales retained respondent ismael perez in to represent her on a contingent fee basis in connection with claims against her former employer.after the employment litigation was resolved in late with grajales receiving a substantial settlement payable to perez trust account,a dispute arose concerning the amount of net proceeds that were due to grajales.she ultimately applied with the local county bar association to arbitrate her dispute with perez under the mfaa.grajales prevailed and received an arbitration award of in december.
perez timely filed a complaint with the superior court rejecting the arbitration award in accordance with business and professions code section,subdivision c.grajales filed a,which was amended on several occasions.more than five years after the filing of the complaint,grajales moved to dismiss the complaint under the mandatory provisions of the code of civil procedure code civ,perez filed his own motion to dismiss grajales third amended under the same statutes.in addition,grajales moved to confirm the fee arbitration award and to enter judgment on the confirmed award.the court granted both motions to dismiss and denied grajales motion to enter judgment on the arbitration award.
grajales challenges the orders dismissing her and denying the motion to confirm and enter judgment on the arbitration award.she claims that the was not subject to dismissal under the mandatory provisions of the code of civil procedure because after the periods of time that it was impossible,impracticable,or futile to bring the case to trial,subd.c are deducted,there was less than five years from the filing of the to dismissal.grajales also contends that the court should have confirmed the fee arbitration award,because perez effectively repudiated his prior request for trial de novo of the arbitration award by failing to diligently prosecute his complaint so that it was involuntarily dismissed.we conclude that the court did not err in dismissing the.but we hold further that the court should have granted the motion to confirm the fee arbitration award and enter judgment on that confirmed award.accordingly,we will reverse the order denying that motion.
facts and procedural history 
on april,grajales entered into a contingency fee agreement with perez under which he would represent her in connection with her employment claims against airtronics.the agreement provided that grajales would pay perez a contingency fee of and percent of all gross recoveries if the matter settled before the taking of any depositions,and percent of all gross recoveries if the case settled after the taking of the first deposition.the agreement did not define the term all gross recoveries.
according to a settlement agreement signed by grajales in november,she filed a lawsuit against airtronics in the united states district court,northern district of california,seeking damages related to the loss of her position with airtronics,injury to her reputation,and mental and emotional distress.after two mistrials,a jury awarded grajales.perez and his cocounsel,michael morrissey,filed a posttrial motion for attorney fees and were awarded a total sum of the case went on appeal before the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit.the settlement agreement noted that after the parties had engaged in extensive settlement discussions and mediation supervised by the ninth circuit,they had reached a settlement on november,pursuant to which airtronics agreed to pay a specified sum to perez trust account in full settlement of the action.
thereafter,on or about may,grajales filed an application with the santa clara county bar association sccba to arbitrate a fee dispute with perez.she alleged that the amount of the dispute was,plus interest.in her description of the dispute attached to the application,grajales stated that perez had refused her request to provide her with a summary of the expenses incurred in the airtronics litigation pursuant to her fee agreement with perez,she was entitled to percent of the gross recovery and her portion of the gross recovery was short by.
a panel of the sccba fee arbitration committee conducted an arbitration on november.as reflected in the subsequent arbitration award,perez,grajales,and morrissey appeared at the arbitration.on december,the panel entered their arbitration award in favor of grajales in the total sum of.the panel concluded that under the contingency fee agreement,perez was entitled to receive percent of all gross recoveries.because grajales had already been charged than the owed under the fee panel concluded that she was entitled to the difference,plus interest and filing fees.
on january,perez filed an unverified complaint against grajales to reject the nonbinding arbitration award of the sccba panel.on february,grajales answered the complaint and filed a against perez,morrissey,and his law firm.in the,she alleged that perez and morrissey had falsely represented to her that,contrary to the terms of her fee agreement with perez,she was entitled to of the gross amount of the settlement of the federal action.grajales alleged claims for fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,and breach of contract.she later dismissed morrissey as a.
on or about april,grajales filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to sections and for failure to prosecute the case to trial within five years she concurrently filed a motion to confirm the sccba fee arbitration award and to enter judgment on the confirmed award.she argued in that motion that perez,through his dilatory conduct in the prosecution of the complaint,had effectively repudiated his request for a trial de novo the two motions were accompanied by a declaration of counsel attaching some exhibits that grajales claimed supported her position that perez had been extremely dilatory in prosecuting the case.perez filed separate oppositions to the motion to dismiss and the motion to confirm and enter judgment on the fee arbitration award.
also on or about april,perez filed a motion to dismiss the,on the basis that it had not been prosecuted to trial within five years as required under sections and grajales opposed the motion.after hearing argument on the three motions,on may,the court granted both parties motions to dismiss,ordered both the action and dismissed,and denied grajales motion to confirm the fee arbitration award and enter judgment on the award.
grajales filed a timely notice of appeal from the order an order dismissing an action is a proper subject for appeal,pursuant to sections,and.southern pac.willett cal,dismissal order under former statute requiring action to be brought to trial within five years appealable.we likewise conclude that the order denying grajales motion to confirm the arbitration award and enter judgment on the award is appealable,because the mfaa bus,subd.b permits a party to petition to confirm an arbitration award in the same manner that arbitration awards may be confirmed under section et.see,subds.b appeal may be taken from order dismissing a petition to confirm an award,c appeal may be taken from order vacating arbitration award see also ray wilson anaheim memorial hospital d,fn.order denying petition to confirm arbitration award in effect dismisses the proceeding before the court and is equivalent to an order vacating the award,disapproved on other grounds in moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.
discussion 
issues on appeal 
the issues on appeal are as follows 
whether there was a period in which it was impossible,impracticable,or futile to bring the to trial under section,subdivision c,and if so,whether after subtraction of that period from the time the was pending,the was subject to dismissal under the mandatory provisions of sections and.
whether the court,based upon its dismissal of the complaint for failure to prosecute it to trial,should have confirmed the fee arbitration award and entered judgment on the award.
ii.dismissal of third amended 
grajales contends that the court erred by dismissing her.in asserting that the period for bringing a case to trial under section had not expired,she argues that there were four separate periods during which it was impossible,impracticable,or futile to bring the to trial under section,subdivision c after discussing the basic law applicable generally to mandatory dismissal motions brought under section,we address each of these periods in which grajales claims that it was impossible,impracticable,or futile to bring the to trial.
applicable law 
under section,an action must be brought to trial within five years after its commencement against a defendant.by statutory definition,action includes a,subd.a,and defendant includes a,subd.d.see also tomales bay.superior court cal d,is subject to mandatory dismissal under former section,where failed to bring it to trial within five years of its filing.an action not brought to trial within five years shall be dismissed by the court on its own motion or on motion of the defendant,subd.a see also,subd.b requirements of this article are mandatory.the parties,however,may extend the statute in writing or by a recital on the record in court.additionally,section provides specifically that the period does not include the time that the court jurisdiction is suspended,subd.a the trial or prosecution of the case was stayed or enjoined,subd.b or the b ringing of the action to trial,for any other reason,was impossible,impracticable,or futile,subd.c.although the impossibility exception is now prescribed by statute,it has its origins in a judicially created exception to the statute.hughes kimble,supra,th at,d.
the mandatory dismissal statute is founded upon the policy of the diligent prosecution of actions.see it is the policy of the state that a plaintiff shall proceed with reasonable diligence in the prosecution of an action but that all parties shall cooperate in bringing the action to trial or other disposition a plaintiff in this instance,a has the duty at every stage of the proceedings to use due diligence to expedite his case to a final determination.citations.crown coach superior court cal d,crown coach,overruled on other grounds in hocharian superior court cal d,fn.this includes the obligation to apprise the court of the need to set the case for trial within the statute.howard thrifty drug discount stores cal th,d,howard see also dresser bindi d.after requesting trial de novo rejecting judicial arbitration award after case was in arbitration more than four and years after commencement of action,plaintiff had duty to advise court of correct date that statute would run in order to have case set for trial within statutory period.
under the impossibility exception of section,subdivision c,w hat is impossible,impracticable,or futile is determined in light of all the circumstances of a particular case,including the conduct of the parties and the nature of the proceedings.the critical factor is whether the plaintiff exercised reasonable diligence in prosecuting its case.citation.the statute must be liberally construed,consistent with the policy favoring trial on the merits.citation.brown bryant,hartford accident indemnity th,d.reasonable diligence places on a plaintiff the affirmative duty to make every reasonable effort to bring a case to trial within five years,even during the last month of its statutory life.citation.baccus superior court d.a showing of reasonable diligence alone is not enough rather,reasonable diligence constitutes a guideline by which to assess the existing exceptions of impossibility,impracticability,or futility.citation.id.at.
the determination of whether the impossibility exception applies involves a inquiry and depends on the obstacles faced by the plaintiff in prosecuting the action and the plaintiff exercise of reasonable diligence in overcoming those obstacles.citation.howard,supra,cal th at,d.the plaintiff bears the burden of proof with respect to the existence of circumstances warranting the application of the impossibility exception.tamburina combined ins.of america th,d tamburina bank of america superior court d.the trial court has discretion to determine whether the impossibility exception applies,and that decision will be disturbed on appeal only if an abuse of that discretion is shown.sanchez city of los angeles th,d hughes kimble,supra,th at,d.
periods claimed under impossibility exception 
grajales argues that there were four separate time which it was impossible,impracticable,or futile to bring the to trial within the meaning of section,subdivision c.we address each of these four periods below.
notices of unavailability by opposing 
grajales notes that perez,who was both a party and cocounsel of record for himself,filed three separate notices of unavailability in pursuant to tenderloin housing clinic,sparks th,d.these three notices indicated that perez would be unavailable for any purpose for periods of,and days,respectively,for a total period of unavailability of days grajales contends that this collective period of perez unavailability should have been excluded in the calculation of the time the was pending because it constituted impossibility,impracticability,or futility.we reject that contention.
as grajales herself admits,this argument was not presented to the trial court.i t is fundamental that a reviewing court will ordinarily not consider claims made for the first time on appeal which could have been but were not presented to the trial court.citation.asbestos claims facility berry berry d.see also jrs products,matsushita of america th,d appellate courts are loath to reverse a judgment on grounds that the opposing party did not have an opportunity to argue and the trial court did not have an opportunity to consider.we will therefore ignore arguments,authority,and facts not presented and litigated in the trial court.bialo western mut.ins.th,d.such arguments raised for the first time on appeal are generally deemed forfeited.in re cal th,fn,d.
this conclusion is particularly appropriate here,where grajales,in essence,contends that the court erred by not excluding the time of perez unavailability,even though the court was not made aware of this circumstance.since we review a trial court decisions concerning the applicability of the impossibility exception for abuse of discretion sanchez city of los angeles,supra,th at,d,it would indeed be peculiar for us to determine here that the court abused discretion it was never given an opportunity to exercise.we therefore reject as being forfeited grajales claim that the collective period stated in perez three notices of unavailability should have been excluded in calculating the time the was pending 
illness of opposing 
grajales argues that there was at least one trial postponement that occurred in because of perez statement to the court that he had significant health problems occurring as a result of complications from surgery.she notes that a trial scheduled for march,was continued for a period of days to june,following an ex parte application to continue presented by morrissey with the accompanying declaration of perez explaining his health circumstances.
as was the case with her argument concerning the perez notices of unavailability,grajales did not argue below that the trial continuance based on perez health problems justified the exclusion of days or any other amount of time in calculating the period that the was pending.she therefore forfeited the right to make this new argument on appeal.asbestos claims facility berry berry,supra,d at.
pendency of motions filed by perez 
grajales also argues that there were other time periods that were subject to the impossibility exception.as best we can determine from her opening brief,her contention is that,within the meaning of section,subdivision c,it was impossible,impracticable,or futile for her to bring her to trial for a period of days that potentially dispositive motions filed by perez were pending 
in support of her claim that the impossibility exception applies here,grajales notes that perez filed a number of motions challenging various versions of her.perez filed a motion for summary judgment that was decided by the court by an order filed december.in october,perez filed a motion for summary adjudication.by order filed january,the court denied that motion and treated it as a motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the initial it granted that motion with leave to amend to permit grajales to sufficiently allege reliance in support of her fraud claim.perez filed a demurrer and motion to strike relative to the first amended,which was granted in part by order filed may.in august,perez filed another motion for summary adjudication directed towards the second amended complaint.by order filed november,the court denied summary adjudication,treated the motion as one for judgment on the pleadings,and granted that motion with leave to amend as to the fraud cause of action on the basis that grajales has conceded certain pleading errors and requested leave to amend.after grajales again amended her pleading,perez filed a demurrer to the in january.that demurrer was not heard because grajales filed an amendment to the to correct certain headings.perez thereafter filed a demurrer to the,as amended,which was overruled in march.
grajales argues that these procedural circumstances compelled the trial court to find that it was impossible,impracticable,or futile,subd.c to bring the case to trial during the time periods that these issues were being decided.but as the supreme court explained in crown coach,supra,cal d at page,the impossibility exception does not contemplate that time consumed by the delay caused by ordinary incidents of proceedings like disposition of demurrer,amendment of pleadings and the normal time of waiting for a place on the court calendar or securing a jury trial is to be excluded from a computation of the period.citation.citations.further,while grajales challenges the propriety of perez actions,as a he was within his rights to assert legal challenges to various that were successively amended.pavicich santucci th,fn,d.
moreover,grajales position ignores the fact that a seeking to apply the impossibility exception must,in addition to presenting the circumstance,show a causal connection between it and the failure to proceed to trial tamburina,supra,th at,d,and that the acted with reasonable diligence in prosecuting the case id.at,d.the papers presented in opposition to perez motion to dismiss do not clearly demonstrate such causal connection or diligence.for example,on the question of diligence,there is no indication that grajales,through her counsel,made any specific efforts to obtain a trial date before the anniversary of the filing of her or that she otherwise alerted the court that a trial date needed to be set in order to prevent mandatory dismissal.see,de santiago d g plumbing,th,d,within last six months of statute,had duty to advise court that it had set a trial date after expiration of that period,and it was thus not diligent when it acquiesced in court setting of that trial date sanchez city of los angeles,supra,th at,d impossibility exception rejected in part because plaintiffs counsel did not apprise court of impending anniversary or attempt to secure trial date within five years.in fact,as late as march,at the hearing on perez demurrer,grajales counsel raised the issue that,although he did not have the exact date,f ive years is going to run in the next few months 
grajales bore the burden of establishing the applicability of the impossibility exception to the circumstances of the pending motions filed by perez.tamburina,supra,th at,d.the court impliedly found that she did not meet that burden.we conclude that such an implied finding did not constitute an abuse of discretion by the court.see sanchez city of los angeles,supra,th at,d.
extraordinary writ proceeding 
the court entered an order denying perez motion for summary judgment on grajales initial on december.perez filed a petition for writ of mandate or prohibition with this court on or about december.we denied that petition on february.grajales argues that the days that perez writ petition was pending in this court should be excluded in calculating the period that the was pending.in support of this position,she relies on new west fed.savings loan superior court d.new west.
in new west,the defendant motion for summary judgment was denied.new west,supra,d at.after the appellate court granted the defendant initial petition for writ of mandate and required the trial court to enter an order compliant with section,the trial court issued a new order denying summary judgment,from which the defendant filed a second mandate petition.new west,supra,at.the appellate court entered an order staying the trial proceedings during the pendency of the first writ petition,but did not do so with respect to the second petition.ibid.the defendant thereafter was unsuccessful in moving to dismiss the action for failing to bring the case to trial within five years and then filed a new mandate petition,arguing,inter alia,that the trial court erred in applying the impossibility exception to the period in which the second writ petition was pending.id.at.the appellate court rejected the defendant argument,concluding that the trial court application of the impossibility exception was amply supported by the evidence.id.at.the court reasoned,this court decision on the writ could have disposed of the entire action,making a trial in the case unnecessary.had the plaintiffs started the trial while the writ was pending,and had the writ been granted,the trial to that point would have been a complete waste of time,money and judicial resources.moreover,there was the possibility the writ would have disposed of just some of the issues because the summary judgment motion alternatively sought summary adjudication of issues.thus,if the trial had begun on all issues and the writ disposed of some of those issues,the trial would have been misdirected to that point.ibid.
under new west,supra,d,it would have been appropriate to exclude the period in which perez challenged the denial of his summary judgment motion in this court.see also kaye mount la jolla homeowners d.impossibility exception applied while plaintiffs pursued writ petition challenging trial court elimination of punitive damage claims.the court order granting perez motion to dismiss,however,does not indicate whether the court,in fact,excluded the days the writ petition was pending in calculating whether the statute under section had expired.but assuming that the court did exclude this,based upon our ultimate conclusion that there were no other time periods that should have been excluded under the impossibility was nonetheless pending for more than five years.therefore,dismissal of the was required,regardless of whether the trial court excluded the time perez writ petition was pending in this court.

propriety of denial of motion to enter judgment 
relevant case authority 
grajales contends that the court erred in denying her motion to enter judgment on the fee arbitration award.she argues that perez failure to prosecute the that resulted in its involuntary a repudiation of his prior request for trial de novo of the arbitration award.as such,the court should have reinstated the fee arbitration award by entering judgment on it in support of this position,grajales relies principally on two cases,herbert hawkins realtors,milheiser d.herbert hawkins,and corell law firm of fox and fox th,d corell.
in herbert hawkins,after referral of the case to judicial arbitration et,and after the rendering of an award in favor of the defendants,the plaintiffs made a timely request for trial de novo.herbert hawkins,supra,d at.prior to a mandatory settlement conference,the plaintiffs filed a voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the action.ibid.because the dismissal was without prejudice,defendants were denied their request for issuance of an abstract of judgment as well as their request for statutory costs and disbursements.ibid.they thereafter made a motion for entry of dismissal with prejudice,which was denied.ibid.the defendants appealed from these orders.ibid.the appellate court reversed,holding that permitting the plaintiffs to dismiss their case without prejudice after their rejection of an unfavorable arbitration award would defeat the purpose of the judicial arbitration statutes of expediting and removing complexities from the judicial process relating to small civil claims citation.such a construction of the interrelationship of the relevant statutes produces absurd consequences and promotes mischievous lawyering.id.at,fn.omitted.the court reasoned further,no party has the right to avoid the judicial arbitration award at their whim,and the party requesting a trial de novo may either proceed with a trial de novo or allow the award to be entered as a judgment,challengeable as provided by section or judicial council rules.citation.when parties withdraw requests for a trial de novo or voluntarily dismiss their complaints,they repudiate their previous election for a trial de novo.this factually restores the repudiating parties to their legal positions before electing the trial de novo,and triggers award finalization under section.accordingly,we hold a party is not entitled to a voluntary dismissal without prejudice within the judicial arbitration setting merely to avoid an unfavorable arbitration award.id.at,fns.omitted,italics added.
in calderon kane th,d calderon,the first district court of appeal division five followed herbert hawkins in reaching the conclusion that the plaintiffs voluntary dismissal without prejudice of their suit following their timely rejection of an unfavorable judicial arbitration award constituted a repudiation of that prior de novo request.the court in calderon reasoned,there is no reason a dissatisfied party should be able to render the entire arbitration proceeding a judicial nullity by the simple procedural tactic of requesting a trial de novo and then dismissing that request.id.at,d.
kelley bredelis th,d kelley,involved a slightly different circumstance,namely,the plaintiffs dismissal with prejudice of their action after their rejection of an unfavorable judicial arbitration award.the court noted that the plaintiffs,having already had their day in court by participating in the arbitration,sought a second day in court by rejecting the award.id.at,d.following the reasoning in herbert hawkins,the court held that the plaintiffs did not have an absolute right to dismiss their case.instead,the plaintiffs request for dismissal resulted in a repudiation of their request for trial de novo and a reinstatement of the arbitration award.such a reconciliation of the competing interests between the voluntary dismissal statute and the judicial arbitration statutes promotes a wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity.citation.to allow otherwise neither makes good sense nor good law.although this case involves a dismissal with prejudice while herbert hawkins involved a dismissal without prejudice,we find no significant reason to treat the two types of dismissal differently under the facts of this case.kelley bredelis,supra,at,d.
in contrast to herbert hawkins,calderon,and kelley,the somewhat procedurally convoluted circumstances in corell,supra,th,d involved an attorney fee dispute arbitrated under the mfaa.the retainer agreement there provided for binding arbitration of disputes between attorney and client under the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association but it also recognized that the client could elect nonbinding arbitration under the mfaa or binding arbitration under the agreement.id.at,d.after a fee dispute arose,the client pursued arbitration under the mfaa,resulting in the rendering of an arbitration award that the attorneys timely rejected by filing an action.id.at,d.the client requested that the action be stayed so that the matter could proceed with binding arbitration in accordance with the retainer agreement.ibid.the court ordered the matter to arbitration to be completed within six months.ibid.the arbitration never occurred ibid,and the attorneys ultimately dismissed the action without prejudice.id.at,d.the client filed a new action,the attorneys for fees under the agreement,and the client demurred,contending that the was an untimely challenge to the arbitration award rendered under the mfaa.id.at,d.the trial court concluded that the attorneys had repudiated their de novo request relative to the fee arbitration award by dismissing the prior action but it also held that the parties were required to resolve their dispute with binding arbitration pursuant to the retainer agreement,and it thus struck the client complaint.id.at,d.
the appellate court in corell reversed.the court concluded that the reasoning found in herbert hawkins,calderon,and the context of judicial applicable to arbitration under the mfaa under the facts before it.corell,supra,th at,d.the court reasoned,like judicial arbitration,mfaa arbitration subserves a legislative and public purpose to apply the relatively informal and inexpensive arbitral process to a class of disputes whose nature merits such facility.citation.and while both systems allow for a trial de novo after an award,both also provide for finality of the award if such further action is not promptly initiated within days.citations.in both cases,therefore,abandonment of de novo proceedings by the party that has invoked them to supersede the award may well be treated as a retraction of that rejection of the award,rather than as effecting a mischievous citation escape from it.id.at,d.the corell court thus held that i n sum,fox dismissal of the fee action,and its conduct thereafter,reflect an attempted evasion of both the mandatory fee arbitration award and the arbitral process as a whole.as in herbert hawkins,supra,d,by that dismissal fox repudiated its request for a trial de novo.the february,award therefore became final and binding,as provided by business and professions code section,subdivision b.id.at,d.
application to dismissal of perez complaint 
in this case,we are dealing with circumstances that differ from those found in the four cases discussed above.herbert hawkins,calderon,and kelley each involved judicial arbitration.corell,while it concerned arbitration under the mfaa,addressed the effect of a party voluntary dismissal on a rejected fee award.we are aware of no instances in which a court has addressed the legal effect of an involuntary dismissal of a case following a party rejection of a fee arbitration award under the mfaa.despite their procedural differences,we conclude that the principles of the four cases compel the holding here that the involuntary dismissal of the perez complaint constituted a repudiation of that attorney prior rejection of the arbitration award.for although three of the cases concerned judicial arbitration,the concept enunciated in herbert a dismissal may result in a repudiation of the party prior rejection of an equally to mfaa arbitration and judicial arbitration.corell,supra,th at,d.
further,while each of the four cases concerned a party voluntary dismissal of the action,we see no practical distinction between a dismissal that is voluntary and one that is involuntary based upon a party failure to diligently prosecute the action.in either case,after the party has rejected the mfaa arbitration award by filing a de novo request,the party effectively repudiates that rejection by causing or permitting the action dismissal,thereby divesting the court of jurisdiction to decide the controversy.as is true where a plaintiff attempts to avoid the consequences of an unfavorable arbitration award by making a timely de novo request followed by a voluntary dismissal of the action,allowing a party to avoid the adverse consequences of an mfaa arbitration award by failing to prosecute the case to a de novo trial would produce absurd consequences and promote mischievous lawyering.herbert hawkins,supra,d at,fn.omitted.although we make no finding as to whether perez rejection of the award and the court later dismissal of the complaint were the product of mischievous lawyering,it is nonetheless true that were we to find that the arbitration award was not reinstated by the dismissal of the complaint,we would be encouraging the manipulation of the mfaa system.
our conclusion promotes the mfaa policies of leveling the playing field in fee disputes and of providing an effective and inexpensive remedy to the client through arbitration in which the client need not hire a second which the supreme court has recently reaffirmed.the high court in maynard held that construing the mfaa to permit relief under section where a party fails to make a timely rejection of an arbitration award would not promote the statute policies because it would undermine the policy of finality of arbitration awards as a result of the parties allowing them to become binding through the passage of time,lead to additional reliance on courts for fee disputes,require clients to retain additional counsel to litigate collateral,section issues,and worsen the disparity in bargaining power between attorney and client.maynard,supra,cal th at,d.the result adopted by the trial court and urged by perez here,if approved by this court,would likewise have these negative consequences in contravention of the goals and spirit of the mfaa.
treatment of the involuntary dismissal here as effectively reinstating the rejected mfaa award is also consistent with the supreme court view of the de novo process.trial de novo under the mfaa incorporates a procedure analogous for present purposes to a conventional appeal.maynard,supra,cal th at,d.since the dismissal of an appeal is the functional equivalent of affirmance eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group,there is logic to the conclusion that the dismissal of perez complaint resulted in the reinstatement or affirmance of the arbitration award.
furthermore,it would make no practical sense to conclude that an arbitration award under the mfaa is and remains a nullity after it is rejected,regardless of whether the dissatisfied party follows through on its request for trial de novo.t he only way to stop an arbitration award from becoming a final judgment is to either settle the case,or go through a trial de novo.if a party fails to do either,then he or she has had his or her day in court.kelley,supra,th at,d.
