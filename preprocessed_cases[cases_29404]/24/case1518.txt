defendants career training center,formerly doing business as computer education institute,sam afrookhteh and matthew amir baniassad collectively cei challenge the trial court denial of their second motion to compel arbitration of the action of plaintiffs tommy thornton,robert thornton,anthony griego collectively the individual plaintiffs and trade school review association tsra for violation of california unfair competition law ucl bus.et and other causes of action.cei contends the court erred by finding inapplicable an arbitration clause in various sallie mae promissory notes the individual plaintiffs signed to obtain student loans.further,in its reply brief cei contends proposition,which limits private enforcement of the ucl,applies to pending appeals and the plaintiffs lack standing to pursue their ucl cause of action 
this court recently held proposition as approved by voters,applies to ucl actions filed before its effective date of november.bivens corel corporation th,d bivens lytwyn fry electronics,th,d lytwyn.we direct the trial court to grant judgment on the pleadings in favor of cei on the plaintiffs ucl cause of action.as to the individual plaintiffs,who,unlike tsra,allege injuries caused by cei conduct,we direct the court to grant them leave to amend the ucl cause of action to attempt to assert class certification.
we conclude the court finding on the arbitration issue is proper as there is no indication cei and the individual plaintiffs agreed to arbitrate disputes against cei pertaining to its enrollment practices.cei is neither a signatory to nor third party beneficiary of the promissory notes,and the alleged wrongdoing of cei does not concern the notes or student loans.accordingly,we affirm the court order denying cei motion to compel arbitration.
factual and procedural background 
cei sold vocational education.in january the individual plaintiffs enrolled at the san diego campus of cei,each paying more than for training in the field of computer networking.
in june the individual plaintiffs sued cei for unfair competition et as private attorneys general on behalf of the general public,violation of the private postsecondary and vocational education reform act of former,et and intentional misrepresentation.the complaint alleges cei made numerous false representations,including that it was a nationally accredited school,the courses it offered carried transferable college credits,and graduates of the computer networking program would be prepared for a certification examination and could expect annual salaries upwards of.further,the complaint alleges cei failed to give a variety of statutorily required disclosures,such as placement statistics regarding prior graduates.tsra,a nonprofit association,joined in the unfair competition cause of action as a private attorney general.
cei moved to compel arbitration under its contracts with the individual plaintiffs,and to stay the matter pending completion of arbitration.the trial court denied the motion on the ground the arbitration clauses are not triggered because they exclude claims addressed by state law,and the complaint alleges only state law claims.cei appealed,and this court affirmed the trial court order.thornton computer education institute,nonpub,wl.
cei then brought a second motion to compel arbitration,and to stay the matter pending completion of arbitration,on the ground arbitration is compelled by arbitration clauses contained in various sallie mae promissory notes the individual plaintiffs and majority of cei students allegedly signed to obtain student loans.the trial court denied the motion on the grounds the defendants are neither parties to nor third party beneficiaries of the notes,and the arbitration clauses concern disputes between borrowers and lenders concerning the notes.the court further found the defendants waived any right to seek arbitration by unreasonable delay in raising the sallie mae argument.
discussion 
iplaintiffs motion to dismiss 
before cei filed its reply brief,the plaintiffs asked us to summarily dismiss cei appeal on the grounds of frivolity and delay,raising essentially the same arguments they raise in their respondents brief.the plaintiffs rely on ferguson keays cal d,which notes the appellate courts have discretion to impose appropriate sanctions or penalties upon the parties or their attorneys,where the appeal is frivolous or taken solely for the purpose of delay see also eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group,appellate courts have inherent authority to dismiss an appeal that is frivolous or taken solely for delay,and can also impose monetary sanctions in connection with the dismissal.
as a practical matter,however,the power summarily to dismiss a frivolous appeal is seldom exercised.coleman gulf ins.group cal d,fn.the reason is that,to determine whether the appeal is frivolous,the court usually will have to examine the record and review the merits having done so,little is to be gained by dismissing rather than deciding the appeal on its merits.eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs,supra.such is the case here,and thus we deny the plaintiffs motion and dispose of the appeal on its merits.the plaintiffs have not requested monetary sanctions.
proposition 
section prohibits any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.the legislature intended this sweeping language to include anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.bank of the west superior court cal th,d,quoting barquis merchants collection cal d.
when this lawsuit commenced,section provided that any person acting for the interests of itself,its members or the general public could bring a ucl cause of action.former.as the court explained in kraus trinity management services,cal th,d,representative ucl actions make it economically feasible to sue when individual claims are too small to justify the expense of litigation,and thereby encourage attorneys to undertake private enforcement actions.through the ucl a plaintiff may obtain restitution injunctive relief against unfair or unlawful practices to protect the public and restore to the parties in interest money or property taken by means of unfair competition.
on november,the voters approved proposition it became effective the following day.cal,art.ii,subd.a.proposition amended business and professions code section to state a ucl cause of action may be prosecuted by any person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition.further,proposition amended business and professions code section to require that a private party may bring a representative action only if he or she meets the standing requirement of section and complies with class certification requirements set forth in code of civil procedure section.proposition curtails the previously broad standing to pursue a ucl action.
cei contends that because the ucl cause of action is strictly statutory,proposition applies to cases pending on appeal.the plaintiffs counter that application of proposition to this action would violate the rule against retrospective application of statutes.
a retrospective law is one which affects rights,obligations,acts,transactions and conditions which are performed or exist prior to the adoption of the statute.aetna cas.surety.acc.com.cal d,myers philip morris companies,cal th,d.a statute has retrospective effect when it substantially changes the legal consequences of past events.kizer hanna cal d.it is well settled that a new statute is presumed to operate prospectively absent an express declaration of retrospectivity or a clear indication that the electorate,or the legislature,intended otherwise.tapia superior court cal d.
the repeal of a statutory right or remedy,however,presents entirely distinct issues from that of the prospective or retroactive application of a statute.a line of authority holds the unconditional repeal of a special remedial statute without a saving clause stops all pending actions where the repeal finds them.if final relief has not been granted before the repeal goes into effect it can not be granted afterwards,even if a judgment has been entered and the cause is pending on appeal.the reviewing court must dispose of the case under the law in force when its decision is rendered.citations.citations.physicians com.for responsible medicine tyson foods th,d italics omitted younger superior court cal d,governing board mann cal d,callet alioto cal,brenton metabolife,th,d beckman thompson th,d.
the justification for this rule is that all statutory remedies are pursued with full realization that the legislature may abolish the right to recover at any time.callet alioto,supra,cal.at,any statute may be repealed at any time,except when vested rights would be impaired.persons acting under any statute act in contemplation of this power of repeal.because it is a creature of statute,the right of action exists only so far and in favor of such person as the legislative or initiative power may declare.graczyk workers comp.appeals bd.d.unlike a common law right,a statutory remedy does not vest until final judgment.county of san bernardino ranger ins.th,d south coast regional com.gordon d.
this rule only applies when the right in question is a statutory right and does not apply to an existing right of action which has accrued to a person under the rules of the common law,or by virtue of a statute codifying the common law.in such a case,it is generally stated,that the cause of action is a vested property right which may not be impaired by legislation.in other words,the repeal of such a statute or of such a right should not be construed to affect existing causes of action.callet alioto,supra,cal.at.
based on the above principles,in bivens and lytwyn this court held proposition applies to cases filed before its effective date of november,and such application does not run afoul of the general rule of prospective application of statutes.rather,proposition repealed the portion of former section that allowed private parties to bring representative actions without suffering any injury or loss associated with the defendants alleged wrongdoing,and the measure contained no saving clause.bivens,supra,th at,d lytwyn,supra,th at,d.
moreover,in lytwyn,we rejected the contention,which the plaintiffs here also raise,that an unfair competition cause of action is based on common law rights.it is clear the right to bring a representative action under section was a purely statutory right and was not a codification of prior common law rights t he common law of unfair competition required a showing of competitive injury to one business.the court noted such a showing was not required by statutes prohibiting unfair competition s tatutory unfair competition extends to all unfair and deceptive business practices.for this reason,the statutory definition of unfair competition can not be equated with the common law definition lytwyn,supra,th at,d.
further,the ucl originated from former civil code section,which was an exception to the common law rule that violations of the criminal laws can not be enjoined.citations.in,former civil code section was amended to provide that an action could be brought by any person acting for the interests of itself,its members,or the general public.citation.thus,the right to bring a representative action under former section was not a codification of prior common law rights.lytwyn,supra,th at,d.
we recognize that in californians for disability rights mervyn th,d mervyn,the first appellate district,division four,held proposition does not apply to actions filed before its effective date of november.the court found the application of different rules depending on whether a new statute affects a common law right or purely statutory remedy exposes a seeming conflict in canons of statutory interpretation.mervyn,at,d.the court wrote that in landgraf usi film products,d landgraf,the united states supreme court has acknowledged this seeming conflict,and provided a reconciliation that the presumption of prospectivity is the controlling principle.mervyn,at,d.the mervyn court concluded that even when the statute in question repeals a purely statutory cause of action,the rule of prospectivity applies unless the enactment clearly indicates an intent that it be applied retroactively.ibid.
we respectfully disagree with the analysis in mervyn.landgraf concerned federal statutes and it does not discuss california law that a cause of action or remedy dependent on a statute falls with a repeal of the statute,even after the action thereon is pending,in the absence of a saving clause in the repealing statute.callet alioto,supra,cal.at,younger superior court,supra,cal d at.it is axiomatic that cases are not authority for propositions not considered.in re marriage of cornejo cal th,d.indeed,in landgraf,the court acknowledged that e ven absent specific legislative authorization,application of new statutes passed after the events in suit is unquestionably proper in many situations.landgraf,supra,at.
in our view,the mervyn court reliance on evangelatos superior court cal d,was also misplaced,as there the issue was whether proposition,which modified the traditional joint and several liability doctrine,applied to common law actions that accrued before the effective date of the measure.evangelatos,at.in evangelatos,the court had no cause to address the numerous cases in which the supreme court held the repeal of a statutory right applies to pending cases.
in california,when the measure in question repeals a purely statutory remedy,the only legislative intent relevant would be a determination to save the proceeding from the ordinary effect of repeal.younger superior court,supra,cal d at.we are bound by california supreme court precedent,and any change in the law based on considerations of fairness or the litigants reliance or expectations would have to come from that court or the legislature.
under bivens and lytwyn,proposition applies to the ucl cause of action here.see also branick downey savings and loan th,d benson kwikset corporation th,d.the complaint alleges tsra has had no direct dealings with cei,has suffered no injury as a result of any conduct by the defendants,and therefore seeks no recovery for itself.accordingly,tsra lacks standing to pursue a ucl claim,and we direct the trial court to enter an order granting cei judgment on the pleadings insofar as tsra is concerned.see code civ,subd.c providing the trial court may grant a motion for judgment on the pleadings when the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.
the complaint alleges the individual plaintiffs were injured as a result of cei alleged conduct,but the ucl cause of action states they bring it only as private attorneys general on behalf of the general public.because they have not complied with the class certification procedure now required,we direct the trial court to also grant cei judgment on the pleadings on the ucl action insofar as the individual plaintiffs are concerned.in the case of a motion for judgment on the pleadings,leave to amend should be granted if there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action.virginia abc unified school dist.th,d.the individual plaintiffs may allege they are pursuing only their own damages in the ucl cause of action,or attempt to seek class certification,and thus we order the court to grant them leave to amend the complaint 
arbitration ruling 
whether an arbitration agreement applies to a controversy is a question of law to which the appellate court applies its independent judgment where no conflicting extrinsic evidence in aid of interpretation was introduced in the trial court.brookwood bank of america th,d.here,the parties introduced no extrinsic evidence in aid of interpretation.
cei contends it is entitled to arbitration under sallie mae loan agreements entered into by former cei students as well as the individual p laintiffs themselves.cei submitted the declaration of defendant baniassad,which stated he was the secretary and chief executive officer of cei,and based on records and su
