this case centers around a labor dispute between plaintiffs csx transportation,and consolidated rail corporation csx and conrail and defendants united transportation union,et.utu.at issue is whether the district court erred in determining that the dispute,which is over the substantive scope of a national moratorium on contractual negotiations between the parties,is a major dispute under the terms of the railroad labor act rla.upon our review of the law and the record,we believe this matter is a minor dispute and must be resolved via the arbitration procedures set forth for resolving such disputes in the rla.id.we therefore reverse the district court determination.
background 
a.the railway labor act 
the rla provides mandatory procedures for resolving disagreements between railroad companies and the unions representing their employees.a.under the rla,a dispute must first be classified as either major or minor and will then be resolved in accordance with procedures set for that classification.a dispute is considered major if the parties are changing terms of an existing collective bargaining agreement and is considered minor if it is merely a dispute over the application or interpretation of provisions in existing agreements consol.rail ry.labor executives ass n,d conrail citing elgin,burley.in a major dispute,the party who wishes to amend a bargaining agreement must serve the other party notice of an intended change.this is known as a section notice.if the parties are unable to reach an agreement after negotiation,either may seek mediation with the national mediation board nmb.id.should that mediation fail,a presidential emergency board may be appointed.id.throughout the entire process,the existing agreement remains intact.detroit toledo shore line united transp.union,d.

plaintiffs csx and conrail are two large unionized railroad companies.the train operators and support staff that they locally employ are represented by defendants utu.the dispute between the parties began when csx and conrail issued a notice of their intent to begin using push cars on their northern district railway lines on march,in response,utu served section notices requesting,among other things,to bargain about the use of push cars to csx and conrail in march.the section notices requested that the parties establish a rule concerning the construction,use,equipment and safety rules for push cars,and amend the current crew policy to include more and safety benefits.on april,csx and conrail responded by suggesting that the issues be handled in the forthcoming national bargaining discussions,which were scheduled to be held in august of.utu declined the offer.on may and july,the parties met to discuss the issues but did not reach an agreement.at the july meeting they collectively scheduled their next discussion for september,just over one month after a planned bargaining meeting between the national representatives of the union and various railroads.
at that meeting,held in august,the numerous railroads represented by the national carriers conference committee,including csx and conrail,and the national leadership of utu entered into a national bargaining agreement on employee compensation and benefits.the agreement contained a moratorium provision that precluded either party from seeking to change any part of the agreement,and explicitly prohibited the filing of any section notices prior to november.it also dismissed or settled all existing section notices dated on or subsequent to november.
because the push car issue was born of a section notice,csx and conrail subsequently notified utu in writing that the moratorium barred any further discussion,despite the fact that the issue had not been discussed at the national meeting.the letter stated that if utu disagreed with this position,the matter could then be set for handling in arbitration pursuant to section of the rla,as a minor dispute.utu disagreed with csx and conrail interpretation of the moratorium and maintained that,because the push car issue and other issues that were related to their march section notice were not discussed during the august proceedings,the moratorium did not apply.
csx and conrail filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio,seeking a declaratory judgment that the parties dispute over the interpretation of the moratorium provision was a minor issue under the rla and could thus be worked out in arbitration proceedings before the national railroad adjustment board nrab.in granting summary judgment for utu,the district court held that dispute over whether the moratorium provision did not bar the progression of the mediation over the section notices was a major dispute.as such,the court concluded that a dispute should be resolved via the negotiation and mediation procedures required for major disputes under the rla.the district court denied csx and conrail motion for reconsideration and csx and conrail filed this timely appeal.

our case law dictates that if csx and conrail interpretation that the moratorium provision should apply to the section notices at issue is arguably justified,then the issue should be resolved under the rla procedures for minor disputes.we have previously held that a dispute over whether a moratorium provision can be interpreted to bar the serving of section notices is a minor dispute within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator.int l longshoremen ass n,local toledo lakefront dock pellet,cir finding that a docking company interpretation of a moratorium to be arguably justified and therefore a minor issue.
applying the classification test here,established by the united states supreme court in conrail,leads us to the same conclusion.under the conrail test,a labor dispute is classified as minor when a party assertion that its proposed action is permitted by the collective bargaining agreement is arguably justified by the terms of the agreement.conrail,at.see also united transp.union cuyahoga valley ry,cir finding that w hen it is unclear whether a dispute is minor or major,the dispute should be characterized as minor if the party actions are arguably justified by the terms of the parties agreement.but if,in an effort to justify its action,the party presents an obviously insubstantial,or frivolous,interpretation of the agreement,then the agreement will need to be amended in order for the party proposed action to proceed.in such an instance,the dispute will be classified as major and the parties will enter into mediated discussions on amending the agreement as provided for under the rla.conrail,at.the moving party carries a relatively light burden in establishing that its interpretation is arguably justified by the terms of the agreement.id.at.
the facts of this case indicate that csx and conrail argument that the moratorium should prohibit further negotiations on utu march section notices may not be strong,but it is arguably justified by the terms of the august national agreement.significantly,the plain language of the august national bargaining agreement supports csx and conrail claim.section a of article x expressly indicates that a purpose of the national agreement is to settle any section notices dated on or subsequent to november,
a the purpose of the agreement is to fix the general level of compensation during the period of the agreement and is in settlement of the dispute growing out of the notices
