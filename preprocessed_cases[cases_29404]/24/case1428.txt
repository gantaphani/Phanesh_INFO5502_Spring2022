plaintiff opposed the motion on unconscionability grounds.in addition to her declaration,plaintiff lodged declarations of her counsel and two other attorneys experienced in wage and hour cases attesting to the difficulty of prosecuting such cases individually,rather than as class actions.the attorneys stated that,given the relatively small sums of money involved in individual cases,it is difficult for plaintiffs to find counsel willing to take them,despite the availability of statutory attorneys fees.the attorneys further opined that class actions were the only effective way to redress wage and hour violations.they each stated the blunt reality is that employers want to limit class actions because they do not want to reform business practices that reduce of the legality of the practices i f the employer can limit attacks on its global classification decision to the odd lawsuit or arbitration here and there,it will have no incentive to truly examine whether its practices comply with the law and make changes if they do not.as a matter of simple economics,a few individual settlements or even lost trials or arbitrations will be more than made up exponentially by the savings from the decision to mis classify employees as exempt and pay them a fixed salary for,and or more hours per week.the employees who have no idea their rights are being violated or who ca find attorneys to take on their relatively small individual cases will continue to be exploited by working unpaid overtime hours
