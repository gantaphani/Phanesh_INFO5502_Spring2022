background 
plaintiffs,fmr and fmv,are property management businesses.fmr is wholly owned by gary baxter.fmv is a limited partnership of which baxter is part owner.josyln development company,of which baxter is president,is fmv corporate general partner.baxter has been in the real estate business since.
defendants are business entities that own apartment complexes in various locations across the united states.scott canel is associated with each of the defendants in some capacity.he is also a lawyer who has been winding up his legal practice to primarily focus on real estate.as a lawyer,canel has represented baxter and entities owned or controlled by baxter in tax and transactional matters 
beginning in and continuing through,baxter,through his business entities,sold a series of properties.each property was sold to one of the defendants.prior to the sales,fmv or another baxter business entity managed the properties.after the sale of each of the first nine properties,fmr was retained to manage them.fmv was retained to manage the tenth property,the southfield property owned by cerc,but was replaced by fmr shortly thereafter.the management of each of the properties was governed by identical management agreements.further,each property was either directly or indirectly subject to the rules of the united states department of housing and urban development hud.
on march,defendants sent plaintiffs a letter informing them that they were terminating their management agreements effective april.defendants terminated the agreements pursuant to section of the management agreements,which provided in pertinent part 
it is expressly understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that the owner as well as the agent shall have the right to terminate the agreement at the end of any calendar month,without penalty,on thirty days advance written notice to the agent.
subsequently,defendants appointed ten south management company ten south,which is controlled by canel,to manage the properties.in addition,canel hired richard price,who had been president of fmr and vice president of josyln development company,to work for ten south.
on july,plaintiffs filed a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association aaa pursuant to section of the management agreements,which provided 
the aaa shall be the final arbitrator of all unresolved disputes between defendants and plaintiffs and the parties hereto agree to abide by the decision of the arbitrator in such case made.
on july,defendants filed counterclaims to which plaintiffs responded on august.following defendants filing of an amended counterclaim and plaintiffs filing of a response and affirmative defenses,plaintiffs filed a statement of claim on january.therein,plaintiffs sought reformation of the management contracts alleged that defendants through canel committed fraud alleged that defendants aided and abetted canel alleged legal misconduct alleged that defendants aided and abetted price misconduct and alleged conspiracy between defendants,canel,price,and ten south.defendant answered the statement of claim on february,
the arbitration panel,which consisted of three neutral,proceeded to oversee discovery and motion practice proceedings,followed by a evidentiary hearing in september.during the hearing,baxter testified that he consulted canel as to how to sell the concerned properties while retaining management of them.canel allegedly suggested that baxter sell the properties to canel business entities,defendants,with the understanding that plaintiffs,baxter business entities,would be retained as management companies of those properties so long as canel controlled them.baxter testified that he never told anyone about this deal,including price,other limited partners,and attorneys.baxter further testified that he relied on canel,who was one of his lawyers,to represent his interests.he denied ever having read the management agreements,which the record shows price signed on behalf of plaintiffs.
conversely,canel denied that an oral agreement existed in which he promised that plaintiffs could manage the properties so long as defendants controlled them.however,canel conceded on that it was his intention that plaintiffs would manage the properties so long as they did a reasonable job.in addition,canel read from a february,memo he wrote to baxter that stated in pertinent part,we also orally agreed that you would retain management of the properties as long as you did a reasonable job.
following the evidentiary hearing,the arbitration panel delivered an unreasoned ruling,due to defendant failure to file a timely request for a reasoned ruling.the panel awarded plaintiffs against amberly,against ashwood,against eastpointe,against great oaks,against kettering,against cerc,against southmoor,against woodview,and nothing against brittany or pine island.with respect to defendants counterclaims,the panel awarded brittany and against fmr for overcharges and cell phone use,respectively.the panel also awarded each to cerc and green oaks against fmr.
thereafter,defendant amberly filed a motion to vacate the award in the circuit court of cook county,and plaintiffs filed a motion to confirm the arbitration award and deny defendants request to vacate the award.following arguments,the circuit court entered a written order on october,in which it granted plaintiffs motion and denied defendants motion.in making its ruling,the circuit court determined that the arbitrators did not exceed their authority in granting the award and held that the award did not violate public policy.on october,pursuant to plaintiffs motion,the circuit court entered its final judgment affirming the arbitration award.defendants appealed.
we initially observe that the arbitrators delivered an unreasoned award.the record shows that the arbitrators decision merely set forth a procedural history of the case and the monetary awards provided to each party,but did not provide a reasoned analysis for the arbitrators decision to deliver those awards.
as,plaintiffs assert,however,commercial arbitration rule b provides that arbitrators need not render a reasoned award unless the parties request such an award prior to the appointment of the arbitrators or if the arbitrators deem it appropriate.american arbitration association,commercial arbitration rules and mediation procedures,rule b,as amended and effective september.as such,whereas,here,the parties did not timely request a reasoned award,the arbitrators did not err rendering an unreasoned award.
turning to the substantive issues before this court,we note that review of an arbitration award is more limited than review of a trial court decision.galasso kns,d.where parties have agreed to settle their dispute via an arbitrator,they have agreed to accept the arbitrator view,and thus,a reviewing court should not overrule an award simply where its interpretation differs from that of the arbitrator.galasso,d at.that said,section a of the uniform arbitration act act ilcs a west does set forth limited circumstances under which a reviewing court may modify or vacate an arbitration award the award was maintained by corruption or fraud the arbitrator was not impartial the arbitrator exceeded his authority the arbitrator unreasonably refused to postpone the hearing or hear material evidence or there was no arbitration agreement.
in the case at bar,defendants contend that the arbitrators exceed
