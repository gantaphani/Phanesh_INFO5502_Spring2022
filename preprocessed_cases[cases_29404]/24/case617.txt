background 
procedural history 
plaintiffs filed their original complaint in the district court on april,which was amended on may.on july,plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint,alleging violations of the truth in lending act tila,et,the racketeer influenced and corrupt organization act,et,and several consumer protection statutes under kentucky law.on june,defendants moved to certify a question of law to the kentucky supreme court whether fees charged by a licensed check cashing company constituted interest subject to kentucky usury laws.on august,the district court ordered plaintiffs action to be held in abeyance pending resolution of the question by the kentucky supreme court.
on june,the kentucky supreme court answered the certified question,finding that a check cashing company licensed under kentucky revised statutes et,which charges a service fee for accepting and deferring deposit on checks pursuant to agreements with the makers of the checks,thereby charges interest subject to the usury laws and disclosure provisions under.see white check holders.
on december,plaintiffs moved to proceed as a class action pursuant to.c.defendants thereafter moved for an extension of time to respond to plaintiffs motion.on january,defendants filed a motion under the faa to compel arbitration of claims brought by plaintiffs,and to stay litigation pending arbitration.the district court denied defendants motion on may,and it is from this order that defendants now appeal.

plaintiffs allege that defendants have loaned money at usurious interest rates to hundreds of kentucky consumers.the consumers entered into check cashing agreements with defendants the loan agreements.under the loan agreements,defendants would provide a borrower with,for example,in cash in exchange for a check in the amount of.the loan agreement would refer to the difference as a finance charge,which,the agreement stated,is deemed a service fee by kentucky law and not interest.at.
defendants would then hold the check until the payment due date,which was normally two weeks after the date of the loan agreement.these terms resulted in annual percentage rates of over,which was stated in the loan agreement.if,as of the payment due date,the borrower lacked sufficient funds to cover the check,defendants would permit the borrower to the debt by paying the service fee,executing a replacement check in the same amount as the original check,and establishing a new payment due date two weeks from the date.plaintiffs allege that defendants coerced borrowers into rolling over their debt by threatening otherwise to prosecute under the kentucky bad check law.see.ann.banks baldwin.
the loan agreements at issue contained an arbitration clause,on the reverse side of the loan agreement,which read as follows 
arbitration to pursue any claim,demand,dispute or cause of action a claim arising under this agreement or the transaction in connection with which this agreement has been executed,the claimant must submit to the other party in writing an explanation of the claim and a demand that the claim be resolved by arbitration.if the other party does not respond to the submittal in writing within ten days of its receipt,the claimant may pursue the claim either through arbitration or court action.if the other party responds to the submittal in writing within ten days of its receipt,the claim must be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with and pursuant to the uniform arbitration act as enacted in the commonwealth of kentucky,krs,et,as amended from time to time the act.the arbitration shall be conducted by one or more arbitrators selected by agreement between you and check into cash but,if no agreement on the arbitrator s can be reached,by the kentucky district court for claims involving or less or the kentucky circuit court,in either case,in the county where this agreement was signed.the expenses of the arbitration,including attorney fees,will be paid in accordance with the award issued by the arbitrator s.the finality and binding effect of the arbitration award shall be as set forth in the act.
kentucky uniform arbitration act provides that a written agreement to submit any existing controversy to arbitration or a provision in written contract to submit to arbitration any controversy thereafter arising between the parties is valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist at law for the revocation of any contract.ann.banks baldwin.
plaintiffs contend that prior to december of,the loan agreements did not include an arbitration clause on the reverse side of the loan agreement form.plaintiffs further contend that defendants never informed them of the addition of the arbitration clause,and that plaintiffs only became aware of the clause when defendants attached it to their motion to compel arbitration.
discussion 
this court reviews de novo a district court ruling on whether to compel arbitration pursuant to the faa.stout byrider,cir.under the faa,a district court consideration of a motion to compel arbitration is limited to determining whether the parties entered into a valid agreement to arbitrate,and does not reach the merits of the parties claims.great mortgage peacock,cir.
the district court concluded,primarily under three valleys municipal water district hutton,cir,that plaintiffs allegations that the loan agreements containing the arbitration clause were void ab initio,must be determined by a court,not an arbitrator.defendants contend that under prima paint flood conklin,d,plaintiffs allegations of void loan agreements are to be determined by an arbitrator.
under section of the faa,when an action is brought in federal court upon any issue referable to arbitration under agreement in writing for such arbitration,the court must stay the action pending arbitration once it is satisfied that the issue is arbitrable under the agreement.prima paint,at.a s a matter of federal law,any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.wilson contractors,minnotte contracting,cir quoting moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.
under prima paint,a court,rather than an arbitrator,may adjudicate a claim of fraud in the inducement only if the claim of fraud concerns the inducement of the arbitration clause itself,not the inducement of the contract generally.prima paint,at.the court in prima paint found that arbitration clauses were separable from the contracts in which they were included,and that a broad arbitration clause will be held to encompass arbitration of the claim that the contract itself was induced from fraud.prima paint,at.if the arbitration clause is not at issue,then the arbitrator will decide challenges to the contract containing the arbitration clause.employees fed.credit union donaldson,lufkin jenrette sec,cir.
several of our sister circuits have found that prima paint does not apply to allegations of nonexistent contracts.see sphere drake ins.all am.ins,cir sandvik ab advent int l,cir three valleys,at chastain,cir joseph.sugar,cir.the third circuit and the ninth circuit,respectively,have expressly found that prima paint applies to voidable,but not void,contracts.see sandvik,at three valleys,at.in contrast,the fifth circuit has found that prima paint applies even to contracts that are void from inception.see lawrence comprehensive bus.servs,cir.
the distinction is relevant for prima paint analysis because a void contract,unlike a voidable contract,was never a contract at all thus,a valid arbitration agreement can not arise out of a broader contract if no broader contract ever existed.sandvik,at.accordingly,prima paint presumes an underlying,existent,agreement.id.at.
although the reasoning of the third,seventh,eighth,ninth,and eleventh circuits is clear,this reasoning appears to be in tension with language in employees,wherein this court discounted the role of the fraud in the in the inducement distinction under prima paint.the restatement provides that,which addresses void contracts,concerns misrepresentations in the factum or the execution rather than merely the inducement of the contract.restatement second of contracts cmt.a.fraud in the factum or execution,that is,the sort of fraud that procures a party signature to an instrument without knowledge of its true nature or contents,renders a contract void,while fraud in the inducement renders a contract merely voidable.langley fdic,d citations omitted.
however,in employees we observed that while the fraud in the in the inducement distinction may offer a legitimate means of analy sis,the distinction may more confound than clarify the dispositive issue and its resolution.employees,at.relying on prima paint,this court then characterized the central issue as whether cbs claim of fraud relates to the making of the arbitration agreement.if it does,the court should adjudicate the fraud claim.if it does not,then the faa requires that the fraud claim be decided by an arbitrator.id.
we note that this court in employees,in not wanting to confound the dispositive question,may in fact have begged the dispositive question.that is,it is not clear that citation to prima paint,without more,answers the void ab initio question,inasmuch as prima paint failed to address the void ab initio question.indeed,if anything,we are inclined to find that prima paint supports,rather than prohibits,excluding nonexistent contracts from the severability doctrine,because an allegation of a void contract raises exactly the same question as an allegation of a fraudulently induced arbitration agreement whether the arbitrator has any power at all.prima paint,at.to immunize an arbitration agreement from judicial challenge on the ground of fraud in the inducement would be to elevate it over other forms of contract.the seventh circuit recently captured the point in four words no contract,no power.sphere drake,at.nevertheless,we need not reach the question here,because the district court application of three valleys in this case was erroneous and requires reconsideration.
the district court,relying on three valleys,found that because plaintiffs had alleged that the loan agreements were void ab initio,those allegations were to be determined by the court,rather than an arbitrator.first,the above is a correct statement of ninth circuit law,but the district court failed to address how three valleys can be reconciled with employees.second,the district court erred when construing plaintiffs allegations under and any loan contract made in violation of shall be void,and that defendants were not licensed to enter into the loan allegations of void ab initio contracts under the three valleys line of cases.
consistent with the nature of fraud in the factum allegations,courts have addressed questions of void ab initio contracts as questions of signatory power,not contract content.see aircraft braking.local,int l union,cir examining whether interim contract existed despite failure to ratify sphere drake,at determining whether signatory had power to bind company sandvik,at determining whether signatory had power to bind company chastain,at determining whether signatory had power to bind family member three valleys,at examining whether signatory had power to bind principals joseph,at determining whether assignee of signatory had power to enforce arbitration agreement cancanon smith barney,harris,upham,cir finding that an allegation of fraud in the factum is an allegation of ineffective assent to the contract par knit mills,stockbridge fabrics,cir determining whether signatory had power to bind company fashions,dhj,cir examining whether signatory had power to enter into arbitration agreement.
indeed,the three valleys decision,on which the district court primarily relied,offered the following explanation for limiting prima paint to challenges seeking to avoid or rescind an existing contract 
a contrary rule would lead to untenable results.party a could forge party b name to a contract and compel party b to arbitrate the question of the genuineness of its signature.similarly,any citizen of los angeles could sign a contract on behalf of the city and los angeles would be required to submit to an arbitrator the question whether it was bound to the contract,even if its charter prevented it from engaging in any arbitration.
three valleys,at.thus,the illustrations chosen by three valleys cast doubt on the position that challenges to the very existence of a contract,for purposes of distinguishing prima paint,include challenges from parties who intended to enter into a contract,but then subsequently discovered that certain terms of the contract may violate state law.that is,the three valleys line of cases requires more than an allegation of a statutory violation the substance of the allegation must concern some misrepresentation as to the character or essential terms of a proposed contract.restatement second of contracts cmt.a.
plaintiffs allegations primarily concern the substance of the loan agreements,which plaintiffs then argue are void under.however,unlike the three valleys line of cases,plaintiffs allegations under do not concern their failure to assent to the loan agreements,and do not concern signatory power.accordingly,because plaintiffs allegations under challenge the substance,rather than the existence,of the loan agreements,we vacate the district court application of three valleys to those allegations.
further,although plaintiffs allegations under do concern signatory power,in that defendants were allegedly not licensed to enter into the loan agreements and thus,plaintiffs contend,had no authority to enter into the loan agreements,we must nevertheless vacate the district court application of three valleys to the allegations under as well.first,plaintiffs have not addressed why three valleys,rather than employees,should control the determination of their allegations.second,plaintiffs have not addressed the distinction between entering into a loan agreement with an unlicensed lender and not assenting to a loan agreement at all.although,like the three valleys line of cases,raises a question of signatory power,the question in this case is different in that the signatory issue arises only on the side of the parties moving for arbitration.whether three valleys requires that parties resisting arbitration allege that they never agreed to any contract at all,is of no moment here because plaintiffs have not addressed the issue.
nevertheless,under prima paint,issues relating to the making of an arbitration agreement,separate from the underlying contract,are to be determined by the court,not the arbitrator.prima paint,at.so,for example,a challenge based on fraud in the inducement of the whole contract including the arbitration clause is for the arbitrator,while a challenge based on the lack of mutuality of the arbitration clause would be for the court.matterhorn,ncr,cir citations omitted.if the fraud relates to the arbitration clause itself,the court should adjudicate the fraud claim.ferro garrison,cir quoting perez,welch,cir.because the district court relied on three valleys in denying defendants motion to compel arbitration,plaintiffs allegations concerning the making of the arbitration agreements,separate from the loan agreements,were not
