this appeal stems from arbitration proceedings arising under a shipping contract between duferco international steel trading duferco or appellant and klaveness shipping klaveness.duferco appeals from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york swain,entered february,denying its petition to vacate,in part,an arbitration award and granting klaveness for confirmation of the award.
in its petition to vacate the arbitral award,duferco relies on the doctrine of manifest disregard of the law.for us to vacate an arbitral award on the grounds of manifest disregard of the step we very seldom must be persuaded that the arbitrators understood but chose to disregard a clearly defined law or legal principle applicable to the case before them.the error must be so palpably evident as to be readily perceived as such by the average person qualified to serve as an arbitrator.any plausible reading of an award that fits within the law will sustain it.here we believe there is such a plausible reading.hence,we affirm.
background 
on november,duferco contracted with klaveness to charter a seagoing vessel to carry a cargo of steel slabs from taranto,italy,to new orleans,louisiana.duferco contract with klaveness was in the form of a voyage charter that covered only the specific voyage set out in the document.the voyage charter provided that the steel would be loaded onto klaveness vessel at one safe berth taranto.
to fulfill its charter with duferco,klaveness in turn chartered the aristidis from its owner,lifedream shipping company,lifedream.klaveness chartered the aristidis on january,by means of a time charter,a type of shipping agreement that allows a party to use an owner vessel for a specified period of time.klaveness time charter with lifedream allowed use of the aristidis for two to four months,plus or minus ten days at klaveness option.in addition,the time charter contained a warranty,which required that the vessel trade via safe port s,safe berth s,and safe anchorage s.in january and february,while the aristidis was moored at the port of taranto,its crew loaded aboard her the steel slabs for shipment to new orleans.due to seasonal swells and back waves at taranto,the crew of the aristidis experienced major difficulties in the loading operation resulting in damage to the mooring equipment and extra costs from measures taken to keep the vessel stable.
london arbitration 
lifedream,as a result of the difficulties encountered in taranto,sought arbitration against klaveness in london to recover for the damages and extra costs incurred london arbitration.the london arbitrators found klaveness liable for these damages because it had breached the warranty by mooring the aristidis where sea conditions made the port unsafe.
klaveness moved to vouch duferco into the london arbitration to obtain indemnification.is a common law procedural device that allows a party to arbitration to join a nonparty alleged indemnitor,referred to as the vouchee,by notifying the nonparty of the pendency of an arbitration that might obligate the vouchee to indemnify the defendant.see scac transp.usa,danaos,cir see also washington gaslight dist.of columbia.universal am.barge,cir.is used where the vouchee can not be impleaded because of defects in personal jurisdiction.the purpose of this legal device is to avoid duplicative litigation and the attendant possibility of inconsistent results.scac transp.usa,at.
once notified,the vouchee has the option of joining the arbitration to defend the action.if the vouchee refuses to join,it may nonetheless be bound by the result in any subsequent litigation by principles analogous to collateral estoppel.washington gaslight,at.for the vouchee to be bound,the party seeking to join the vouchee must be able to represent that party interests fully and fairly in the arbitration.universal,at.
duferco declined to be vouched into the london arbitration,and on june,the arbitration panel found against klaveness for all expenses and damages incurred at the port of taranto.the award amounted to in damages plus in interest london award.
new york arbitration 
klaveness thereafter began arbitration in new york seeking,inter alia,full indemnification from duferco for the london award to lifedream that it was obligated to pay,as well as for attorneys and arbitrators fees from both arbitrations.at the arbitration hearing,klaveness maintained that the warranty in its charter with that it would load at one safe berth taranto was similar to the one included in the charter between klaveness and lifedream,which provided that the vessel trade via safe port s,safe berth s,and safe anchorage s,and therefore declared that had been appropriate and that duferco could thus be bound by the london award based on collateral estoppel principles.
duferco did not challenge the findings of the london arbitrators,but it countered that collateral estoppel could not apply because significant differences between the time and voyage charters made the sweep of klaveness liability under its time charter with lifedream far greater than duferco liability under its voyage charter with klaveness.essentially,duferco asserted the voyage charter specifically waived any warranty.under settled principles of maritime law,a voyage charter that names a specific port relieves the charterer of liability for damage arising from conditions at that port so long as those conditions were reasonably foreseeable.see tweedie trading dyewood,cir see also benedict on admiralty,at ed.since the named port of taranto had predictable seasonal swell conditions,duferco insisted the warranty had been waived,and it therefore had no liability for damages occurring there.
duferco further averred that it should not be bound by any findings of the london arbitrators because its interests could not have been fully and fairly represented in the london arbitration.it argued that since klaveness could not advance the argument,as duferco could have,to relieve itself of liability,klaveness could not have fully and fairly represented its interests in the london arbitration.
a divided panel of the new york arbitrators found for klaveness in an arbitration decision and award entered on april,new york award.the majority found that klaveness did not waive the warranty by agreeing with duferco to load the ship at taranto,and that the warranties of both charters were sufficiently identical for.the panel therefore found duferco to be bound by the outcome of the london arbitration with respect to the damage portion of the london award and ordered it to indemnify klaveness for the amount klaveness paid lifedream in satisfaction of the london award.
the panel went on to rule nonetheless that collateral estoppel principles prevented klaveness from collecting attorneys and arbitrators fees from duferco for the london arbitration.the majority reasoned,somewhat confusingly,that i nasmuch as the london arbitrators did not consider the warranties of the voyage charter,as properly not before them,no previous determination had been made,and therefore,klaveness must not be permitted to now use the london award against duferco offensively for or collateral estoppel purposes.on its own motion,the arbitration panel awarded klaveness as an allowance toward attorneys fees and expenses for the new york arbitration.the panel majority made several other determinations of liability related to events at the port of new orleans.neither party contests these additional determinations and,in any event,they are not relevant to this appeal.
district court proceedings 
following the conclusion of the new york arbitration,duferco,as noted,petitioned the southern district to vacate that portion of the arbitration award compelling it to indemnify klaveness for the london arbitration.the district court denied the petition and confirmed the award.see duferco int l steel trading klaveness shipping,d.duferco appeals.
