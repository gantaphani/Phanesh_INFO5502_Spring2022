introduction 
mediation using a neutral professional is often an effective and efficient way to resolve legal disputes.the california legislature businesses,consumers,and lawyers have all recognized the benefits of mediation.
many written contracts include provisions requiring the parties to mediate before filing a lawsuit or arbitration proceeding,and conditioning recovery of attorney fees by a prevailing party on an attempt to mediate.the standard form residential purchase agreement used in california has a recently added clause providing that a prevailing party in litigation or arbitration who refused a request to mediate made before the commencement of such proceedings is barred from recovering attorney fees.this is the first published case in which this provision has been applied.
in accordance with the parties express agreement,we hold that the prevailing parties are barred from recovering attorney fees because they refused a request to mediate.the trial court finding that they did not refuse such a request is not supported by substantial evidence.the new provision barring recovery of attorney fees by a prevailing party who refuses a request for mediation means what it says and will be enforced.therefore,we reverse the order awarding attorney fees.

the court comments at the hearing on the motions for attorney fees explained the rationale underlying its order 
raitt counsel for the freis you granting motions for attorney fees.i was wondering what the court view was on the question of the mediation provision in the contract.
the court i reviewed it and there was a refusal to mediate.that paragraph.
elenbaas counsel for the daveys yes,your honor.
the court yeah.i was satisfied that that argument was well taken.it only disallows attorney fees where the party files the action without mediating or refuses to mediate,and there was no evidence to support a finding that the defendants refused to mediate,and the fees are appropriate.

discussion 
of the agreement provides the legal basis for recovery of attorney fees.
the legal basis for an award of attorney fees is reviewed de novo.blackburn charnley th,d.here,the daveys sought attorney fees under paragraph of the agreement,which reads in any action,proceeding,or arbitration between buyer and seller arising out of this agreement,the prevailing buyer or seller shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs from the buyer or seller,except as provided in paragraph.
the freis complaint for specific performance was an action between the buyers and the sellers arising out of the agreement,and the daveys were the prevailing parties in that action.paragraph therefore provides a legal basis for awarding attorney fees to the daveys,if they satisfied the conditions set forth in paragraph of the agreement.
there was no substantial evidence to support the trial court finding the daveys did not refuse to.the issue 
we next turn to the question whether the daveys refused the freis request to mediate the dispute.any award of attorney fees to the daveys was contingent on their compliance with the mediation provision found in paragraph of the agreement mediation buyer and seller agree to mediate any dispute or claim arising between them out of this agreement or any resulting transaction,before resorting to arbitration or court action,subject to paragraphs and d below if,for any dispute or claim to which this paragraph applies,any party commences an action without first attempting to resolve the matter through mediation,or refuses to mediate after a request has been made,then that party shall not be entitled to recover attorney fees,even if they would otherwise be available to that party in any such action.thus,if the daveys refused the freis request for mediation,the daveys may not recover their attorney fees,despite the fact they were the prevailing parties in the litigation.
as we shall discuss,this case is a textbook example of why agreements for attorney fees conditioned on participation in mediation should be enforced.it is also a graphic illustration of a case that should have been mediated at an early stage when the parties were only plus expenses apart in their settlement positions.hundreds of thousands of dollars in attorney fees have been spent and the parties have litigated through two trials and three appeals.the lesson there is a good reason the mediation clause was in the agreement,and the legal consequences specified by the agreement for refusing to mediate will be enforced.
b.the standard of review 
the standard of review on issues of attorney fees and costs is abuse of discretion.the trial court decision will only be disturbed when there is no substantial evidence to support the trial court findings or when there has been a miscarriage of justice.if the trial court has made no findings,the reviewing court will infer all findings necessary to support the judgment and then examine the record to see if the findings are based on substantial evidence.finney gomez th,d,fns.omitted.
however,the appellate court does not merely the trial court decision.our search for substantial evidence in support of the judgment does not mean we must blindly seize any evidence in support of the respondent in order to affirm the judgment.the court of appeal was not created merely to echo the determinations of the trial court.a decision supported by a mere scintilla of evidence need not be affirmed on review.citation.i f the word substantial is to mean anything at all,it clearly implies that such evidence must be of ponderable legal significance.obviously the word can not be deemed synonymous with any evidence.it must be reasonable,credible,and of solid value citation.the ultimate determination is whether a reasonable trier of fact could have found for the respondent based on the whole record.citation.while substantial evidence may consist of inferences,such inferences must be a product of logic and reason and must rest on the evidence citation inferences that are the result of mere speculation or conjecture can not support a finding.kuhn department of general services th,d.carter cb richard ellis,th,d.
c.did the daveys refuse the freis request to mediate 
in a declaration filed in support of the motion for attorney fees,davey acknowledged receiving a letter from the freis attorney dated november,which included a demand to mediate pursuant to paragraph of the agreement.a demand for mediation certainly meets the agreement requirement of a request to mediate.davey declared he and his wife did not immediately respond to the demand for mediation.the freis filed their lawsuit on december and served the daveys with the summons and complaint on december.
on january,the freis attorney sent another letter in which he said he had not received any response from the daveys regarding mediation,and asked the daveys to advise him as soon as possible if they wished to mediate.the freis attorney granted the daveys two extensions of time to respond.the freis attorney submitted a declaration stating that on january,the daveys counsel told him the daveys were not interested in mediating the dispute.the freis attorney declaration also stated that on february,the daveys attorney called to say that although he had recommended mediation,the daveys were not interested in doing so.neither the daveys nor their counsel disputes these descriptions of the daveys actions and inaction.
davey also declared that as of january,he believed mediation would be fruitless given the freis intransigence.davey stated he believed the parties own settlement negotiations had essentially accomplished,through the letters and other communications,what a mediation was intended to we made a concerted and good faith attempt to settle the case.davey declared he believed his duty to mediate had terminated once the daveys cancelled the agreement,meaning they did not need to respond to the freis request for mediation.
was this course of conduct a refusal by the daveys of the freis request to mediate yes.there is no substantial evidence supporting the trial court finding that the daveys did not refuse to mediate.to refuse is to decline the acceptance of something offered,or to fail to comply with some requirement.people ex rel.finigan perkins cal.webster third new international dictionary page defines refuse as to decline to accept and to show or express a positive unwillingness to do or comply with.black law dictionary ed page defines refusal as t he denial or rejection of something offered or demanded.
under all of these definitions,the daveys course of conduct constituted a refusal to respond to a clear and unequivocal request to mediate.as explained below,the daveys excuses are unavailing.after the lawsuit was filed,the freis continued to request mediation and extended the daveys time to respond to the request.finally,the daveys,through their attorney,refused to mediate.there is no evidence to the contrary,and the record does not support the trial court finding the daveys did not refuse a request to mediate.
d.the daveys refusal to mediate was not excused.
the daveys raise a number of arguments why their refusal to mediate should be excused.each of these arguments necessarily recognizes the daveys did,in fact,refuse to mediate.
the request for mediation was effective.
the daveys argue the request for mediation in the november,letter from the freis counsel was sandwiched between counsel threats,and therefore was not effective.this argument assumes that if the request for mediation was contained in one letter,and other litigation and settlement demands were contained in another,the request for mediation would be effective,but by including both in one letter it was not.this assumption has no basis.in the real world,lawyers letters often contain arguments to support their clients various positions and compliance with contractual terms.there is no reason to require separate letters for each subject.
negotiations between the parties are not mediation.
the daveys also argued they substantially complied with the mediation provision by making a concerted and good faith attempt to settle the case,which,they say,is all mediation would have accomplished.communications between the parties or their counsel regarding settlement are not the same as mediation.in mediation,a neutral third party analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of each party case,works through the economics of litigation with the parties,and otherwise assists in attempting to reach a compromise resolution of the dispute.leamon krajkiewcz th,d the economic inefficiency of this result may have been avoided if,prior to judicial proceedings,a disinterested mediator had explained to the parties the costs of litigating the dispute through to a judgment or a final resolution by an appellate court see also code civ,
the lack of a perceived likelihood of success from mediation did not excuse the daveys from complying with the agreement terms.
the daveys also argue they should be excused from their refusal to mediate because,they contend,mediation would not have been successful.davey asserted that when he received the freis counsel november letter requesting mediation,he did not feel that mediation was likely to be fruitful.after a meeting between the freis and the daveys on december,it was apparent to the daveys that mediation would be of no benefit.
yet the daveys admitted they originally proposed to settle the dispute by completing the sale of the property and having coldwell banker credit its commission of approximately to the daveys.in his november,letter,the freis counsel proposed to settle the matter by completing the sale of the property,holding the coldwell banker commission in escrow,and having the daveys reimburse the freis additional escrow expenses and the cost of redrawing the freis loan documents.so,the parties settlement offers were plus expenses apart before the lawsuit was filed.especially given the parties respective settlement positions and th
