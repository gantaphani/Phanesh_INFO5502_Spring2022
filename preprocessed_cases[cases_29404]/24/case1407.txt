in this construction defect case,defendants rwr homes,and related entities collectively rwr appeal an order denying their motion to compel arbitration and stay the litigation as to certain plaintiffs.rwr contends the order violates federal and state laws that favor arbitration.rwr,however,did not submit the arbitration agreement that was allegedly incorporated by reference in the plaintiffs applications for warranty protection.because rwr did not satisfy its burden of establishing the existence of an arbitration contract,we affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
rwr built the tract homes at issue in this action.in march the owners of of the homes sued rwr for strict products liability,breach of implied and express warranties,breach of contract and negligence.the first amended complaint filed in may added the owners of an additional nine homes as plaintiffs.the amended pleading alleges various defects pertaining to soil compaction and movement drainage,landscaping and irrigation fencing and retaining walls waterproofing roofs windows and doors framing,drywall,siding and stucco plumbing and electrical sheet metal painting tubs and showers and fireplaces and chimneys.
after answering the first amended complaint,rwr moved to compel arbitration and stay the action as to the claims of the owners of of the homes.rwr argued these owners signed written arbitration agreements governed by the federal arbitration act faa et.
rwr submitted a declaration by stephen graham,a with home buyers warranty corporation hbw,a colorado entity authorized to do business in california.the declaration explained that rwr participated in the hbw program,which allowed it,on the payment of fees and hbw approval,to enroll homes in a nationwide insured warranty program,under which it could issue warranties to new home buyers at the close of escrow at no cost to them.the builder warranty obligations are insured by a warranty insurer selected by hbw.according to graham declaration,hbw warranties typically provide that the homes will be free of workmanship defects for one year,free of systems defects such as plumbing,electrical,mechanical for two years,and free of structural defects for years.
rwr also submitted copies of applications for hbw warranties signed by owners of the homes.the applications state 
buyer acknowledgement and consent 
your builder is applying to enroll your home in the warranty program.by signing below,you acknowledge that you have viewed and received the video warranty teamwork you,your builder hbw,you have read a sample copy of the warranty booklet,and consent to the terms of these documents including the binding arbitration provision contained herein.you further understand that when the warranty is issued on your new home,it is an express limited warranty and that all claims and liabilities are limited to and by the terms and conditions of the express limited warranty as stated in the hbw booklet.if you,the buyer s,have not received a certificate of warranty coverage and a warranty booklet from hbw within thirty days after closing,then no warranty exists on the home at this address.
rwr did not submit any copy of the video or the sample copy of the warranty booklet sample warranty booklet that owners attested to having read before signing the above paragraph.rather,rwr submitted copies of two versions of an hbw warranty booklet that hbw issued to buyers after the close of escrow.one version is dated january,version,and the other version is dated october,version.rwr also submitted copies of certificates of warranty insurance that notified the owners their homes were enrolled in the warranty program and specified whether they received the or the warranty booklet.
both the and versions of the warranty booklet contain a clause requiring binding arbitration under the rules of construction arbitration services,cas of any disputes between rwr and the owner,whether or not they arise from the warranty,and acknowledging the arbitration agreement involves interstate commerce and is subject to the faa.the two versions of the arbitration provision differ somewhat,however,as the booklet provides n o arbitration proceeding shall involve more than one detached dwelling,and the version does not include that restriction.further,the version gives hbw the discretion to choose an arbitrator other than cas,and the version requires cas arbitration.
in opposition to the motion,the plaintiffs argued,among other things,that rwr was attempting to compel arbitration based upon consent to an arbitration provision not provided to this court or plaintiffs counsel.the terms of the arbitration provision in the sample warranty booklet are unknown.rwr can not establish to what provision consent was given.additionally,the owners of most of the homes submitted declarations that stated they did not receive a video pertaining to the warranty or a copy of the sample warranty booklet.
after a hearing,the court denied the motion on the grounds that even if rwr were a party to the plaintiffs arrangement with hbw,arbitration is unavailable because the plaintiffs claims are not for relief under the warranties and the only arbitration agreement is set forth in the application for warranty protection,and the application is procedurally unconscionable because there is no specific acknowledgement of the arbitration clause and it is not separately identified in the paragraph,and substantively unconscionable because none of the terms of the arbitration are set forth,nor is there any information regarding plaintiffs waiver of a right to jury trial.
