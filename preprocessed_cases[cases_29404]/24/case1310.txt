appellants advanced fresh concepts franchise and advanced fresh concepts collectively afc or franchisor appeal from an order denying their motion to compel arbitration of a lawsuit brought by a franchisee,respondent htay htay chin chin or franchisee.afc contends the arbitrator rather than the trial court must determine the validity of the arbitration provision in the franchise agreement that specifically delegates this task to the arbitrator in a clause.we will refer to this as the delegation clause.chin argues the arbitration provision is unconscionable and hence unenforceable in an adhesion contract such as the one in this case.we conclude that,even if the delegation clause by itself is unconscionable,none of the other terms of the arbitration provision is,rendering moot the question about the delegation clause.because the trial court erred in finding other terms of the arbitration provision unconscionable,we reverse its order denying the motion to compel arbitration.

afc contends that when an arbitration provision contains a delegation clause,as this one does,it is the arbitrator who decides whether the arbitration provision is unconscionable.afc points to the recent united states supreme court decision in rent a center,west,jackson,rent a center,which,it argues,holds that the arbitrator must decide whether an arbitration provision is enforceable in cases where the parties have delegated that task to the arbitrator.the holding of rent a center is narrower than afc suggests.rent a center was decided under the faa,and its holding rests on the fact that the plaintiff had not challenged the unconscionability of the delegation provision of an arbitration agreement in any of the courts below.id.at.the superior court specifically declined to consider whether the delegation provision was unconscionable because the plaintiff brought this challenge too late.id.at fn.it did not hold that the enforceability of a delegation provision was to be determined by the arbitrator in all cases.the california supreme court has declined to consider whether rent a center applies in state courts or whether california would adopt its narrow rule of severability as a matter of state law.see sonic calabasas a,moreno cal th,fn.whatever its applicability in general,rent a center does not aid us in this case.

the judicially created doctrine of unconscionability,now codified in civil code section,has both a procedural and a substantive element.they are applied on a sliding scale the more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.armendariz,supra,cal th at.the procedural element focuses on the contracting parties unequal bargaining power and on the weaker party lack of notice of hidden or oppressive terms the substantive element focuses on the actual presence of or oppressive terms.ibid.an adhesion contract is indicative of procedural unconscionability because it is a standardized contract drafted by the party with greater bargaining power and offered to the weaker party on a basis.id.at.such a contract will not be enforced if its provisions are not within the reasonable expectations of the weaker party or if they are oppressive.ibid.a franchise agreement may have the characteristics of an adhesion contract because of the franchisor greater bargaining power.postal instant press,sealy th.but because a franchise agreement is made in a commercial context where arbitration is quite common,and reasonably to be anticipated,absent some special element of unfair advantage an arbitration provision in a franchise agreement may be enforced though the agreement is adhesive.keating superior court cal d,overruled on other grounds in southland keating,arbitration provision enforceable where franchisee was aware of it and of pamphlet referencing applicable rules.
