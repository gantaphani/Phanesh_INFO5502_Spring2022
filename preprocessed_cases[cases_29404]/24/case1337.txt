introduction 
petitioners and plaintiffs young seok suh and yongkew chung plaintiffs are anesthesiologists who were with a medical group that entered into two anesthesiology contracts with a hospital.they seek review of an order by the trial court compelling arbitration.we grant the petition,holding that plaintiffs did not agree to arbitrate disputes relating to one of the contracts and that the terms of the arbitration clause in the other contract are,because of the applicable rules limiting damage remedies,unconscionable,rendering the agreement to arbitrate unenforceable.
background 
plaintiffs were anesthesiologists on the medical staff of real party in interest and defendant hollywood presbyterian medical center,cha hollywood medical center,which does business under the name hollywood presbyterian medical center,operated the hospital.in,plaintiffs formed a group,hp anesthesia llc hp llc,with defendants and real parties in interests,hyung shin,sung kim,romeo velasco and sung kim all of whom are anesthesiologists.in,hp llc entered into an agreement for anesthesiology department coverage agreement with the hospital to provide all anesthesiology and pain management services at the hospital and to supervise the operation of the department.plaintiffs became bound to that agreement by signing a waiver and agreement form.
a week later,the doctors in hp llc formed hp to succeed hp llc as a party to the agreement,and the doctors,along with others,became shareholders of the corporation.the agreement was assigned by hp llc to hp.
plaintiffs allege that in,they were removed from the hospital anesthesiology department schedule because of their age and their national origin.they contend that the defendant doctors hired a number of younger doctors.in,hp and the hospital entered into a new agreement for anesthesiology department coverage,again providing for anesthesiology services agreement.plaintiffs assert they did not sign or accede to that agreement and did not see or receive it until months after it had been executed.plaintiffs allege that after their removal from the schedule,they did not practice medicine at the hospital.
plaintiffs,in their complaint,allege the following causes of action national origin discrimination against hospital and hp in violation of government code section,subdivision a first age discrimination against hospital and hp in violation of government code section,subdivision a second aiding and abetting age national origin discrimination against the hospital in violation of government code section,subdivision i third aiding and abetting age national origin discrimination against hp and the individual doctor defendants in violation of government code section,subdivision i fourth national origin discrimination in violation civil code section et against hospital and hp fifth retaliation in violation of government code section et against hospital sixth retaliation in violation of health and safety code section against hospital seventh denial of the vested right to practice medicine against hospital eighth intentional contract interference against hospital ninth intentional prospective economic advantage interference against hospital tenth intentional prospective economic advantage interference against hp and the individual doctor defendants eleventh contract breach against the individual doctor defendants twelfth contract breach against hp thirteenth fiduciary duty breach against the individual doctor defendants fourteenth negligence against the individual doctor defendants fifteenth cause of action accounting against hp and the individual doctor defendants sixteenth declaratory relief against hospital seventeenth and declaratory relief against all named defendants eighteenth.
defendants filed a petition to compel arbitration,invoking the following arbitration provision in the agreement any dispute or controversy arising under,out of or in connection with,or in relation to this agreement,or any amendment hereof,or the breach hereof shall be determined and settled by arbitration in los angeles county,california,in accordance with the american health lawyers association alternative dispute resolution service rules of procedure for arbitration and applying the laws of the state.any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon each of the parties,and judgment thereon may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
defendants also rely upon the arbitration clause in the agreement,which states in part any dispute arising under,out of or in connection with,or in relation to this agreement shall be determined and settled by arbitration in los angeles county,california,in accordance with the commercial rules of arbitration of the judicial arbitration and mediation services jams before one arbitrator applying the laws of the state.the parties shall attempt to mutually select the arbitrator.in the event they are unable to mutually agree,the arbitrator shall be selected by the procedures prescribed by the jams rules.any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon each of the parties,and judgment thereon may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.the costs shall be borne equally by both parties.
plaintiffs filed three declarations in opposition to the petition to compel arbitration.suh described his age and ancestry,the hospital organization,and the organization of hp llc.suh stated he never received a copy of the agreement,but was provided with the waiver document by which he acceded to the agreement.suh was told that if he did not execute the may waiver document,he would not be permitted to practice anesthesiology at the hospital.suh only saw the agreement after he signed the waiver form,and he was never advised of the arbitration clause or its consequences.he contended that the american health lawyers association alternative dispute resolution service rules of procedure for arbitration ahla rules,provided for in the agreement,would result in a waiver of his rights and remedies to recover consequential,incidental,and punitive damages hp llc was not legally qualified to practice medicine,rendering the agreement illegal and he did not sign and was not provided a copy of the agreement.
suh further declared that among the original shareholders of hp were plaintiffs,the kims,shin,and velasco.the original shareholders of hp never entered into a written shareholder agreement,and no officers or directors were actually elected.suh denied being a director,officer,or employee of hp.commencing in may,he rendered anesthesiology services at the hospital as provided for in the agreement,for which services he was compensated.he included facts relating to his allegations of discrimination,including that he was removed from the hospital anesthesia department schedule.he also alleged other acts of malfeasance.
in his declaration,chung reiterated many of the points raised by suh.chung declared that he had not seen the agreement until after he signed the waiver form and did not sign,nor was he provided with,the agreement until september.chung further declared that on may,he was removed from the anesthesia department schedule.
jonathan golding,plaintiff attorney,submitted a declaration to which he attached a copy of the ahla rules.section of the ahla rules states in part t he arbitrator may not award and there shall be no claim available for consequential,exemplary,incidental,punitive or special damages in an action other than an action arising from a tort unrelated to employment or the termination of employment.in an action arising from a tort unrelated to employment or the termination of employment,the arbitrator may not award consequential,exemplary,incidental,punitive or special damages against a party unless the arbitrator determines,based on the record,that there is clear and convincing evidence that the party against whom such damages are awarded is guilty of conduct evincing an intentional or reckless disregard for the rights of another party or fraud,actual or presumed.
during the hearing,the trial court respondent stated it would grant defendants petition to compel arbitration,but then raised the issue of severing the use of the ahla rules,apparently because of the substantive unconscionability question.as noted,the ahla rules barred certain remedies.
the following colloquy between plaintiffs counsel and the trial court occurred concerning severing the ahla rules from the arbitration counsel we wo waive our right to contest whether the court decision is right on this obviously.to the extent the court is going to issue an order in this manner,we would prefer if we have to arbitrate,to arbitrate under the jams rules as well.the court without waiving objection to this ruling plaintiff agrees to the jams rules.okay can we get defense to prepare an order the april,minute order states the petition by defendants to compel arbitration is granted.without waiving objection to this ruling,the plaintiff agrees to jams rules for arbitration.
a series of proposed orders and objections ensued.plaintiffs argued that they never agreed to use the jams rules.plaintiffs,in objecting to the proposed order granting the petition to compel arbitration,stated,c ounsel stated on the record that the plaintiffs would not waive their right to contest the court ruling,but if the court was going to issue an order and force the plaintiffs to arbitrate,the plaintiffs would prefer to arbitrate under the jams rules.the last filing with the respondent court concerning the written order was filed on april.
on june,suh and chung filed a mandate petition challenging the april,minute order.on july,we denied the petition because the final written order had not been filed.suh superior court,nonpub.order.on july,the respondent court issued its ruling the court grants defendants petition to compel arbitration.the court finds that a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement exists between the parties and that all of the alleged claims are within the scope of the arbitration agreement.the court further finds that to the extent the arbitration provision within the agreement for anesthesiology department coverage contains any unconscionable provision,that provision is hereby severed.the court further orders that consistent with the parties agreement and stipulation of counsel on the record at the hearing of the petition,the parties are to conduct the arbitration pursuant to the applicable rules of the judicial arbitration and mediation services.
plaintiffs filed the petition in this proceeding on september.in their petition,plaintiffs contend that no arbitration agreement existed from may,the date of the agreement to the present the agreement was illegal and could not be assigned or enforced defendants concede the agreement superseded the agreement resulting in a novation and the arbitration clause in the agreement is substantively and procedurally unconscionable.defendants contend that plaintiffs consented to arbitration under the agreement because they signed the waiver documents plaintiffs claim that they never bothered to read the arbitration provision is not a defense to its enforceability plaintiffs are bound by the arbitration provisions even though they were nonsignatories the agreement was executed after the agreement had expired the agreement is neither procedurally nor substantively unconscionable plaintiffs,as nonsignatories to the agreement,are nevertheless bound by that agreement because of their status in hp and because they accepted the benefits of the agreement to the extent the ahla rules provided for in the agreement are unconscionable,they could be severed and plaintiffs agreed that the jams rules could be utilized.
discussion 
defendants demurred to the petition on the ground that no writ may issue because plaintiffs are obligated to arbitrate.this court may,however,issue a writ to set aside an order compelling arbitration.zembsch superior court th,this court may properly review the trial court order compelling arbitration by writ of mandate.because we grant the petition for a writ,we overrule the demurrer.

plaintiffs assert that because they are not parties to the agreement,they are not bound by its arbitration clause.the agreement is between the hospital and hp.the arbitration clause in that agreement does not refer to the obligation of any employee or shareholder of hp.there is no evidence that any of the plaintiffs agreed to arbitrate any dispute arising out of the agreement.plaintiffs declare they did not even see the agreement until months after it was executed.persons are not normally bound by an agreement entered into by a corporation in which they have an interest or are employees.see benasra marciano th.
there are circumstances in which nonsignatories to an agreement containing an arbitration clause can be compelled to arbitrate under that agreement.as one authority has stated,there are six theories by which a nonsignatory may be bound to arbitrate a incorporation by reference b assumption c agency d or alter ego e estoppel and f beneficiary oehmke,commercial arbitration ed update at see dryer rams cal d,agency goldman kpmg llp th recognizing but denying equitable estoppel rn solutions,catholic healthcare west th agency and third party beneficiary rowe exline,supra,th at alter ego and equitable estoppel boucher alliance title,th equitable estoppel wolschlager fidelity national title ins.th,incorporation of arbitration clause metalclad ventana environmental organizational partnership th equitable estoppel magness petroleum warren resources of,inc.th,limited circumstances of waiver,estoppels,oral agreement reflected in written court or other record norcal mutual ins.newton th,person who accepts benefits under agreement containing arbitration clause bound by the clause county of contra costa kaiser foundation health plan,supra,cal.app th at third party beneficiary marsch williams th,agreement to arbitrate may be in a collateral document which is incorporated by reference harris superior court d third party beneficiary berman dean witter,d agency frame merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,d,part of agreement.
defendants claim that plaintiffs,although nonsignatories,are bound by the agreement as third party beneficiaries,agents or employees of hp,or as having accepted the benefits of the agreement.there is no evidence,however,that plaintiffs actually derived any benefits either as a third party beneficiary or otherwise.the uncontradicted evidence is that by the time of the agreement and thereafter,plaintiffs were not obtaining any work at the hospital.that they were employees of hp does not mean they were bound by the arbitration clause in an agreement between hp and the hospital.this is not a situation in which individual defendants were agents of the corporate defendant,were alleged to be parties to the agreement,and sought the benefit of the arbitration clause in the contract.see dryer rams,supra,cal d at.plaintiffs did not sign the agreement on behalf of hp as principals and did not benefit from that agreement.see rn solutions,catholic healthcare west,supra,th at.they are not otherwise bound by the contract under agency principles.
unlike in harris superior court,supra,d,relied upon by defendants,this case is not one for medical malpractice.in that case,the court held that a physician was bound by the arbitration provision in a contract between his medical group and the health plan in connection with a malpractice action because as an employee of the medical group,he had treated the plaintiff patient and thus voluntarily had accepted the benefits under the contract.here,plaintiffs are suing the medical group and the hospital rather than defending a medical malpractice case brought by patients against them and the medical group.
defendants also rely upon keller constr.kashani d.there,a general partner of a limited partnership signed a contract containing an arbitration clause.unlike in this case,the general partner himself signed the agreement and was legally bound in his capacity as a general partner.here,plaintiffs are shareholders of a corporation,and the agreement was not signed by them individually or on behalf of the corporation.therefore,the agreement provides no basis for compelling arbitration in this case.
the agreement provides for arbitration in accordance with the ahla rules and applying the laws of the state.those rules prohibit an award of consequential,exemplary,incidental,punitive or special damages except in tort cases unrelated to employment or termination of employment.the rules specify,in an action arising from a tort unrelated to employment or the termination of employment,the arbitrator may not award consequential,exemplary,incidental,punitive or special damages against a party unless the arbitrator determines,based on the record,that there is clear and convincing evidence that the party against whom such damages are awarded is guilty of conduct evidencing an intentional or reckless disregard for the rights of another party or fraud,actual or presumed.thus,there is an absolute bar to a claim for consequential,punitive,incidental or special damages in a case related to employment.the rules also require each party to share in the arbitration expenses,empower the arbitrator to assess expenses against any of the parties,place certain limitations on discovery,and do not compel a reasoned opinion or findings by the arbitrator.
here,there are claims for breach of contract,an accounting,and declaratory relief to which the limitations in the ahla rules apply.there are also statutory claims to which the limitations may apply.some of the tort claims are related to employment and are also subject to the ahla rules limitations.thus,the ahla rules limitations would impact many of the claims.
plaintiffs contend that the agreement is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable rendering the arbitration clause unenforceable.procedural unconscionability focuses on oppression,surprise and the manner in which the agreement was negotiated.martinez master protection th.substantive unconscionability focuses on the actual terms of the agreement and evaluates whether they create overly harsh or,results as to shock the conscience aron of california th,see generally dotson amgen,th.lexis,roman superior court th.as the supreme court has said,the prevailing view is that both procedural and substantive unconscionability must be present before a court can refuse to enforce an arbitration provision based on unconscionability.gentry superior court cal th.the court added that the absence of procedural unconscionability would as a logical conclusion mean that no matter how the contract terms,a court will not disturb the contract.id.at see civil code.although both substantive and procedural unconscionability are required,they need not be present in the same degree the more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.armendariz,supra,cal th at.
the severe ahla rules limitations on remedies are substantively unconscionable.harper ultimo th,stirlen supercuts th,see also armendariz,supra,cal th at,gelow central pacific mortg.d,for arbitration clause in employment contract to be lawful,it must allow for all types of relief that a court could order.defendants do not dispute this conclusion.these limitations are significant elements of the contract.by limiting the arbitrator power to provide various remedies,plaintiffs may be left with the possibility of having to seek relief for the excluded remedies in a separate judicial proceeding.
there is also uncontradicted evidence of procedural unconscionability.the arbitration clause is on page of the agreement in the same typeface as the balance of the agreement.plaintiffs declared that they were required to sign a printed form waiver and agreement binding them to the agreement without having the opportunity to see that agreement and as a condition of practicing anesthesiology at the hospital.the offending rules were not provided to them.this uncontradicted evidence establishes procedural unconscionability.see harper ultimo,supra,th at referencing restrictive rules without providing them.accordingly,weighing the substantive and procedural unconscionability,we conclude that the arbitration provision in the agreement is unconscionable.
moreover,the ahla rules can not be severed from the arbitration clause.the agreement does not provide for any replacement rules.see parada superior court,supra,th at severance is not permitted if the court would be required to augment the contract with additional terms.being a health provider agreement,these particular health rules are an integral part of and permeate the arbitration provision.the provision for those rules is so tainted or contrary to the essential purpose of the agreement that they are not severable.armendariz,supra,cal th at,quoting.
defendants did not specifically argue that the restriction on remedies in the ahla rules should be severed from the rules,and there is no authority permitting such a severance.the trial court was vague in what actually was being severed by stating to the extent the agreement contains any unconscionable provision,that provision is hereby severed.in any event,the ahla rules limitation of remedies clause practically can not be severed.the ahla rules specify that its entire framework is a cost containment measure of which the limitation of liability is a prime feature.those rules specify in the introduction that,the healthcare industry is under great pressure to contain costs in every way possible.the rules provide that t he parties shall be bound by these rules whenever they have agreed in writing to arbitration by the service or under the rules.a principle aspect of the rules is the limitation on the arbitrator to award consequential and punitive damages.
the supreme court said,we need not decide whether the unlawful damages provision in this arbitration agreement,by itself,would be sufficient to warrant a court refusal to enforce that agreement because we resolve this case on other grounds,we need not decide whether the state of the law with respect to damage limitations was sufficiently clear at the time of the arb
