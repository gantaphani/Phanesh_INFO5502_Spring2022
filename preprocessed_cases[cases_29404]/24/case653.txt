in this successive appeal,nissan north america,nissan challenges the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of jim oldsmobile jim nissan the first time the case was before us,we vacated the district court order compelling arbitration,finding that nissan had failed to produce sufficient evidence of arbitrability and the court had not given an adequate opportunity to rebut nissan evidence.see nissan north america,jim oldsmobile,jim nissan,cir hereafter nissan i.with the benefit of a more developed record on remand,the district court found that nissan failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to arbitration and entered judgment in favor of.we affirm.
because the record is considerably more developed than when last we visited this dispute,we recount the relevant facts anew.see nissan i,at.nissan filed this suit to compel arbitration of a dispute regarding nissan termination of car dealership.in,nissan and entered into a written dealership contract that allowed to operate as an authorized dealer of nissan cars and trucks.this initial agreement,titled nissan dealer term sales service agreement,hereafter dealer agreement was set to expire on april.the dealer agreement specified that it would automatically terminate at the end of the stipulated term without any action by either party.another provision required that any amendments be made in a writing executed by both parties.in,the parties extended the termination date to november,by executing amendment to nissan dealer term sales and service agreement.second and third amendments effected changes to certain terms of the dealer agreement that are not at issue here,but did not modify the termination date.november,came and went without the parties signing any extension to the dealer agreement.until may,continued operating as a dealer of nissan products without a written contract in place to govern the parties relationship.
on may,the parties entered into amendment to nissan dealer term sales and service agreement amendment.amendment changed the expiration date of the dealer agreement to may,and changed certain deadlines for to complete construction of an exclusive nissan showroom.to effect the latter of these changes,article twelfth of the original dealer agreement was amended to provide that would submit for nissan approval plans for the construction of the new showroom by july,submit to nissan a signed contract for the construction of the showroom by september,commence construction of the new showroom by november,and complete construction of the new showroom by may.amendment also contained a provision subjecting the parties to binding arbitration as the exclusive mechanism for resolving any dispute,controversy or claim arising out of or relating in any way to this agreement and amendment,including but not limited to claims under any state or federal statutes hereinafter disputes.all disputes were to be submitted to the independent arbitration service unless arbitration was waived in writing by both parties.amendment marked the first time the parties agreed to arbitration.
on april,two weeks before the dealer agreement was set to expire,nissan sent a notice of default,charging with failing to meet three of the four amendment deadlines for constructing the exclusive nissan showroom.the notice of default required to either complete the showroom within sixty days or provide a commitment within sixty days to complete the showroom in an acceptable amount of time.if failed to complete these new requirements within sixty days,nissan stated it would consider the dealer agreement to be in breach and that this breach may result in nissan issuing a notice of termination under the relevant provisions of the dealer agreement.this was a curious threat given that the agreement was set to expire on its own terms approximately two weeks later,on may.on may,responded to the notice of default by explaining that a lawsuit with its landlord delayed construction,that the suit had been resolved six months earlier and that had since contracted with an architect to begin the planning process for the new facility.hoped to have a final set of plans by august and planned to begin construction by the end of or the spring of nissan responded on june,by offering an additional period to substantially correct failure to fulfill its responsibilities under article twelfth d of the agreement with respect to the new exclusive nissan showroom.the june letter offered an additional one day extension,expiring on december,upon which to either commence construction or provide nissan with a new nissan exclusive showroom facility.nothing in this letter addressed the larger issue of the expiration of the dealer agreement and its amendments.
apparently did not meet the new deadlines set by the june letter,and nissan consequently sent a notice of termination pursuant to the nissan dealer sales and service agreement and chapter,sections et of the illinois compiled statutes hereafter notice of termination on january.this letter purported to terminate the dealer agreement and also to terminate as a dealer,effective sixty days from receipt of the letter.the notice of termination directed,among other things,to stop selling nissan products,and to remove the nissan name and trademark from the dealership,including from all signs and all advertising materials.
jim met with representatives of nissan on april,and informed them that he was trying to sell the nissan dealership.as a result,on may,nissan sent a letter that purported to extend the effective date of the termination by ninety days to give an opportunity to complete negotiations and to present an acceptable agreement to nissan.specifically,the letter stated,nissan will extend the notice of termination and stay the effective date of termination for days commencing from the april,meeting,to and including july,to provide you an opportunity to submit an acceptable proposed transfer of assets.again,there was no mention of the expiration of the dealer agreement and its amendments.
the next correspondence between the parties was a letter from nissan to on june,offering four possible scenarios to resolve the parties dispute.the first option,which nissan labeled the status quo,was that would provide a proposal to sell the dealership to a buyer acceptable to nissan by july.if failed to present an acceptable buyer candidate by july,under the second option,nissan would proceed with termination.under the third option,would agree to enter into a new dealer term sales and service agreement,which would entail removing the oldsmobile and isuzu lines from the premises and providing an exclusive nissan dealership.the fourth option was the one on which the parties reached some agreement.under the fourth option,nissan agreed to further extend the effective date of termination,listed as july,an additional ninety days in order to provide an opportunity to accomplish one of three things would submit a proposal to sell the dealership to a buyer acceptable to nissan if no acceptable buyer was procured,would remove all other lines,including oldsmobile and isuzu,from the dealership premises within days after july or if failed to procure a buyer and also failed to remove the other lines from his dealership,would voluntarily terminate.reluctantly accept ed scenario four in a letter faxed to nissan on july.
in early august,nissan sent a draft amendment.amendment proposed extending the expiration date in the final article of the dealer agreement to january.it also required to find a buyer for the dealership by october,or remove the oldsmobile and isuzu lines by january.finally,amendment stated that the parties would resolve any disputes arising out of the dealer agreement,including amendment,through mediation and binding arbitration.did not respond to nissan request to execute amendment,and nissan sent a letter on august,asking again to sign the new terms and informing that it would revoke the offer and pursue termination unless complied.responded with an august,letter declining amendment and specifically objecting to,among other things,the arbitration clause.nissan then revised amendment to eliminate the arbitrati
