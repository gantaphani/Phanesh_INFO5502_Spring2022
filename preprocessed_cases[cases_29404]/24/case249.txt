photopaint technologies,llc,photopaint appeals from a final judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york knapp,denying photopaint motion to confirm an arbitration award under the federal arbitration act faa,et,and granting the for summary judgment of smartlens corporation and steven hylen collectively,smartlens on the grounds that section of the faa imposes a statute of limitations on an application for an order of confirmation and that photopaint which moved for confirmation more than one year after the award was made was not entitled to relief from this limitation period.see photopaint,llc smartlens,d.
we reverse,holding that the faa does impose a statute of limitations,but that photopaint is entitled to relief from the statutory period.for the reasons that follow,the judgment of the district court is vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
background 
in december,photopaint and smartlens entered into a license agreement containing a clause under which they agreed that their disputes would be submitted to arbitration.when a dispute arose in october,they duly submitted it to an arbitrator selected by the american arbitration association aaa.in an august award,the arbitrator ruled largely in photopaint favor and ordered it to submit an accounting of costs associated with the license agreement.after reviewing these accounting submissions,the arbitrator signed a final award on may.the final award provided that the license agreement was voidable that either party could elect to rescind it within thirty days from receipt of the award and that smartlens would make a payment to photopaint if either party elected to rescind.the amount of this payment was to depend on which party rescinded if smartlens rescinded first,it would pay approximately plus photopaint share of the aaa costs if photopaint rescinded first,smartlens would pay approximately.
although the arbitrator signed the final award on may,and promptly sent it to the aaa for distribution,the aaa failed for some reason to deliver the award to the parties until october,than four months later.the parties ultimately found out that the award had issued when smartlens asked to have the arbitration hearing reopened for additional submissions in denying that request on october,the arbitrator treated it as one for modification of the final award,noting that this award had been rendered on may,
since the final award provided that either party could rescind within thirty days of receiving the award,and since the parties first received it on october,the option to rescind was initially scheduled to expire on november.as this date neared,the parties entered into a series of letter agreements to allow for continued settlement discussions.
during the negotiations,smartlens and photopaint exchanged several drafts of a settlement agreement,in which they agreed that smartlens would pay photopaint a of,but differed as to other provisions.in april,negotiations appeared close to resolution,and on april,photopaint circulated a revised draft reflecting the payment and acceding to the remaining changes sought by smartlens.shortly afterward,however,smartlens advised that,due to sharp financial reverses,it could offer no more than a payment of,together with a promissory note.on may,smartlens sought a further time extension under exactly the same terms as the parties prior agreements,to discuss the alternative proposal further and attempt to achieve a final resolution.photopaint agreed.on the basis of this and subsequent letter agreements,the parties continued discussions into may,june,and july the may anniversary of the rendering of the final award.
negotiations broke down in july,and on july,photopaint rescinded the license agreement and demanded from smartlens the payment provided for under the terms of the final award.smartlens refused to pay,and photopaint filed this petition to confirm the final award pursuant to the faa.
in the district court,smartlens argued against confirmation on the ground that the application was,under section of the faa,because it was filed more than one year after the date the final award was made.the district court agreed,granted smartlens summary judgment on this ground,and dismissed the petition.photopaint,d at.photopaint appealed.
discussion 
we review de novo a ruling granting summary judgment,see young county of fulton,cir,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party here,photopaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in that party favor see anderson liberty lobby,d maguire citicorp retail,cir.first options of chicago,kaplan,d stating that,on appeals from decisions upholding arbitration awards,we review legal conclusions de novo and factual determinations for clear error.summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
section of the faa provides,in pertinent part 
if the parties in their agreement have agreed that a judgment of the court shall be entered upon the award made pursuant to the arbitration,and shall specify the court,then at any time within one year after the award is made any party to the arbitration may apply to the court so specified for an order confirming the award,and thereupon the court must grant such an order confirming the award unless the award is vacated,modified,or corrected as prescribed in sections and of this title.
emphasis added.the threshold question on appeal is whether this wording creates a statute of question of first impression in this court.
as photopaint emphasizes,the permissive verb may,rather than the mandatory verb must,is used in the clause affording one year to the party wishing to confirm an award,while must is used elsewhere in the same section and in other sections of the faa.in section,for example,congress used must in relation to the period for filing a motion to vacate an arbitration award 
we have recognized in another context that when the same statute uses both may and shall,the normal inference is that each is used in its usual one act being permissive,the other mandatory.weinstein albright,cir alteration in original quoting anderson yungkau.accord lopez davis,d haig agee,d see also rastelli warden,metro.corr,cir the use of a permissive verb may review instead of shall review suggests a discretionary rather than mandatory review process.both the fourth and the eighth circuits have relied on this normal inference in holding that may in section is permissive only,and that petitions to confirm arbitral awards under the faa may be filed beyond the one year period.see sverdrup whc constructors,cir const.of rosebud sioux tribe,cir see also gronager gilmore sec,civ,wl,at,following sverdrup,aff on other grounds,cir unpublished disposition nations personnel of texas,american med,no,wl,at.may,following sverdrup.but see in re consol.rail,relying on considerations of finality to hold that section imposes a mandatory statute of limitations.in the fourth circuit sverdrup decision,which was relied on heavily by the eighth circuit in construction,the court cited the ordinary permissive meaning of may,as well as considerations of judicial economy,in holding that section limitations period is not mandatory.sverdrup,at,accord,at.
we respectfully disagree,particularly in light of the supreme court intervening decision in cortez byrd chips,bill harbert construction,d.cortez byrd considered whether the word may is used permissively in the context of the faa venue provisions,under which whenever the parties do not specify otherwise proceedings may be conducted in the district where the award was made.id.at.discussing.although the court held that the venue provisions are permissive,it expressly declined to rely on the permissiveness of may as a matter of plain meaning see id.at.instead,cortez byrd relied on considerations particular to venue the overall structure of the faa a narrow reading of the venue provisions would have created needless tension with other parts of the faa,id.at,and the statutory history of the gen
