plaintiff ralphs grocery company ralphs appeals an order denying its petition to compel defendant kelvin massie,its terminated former employee,to arbitrate an employment discrimination complaint he filed with the california division of labor standards enforcement dlse and stay defendant arthur lujan from taking any administrative action on massie complaint in lujan capacities as the dlse chief and california labor commissioner ralphs contends the superior court reversibly erred by determining massie filing of his discrimination complaint with the dlse did not trigger ralphs contractual right to compel massie to arbitrate that complaint in accord with an agreement he signed during his employment with ralphs.ralphs also contends the superior court reversibly erred by determining massie arbitration agreement with ralphs did not bar state from investigating massie discrimination complaint or otherwise exercising its administrative jurisdiction under labor code section further,citing howsam dean witter reynolds,d howsam,ralphs contends that in deciding whether to compel arbitration,a court may consider only two gateway issues of arbitrability unless the parties have clearly and unmistakably provided otherwise.id.at.thus,a gateway dispute about whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration clause raises a question of arbitrability for a court to decide.citations.similarly,a disagreement about whether an arbitration clause in a concededly binding contract applies to a particular type of controversy is for the court.id.at.
the record indicates that without first determining the first gateway dispute whether massie was bound by a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement,the superior court proceeded to determine the second gateway dispute adversely to ralphs by concluding ralphs contractual right to compel arbitration was unripe because the filing of massie discrimination complaint with the dlse did not trigger massie obligation under his agreement with ralphs to arbitrate his claims,and the arbitration agreement between massie and ralphs did not preclude state from maintaining the administrative proceedings initiated by massie complaint.howsam,supra.at.because the superior court did not comply with the process mandated by the supreme court for determining the two gateway issues of arbitrability bearing on the decision whether to compel arbitration,we reverse the order denying ralphs petition and direct the superior court to determine whether the parties arbitration agreement is binding and enforceable against massie before the court proceeds,if necessary,to determine the issues whether the federal arbitration act faa requires arbitration of massie labor code discrimination complaint and whether the united states constitution supremacy clause applies to preempt state administrative proceedings on massie complaint.perry thomas,d perry southland keating,d southland.
introduction 
in massie began working for ralphs.in massie signed an employee acknowledgement stating he received,read and understood ralphs dispute resolution program mediation binding arbitration policy the policy in may ralphs terminated massie employment.
in october massie filed a discrimination complaint with the dlse asserting ralphs violated the law by discharging him for lawful conduct occurring during nonworking hours away from the employer premises.state notified ralphs that massie had filed a complaint that state intended to investigate.
in february,after seeking unsuccessfully to persuade massie and state that massie discrimination complaint was subject to mandatory arbitration and that state lacked jurisdiction over massie complaint,ralphs filed its petition in the superior court to compel massie to arbitrate,and to stay state administrative proceedings on massie complaint.in opposing ralphs petition,massie asserted the arbitration agreement was unenforceable because it was procedurally and substantively unconscionable his filing of a discrimination complaint with the dlse did not initiate any formal dispute resolution that would trigger his contractual obligation to arbitrate and ralphs right to compel arbitration had not yet ripened.state opposition to ralphs petition asserted that the faa did not preempt state power to investigate massie discrimination complaint because state was not a party to the arbitration agreement,and that the labor commissioner,not employee complainant massie,controlled the investigation of the complaint.
in april the superior court denied ralphs petition.the court concluded massie filing of his discrimination complaint with the dlse initiated state administrative proceedings,but did not trigger massie contractual arbitration obligation because those administrative proceedings did not presently involve massie as a party.hence,the court denied ralphs request to compel arbitration on the ground ralphs contractual arbitration right was unripe.citing waffle house,d waffle house,the superior court also concluded the arbitration agreement between massie and ralphs did not preclude state from investigating employee massie discrimination complaint or otherwise exercising its administrative jurisdiction under section.the court thus declined to stay the labor commissioner administrative proceedings.
on this appeal,ralphs seeks reversal of the superior court order denying its petition.because the superior court prejudicially erred by not complying with the procedural requirements mandated in howsam,supra,when it decided the arbitrability of massie arbitration agreement with ralphs,the order must be reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings.
