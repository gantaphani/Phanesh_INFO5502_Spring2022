discussion 
appellant primary contention is that the arbitration award must be vacated because the arbitration clause of the retainer agreement violates the mfa and was therefore unenforceable.
standard of review 
because of the strong public policy favoring arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive method of dispute resolution,judicial review of arbitration awards is restricted to the grounds for vacation or correction enumerated in code of civil procedure sections and.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,moncharsh.an enumerated ground for vacation occurs when a court determines that the arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted.code civ,subd.d.
moncharsh recognized that there may be some limited and exceptional circumstances justifying judicial review of an arbitrator decision when a party claims illegality affects a portion of the underlying contract.such cases would include those in which granting finality to an arbitrator decision would be inconsistent with the protection of a party statutory rights.moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.as board of education round valley teachers cal th,d,round valley explained,were an arbitrator to grant relief pursuant to a contract that violates the losing party specific statutory rights,he would exceed his powers,as that phrase is used in code of civil procedure,section,subdivision d.round valley,supra,at,d.moncharsh cautioned,however,that courts should not invalidate an arbitrator award on the ground of inconsistency with the protection of a party statutory rights unless the pertinent statute contains an explicit legislative expression of public policy that a specific issue is not to be subject to arbitration.moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d,see also round valley,supra,cal th at,d.
because appellant contends,in essence,that the arbitration clause requirement of binding arbitration of fee disputes is inconsistent with his statutory rights under the mfa,and therefore the arbitrator exceeded his powers in granting respondent relief under that clause,judicial review of the arbitrator decision here is appropriate.round valley,supra,cal th at,d.
ii.appealability
