this appeal presents two questions.the first,which we dispose of in relatively short order,is whether the district court erred in confirming an arbitration award.the second,which merits fuller discussion,is whether the party that prevailed in arbitration was entitled,by contract or statute,to recoup the fees and costs it incurred in seeking to confirm the arbitral award before the district court.
are zurich american insurance zurich and vinmar international,vinmar jointly,the petitioner or the shipper.the appeal challenges two orders of the united states district court for the southern district of new york william pauley iii,judge.in the first,entered on june,the district court denied the petitioner motion to vacate an arbitration award and granted the motion of team tankers team tankers,eitzen chemical usa eitzen,and the siteam explorer the siteam explorer jointly,the respondent or the carrier to confirm it.in the second,entered on september,the district court awarded the respondent its attorney fees and costs.
we affirm the district court june,order denying the petitioner motion to vacate the arbitral award and granting the respondent motion to confirm it but reverse the district court september,order awarding attorney fees and costs to the respondent because the award was not authorized under relevant law.
background 
in june,vinmar chartered from team tankers a ship called the siteam explorer to move a large quantity of a chemical called acrylonitrile acn from houston,texas to ulsan,south korea.zurich am.ins.team tankers,cv whp,wl,at june.acn is a versatile raw material that is,in its most valuable form,colorless.zurich am.ins,wl,at.contact with other chemicals can cause acn to yellow,become yellow in color,which is evidence of a change in composition that reduces its value,zurich am.ins,wl,at.
vinmar planned to find a buyer for its cargo in ulsan,but the acn market dropped while the siteam explorer was at sea.accordingly,when the ship arrived in port in august,the acn was transferred into onshore tanks for storage.at that time,the acn remained on specification for color that is,it had not begun to yellow.zurich am.ins,wl,at see.
six weeks later,vinmar tested the stored acn and learned that it had yellowed beyond vinmar quality standards.it also tested a sample that had been carried on the siteam explorer but never exposed to the ulsan shore tanks it too had yellowed.zurich am.ins,wl,at.a sample pulled from tanks in houston that had not been carried on the siteam explorer had not yellowed at all.
consistent with the charter agreement,vinmar initiated arbitration before the society of maritime arbitrators,sma.zurich am.ins,wl,at.vinmar attempted to show that it had delivered the acn to houston in good order but that it had arrived contaminated in ulsan.see.it argued that the acn had been contaminated by a chemical called pygas previously carried in the siteam explorer tanks.see.
on august,applying the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa,note,the arbitration panel majority held that,for three reasons,vinmar was not entitled to relief.it held,first,that vinmar had not made out a prima facie case that the acn had been damaged while aboard the vessel,second,that even if vinmar had made out a prima facie case,team tankers had shown that it exercised due diligence in transporting the cargo,and third,that vinmar had in any event failed to prove damages.
following the panel decision,the shipper,vinmar,petitioned the district court on november,to vacate the award under section of the federal arbitration act faa,et arguing that the panel manifestly disregarded cogsa in reaching each of the three conclusions described above.see.in january,the shipper learned that the panel chairman had died as a result of a brain tumor with which he had been diagnosed during the arbitration,and of which he never informed the parties.zurich am.ins,wl,at.vinmar amended its petition to argue that that his failure to do so constituted corruption or misbehavior as those terms are used in the faa.see a.
the district court held that the arbitration panel had not manifestly disregarded the law in determining that vinmar had not made out a prima facie case under cogsa accordingly,the court declined to address vinmar other arguments.zurich am.ins,wl,at.it likewise held that the panel chairman had not been guilty of corruption or misbehavior.id.at.on the authority of a provision in the charter agreement stating that d amages for breach of this charter shall include all provable damages,and all costs of suit and attorneys sic fees incurred in any action hereunder,the district court awarded the respondent carrier the fees and costs it incurred in connection with the district court proceeding.id.at.
on appeal,the petitioner shipper argues that the district court erred in three respects concluding that the arbitral panel did not manifestly disregard the law concluding that the panel chairman had not been guilty of corruption or misbehavior and awarding attorney fees and costs to the respondent carrier.we agree with the district court decision to uphold the arbitral award.we conclude,however,that it erred in awarding the respondent carrier its fees and costs.
discussion 
i.the arbitral award 
t o avoid undermining the twin goals of arbitration,namely,settling disputes efficiently and avoiding long and expensive litigation,arbitral awards are subject to very limited review.folkways music publishers,weiss,cir.under the united nations convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,june,the new york convention,which governs this dispute,a court must confirm an arbitral award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said convention.
the award in this case having been rendered in the united states,available grounds for vacatur include all the express grounds for vacating an award under the faa.see yusuf ahmed alghanim sons toys r us,cir the new york convention specifically contemplates that the state in which the award is made,will be free to set aside or modify an award in accordance with its domestic arbitral law and its full panoply of express and implied grounds for relief.as relevant here,the faa permits a court to vacate an arbitral award where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,u.a,or where the arbitrators were guilty of any misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced,id.a.a court may also set aside an arbitration award if it was rendered in manifest disregard of the law.schwartz merrill lynch,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we conclude that the shipper has not established any ground for vacating the arbitral award.on this point we agree entirely with the district court thorough analysis,see zurich am.ins,wl,and thus touch only briefly on the shipper arguments.
manifest disregard of the law 
the shipper first argument that the arbitral panel manifestly disregarded the substantive law of cogsa is easily rejected.a litigant seeking to vacate an arbitration award based on alleged manifest disregard of the law bears a heavy burden metals,llc dempsey pipe supply,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a court may vacate an arbitral award on this ground only if the court finds both that the arbitrators knew of a governing legal principle yet refused to apply it or ignored it altogether,and the law ignored by the arbitrators was well defined,explicit,and clearly applicable to the case.wallace buttar,cir alterations omitted.
the shipper basic argument,briefly stated,is that the arbitration panel majority disregarded cogsa by requiring the shipper to prove the cause of the damage to its cargo,rather than properly applying cogsa regime.see transatlantic marine claims oocl inspiration,cir describing cogsa system of burdens and presumptions.we disagree.as the district court carefully explained,the panel majority recognized that cogsa permits a shipper to make a prima facie case by establishing that it delivered goods to a carrier in sound condition,and that the goods arrived in damaged condition following carriage.see zurich am.ins,wl,
