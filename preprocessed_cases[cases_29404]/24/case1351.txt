a student and his parents filed this action against his school,alleging it was liable under the state hate crimes laws,for death threats he received from classmates who misperceived his sexual orientation.the trial court ordered that all of the statutory hate crimes claim and several common law arbitrated in accordance with the school enrollment contract,which contained not only an arbitration provision but also a provision entitling the prevailing party to attorney fees.the arbitrator found in favor of the school on all claims and awarded it over in arbitral expenses and attorney fees.
the primary question on appeal is whether the arbitrator could impose a type of expense on plaintiffs they would not have been required to bear if the dispute had been heard in court.we conclude that because the hate crimes laws constitute unwaivable statutory rights comparable to antidiscrimination laws,such expenses are prohibited.otherwise,the filing of hate crimes claims would be deterred.see armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,armendariz.
in postarbitration proceedings,plaintiffs argued they were not liable for any type of arbitral expense they would not have had to pay in a court case.they also asserted that because the hate crimes laws authorize an award of attorney fees only to a prevailing plaintiff see,subd.b,subd.h,the arbitrator could not award attorney fees against them.we determine that although the trial court should have decided whether the arbitrator awarded such expenses and fees,the court failed to do so and found only that plaintiffs claims were properly submitted to arbitration.thus,the judgment shall be reversed,and,on remand,the trial court shall take the necessary steps to ensure that plaintiffs do not pay any inappropriate expenses or fees.
background 
the following allegations and facts are taken from the pleadings and the papers submitted in the trial court concerning the arbitration of the case.
was a student at school,a private educational institution with a middle and an upper school in los angeles.filed this action against and others through a guardian ad litem,his father.father and mother also pleaded claims in their own right.we will refer to and his parents collectively as plaintiffs.
a.the original complaint 
on april,plaintiffs filed this action against,the board of directors,certain officers and administrators,and a faculty member collectively school,alleging as follows.
while a student,was also a singer and an actor.he had a record album with a planned release date,had broadcast a song worldwide via satellite radio,and had played the leading role in a feature film presented at an internationally acclaimed film festival.he attended upper school.
maintained a web site to promote his career in entertainment.the site allowed any member of the public to post comments in a guestbook.several students at,using its computers,went to the web site and posted death threats against and made derogatory comments about him.one post read,i going to pound your head in with an ice pick.another said,faggot,i going to kill you.a third stated,you are an oversized faggot i just want to hit you in the g o to the freeway bridge and jump.a fourth read,i hate fags you need to be stopped.one student wrote,i am looking forward to your death.another commented,not only are you a massive fagmo,but must absolutely quit showing your face at my school.you are now officially wanted dead or alive.one post read,i want to rip out your fucking heart and feed it to you.several other posts couched threats with references to misperceived sexual orientation as a homosexual.
the students who posted the threats sought to destroy life,threatened to murder him,and wanted to drive him out of and the community in which he lived.the student newspaper,the chronicle,ran more than one article on the matter.
when father read the threats at the web site,he immediately informed of the problem,believing that some of its students were responsible.the father also contacted the los angeles police department,which,in turn,notified the federal bureau of investigation.
on the advice of the police,withdrew from.he and his family moved to another part of california,where he went to a different educational institution.the chronicle ran an article disclosing new residential location and the name of the school he was attending.the article also disclosed that postings at the web site had referred to as a faggot.the faculty advisor to the staff of the chronicle approved the article before publication.did not suspend or expel any of the students who admitted posting the threats.
the original complaint contained causes of action negligence assault upon another with death threats and hate crimes conspiracy to assault another with death threats and hate crimes invasion of privacy conspiracy to invade the privacy of another defamation conspiracy to defame another intentional infliction of emotional distress conspiracy to inflict emotional distress on another negligent infliction of emotional distress and fraud in the inducement of a contract.a statutory hate crimes claim was not pleaded.
the cause of action for negligence alleged that the school had failed to provide a safe school environment see former,added by stats,ch.the cause of action for assault upon another with death threats and hate crimes sought to impose liability on the school for permitting students to use its computers to make the threats.the related conspiracy claim accused the school of protecting the students who posted the threats in order to preserve their academic standings,to prevent colleges and universities from learning about their misconduct,and to protect the school reputation in addition,the school exposed plaintiffs to further harm by publishing an article in the chronicle disclosing their new residential location and the name of new educational institution.the privacy and defamation claims alleged that defendants had published in a public forum false and derogatory comments about misperceived sexuality.the intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims were premised on the preceding allegations.the last cause of action,for fraudulent inducement,alleged that parents enrolled him in and paid a substantial sum of money in exchange for the school promise to provide an environment free of verbal abuse and harassment.at the end of the complaint,plaintiffs prayed for an unspecified amount of general damages,special damages,and attorney fees on each cause of action.the complaint did not include as defendants either the students who had posted the death threats or their parents as guardians ad litem.
in the body of the complaint,the privacy and defamation claims each alleged that reputation had been damaged in an amount exceeding million.
the case was assigned to judge victor person.
b.the petition to compel arbitration 
on may,the school filed a petition to compel arbitration of all claims and to stay the civil action pending the outcome of arbitration.the petition was based on the contents of enrollment contract,signed by father.
the enrollment contract consisted of five pages.the heading permission to enroll appeared at the top of the first page,followed by the recitation,i have read,initialed and agree to the enclosed terms conditions i accept this offer of enrollment,certify that i am the legal custodial parent and hereby enroll my child at.the fourth page was captioned terms and conditions.it stated at the top my signature on the enrollment agreement and initials below affirm that i have read this statement and have accepted all of its provisions.third italics added.
under terms and conditions,the contract contained an arbitration provision,stating i understand that any legal and actionable controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement including but not limited to the determination of the scope and applicability of this agreement to arbitrate,the student enrollment from or the student educational experience at including,but not limited to academic matters and extracurricular activities and community service shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration to be held in los angeles county,california,before a single,neutral arbitrator in accordance with judicial arbitration and mediation services,jams comprehensive arbitration rules and procedures.this arbitration agreement applies during the term of this enrollment agreement and survives after the termination of the enrollment agreement.
jams rules,though not set forth in the contract,provided each party shall pay its share of jams fees and expenses,unless the parties agree on a different allocation of fees and expenses.the contract did not establish a different allocation.
also under terms and conditions was an attorney fees provision,as follows in the event of any arbitration or litigation between the parties arising out of this agreement,or which relates in any way to the enrollment of the student at,the prevailing party therein shall be allowed all reasonable attorneys fees expended or incurred in such arbitration or litigation,to be recovered as part of the costs therein.
the next paragraph began,i recognize that alteration of any wording in this agreement will nullify this offer of enrollment.italics added.
the end of the contract stated that tuition for the upcoming academic year was.
in its petition,the school argued that,based on the california arbitration act code civ,plaintiffs claims were subject to arbitration,and the civil action should be stayed until the arbitration was completed.the petition was scheduled to be heard on july.
on june,plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint.the school defendants remained substantially the same some new defendants were added the students who had allegedly posted the death threats on the web site were sued through their parents as guardians ad litem collectively students.
the causes of action also underwent some changes.nine,not,causes of action were alleged.the negligence claim see former,was abandoned.the previous claims for assault and conspiracy to commit assault with death threats and hate crimes were combined into a single cause of action that alleged violations of both the ralph civil rights act,and the tom bane civil rights act.in general,those acts provide a civil remedy for hate crimes.parents,together with,were plaintiffs on the hate crimes claim,alleging they had suffered emotional harm and economic damages,including moving expenses,caused by the threats.the privacy claim was replaced by a cause of action entitled public disclosure of private facts.the defamation claim remained the same.a new cause of action for false light alleged that the school and the students had falsely portrayed as a homosexual.the two emotional distress claims were realleged without change.a new cause of action sought to impose liability on the parents of the students based on civil code section,subdivision a,which makes a parent liable,up to specified limits,for an injury or death caused by the willful misconduct of a minor child within the parent custody and control.another new cause of action,entitled negligent supervision of students,alleged that the school had failed to prevent threats of violence,offensive language,and harassment.the ninth and last cause of action realleged the fraudulent inducement claim.
as before,the prayer for relief sought unspecified general and special damages and attorney fees and costs.the new cause of action for violation of the hate crimes laws sought injunctive relief.in the body of the first amended complaint,plaintiffs alleged that reputation had been damaged in an amount exceeding million.
on june,plaintiffs filed opposition to the petition to compel arbitration.they argued was not bound by the enrollment contract or its arbitration provision because,as a minor,he had disaffirmed the contract the arbitrator lacked the authority to issue injunctive relief arbitration was improper as to the school because other parties the students were not bound by the arbitration provision see code civ,subd.c and the arbitration provision was unenforceable on the ground that plaintiffs would not be able to vindicate their statutory rights in the province of arbitration,citing armendariz,supra,cal th,d.
in the reply,the school argued that,after it filed the petition,plaintiffs could not amend their new causes of action,requests for relief,or an effort to avoid arbitration.the school also asserted armendariz did not preclude the arbitration of plaintiffs claims because that decision did not apply to the hate crimes laws.
on july,one of the defendants filed a peremptory challenge code civ,seeking to disqualify judge person.the challenge,which bore the wrong case number,was not filed in judge person courtroom.see,subd.a.at the time of the hearing on the petition,judge person had not seen the challenge.
on july,the day of the hearing,judge person provided the parties with a tentative ruling granting the arbitration as to the school and staying the action as to the students.the parties presented argument.judge person took the matter under submission.
by minute order dated july,judge person adopted the tentative as his final ruling,concluding that the arbitration provision in the enrollment contract encompassed plaintiffs claims.the order also stated the plaintiffs have tried improperly to amend their claims,adding claims against the parents of the students who made the allegedly offensive web site postings.however,plaintiffs can not escape their obligation to arbitrate their claims against the school and school personnel simply by adding other claims and defendants.were this the rule,arbitration agreements would be illusory.instead the court must simply stay those claims pending completion of the arbitration against the defendants.
with respect to the peremptory challenge,judge person wrote at the commencement of the hearing on the petition,counsel inquired as to whether the court had been made aware of a peremptory challenge pursuant to code of civil procedure section.it was not aware of such a challenge as no record of the filing of a challenge in this particular case was established.if such a challenge is brought,of course,it limits the court power to move forward until it has ruled on the legal sufficiency and timeliness of such a challenge.at that time the court official records reflected that no such peremptory challenge had been filed in this case.since the court had nothing,officially,before it to rule upon,it was impossible for the court to determine the legal sufficiency or timeliness of the alleged challenge.under those circumstances,even though plaintiff represented it had a service copy,the court went forward with the hearing.
subsequent to taking the matter under submission in order to review the authority on the procedural issues contested by the plaintiff during the hearing,plaintiff counsel apparently returned later the same morning of the hearing with a copy of a peremptory challenge that purported to be for this matter but contained the wrong case number instead of.the document had apparently been filed on july,but was not recorded anywhere except in the record of whatever case represents.since the error on the face of the peremptory challenge prevented the court from reviewing the matter prior to the commencement of the hearing on the petition,the court finds it to be untimely as to that hearing.
as to ruling on the peremptory challenge,the court having reviewed the challenge finds it to be timely filed as to all further proceedings and legally sufficient the court accepts the challenge at this time.the case file is ordered to be delivered to the master calendar department forthwith for the purpose of being reassigned to another courtroom.
on august,plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of mandate with this court,challenging judge person refusal to disqualify himself before ruling on the petition to compel arbitration.plaintiffs argued that judge person order compelling arbitration was void and should be set aside.the school filed a preliminary opposition.by order dated august,we summarily denied the writ petition.
c.the arbitration 
in november,the arbitration commenced,the honorable judith ryan serving as the arbitrator.the parties engaged in document productions,took depositions,and retained a total of eight expert witnesses.
in may,the school moved for summary disposition of all of plaintiffs claims.plaintiffs then filed a second amended complaint,adding three causes of action breach of contract,alleging the existence and breach of a contract consisting of the enrollment contract,the student honor code,and the handbook intentionally tortious conduct and negligence.the second and third of those claims were based on the investigation of the incident.
in august,the school moved for summary disposition as to all of the claims in the second amended complaint.plaintiffs filed opposition.in october,the parties presented argument on the motion.
in a ruling dated october,the arbitrator granted the motion in part.she dismissed the hate crimes claim,finding that a federal statute rendered the school immune from liability for the students misconduct,notwithstanding that some of the students had used computers to post the death threats the claims for defamation and disclosure of private facts were dismissed as to parents but not as to.the false light claim was dismissed as duplicative of the defamation claim.and the intentionally tortious conduct claim was dismissed for failure to state a cognizable cause of action.the motion was denied in its entirety as to the negligent infliction of emotional distress claim,which was brought by only the claim for negligent supervision of students,brought by all plaintiffs the negligence claim,brought by all plaintiffs and the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim,which was not asserted against the school.the ruling,consisting of pages,was served on counsel by mail and facsimile transmission on october,
the surviving based on the common heard by the arbitrator in an evidentiary hearing held on february,and.the parties submitted closing briefs.in may,the parties presented closing arguments.
in an interim award dated may,the arbitrator found in favor of the school on the merits of the claims.the arbitrator explained her reasoning in a opinion.she also concluded that the school was the prevailing party for purposes of the attorney fees provision in the enrollment contract and reserved jurisdiction to make a final award that would include attorney fees and costs.the interim award was served on counsel by mail and facsimile transmission on june.
the school filed an application for arbitration fees,attorney fees,and costs.the application sought in attorney fees and costs,and in arbitration fees and costs.
plaintiffs countered with a motion to tax costs.argued for himself only that,as a minor,he had disavowed any financial obligations relevant to the arbitration.the arbitrator agreed and did not award any fees or costs against him.parents took issue with some of the specifics in the school billing records,arguing for example that some of the attorneys work should have been performed by nonattorneys and that excessive time had been spent on the case.the arbitrator rejected those contentions.
in an final award dated august,the arbitrator ordered parents to pay the school a total of in arbitration fees,attorney fees,and costs.in other words,the arbitrator awarded the school all of its requested arbitral expenses and attorney fees.the award was served on counsel by mail and facsimile transmission on august.with the exception of the arbitrator initial ruling and the subsequent awards,we do not have the record of the arbitration proceedings.
the school returned to the trial court,judge ernest hiroshige presiding,and filed a petition to confirm the arbitration award.for their part,plaintiffs filed a petition to vacate the award.each side filed an opposition to the other petition.
the school petition was straightforward plaintiffs had agreed in the enrollment contract to arbitrate disputes with the school disputes subject to arbitration had arisen and had been arbitrated in accordance with the contract and the arbitrator had awarded arbitration fees,attorney fees,and costs as provided in the contract and jams rules.
in their petition to vacate the award,plaintiffs argued that judge person order compelling arbitration was void because he should have been disqualified see code civ,before he issued a final ruling on the petition to compel arbitration.in the alternative,plaintiffs asserted that the award of violated their rights because,under armendariz,supra,cal th,d,they could not be required to pay attorney fees or any type of arbitral expense they would not have incurred if the hate crimes claim had been adjudicated in court.
the petitions were heard on october.at the conclusion of the hearing,judge hiroshige granted the petition to confirm the arbitration award and denied the petition to vacate.he concluded that all of plaintiffs claims were arbitrable but did not rule on whether the award of arbitral expenses and attorney fees was proper.a formal order and a judgment were filed the same day.plaintiffs appeal from the judgment.
discussion 
because the relevant facts are not in dispute,we independently decide the issues raised on appeal.see reed mutual service th,d medical center shewry th,d.
plaintiffs present three arguments.first,the peremptory challenge was timely and duly filed,rendering the order to compel arbitration void.second,under armendariz,supra,cal th,d,the arbitration award had to be vacated because plaintiffs were found liable for expenses unique to arbitration,that is,expenses they would not have incurred if they had pursued their hate crimes claim in court.for simplicity,we will refer to such arbitral expenses as inappropriate.third,plaintiffs assert they did not have to pay attorney fees notwithstanding the attorney fees provision in the enrollment contract.
we conclude,first,that the ruling on a peremptory challenge may be reviewed only by way of a petition for a writ of mandate and not on appeal from a final judgment.plaintiffs challenged the ruling through such a petition,which we summarily denied.we therefore can not review again whether the order compelling arbitration was void.
on the second issue,we agree that armendariz prohibition of inappropriate arbitral expenses is fully applicable to plaintiffs hate crimes claim.
last,on the attorney fees issue,we conclude that the hate crimes laws prohibit an award of fees to a prevailing defendant.
with respect to relief,we conclude that the trial court,on remand,should take the necessary steps to ensure that plaintiffs do not pay any inappropriate arbitral expenses or any statutorily prohibited attorney task the trial court has yet to undertake.
peremptory challenge 
by statute,t he determination of the question of the disqualification of a judge is not an appealable order and may be reviewed only by a writ of mandate from the appropriate court of appeal sought only by the parties to the proceeding.the petition for the writ shall be filed and served within days after service of written notice of entry of the court order determining the question of disqualification.code civ,subd.d.this law governs the ruling on a peremptory challenge.see people hull cal th,d,guedalia superior court d.curle superior court cal th,d.a timely writ petition is the exclusive avenue for appellate court review whether the judge disqualification is sought for cause per ccp or by peremptory challenge per ccp the ruling is neither directly appealable nor reviewable on appeal from the subsequent final judgment.eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group,italics omitted.
plaintiffs attacked judge person ruling on the peremptory challenge by filing a writ petition in this court,which we summarily denied.on this appeal from the judgment,we can not revisit whether the judge should have disqualified himself before granting the petition to compel arbitration.see guedalia superior court,supra,d at.his ruling stands as valid.id.at fn.
enforcement of the arbitration award 
in armendariz,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court held that an arbitration conducted pursuant to a mandatory employment arbitration agreement must satisfy certain minimal criteria if the employee alleges the violation of an unwaivable statutory right.in armendariz,the employees alleged a statutory cause of action for discrimination under the fair employment and housing act feha,et and three common law claims for wrongful termination based on tort and contract theories of recovery.armendariz,at,d.the employees claims were covered by an arbitration agreement imposed as a condition of employment.
as armendariz explained c ertain statutory rights can be waived but arbitration agreements that encompass unwaivable statutory rights must be subject to particular scrutiny.this unwaivability derives from two statutes that are themselves derived from public policy.first,civil code section states all contracts which have for their object,directly or indirectly,to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another,or violation of law,whether willful or negligent,are against the policy of the law.agreements whose object,directly or indirectly,is to exempt their parties from violation of the law are against public policy and may not be enforced.second,civil code section states,anyone may waive the advantage of a law intended solely for his benefit.but a law established for a public reason can not be contravened by a private agreement.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,citations omitted,original italics.
after determining that the feha created unwaivable statutory rights,the high court concluded the arbitration agreement could not limit the feha remedies the arbitration proceeding had to permit adequate discovery the arbitrator had to provide a written award explaining the essential findings and conclusions supporting the award,followed by sufficient judicial review and the employer must shoulder the expenses of the arbitration that an employee would not have to bear if the dispute were tried in court.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.further,to the extent an arbitration agreement is silent as to these requirements,a court should find that the employer has impliedly agreed to them.id.at,d.
in explaining why the employer should pay the employee share of arbitral expenses,the court stated a rbitration is supposed to be a reasonable substitute for a judicial forum.therefore,it would undermine the legislature intent to prevent employees who are seeking to vindicate statutory rights from gaining access to a judicial forum and then require them to pay for the services of an arbitrator when they would never be required to pay for a judge in court.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.there is no doubt that parties appearing in court may be required to assume the cost of filing fees and other administrative expenses,so any reasonable costs of this sort that accompany arbitration are not problematic.however,if an employee is required to pay arbitrators fees ranging from to per day or more,in addition to administrative and attorney fees,is it likely that he will be able to pursue his statutory claims we think not.ibid.
the court continued w hen an employer imposes mandatory arbitration as a condition of employment,the arbitration agreement or arbitration process can not generally require the employee to bear any type of expense that the employee would not be required to bear if he or she were free to bring the action in court.this rule will ensure that employees bringing unwaivable statutory claims will not be deterred by costs greater than the usual costs incurred during litigation armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,second italics added.it has been argued that although employees may have large arbitration costs,the cost of arbitration is generally smaller than litigation,so that the employee will realize a net benefit from arbitration.although it is true that the costs of arbitration are on average smaller than those of litigation,it is also true that the amount awarded is on average smaller as well the payment of large,fixed arbitration costs,especially in the face of expected meager awards,serves as a significant deterrent to the pursuit of unwaivable statutory claims.id.at,d,citation omitted,italics added.we therefore hold that a mandatory employment arbitration agreement that contains within its scope the arbitration of feha claims impliedly obliges the employer to pay all types of costs that are unique to arbitration.id.at,d,italics added.
little auto stiegler,cal th,d,little presented the question of whether the armendariz requirements should apply to a common law claim for wrongful termination of employment in violation of public policy.answering that question in the affirmative,the court explained a tameny claim tameny atlantic richfield cal d,is almost by definition unwaivable.the public policy exception to the at will employment rule must be based on policies carefully tethered to fundamental policies that are delineated in constitutional or statutory provisions moreover,the public policy that is the basis for such a claim must be public in that it affects society at large rather than the individual,must have been articulated at the time of discharge,and must be fundamental and substantial.thus,a legitimate tameny claim is designed to protect a public interest and therefore can not be contravened by a private agreement.b ecause an employer can not ask the employee to waive tameny claims,it also can not impose on the arbitration of these claims such burdens or procedural shortcomings as to preclude their vindication.thus,the armendariz requirements are as appropriate to the arbitration of tameny claims as to unwaivable statutory claims.little,at,d,citations omitted.
in a partial dissent in little,justice baxter disagreed.relying on an intervening decision by the united states supreme court green tree financial.randolph,d green tree,justice baxter,joined by justices chin and brown,went so far as to say i would overrule armendariz arbitrary cost allocation formula.in its place,i would adopt green tree principle that if a party resists mandatory contractual arbitration of a statutory claim on grounds of undue cost,he must make a timely,particularized showing of the expected expense,and must also demonstrate that,in his particular case,this cost would make arbitration prohibitively expensive as compared to court litigation.evidence on this issue could be presented to the court deciding a motion to compel arbitration.if the party opposing arbitration demonstrated prohibitive expense,the court could grant the motion to compel upon the condition that the proponent of arbitration accept,with the caveat discussed below,a more equitable allocation of costs.
i nterference with the arbitration contract cost provisions,express or implied by statute,should be countenanced only to the degree actually necessary to assure that mandatory resort to the arbitral forum has not deterred vindication of a statutory claim.for this reason,whatever reallocation of costs may be necessary to ensure that the claimant is not deterred in advance,this allocation should be tentative only,and should be subject to readjustment once the true expenses and rewards of the arbitral proceeding are known.little,supra,cal th at,d,conc.dis.opn.of baxter,italics added.
simply put,the dissent in little would have required trial courts to make a determination as to whether the arbitration proceeding would impose prohibitive expenses on the particular plaintiff,while armendariz categorically imposes costs unique to arbitration on employers when unwaivable rights pursuant to a mandatory employment arbitration agreement are at stake.little,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.under the categorical rule applied in armendariz the employer should pay the costs of a mandatory employment arbitration of statutory claims little,at,d,but the dissent in little would require a analysis based on such factors as the employee ability to pay the arbitration fees and the differential between projected arbitration and litigation fees ibid.
in the unanimous decision in boghos certain underwriters of lloyd of london cal th,d,boghos,neither armendariz nor little was of any assistance to the plaintiff.there,a disabled insured brought suit against his disability insurer,alleging that the company had improperly stopped paying benefits.the disability policy contained an arbitration clause requiring the costs of the arbitration to be equally split among the parties.boghos,at,d.the insurer moved to compel arbitration.the trial court denied the motion.the court of appeal affirmed,relying on armendariz and little for the proposition that the insured could not be required to pay any type of expense in arbitration that he would not incur in court.
the supreme court reversed,stating the insured asks us to extend the holdings of armendariz,supra,cal th,d,and little,supra,cal th,d,to insurance disputes and to declare the policy arbitration clause unenforceable because it requires him to share with the underwriters the costs of arbitration and the arbitrators fees.we find no merit in the request.even if the holdings in armendariz and little might conceivably be extended beyond the employment context to cover other types of unwaivable claims based on or tethered to statutes,the insured claims for nonpayment of benefits and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing can not properly be so described.his claim that the underwriters have failed to pay benefits under the policy is a claim for breach of contract,pure and simple.his claim that the underwriters have,by failing to pay,violated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing may properly be described either as a tort claim or as a special type of contract claim for which we allow tort damages i nsurance bad faith claims can not properly be described as tethered to a statute,in the sense that tameny claims subject to arbitration under little are necessarily based on policies carefully tethered to fundamental policies delineated in constitutional or statutory provisions while the business of insurance is sufficiently affected with a public interest to justify its regulation by the state,the fact of regulation does not suffice to demonstrate that any given claim entails an unwaivable statutory right,or that any given claim seeks to enforce a public policy articulated in a statute.
in any event,we have not extended the rule to common law claims generally.the rule is a judicially created exception to code of civil procedure section,which provides that the parties to an arbitration agreement do share costs u nless the arbitration agreement otherwise provides or the parties to the arbitration otherwise agree we justified our creation of the exception in armendariz,supra,cal th,d,by reasoning that section is a default provision,and the agreement to arbitrate a statutory claim,a feha claim is implicitly an agreement by the employer to abide by the substantive remedial provisions of the statute and to pay all types of cost that are unique to arbitration.the same reasoning fairly covers common law tameny claims,which must be carefully tethered to statutory or constitutional provisions,but not to common law claims generally.to extend armendariz to the arbitration of claims not carefully tethered to statutory or constitutional provisions would seem an arbitrary refusal to enforce section,a legislative act,and thus raise concerns about judicial policymaking boghos,supra,cal th at,d,citations fn.omitted.
in gutierrez autowest,th,d gutierrez,the court of appeal extended armendariz prohibition of inappropriate arbitral expenses to a dispute arising under a vehicle lease.there,the lessees sued a dealership under the consumers legal remedies act clra,et and the vehicle leasing act vla,et for failing to lease a vehicle at the advertised price.the dealership moved to compel arbitration based on an arbitration clause in the lease.the trial court denied the motion.
the court of appeal reversed and remanded.it recognized that the clra and the vla confer unwaivable statutory rights see gutierrez,supra,th at fns,d and that,under armendariz,supra,cal th,d,the lessees were entitled to protection from inappropriate arbitral expenses see gutierrez,at,d.nevertheless,the court concluded that armendariz categorical rule was not applicable and that a plaintiff ability to pay arbitral expenses in a consumer dispute should be determined on a basis.as the court noted,the governing rules of the american arbitration association aaa permit the arbitrator to allocate costs as appropriate.gutierrez,at,d.in addition,the california arbitration act contains provisions for consumer arbitrations that limit the arbitrator authority to impose inappropriate expenses on a plaintiff code civ,subds.a,b.see gutierrez,at fn,d.the court concluded that the aaa rules,together with the consumer provisions of the arbitration act,ensure that consumers will not be deterred from pursuing their statutory claims by the fear that the arbitrator will allocate unaffordable fees to them.gutierrez,at,d,italics added.
in independent of mailbox center owners,superior court th,d independent,the court of appeal extended armendariz prohibition of inappropriate arbitral expenses to a dispute arising under a franchise agreement.several franchisees of mail boxes,filed suit against their franchisor,alleging common law and statutory claims.the statutes included the franchise investment law,et,the cartwright act bus,et,the uniform trade secrets act,et,and the unfair competition law bus,et.as the court noted,these statutory claims affect the public interest and appear to fall all or in part within the rules of armendariz,supra,cal th,d,and boghos,supra,cal th,d.independent,at,d.emphasizing that the applicable arbitration rules aaa permitted the arbitrator to apportion arbitral expenses as he or she found appropriate,the court adopted a analysis to determine the amount of arbitral expenses a plaintiff should pay.see independent,supra,th at,d.
we now turn to the statutory claim here to decide whether it is subject to armendariz prohibition of inappropriate arbitral expenses and,if so,whether the categorical rule or a analysis should apply in implementing that prohibition.

every year,thousands of americans are victims of hate crimes.each one of these crimes has a ripple effect in our communities.the pain and injustice of such crimes tear at the fabric of our democratic society,creating fear and tensions that ultimately affect us all.schools are not immune from such intolerance and violence.teenagers and young adults account for a significant proportion of the country hate as perpetrators and as victims.behavior,whether in the form of ethnic conflict,harassment,intimidation,or graffiti,is often apparent on school grounds.of education,office of elementary and secondary education safe and schools program,preventing youth hate crime as of.

the legislative history of the hate crimes laws shows they were enacted for a public reason.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
according to one court the history of civil code section indicates the legislation was referred to as the ralph civil rights act and enacted in as part of assembly bill reg.sess.an assembly committee report stated that while there were numerous state and federal laws providing for full and equal civil rights protections in employment,housing,and access to public accommodations and facilities,there was no specific prohibition protecting individuals from violence because of their race,religion,color,ancestry,or national origin.the report continues,although it is impossible to estimate the instances of violence against persons in california because of race,color,religion or other factors,there have been enough occurrences such as the one in taft,california last year where black college students were threatened with violence and chased out of town to signify a possible need for greater protection of this fundamental right this measure declares that all persons have a right to be free from violence or threat of violence committed against their persons or property because of race,color,religion,ancestry,national origin,political affiliation,or position in a labor dispute.
the second statute on which the plaintiff complaint was based,civil code section,was enacted a decade later as part of assembly bill reg.sess.and is known as the tom bane civil rights act.it was intended to supplement the ralph civil rights act as an additional legislative effort to deter violence the stated purpose of the bill was to fill in the gaps left by the ralph act by allowing an individual to seek relief to prevent the violence from occurring before it was committed and providing for the filing of criminal charges 
the assembly committee on public safety reported,the attorney general office states that the number of crimes which are committed because of the victim racial,ethnic,religious,or other minority status are increasing,that members of minority groups increasingly believe they are threatened by attack or harassment,and that existing law is inadequate to protect them.they also stated that existing civil rights statutes do little to deter hate violence because there are no criminal penalties the purpose of this bill is to give law enforcement officials clear effective authority to prevent acts of hate violence,and to deter such conduct by establishing serious criminal penalties and by a llow ing an individual,or the attorney general,district attorney,or city attorney,to bring an action to enjoin crimes of hate violence where they are threatened.
the legislative history reveals that the broad and plain language of civil code sections and was chosen to provide protection from discriminatory violence and intimidation,and from threats,intimidation and coercion that denied the civil rights of others.the creation of civil causes of action by victims of such conduct was at the heart of the legislation.stamps superior court th,d,citations omitted,italics added.
as explained by justice baxter in venegas county of los angeles cal th,d,the legislative history of civil code section clearly reflects that it was originally enacted to stem a tide of hate crimes.nearly every court which has construed this statute has recognized that in light of its original combat hate violation of civil code section requires a showing that the defendant acted with discriminatory animus,an intent to interfere by threats,intimidation,or coercion,subd.a with the victim exercise or enjoyment of his or her constitutional or statutory rights,based on the victim actual or perceived racial,ethnic,religious,or sexual orientation or other minority status 
civil code s ection,commonly referred to as the tom bane civil rights act or the bane act,was enacted in as part of a renewed effort to combat the disturbing rise in hate crimes,or,put otherwise,the rising incidence of civil rights violations motivated by hatred and discrimination.this purpose of the legislation is undeniably evidenced by both its legislative history and the case law interpreting it,including several decisions of this court.
the legislature focused effort to combat discriminatory and pernicious conduct often referred to as hate crimes began with the enactment of civil code section,commonly referred to as the ralph civil rights act or the ralph act.the obvious purpose of the ralph act is to declare unlawful,and civilly actionable,any acts of violence or intimidation by threats of violence directed against any individual because of his actual or perceived membership in a minority or similarly protected class.
in this same vein,years later,the legislature enacted the bane act,to further address the rising tide of hate crimes in california 
the central provisions of the bane act have not been substantively changed since its enactment nearly years ago 
from its inception,the bane act purpose has been to specifically target unlawful conduct motivated by discriminatory animus that interferes with the victim enjoyment of statutory or constitutional civil rights t he key issue in the enactment of the bane act was whether there should be additional civil and criminal penalties for crimes which are committed because of the victim racial,ethnic,religious,sexual orientation or other minority status 
the senate report explained that under the then current law,the ralph act,quoted above,hate crimes perpetrated through acts of violence or threats of violence were subject to considerably expanded civil penalties however,due to the inadequacy of that law and the rise in hate crimes,the stated purpose of the bane act was to subject the use of force or threats to interfere with the free exercise of one constitutional rights,based on the victim membership or perceived membership in one of the enumerated protected classes,to both civil and criminal remedies.in other words,what the bane act did at its inception was to add threats,intimidation or coercion to the already proscribed violence,or threats of violence sanctioned under the ralph act,where any such conduct interferes with or attempts to interfere with the statutory and constitutional rights of persons in minority or similarly protected classes,or who were perceived by the defendant to be members of such protected classes.venegas county of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d,conc.opn.of baxter,citations,fn.italics omitted.
thus,california hate crimes law s clearly establish that crimes motivated by bigotry and bias are against the public policy of the state.webb puget sound broadcasting,lab.cas.cch,wl.lexis.d epending on the circumstances,insults or harassment directed to individuals on the basis of historically disfavored personal characteristics more readily transgress contemporary social bounds than do other forms of antagonistic behavior.williams met.to be specific,p roviding a safe and environment for students obviously serves the public interest in addition,fostering tolerance and thereby decreasing hate crimes among students is in the public interest.doe perry community school dist.d,citation omitted.
in upholding a state hate crimes law against a free speech challenge under the first amendment,amend,the united states supreme court explained t he wisconsin statute singles out for enhancement conduct because this conduct is thought to inflict greater individual and societal harm.for example,according to the state and its amici,crimes are more likely to provoke retaliatory crimes,inflict distinct emotional harms on their victims,and incite community unrest the state desire to redress these perceived harms provides an adequate explanation for its provision over and above mere disagreement with offenders beliefs or biases.as blackstone said long ago,it is but reasonable that among crimes of different natures those should be most severely punished,which are the most destructive of the public safety and happiness.wisconsin mitchell,d,quoting blackstone,commentaries,italics added,citations omitted.
in short,t here is no question that the statutory rights established by the ralph civil rights act and the tom bane civil rights act are for a public reason.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.thus,the hate crimes laws constitute unwaivable statutory rights.
categorical rule or analysis 
armendariz adopted a categorical rule for arbitral expenses,holding that an employer must pay any type of expense unique to arbitration if the plaintiff seeks to vindicate an unwaivable statutory right.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.the underlying rationale for the categorical rule is to ensure that the cost of arbitration does not deter a plaintiff from bringing a claim.id.at,d.to be sure,it would be ideal to devise a method by which the employee is put in exactly the same position in arbitration,costwise,as he or she would be in litigation.but the factors going into that calculus refuse to admit ready quantification.turning a motion to compel arbitration into a on the comparative costs and benefits of arbitration and litigation for a particular employee would not only be burdensome on the trial court and the parties,but would likely yield speculative answers.nor would there be an advantage to apportioning arbitration costs at the conclusion of the arbitration rather than at the outset.without clearly articulated guidelines,such a postarbitration apportionment would create a sense of risk and uncertainty among employees that could discourage the arbitration of meritorious claims.ibid.
in armendariz,supra,cal th,d,the court analysis of the requisite safeguards in arbitration,including the prohibition of inappropriate arbitral expenses,was grounded on the nature of the cause of unwaivable statutory right.see id.at,d.
in little,supra,cal th,d,the court discussed the armendariz requirements,stating one ground for refusing to enforce a contractual term is that it would force a party to forgo unwaivable public rights w hile we recognize that a party compelled to arbitrate such rights does not waive them,but merely submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than a judicial,forum,arbitration can not be misused to accomplish a de facto waiver of these rights.accordingly,although the armendariz requirements specifically concern arbitration agreements,they do not do so out of a generalized mistrust of arbitration per se,but from a recognition that some arbitration agreements and proceedings may harbor terms,conditions and practices that undermine the vindication of unwaivable rights.the armendariz requirements are therefore applications of general state law contract principles regarding the unwaivability of public rights to the unique context of arbitration t here is no reason under armendariz logic to distinguish between unwaivable statutory rights and unwaivable rights derived from common law.little,at,d,citations omitted,original italics.
and in boghos,supra,cal th,d,where the court declined to extend the armendariz requirements to an arbitration between a disabled plaintiff and his disability insurer,the court emphasized that the plaintiff had asserted common law claims as opposed to a claim based on an unwaivable statutory right or a claim tethered to a statutory or constitutional provision.boghos,at,d.again,the nature of the cause of action determined whether armendariz applied.boghos,at,d.
the trilogy recognizes that certain statutory rights or fundamental rights delineated in constitutional or statutory so important in our society that their enforcement should not be chilled by the threat of expenses unique to arbitration.under armendariz,supra,cal th,d,all employees are treated the purposes of arbitral expenses because discrimination in employment is an anathema that should not be tolerated as a matter of public policy.similarly,under little,supra,cal th,d,a common for wrongful termination of employment,which is based on a fundamental public policy tethered to a statute or constitutional provision,must be arbitrated without imposing costs that would not be incurred in court.and boghos held that armendariz does not apply to a dispute of private insured contention that his insurer wrongfully discontinued his benefits.
in the present case,the public nature of plaintiffs statutory rights is legally indistinguishable from the rights discussed in armendariz and little,and plaintiffs rights should be equally protected.
the feha,at issue in armendariz,provides a remedy for adverse employment actions taken for an improper reason an employee or applicant race,religious creed,color,national origin,ancestry,physical disability,mental disability,medical condition,marital status,sex,age,or sexual orientation,subd.a.the ralph civil rights act provides a remedy for violence and threats of violence made for virtually the same reasons.see,subd.a,subds.b,e.the legislative history of the ralph civil rights act and the feha illustrates the similarity of the two statutory schemes a central feature of the ralph civil rights act was to afford an individual the opportunity to file immediately a private civil action at the same time he or she pursued a complaint with the fair employment practices commission fepc now the fair employment and housing commission previously,a person filing a complaint with the fepc would have been precluded from concurrently initiating a private civil action on the same matter.by amendment,the legislature allowed for both a private civil remedy and the enforcement mechanisms of the fepc.stamps superior court,supra,th at,d,citation omitted,italics added see,subds.e,f.indeed,a cause of action under the ralph civil rights act may arise in the employment setting.see,stamps,at,d burnette godshall,affd.sub nom.burnette lockheed missiles space cir diem city and county of san francisco.
little extended armendariz to employees who are terminated in violation of fundamental public policies that are delineated in constitutional or statutory provisions.little,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.similarly,the tom bane civil rights act provides a remedy where a person receives threats that interfere with the rights secured by the constitution or laws of this state or of the united states,subd.a.the bane act,too,applies to threats in the workplace.see stamps superior court,supra,th at,d.
claims under the hate crimes laws should not be discouraged by the possibility that an alleged victim will incur arbitral expenses beyond the costs payable in court.a analysis would simply lead to a on the comparative costs and benefits of arbitration and litigation for a particular plaintiff and would not only be burdensome on the trial court and the parties,but would likely yield speculative answers that would deter the bringing of hate crimes claims.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,we adopt armendariz categorical rule in this action because a student and his parents filed suit against a school,seeking remedies under the california hate crimes laws,neither the student nor his parents may be required to pay any type of arbitral expense that would not be imposed were the dispute adjudicated in court.
we acknowledge that gutierrez,supra,th,d,and independent,supra,th,d,adopted a analysis in imposing arbitral expenses.in gutierrez,however,the applicable arbitration rules aaa and the provisions of the arbitration act code civ,subds.a,b ensure d that consumers will not be deterred from pursuing their statutory claims by the fear that the arbitrator will allocate unaffordable fees to them.gutierrez,at,d.similarly,in independent,the arbitration rules aaa did not allow the arbitrator to impose inappropriate arbitral expenses on the plaintiffs.independent,at,d.
in this action,the applicable arbitration rules jams require the arbitrator to impose arbitration fees and costs on the parties on a pro rata basis.the enrollment contract states that the prevailing party shall be awarded attorney fees.the arbitration act code civ,does not address or limit the imposition of expenses in a hate crimes dispute.thus,the arbitration rules and the arbitration act fail to ensure that hate crimes plaintiffs will not be deterred from pursuing their statutory claims.gutierrez,supra,th at,d.further,unlike gutierrez and independent,this case involves death threats motivated by a statutorily protected personal characteristic it is not a vehicle leasing transaction or a business arrangement gone awry.consequently,a claim under the hate crimes laws should not be subject to a analysis.
we necessarily reject the school argument that armendariz prohibition of inappropriate arbitral expenses is limited to mandatory employment imposed as a condition of employment.see boghos,supra,cal th at,d,assuming,without deciding,that the holdings in armendariz and little might conceivably be extended beyond the employment context to cover other types of unwaivable claims based on statutes gutierrez,supra,th at,d supreme court has not decided whether armendariz categorical rule applies to arbitration of consumer claims.like the feha claim in armendariz,plaintiffs hate crimes claim the words of the trial to a mandatory arbitration provision that requires arbitration of any legal controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the enrollment contract.italics added.here,arbitration was imposed as a condition of enrolling in 
both gutierrez,supra,th,d,and independent,supra,th,d,extended armendariz prohibition of inappropriate arbitral expenses beyond the employment vehicle leases and store franchise agreements,respectively.california hate crimes laws deserve nothing less.
as division seven of this district observed w e see no reason why armendariz particular scrutiny of arbitration agreements should be confined to claims under feha.rather,under the supreme court analysis,such scrutiny should apply to the enforcement of rights under any statute enacted for a public reason.mercuro superior court th,d,italics added.armendariz itself suggests its minimum requirements for arbitration of statutory claims apply to claims under the consumer legal remedies act,et.mercuro,at,fn,d see kristian comcast cir,arbitration agreement must permit plaintiffs to vindicate statutory rights under federal and state antitrust laws whitney alltel communications,contractual provision requiring arbitration of dispute between customer and telephone service provider was unenforceable because it prevented customer from vindicating rights under missouri merchandising practices act.et.
attorney fees 
although we have been discussing arbitral expenses up to this point,a similar analysis applies to the provision in the enrollment contract stating that the prevailing party in any arbitration or litigation shall be allowed all reasonable attorneys fees.yet,an agreement to arbitrate a statutory claim implicitly incorporates the substantive and remedial provisions of the statute so that parties to the arbitration would be able to vindicate their statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.obviously,the law can not be read as holding that an arbitration agreement is enforceable no matter what rights it waives or what burdens it imposes such a holding would be fundamentally at odds with our understanding of the rights accorded to persons protected by public statutes id.at,d.
the ralph civil rights act and the tom bane civil rights act expressly provide that a court may award attorney fees only to the plaintiff.neither act permits an award of attorney fees to a defendant,even if it prevails.see,subd.b w hoever denies the right provided by the ralph civil rights act is liable for a ttorney fees as may be determined by the court,subd.h under tom bane civil rights act,the court may award the petitioner or plaintiff reasonable attorney fees.thus,the attorney fees provisions in the hate crimes laws are deemed to be a part of the enrollment contract see armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,and trump the contract conflicting prevailing party provision see graham oil arco products cir,remedy provisions of statutes prevail over conflicting provisions of arbitration agreement,cited with approval in armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,mccaskill sci management cir,conc.opn.of rovner,same.
further,the legislature knows how to draft a statute to authorize an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party the plaintiff or the it so desires.for instance,under the feha,the party that prevails is entitled to attorney fees in the discretion of the trial court.see,subd.b.although the attorney fees provision in the feha does not distinguish between prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants,the courts treat them differently by routinely awarding fees to a prevailing plaintiff but denying fees to a prevailing defendant unless the plaintiff claim is unreasonable,frivolous,meritless,or vexatious.mangano verity,th,d.this standard discourages frivolous suits while providing adequate support and incentive for meritorious actions.id.at,d.a routine allowance of attorney fees to successful defendants in civil rights suits might effectively discourage suits in all but the clearest cases,and inhibit earnest advocacy on undecided issues.united states steel united states cir.
t he availability of costs and attorneys fees to prevailing plaintiffs is integral to making the hate crimes laws an effective piece of legislation,increasing the financial feasibility of bringing suits under the statute.broughton cigna healthplans cal th,d.as explained by one court in an analogous context the cartwright act bus,et contains a attorney fees provision that allows an award of attorney fees to a prevailing plaintiff but not to a prevailing defendant such nonreciprocal fee provisions are created by legislators as a deliberate stratagem for advancing some public purpose,usually by encouraging more effective enforcement of some important public policy.the public policy implicit in the provision is to encourage injured parties to broadly and effectively enforce the cartwright act in situations where they otherwise would not find it economical to sue.the legislature clearly intended to give special treatment to antitrust claims under the cartwright act by creating this right for a successful plaintiff but not for a defendant who successfully defends such a claim.carver chevron,th,d,citations omitted mccaskill sci management,supra,at conc.opn.of rovner,statutory attorney fees provision favoring plaintiff advances enforcement and remedial effect of antidiscrimination law.
the possibility of an award of attorney fees against the plaintiff in a hate crimes case would discourage such litigation.by analogy,armendariz condemned the imposition of inappropriate arbitral expenses because they would deter the pursuit of unwaivable statutory rights.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
the attorney fees provisions in the hate crimes laws serve a public purpose to increase the financial feasibility of bringing suits under those laws.broughton cigna healthplans,supra,cal th at,d,carver chevron,supra,th at,d.thus,the provisions are unwaivable statutory rights see armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,and render the award of attorney fees in this case invalid to the same extent as an award of inappropriate arbitral expenses.
relief on remand 
this case is distinguishable from armendariz on procedural grounds.armendariz was decided on appeal from the denial of a petition to compel arbitration.the arbitration proceedings had no
