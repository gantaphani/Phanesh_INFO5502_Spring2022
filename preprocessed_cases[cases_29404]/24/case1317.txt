appellants appeal from a judgment based on,inter alia,a determination that they were judicially estopped from denying that they are bound by a settlement agreement.we hold that even if the settlement agreement had not been binding,appellants were judicially estopped from denying the enforceability of that agreement because they represented to the trial court that the case had settled and the trial court discharged the jury in reliance on that representation.

the trial of the case commenced in march of,presided over by los angeles county superior court judge lee edmon.during jury selection,each lead counsel gave a mini opening statement to the jury panel.after the jury was selected,judge edmon suspended the trial for scheduling reasons and ordered the parties and the jury to report back on april.during the break,the parties engaged in a mediation with the mediator anthony piazza.gelbard,who was in bankruptcy,and ecp did not participate,but their counsel,christopher dieterich,indicated they would enter into a settlement so long as they did not have to pay money and received full general releases.those present at the mediation were hugh and barbara cassidy and their counsel,brian sun,who also represented the absent daniel cassidy,and straw and his counsel.the parties to the mediation reached a settlement and executed a handwritten settlement agreement.the document was signed by straw,for himself and for blix street records,hugh cassidy,barbara cassidy,and sun for daniel cassidy.the approved as to form spaces on the document were signed by blix street counsel and sun for the cassidys.
the settlement agreement provided,although subject to more formal documentation,including the preparation and filing of a dismissal of the entire action with prejudice,this is a final binding agreement subject to judicial enforcement pursuant to ccp.the settlement agreement extended the licensing agreement and provided for,inter alia,minimum royalties over a period of years,a means to determine the amount of royalties,a business plan,cooperation concerning the motion picture,and releases.the agreement specifically stated that,the parties hereby release all claims of any type or nature from inception through today,including rights as to gelbard,engel a former attorney for some of the parties and eva cassidy partners,llc gelbard and ecp to be releasors under the more formal agreement documents and that blix street first payment to the cassidys shall occur upon delivery to blix counsel of a full,executed dismissal of the entire action with prejudice and any order necessary from the bankruptcy court and trustee.
at the time of the execution of the settlement agreement,straw believed that there were no additional terms that needed to be negotiated.on march,blix street counsel sent an to judge edmon that stated,judge edmon the parties reached a settlement at the mediation on friday,march,and signed a document that can be enforced pursuant to ccp section.we need to get a signature from the eva cassidy partnership dieterich client which should not be that difficult.there are issues relating to the release of claims against gelbard given his bankruptcy that we need to navigate,but the case has settled.
during the week of march,straw,an attorney who had negotiated entertainment contracts,began to have concerns about the agreement and what he considered the negative effect it could have on his business.he believed it was in favor of the cassidys and decided to take the position that material terms were missing from the settlement agreement and that some existing terms were ambiguous.he testified,that i started thinking about those things.and,if those things were worked out,then i really had agreed to anything.thus,from his perspective,the litigation was not concluded.he said he wanted to try to get out from under the settlement agreement.he added that it was the worst agreement i ever seen it did contain,even the material terms necessary to settlement sic the issues that caused the litigation in the first place they was just missing.no mention.he testified at some length as to the various areas that were not covered by the settlement agreement.he said he did not,however,withdraw from the deal because he was very hopeful that he could resolve all issues in the long form agreement negotiations.
the parties returned to court on april.blix street attorneys had not communicated to the cassidys attorneys that there was any problem with the settlement agreement,even though straw believed that an enforceable agreement had not been reached.blix street lead counsel,bert deixler,and the cassidys lead counsel,sun,as well as his,frederick feldman,were present in court.straw was also present,as was gelbard and his counsel,dieterich.in chambers,sun recalled that he or deixler informed judge edmon that the parties had resolved the case at the mediation and that there were a few things to do,but that we all felt that the judge could dismiss the jury.another lawyer who was in chambers at that time testified that sun may have mentioned there was a bankruptcy issue as to gelbard.but no one,including straw,suggested the settlement agreement was not enforceable,even though straw had considered telling his counsel to inform the judge that there was no settlement.
straw testified that sun stated in the meeting that gelbard was threatening not to sign a settlement agreement unless he received money and that he might sue blix street for malicious prosecution.straw,although stunned,did not state there was no settlement.
after the meeting,judge edmon took the bench and called for the jury.she informed the jury as follows good morning to everybody.i have some news for all of you.since the last time we were together,the case has settled i ca overemphasize what an important role all of you played in that.some cases just ca settle until they get right up to trial.and it was seeing all of you and actually getting started that got this case to settle.
after some further comments to the jurors,judge edmon dismissed them.neither straw nor deixler informed judge edmon prior to the dismissal of the jury that straw believed the settlement agreement was not enforceable.then the following colloquy took place the court deixler here,you plaintiff counsel.the representation has been made to me in our conversation off the record that this matter is settled.and i just want to hear from all the parties with respect to that issue.deixler yes,your honor.the matter,subject to having the long form agreement being prepared and obtaining the approval of the bankruptcy court with regard to the gelbard piece and the eva cassidy partners piece,the case is settled,subject to those two provisions,which we expect will be resolved in the next days.sun the short form agreement,the parties agree that they going to try to put as quickly as possible.the long form we can get that part of it consummated as well.and weeks already said there is something in the short form agreement about coordinating with the bankruptcy court certain aspects regarding gelbard status of the case.but the parties have reached a settlement,and we think it enforceable under the and we have to get the rest of it done.dieterich,counsel for gelbard,stated he agreed.after scheduling an order to show cause re dismissal after settlement,judge edmon concluded by saying to the parties good luck with it,presumably referring to the steps necessary to finalize the settlement.
on april,a new attorney for blix street wrote to counsel for the cassidys,stating bill straw and blix street have retained the undersigned to act as transactional attorney in the negotiation of a settlement agreement regarding the above referenced cause.we have advised our client,based upon the writings so far presented to us for review,that it is our opinion that the parties purported settlement agreement is neither binding nor enforceable for several reasons,including by way of example and not by way of limitation,i the omission of at least one necessary party to wit defendant gelbard as a signatory to the document and ii the ambiguities of a substantive nature therein.on april,new litigation counsel for blix street reiterated that the settlement agreement was neither binding nor enforceable because gelbard did not sign the agreement and because there was no meeting of the minds on many material terms.
blix street opposed the cassidys motion to approve the settlement in the bankruptcy court.at the may hearing in that court,gelbard personally advised the court that he had signed the settlement agreement and considered the case settled.the bankruptcy court denied the cassidys motion without prejudice,finding,this is a settlement of this trial in the state court,and you either got a deal that going to settle the whole trial or you do,and i think that i should step aside and allow the state court judge to make a determination then you should come back here to approve it i kind of think the judge in superior court is going to be a little ticked if you do go and present a settlement agreement in a trial that you got sitting there.the court added,you know,again,if everybody to a settlement comes in and says,we thrilled.here the settlement agreement,you be amazed how fast i sign the order.
in june,the cassidys successfully moved the trial court for entry of judgment based on the settlement agreement pursuant to california code of civil procedure section section.the court stated in the judgment,in a declaration submitted to the court,daniel cassidy expressly agreed to the terms of the settlement agreement and affirmed the authority of his counsel to sign on his behalf.subsequently,gelbard and ecp and their counsel signed the settlement agreement.
on appeal from that judgment,we held that the settlement agreement could not be enforced under section because it lacked necessary signatures or an oral stipulation before the court,which formalities explicitly are required by that provision.we noted that our ruling did not preclude enforcement of the agreement by means other than section 
following remand to the trial court,the cassidys filed a third amended alleging,inter alia,breach of the settlement contract.the trial court bifurcated the trial and,in a bench trial,tried the settlement contract cause of action.the trial court held in favor of the cassidys,finding that even though the settlement agreement did not constitute an enforceable contract,blix street was judicially estopped from denying the enforceability of the settlement agreement.the trial court observed that straw,an experienced attorney,and blix street attorney represented to judge edmon that the settlement agreement was enforceable at a time they knew all of the facts that they later contended made the agreement unenforceable.in reliance on those representations,judge edmon discharged the jury that had been selected after two days of jury selection and abbreviated opening statements,and vacated the trial date.thus,according to the trial court,even if the settlement agreement was not otherwise enforceable,blix street was estopped from denying its enforceability.
the trial court entered a judgment in favor of the cassidys and ordered blix street records,and straw to comply with their obligations under the settlement agreement.blix street records,and straw timely filed a notice of appeal.
