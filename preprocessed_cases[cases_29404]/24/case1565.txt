plaintiff david furia,doing business as furia construction company appeals from an adverse judgment entered after the court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer of defendant hugh helm iii to furia second amended complaint.the amended complaint alleged causes of action for legal malpractice and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment,arising out of an agreement by helm,an attorney representing furia construction clients,to attempt to mediate differences between furia and his clients.although we have some misgivings about the manner in which helm accepted dual responsibilities,we agree with the trial court that furia has failed to allege facts entitling him to relief and we therefore affirm.
background 
furia was a licensed general contractor who,in,was hired by laurie and larry levin the levins to remodel their windsor home.disputes arose after work had commenced,and the levins went to their attorney,helm,for advice.following some discussions,helm agreed to attempt to help resolve the differences.although furia characterized the role helm agreed to play somewhat differently in each of his three complaints,furia attached as an exhibit to each of the complaints a copy of helm letter of november,sent to both the levins and furia to confirm their understanding.because much of the argument turns upon a characterization of what helm agreed to do,we set forth that letter in full 
i am writing to set forth our understanding regarding my role in this matter,and assure all of you that i intend to use my best efforts to resolve your differences efficiently,in a manner that honors each of your concerns.thank you in advance for the opportunity to assist in constructively dealing with this situation before matters become intractable.
as we discussed,i represent laurie and larry in this matter.however,in an effort to cost effectively come to terms,i will initially meet with dave and his superintendents at his office to review the plans and listen to their concerns.laurie has asked that my fees for this meeting be paid by david,and david has agreed.my usual hourly rate is plus out of pocket expenses.
after that,all of us will meet and attempt to devise a plan for the timely completion of the project by november,and reach an understanding regarding responsibility for expenses that have been incurred.because david has asked that i attempt to fairly mediate your differences rather than advocate for laurie and larry,and i have said i am willing to try,laurie has asked at this meeting that the parties equally divide my fees for these meetings and related follow ups.please advise if this is agreeable by all concerned.
after having spoken with all of you,i am confident that this approach will succeed,but from an abundance of caution i must state for the record,so there is no misunderstanding,that if an agreement is not reached,and an adversarial posture is taken by either party,that my loyalty lay with laurie and larry,and i may assume their representation in subsequent proceedings.
on the other hand,with that disclosure in mind,please be assured that as long that we all continue to agree to work cooperatively,that i will do my very best to listen to all sides equally,and offer ideas and a perspective that respects the needs and interests of all concerned.all of you have told me that you want to be,and will be,fair and flexible,and do the right thing.my hope is that we can build on that attitude,and bring this matter to a conclusion satisfactory to each of you.
thank you again for the opportunity to assist,and if you have any questions or wish to discuss anything,do not hesitate to call.by the time you receive this,a meeting with dave will be scheduled and we will be on our way.
unbeknownst to furia,helm at the same time sent the levins a second letter also incorporated in each of the complaints,which reads as follows 
enclosed is the letter i have sent to you and dave regarding our arrangements.i believe it makes adequately clear to dave that i represent you and that i am not going to be truly neutral during our efforts to negotiate an agreement.so,please feel free to contact me to discuss anything,and be assured that i will not disclose any communications between us that are expected to be confidential.as the joint letter indicates,my ordinary rates are plus out of pocket expenses.i will send itemized bills to you monthly,for services,which we agree are your exclusive responsibility,and send a separately prepared bill that will go to dave for payment or partial payment.this approach will avoid dave knowing what i may be doing on your behalf.if you have any questions,please do not hesitate to call anytime.
in his original complaint,furia alleged that the levins retained helm to act as their attorney,and that helm had agreed to discontinue his advocacy on behalf of the levins and had represented and agreed to use his best efforts to fairly mediate and resolve the differences existing between furia and the levins.he further alleged that helm had secretly agreed with the levins that he would not be truly neutral,that he breached his professional and ethical obligations in failing to disclose to furia that he was continuing to act as an advocate for the levins in the mediation,and that i n rendering the mediation services helm failed to exercise reasonable care and skill and negligently advised,encouraged and persuaded furia to abandon the project and assured furia that abandonment of the project was the best course of action to resolve the dispute between furia and the levins.in reliance on this advice,the complaint alleged that furia withdrew from the project,which intensified the dispute and provided the levins with a strategic advantage.following plaintiff withdrawal from the project,the levins initiated civil and administrative proceedings against furia for the alleged wrongful abandonment of the project requiring furia to retain attorneys and expend money to defend himself from such claims.
following the trial court order sustaining general and special demurrers to this complaint,furia filed a first amended complaint.in this pleading,furia deleted the allegation that the levins had retained helm as their attorney and alleged that furia and the levins jointly retained defendant helm to act as a mediator and to advise both parties with respect to settlement.defendant helm orally and in writing agreed that he would fairly mediate the parties differences rather than advocate for the levins and would listen to all sides equally and offer ideas and a perspective that would honor and respect the needs,concerns and interests of both parties.the first amended complaint added the allegation that on november helm billed furia for professional services for his november meeting with furia.like the original complaint,the amended pleading alleged helm failure to disclose that he was not truly neutral,that furia had relied on helm advice to withdraw from the project,and that he was damaged in the manner described in the original complaint.the trial court again sustained helm general demurrer,with leave to amend,explaining that the cause of action for legal malpractice failed to allege sufficient cognizable facts showing that there was actually any relationship as between furia and helm,and that the cause of action for misrepresentation failed to plead with particularity,all of the essential elements of fraud,to wit,damages.
in his second amended complaint,furia characterized the arrangement with helm as follows furia retained and employed defendant helm to provide legal advice and services to furia helm agreed to meet with f uria and to provide furia with legal advice on how to resolve the dispute with the levins.the allegations that helm concealed he was secretly acting as an advocate for the levins and would not be truly neutral,that furia withdrew from the project in reliance on helm advice,and that he consequently suffered unspecified damages remained essentially the same as in the prior pleadings.this time,the court sustained helm general demurrer without leave to amend,explaining that e ven though furia now alleges that helm actually was the attorney for furia,this new allegation is both inconsistent and contradictory with furia earlier pleadings and therefore was properly disregarded.as to the misrepresentation cause of action,the court explained for the third time furia does not sufficiently plead the element of damages.furia simply asserts that he was required to expend money to defend himself when the levins turned around and sued him after he followed helm advice furia states that damages are in an amount according to proof.furia needs to plead an amount of damages.
in support of helm several demurrers,and without objection,helm requested the trial court to take judicial notice of documents filed in the levins suit against furia and in the disciplinary proceedings before the contractors state license board to which reference was made in furia complaints.the levins complaint against furia and many of his subcontractors asserted several causes of action based on numerous alleged construction deficiencies,but the complaint contained no allegation that furia had abandoned the project.the filed by furia in the levins action alleged,among other things,that the levins had retained another contractor finley to complete the remodeling project and that in november,furia confirmed that levin choose sic another contractor finley to complete the remodeling project although furia offered to return and complete the project upon payment of monies due and owing from levin.the decision of the contractors state license board,following a hearing before an administrative law judge on the levins complaint to the board,found that furia had performed in a substantially incompetent manner in both the administration of the project and in failing to meet trade standards for the work performed,specifying a lengthy list of construction deficiencies on the job.the board revoked furia license and ordered him to pay in restitution to the levins as a condition to the reinstatement of his license.however,after reciting the murky circumstances surrounding the attempts to resolve the controversy,including the efforts of helm to mediate the dispute,the board found that it had not been proven that furia abandoned the project.
upon sustaining helm demurrer to the second amended complaint without leave to amend,the court entered judgment in helm favor,from which furia has timely appealed.
discussion 
the cause of action for legal malpractice does not fail for lack of an relationship.
in sustaining helm demurrer to the first cause of action,the trial court appears to have reasoned that helm could not be liable for legal malpractice in the absence of an relationship,and that furia was bound by the allegations in his original complaint that helm was not his attorney.we do not believe that the sufficiency of the cause of action can be dismissed so easily.
despite furia attempts in his later pleadings to assert that helm agreed to provide him with legal advice,we agree with the trial court that from furia original complaint and from the november,letter to both furia and the levins,which is incorporated in all of the pleadings,it is established that helm did not undertake to act as furia attorney or to provide him legal counsel.colapinto county of riverside d.court may disregard allegations inconsistent with original complaint witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading.that letter plainly disclosed that helm was the levins attorney,and furia original complaint alleged that helm was the attorney not for himself but for the levins.indeed,in his briefing to this court,furia states,to be clear,it is not alleged that helm was the attorney for furia.furia appellate brief continues,somewhat inconsistently,with the assertion that he has consistently alleged that a contractual relationship existed between he sic and helm whereby helm agreed to provide legal advice on how to resolve the dispute with the levins and services as a mediator to furia.while helm letter and furia allegations make clear that helm agreed to act as a mediator,which might involve suggesting possible compromises,such a role does not encompass rendering legal advice.cal.dispute resolution council,stds.of practice for cal.mediators hereafter cdrc standards,std.american arbitration and aba,model stds.of conduct for mediators hereafter model standards,preface comment to vi neither the november jointly addressed letter nor the allegations of the initial complaint are consistent with the suggestion that helm,as the mediator,agreed to provide furia with legal advice.
hence,it is correct to conclude that an relationship did not arise between helm and furia,so that helm did not owe furia the obligations of a fiduciary.that is not to say,however,that as an attorney agreeing to act as a neutral mediator for the conflicting parties,helm did not assume duties to both of them actionable legal malpractice is compounded of the same basic elements as other kinds of actionable negligence duty,breach of duty,proximate cause,damage.citations.touching the first element,duty,the general rule is that the attorney,by accepting employment to give legal advice or to render other legal services,impliedly agrees to use such skill,prudence,and diligence as lawyers of ordinary skill and capacity commonly possess and exercise in the performance of the tasks which they undertake.ishmael millington d,italics added.
whether or not the label furia affixed to the first cause of action legal malpractice was entirely accurate,the pleading did sufficiently allege facts establishing the existence of a duty owed by helm to furia.we need not explore the full dimensions of that duty,but certainly the duty encompassed disclosing to furia any facts that reasonably might cause furia to believe that helm would not or could not be impartial.in agreeing to act as neutral mediator,helm did not assume the duties of furia attorney,but he did assume the duty of performing as a mediator with the skill and prudence ordinarily to be expected of one performing that role.while rule c of the rules of professional conduct may not be strictly applicable,we have no doubt that an attorney accepting the role of mediator has the same duty of full disclosure as an attorney accepting the representation of clients with actual or potentially conflicting interests.model standards,std.iii a mediator shall disclose all actual and potential conflicts of interest reasonably known to the mediator cdrc standards,cal.rules of court,rule b disclosure of matters potentially affecting impartiality by mediators in mediation programs.
mediators may not provide legal advice,but they are in a position to influence the positions taken by the conflicting parties whose dispute they are mediating.one of the principal roles of the mediator is to help the parties understand the other position and find a resolution acceptable to both.see fns,ante.the mediator role is simply to facilitate the parties direct negotiations,but this is not a hard and fast rule.many mediators do in fact offer their opinions.knight et,cal.practice guide alternative dispute resolution the rutter group.a party to mediation may well give more weight to the suggestions of the mediator if under the belief that the mediator is neutral than if that party regards the mediator as aligned with the interests of the adversary.for the same reasons that full disclosure is necessary before an attorney may represent divergent interests,before an attorney agrees to serve for compensation as a mediator,there must be complete disclosure of all facts and circumstances which,in the attorney honest judgment,may influence the party choice,holding the attorney civilly liable for loss caused by lack of disclosure.ishmael millington,supra,d at.
furia amended complaint thus alleged facts establishing the existence of a duty on the part of helm,and it alleged as well the breach of that duty.we need not decide whether the november,letter sent to both parties,standing alone,was sufficient to disclose the existing relationship between helm and the levins and the possibility that despite his best efforts,helm might nonetheless be partial to their interests in that letter he did assure furia that he would do his very best to listen to all sides equally.yet,in a second letter to the levins,he represented,i am not going to be truly neutral during our efforts to negotiate an agreement and he made arrangements for communications relating to the mediation that would be concealed from furia.assuming that the attorney for one party to a dispute can ever properly agree to act as a mediator in attempting to resolve that dispute,certainly the full understanding of the responsibilities the attorney will perform should be set out unambiguously in a common writing to both parties,with no undisclosed side understandings with one of them.the amended complaint sufficiently alleges that helm did not fully and fairly disclose to furia that he did not intend to be entirely impartial as a mediator,and in fact misrepresented his intentions,and in that respect breached the duty to exercise reasonable care that he assumed towards furia.
the cases cited by helm for the proposition that an attorney representing one party has no duty to protect the interests of adverse parties are inapposite.flatt superior court,supra,cal th at,d,schick lerner d.an attorney generally will not be held liable to a third person not in privity of contract with him since he owes no duty to anyone other than his client fox pollack d.helm assumed obligations to furia not because helm was representing the levins,but because helm entered an express agreement with furia to serve as a mediator in his controversy with the levins.we reiterate that we do not here determine whether,consistent with his obligations to the levins,helm properly could agree to serve as a neutral mediator.see fn,ante.the fact is that he did so agree and,having done so,he assumed certain obligations to those he agreed to serve.
the amended complaint fails to allege recoverable damage under either cause of action.
the trial court sustained helm demurrers to the second cause of action,for fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment,on the ground that furia failed adequately to allege damages from the fraud.since we have concluded that furia sufficiently pleaded a duty and breach of duty under the first cause of action,the sufficiency of both causes of action turns upon the sufficiency of the allegations of causation and damages.both causes of action rest upon the claim that helm failed to disclose to furia the extent of his partiality to the levins when he agreed to serve as a mediator of their dispute.in all three versions of his complaint,furia alleged that because of his ignorance of helm true loyalties,he relied on helm advice that he abandon the construction project as the best means of resolving the dispute.furia withdrawal from the project is the sole causal link alleged to give rise to damages,in the form of prejudicing his position in litigation with the levins and in disciplinary proceedings before the contractors state license board,and in putting him to the expense of defending before the board the accusation that he had abandoned the project.
initially,furia failure to ascribe a dollar amount to these elements of damage was not fatal to his pleading.generally,f raud actions are subject to strict requirements of particularity in pleading.nagy nagy d.every fact constituting the fraud must be alleged,and the policy of liberal construction will not ordinarily be invoked to sustain a defective pleading.committee on children television,general foods cal d.f raud without damage is not actionable because it fails to state a cause of action.billings farm development.in billings,the plaintiff failed to allege not only a specific dollar amount,but also any harm caused by the fraud.there is no specific allegation of injury and nothing from which injury might be inferred.ibid.similarly,in nagy,the court held that a n allegation of a definite amount of damage is essential to stating a cause of action nagy nagy,supra,d at,but the court also found that the complaint did not state a cause and effect relationship between the fraud and damages sought id.at.here,although furia amended complaint fails to state a specific dollar amount of damages,the pleading does allege two types of damage caused by his reliance on helm advice furia was placed in a strategic disadvantage in defending the civil lawsuit filed by the levins and was subjected to administrative disciplinary proceedings requiring him to retain attorneys and expend money in defending such actions.the allegation that furia was placed in a strategic disadvantage we agree is too conclusory and indefinite to suffice.however,the allegation that furia was put to the expense of defending the charge of abandonment describes in a meaningful way the manner in which furia was damaged by his reliance on helm advice.this allegation was sufficient to overcome a general demurrer despite the absence of the exact amount of attorney fees incurred in defending against this accusation.
although a complaint shall contain a demand for judgment for the relief to which the pleader claims to be entitled,including the amount of damages demanded code civ,subd.a,the specific dollar amount is necessary only when a default judgment is to be entered.the purpose of such a requirement is to ensure that the defendant is sufficiently aware of the consequences of not answering the complaint.janssen luu th,d.however,in any other case,the court may grant the plaintiff any relief consistent with the case made by the complaint and embraced within the issue.code civ,subd.a.hence,the absence of a specific amount from the complaint is not necessarily fatal as long as the pleaded facts entitle the plaintiff to relief.see hunter freeman d,hoffman pacific coast const.
nonetheless,there is a fatal flaw in furia complaint with respect to the issue of causation.as indicated above,the sole causal link alleged between helm breach of duty and damage to furia is furia alleged abandonment of the remodeling project in reliance on helm advice.absent the abandonment,there is no respect in which helm failure to fully disclose his loyalties is alleged to have caused furia any harm.there may well be merit in helm contention that because furia did know that helm was the levins attorney,any reliance he placed on helm recommendation was,as a matter of law,unjustifiable.sabo deitsch th,d wilhelm pray,price,williams russell d.however,the more fundamental problem is that furia has previously alleged that he did not abandon the project and,following a contested administrative hearing,the evidence was found insufficient to establish such abandonment.
in asserting in the action brought against him by the levins,furia expressly alleged that he did not abandon the levins remodeling project.when disciplinary proceedings were brought against him before the contractors state license board,furia denied that he abandoned the project and he ultimately prevailed with respect to that contention.yet,the capstone of his damage claim is that in reliance on helm advice he withdrew from the project.this reversal in position is precluded by the doctrine of judicial estoppel.judicial estoppel is designed to maintain the purity and integrity of the judicial process by preventing inconsistent positions from being asserted.jackson county of los angeles th,d.it is an equitable doctrine aimed at preventing fraud on the courts.thomas gordon th,d drain betz laboratories,th,d.although not all of these elements are always necessary,the doctrine generally applies when the same party has taken two positions the positions were taken in judicial or administrative proceedings the party was successful in asserting the first position,the tribunal adopted the position or accepted it as true the two positions are totally inconsistent and the first position was not taken as a result of ignorance,fraud,or mistake.thomas gordon,supra,at,d,quoting drain betz laboratories,supra,at,d jackson county of los angeles,supra,at,d.
the only reason furia contends that this doctrine does not apply here is that the allegations of his complaint are not truly inconsistent with the position he took in the earlier proceedings.he argues that even though he prevailed on the abandonment issue before the
