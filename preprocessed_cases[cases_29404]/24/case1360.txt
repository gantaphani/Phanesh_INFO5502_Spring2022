agreement waiver of a judicial forum for statutory claims 
general principles 
in wright universal maritime service,d,the united states supreme court addressed the question whether a general arbitration clause in a collective bargaining agreement required an employee to use the arbitration procedures for an alleged violation of the americans with disabilities act of ada et.id.at.the collective bargaining agreement governing the employee employment provided that it was intended to cover all matters affecting wages,hours,and other terms and conditions of employment and stated that all unresolved disputes were subject to arbitration.id.at.the employee was also subject to a seniority plan which contained its own grievance procedures and specified that any dispute arising out of the terms conditions of the agreement,including the interpretation or application of the agreement,was subject to the grievance procedures.id.at.the employee filed suit under the ada when he learned stevedoring companies would not hire him because he had previously settled a claim for permanent disability.id.at.the district court dismissed the case because the employee had failed to pursue the grievance procedures of the collective bargaining agreement and the seniority plan.the fourth circuit affirmed and the united states supreme court reversed.
the wright court noted that in the context of collective bargaining agreements there is generally a presumption of arbitrability of issues that are arguably within the scope of the agreement.the presumption,the court explained,does not extend beyond the reach of the principle rationale that justifies it,which is that arbitrators are in a better position than courts to interpret the terms of a cba collective bargaining agreement.wright universal maritime service,supra,at.the court stated that the discrimination claim under the ada concerned neither the application nor interpretation of the agreement,but the meaning of a federal statute,and was thus distinct from any right conferred by the agreement.id.at.because the case involved the interpretation and application of a statute,the ultimate question for the arbitrator would be not what the parties have agreed to,but what federal law requires.ibid.accordingly,for an agreement to require arbitration of a statutory claim the court held it must be clear and unmistakable that the parties intended to waive a judicial forum for statutory claims.the waiver must be explicitly stated id.at because the right to a federal judicial forum is of sufficient importance to be protected against union waiver in a cba collective bargaining agreement.ibid.
the arbitration provision under review did not meet this clear and unmistakable standard.the arbitration clause was very general and failed to include an explicit incorporation of statutory antidiscrimination requirements.wright universal maritime service,supra,at.accordingly,the court held that the agreement had not waived the covered employee right to a judicial forum for his federal statutory claims of discrimination.id.at.
in vasquez superior court,supra,th,d,the trial court granted the employer petition to compel arbitration of a covered employee claims for discrimination and retaliation and the employee filed a petition for a writ of mandate to overturn the order compelling arbitration.the arbitration clause at issue in vasquez stated that it applied to all grievances and disputes between the union and employer regarding the interpretation or application of any term of the agreement.the agreement also contained a provision prohibiting discrimination against any applicant or employee on account of race,color,religion,sex,age or national origin under applicable federal and state law.id.at,d.
applying the analysis of wright,the vasquez court concluded that in determining whether there has been a sufficiently explicit waiver,the courts look to the generality of the arbitration clause,explicit incorporation of statutory antidiscrimination requirements,and the inclusion of specific antidiscrimination provisions.the test is whether a collective bargaining agreement makes compliance with the statute a contractual commitment subject to the arbitration clause.citations.vasquez superior court,supra,th at,d.if an agreement does not clearly,explicitly,and unmistakably show that the parties intended to make statutory claims subject to arbitration,the vasquez court stated that an alternative test for determining whether a dispute was subject to arbitration was the coupling of a general arbitration clause with an explicit incorporation of statutory antidiscrimination requirements elsewhere in the agreement.this combination had been upheld by courts as sufficient,provided another part of the agreement makes it unmistakably clear that the discrimination statutes at issue are part of the agreement,then employees will be bound to arbitrate
