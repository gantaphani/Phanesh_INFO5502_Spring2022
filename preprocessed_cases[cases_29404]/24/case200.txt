this case requires us to consider the circumstances under which a federal court may enjoin foreign judicial proceedings that threaten to undermine federal judgments confirming and enforcing a foreign arbitral award.the united states district court for the southern district of new york thomas griesa,judge enjoined appellant perusahaan pertambangan minyak dan gas bumi negara pertamina from pursuing foreign litigation that would undermine federal judgments enforcing a foreign arbitral award that appellee karaha bodas company,kbc had obtained in switzerland and enforced in the united states pursuant to the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,opened for signature june,new york convention or convention,implemented at.see karaha bodas perusahaan pertambangan minyak dan gas bumi negara,d district court opinion.the district court issued the injunction upon learning that pertamina had initiated a suit in the cayman islands that sought,inter alia,to vitiate the foreign arbitral award and obtain return of funds that had been paid over pursuant to the award.
pertamina argues on appeal that the district court used the wrong legal standard to determine whether an injunction should issue against it and that,under the proper legal standard,the injunction should not have been granted.pertamina also argues that,in any event,the district court lacked jurisdiction to maintain the injunction once the federal money judgment against it was satisfied.
although we find that the district court did not apply the correct legal standard,we affirm its judgment with minor modifications.we conclude that the test set forth in china trade development choong yong,cir,applies to the injunction the injunction was justified under the china trade test and the district court maintains jurisdiction to protect the federal judgments even after the money judgment against appellant was satisfied.we also modify the scope of the injunction to clarify that the injunction does not prohibit foreign confirmation proceedings contemplated by the new york convention.
background 
the dispute between the parties has been litigated extensively in several countries and two federal circuits for almost ten years.we set forth only those facts relevant to the disposition of the appeal.
a.the project and arbitration award 
in,kbc,a cayman islands limited liability company owned by american power companies and other investors,and pertamina,an oil and gas company owned and controlled by the republic of indonesia,entered into a joint venture for a project to explore and develop certain geothermal energy resources in indonesia the project.see district court opinion,d at.the parties agreed to settle any disputes between them by binding arbitration in geneva,switzerland,under the arbitration rules of the united nations commission on international trade law uncitral.the parties further agreed that their contractual relationship would be governed by indonesian law.
by,the indonesian government had suspended the project.in,kbc initiated arbitration proceedings in switzerland in which it contended that the indonesian government actions caused it over million in damages and lost profits.during the arbitration,the parties contested the potential yield of the geothermal resources kbc had contracted to develop with pertamina and the validity of kbc projections concerning the facilities it could develop to tap those resources.pertamina contended that the geothermal resource and development estimates put forward by kbc when entering into the project were sham s,and that kbc had no bona fide intention to develop the facilities proposed in its documents.the swiss arbitral tribunal rejected pertamina allegations about the genuineness of the information provided by kbc in support of its claims,but acknowledged the possibility that kbc projections may have been overestimate s.on december,the arbitral panel issued a final decision the award awarding kbc more than million in damages,lost profits,and costs of arbitration,plus interest per annum from january,until the date of full payment.in february,pertamina filed a petition challenging the award in the supreme court of switzerland.this challenge was dismissed in april because pertamina failed to pay court fees on a timely basis.district court opinion,d at.the dismissal became final in august when the supreme court of switzerland denied pertamina request for reconsideration.
fifth circuit litigation 
in early,kbc initiated proceedings in the united states district court for the southern district of texas texas district court to confirm the award pursuant to the new york convention.the texas district court entered a judgment in december confirming the award in the amount of million plus interest.see karaha bodas perusahaan pertambangan minyak dan gas bumi negara,d texas confirmation opinion.
while the texas district court judgment confirming the award was on appeal to the fifth circuit,pertamina filed an action in a jakarta,indonesia,trial court in march seeking to collaterally attack the award and enjoin kbc from enforcing the award.kbc obtained a temporary restraining order from the texas district court prohibiting pertamina from pursuing injunctive relief against kbc in indonesia while the texas district court considered whether the indonesian action impinged on its judgment and upon kbc legitimate efforts to enforce kbc rights thereunder.karaha bodas perusahaan pertambangan minyak dan gas bumi nebara,d,texas injunction opinion,rev,cir fifth circuit injunction opinion.despite the texas district court temporary restraining order,pertamina obtained an injunction from the indonesian trial court prohibiting kbc from enforcing the award and imposing on kbc the obligation to pay enforcement money in the amount of for each day this order is contravened,which amount must be paid promptly and fully to pertamina.texas injunction opinion,d at quoting indonesian injunction.the indonesian trial court also issued an order annulling the award.see fifth circuit injunction opinion,at.following entry of the indonesian injunction,the texas district court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting pertamina from enforcing the indonesian injunction or collecting penalties that might be imposed on kbc under the indonesian injunction.see texas injunction opinion,d at.
while the indonesian trial court decision was on appeal to the indonesian supreme court,the fifth circuit vacated the preliminary injunction issued by the texas district court.see fifth circuit injunction opinion,at.in its decision,the fifth circuit determined that,as the convention already provides for multiple simultaneous proceedings,it is difficult to envision how court proceedings in indonesia could amount to an inequitable hardship sufficient to support an injunction against the indonesian proceedings.id.at.the fifth circuit concluded that,in any event,
as a court of secondary jurisdiction under the new york convention,charged only with enforcing or refusing to enforce a foreign arbitral award,it is not the district court burden or ours to protect kbc from all the legal hardships it might undergo in a foreign country as a result of this foreign arbitration or the international commercial dispute that spawned it.
in march,the indonesian supreme court vacated the indonesian trial court order annulling the award and issuing the injunction.in the ruling,the indonesian supreme court concluded that only a swiss court had power to annul the award.later that month,the fifth circuit affirmed the texas district court confirmation of the award.see karaha bodas perusahaan pertambangan minyak dan gas bumi negara,cir.fifth circuit confirmation opinion,cert.denied,d in doing so,the fifth circuit concluded as had the supreme court of indonesia,unbeknownst to the fifth circuit that,because only a swiss court could annul the award under the new york convention,the indonesian annulment order did not require vacating the judgment confirming the award in the united states.see id.at.
c.other confirmation and enforcement proceedings 
pursuant to the new york convention,kbc also sought to confirm and enforce the award against pertamina in hong kong,singapore,and canada.those efforts yielded approximately to be applied to the amount owed by pertamina under the award.see district court opinion,d at 
second circuit litigation 
enforcement proceedings 
when pertamina appealed the texas district court judgment to the fifth circuit,it declined to post a supersedeas bond in order to obtain a stay of judgment pending appeal.see.d when an appeal is taken the appellant by giving a supersedeas bond may obtain a stay.this permitted kbc to seek registration and enforcement of the texas district court judgment in the southern district of new york,where pertamina maintained several bank accounts in its name that held hundreds of millions of dollars in assets.see providing for registration of federal judgments in other districts district court opinion,d at.kbc registered the texas judgment confirming the award with the district court on february,and immediately commenced execution proceedings against pertamina.see id.at.
the parties then engaged in heated litigation concerning ownership of the assets in the new york bank accounts held in pertamina name.pertamina contended that the indonesian government was the actual owner of the funds in the new york bank accounts.on an interlocutory appeal certified pursuant to b,we determined that both pertamina and the indonesian government owned some part of the funds in the accounts and that kbc was entitled to satisfy its judgment against pertamina out of the portion of the funds owned by pertamina.see karaha bodas perusahaan pertambangan minyak dan gas bumi negara,cir,cert.denied,d.the district court ultimately ordered pertamina to turn over to kbc the entire amount of the award by this time valued at roughly million,including interest on the award less the already recovered by kbc in hong of the funds in the new york bank accounts.see district court decision,d at.we affirmed this order in march.see karaha bodas ministry of finance of the republic of indonesia,wl,at cir.pertamina,seeking review of our decision,petitioned the united states supreme court for a writ of certiorari.
the injunction 
while pertamina petition for a writ of certiorari was pending before the supreme court,the district court asked pertamina whether,if the supreme court denied certiorari,pertamina would finally consent to pay the remainder of the judgment against it,thus ending the litigation between the parties.see district court opinion,d at.in a letter to the district court dated august,pertamina stated that if certiorari were denied,it would not object before this court to the payment of the judgment.id.this statement was technically accurate.the supreme court denied certiorari on october,see,d,and on october,almost all of the remainder of the million payment was turned over to kbc in the meanwhile,however,pertamina filed a new action in the cayman islands the cayman islands action.
the cayman islands action,filed on september,was based on the theory that the award was procured by fraud.pertamina sought damages in the amount of the award against kbc along with a variety of ancillary remedies.see district court opinion,d at.specifically,pertamina alleged in a supporting affidavit that,in august,pertamina advisors discovered documents that kbc had left behind when it ceased its operations and left indonesia some time around,which revealed that kbc had committed a fraud on pertamina by creating fraudulent resource and development estimates for the project.pertamina further alleged that the fraud associated with these estimates was such as to vitiate the arbitral award.district court opinion,d at internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,pertamina sought damages,an accounting,and restitution from kbc for the alleged fraud,including r estitution equitable compensation repayment of all sums received by kbc pursuant to the arbitral award and its enforcement.see id pertamina also sought a mareva injunction prohibiting kbc from disposing of any funds obtained pursuant to the award,including any sums received or to be received by kbc pursuant to any order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york pursuant to proceedings directed to enforcing the award in favour of kbc.see district court opinion,d at.
in response to the cayman islands action,kbc moved in the southern district of new york for an injunction prohibiting pertamina from maintaining the cayman islands action,or any similar action anywhere,and restraining kbc from disposing of funds obtained from pertamina.the district court granted kbc application for an injunction.it found that the cayman islands action was intended to undo the award and,furthermore,ha d the obvious purpose of nullifying the judgment s of the federal court in texas and the southern district of new york.district court opinion,d at.after noting that it ha d the power,and indeed the duty,to deal with abusive litigation tactics used by a party before it,the district court concluded that pertamina had engaged in abusive litigation tactics by deciding to file suit in the cayman islands rather than seek relief using means available to it under federal law see id.at.accordingly,the district court made the injunction permanent and issued a declaratory judgment declaring that the funds recovered by kbc pursuant to the judgments in this matter are the property of kbc,that kbc has full right to dispose of such funds as kbc sees fit,and that,in the event that pertamina should for some reason obtain an order of the cayman islands court or any other court,based upon matters relating to the arbitral award,purporting to interfere with kbc rights to dispose of the funds,kbc has no obligation to comply with such order.id.at.finally,pending appeal,it stayed its decision authorizing kbc to dispose of funds obtained pursuant to its earlier judgments.
subsequent developments 
while pertamina appeal from the district court injunction was being briefed,kbc moved us to lift the stay entered by the district court,thereby authorizing it to distribute to its shareholders the million it had obtained from pertamina.we granted kbc motion on february.on february,pertamina motion for an emergency stay before the united states supreme court was denied.at oral argument for the instant appeal,we were informed by kbc that,following the lifting of the stay,kbc distributed substantially all of the remaining pertamina funds to its shareholders and was thus no longer in possession of any of the assets that would be the subject of the mareva injunction sought by pertamina in the cayman islands following oral argument,we ordered the parties to submit supplemental letter briefs addressing whether the satisfaction of the money judgment against pertamina affected the district court jurisdiction to maintain the injunction.
discussion 
standard of review 
the standard of review for the grant of a permanent injunction,including an injunction,is abuse of discretion.paramedics electromedicina comercial,ltda.ge med.info,cir china trade,at.we will find such an abuse of discretion if the district court applies legal standards incorrectly or relies upon clearly erroneous findings of fact,or proceed s on the basis of an erroneous view of the applicable law,verio,cir citation omitted see also zervos verizon,cir error of law constitutes abuse of discretion.
b.the china trade test applies to,and supports entry of,the injunction 
the china trade test 
in china trade,we adopted a test governing the circumstances under which a federal district court could issue an injunction.under the china trade test,an injunction against foreign litigation may be imposed only if two threshold requirements are met a the parties are the same in both matters,and b resolution of the case before the enjoining court is dispositive of the action to be enjoined.paramedics,at citing china trade,at.if these two threshold requirements are satisfied,courts are directed to consider a number of additional factors,including whether the parallel litigation would 
frustrat e a policy in the enjoining forum be vexatious threat en the issuing court in rem or quasi in rem jurisdiction prejudice other equitable considerations or result in delay,inconvenience,expense,inconsistency,or a race to judgment.
ibeto petrochemical industries beffen,cir quoting china trade,at.china trade instructed that two of these factors should be accorded greater significance whether the foreign action threatens the enjoining forum jurisdiction or its strong public policies.at.however,we have reiterated that all of the additional factors should be considered when determining whether an injunction is warranted.see ibeto petrochemical,at disagreeing with courts and commentators that have erroneously interpreted china trade to say that we consider only these two more significant factors.china trade also states that principles of comity counsel that injunctions restraining foreign litigation be used sparingly and granted only with care and great restraint.paramedics,at quoting china trade,at.
the china trade test applies to the injunction 
china trade involved an injunction prohibiting a foreign defendant from pursuing a parallel proceeding in a foreign forum while a proceeding was pending in the southern district of new york.the district court,noting that judgment had already been entered in american courts,did not apply the china trade test.relying on dicta in a district court decision that had been affirmed by our court in a brief published per curiam opinion,the district court concluded that a more lenient standard applied to injunctions intended to prevent an abusive effort to evade a domestic judgment.see district court opinion,d at quoting farrell lines columbus,d,aff sub nom,farrell lines ceres terminals,cir 
in the instant case,pertamina argues that the district court committed legal error in concluding that kbc did not have to satisfy the china trade test in order to obtain an injunction against it.it notes that the china trade test has been applied by our court for twenty years,and that we applied the china trade test to an injunction in paramedics even though a judgment ha d been rendered in that case.at.
we agree with pertamina that,pursuant to our decision in paramedics,the china trade test applies to injunctions intended to protect federal judgments.we note,however,that as discussed in paramedics,the discretionary china trade factors will tend to weigh in favor of an injunction that is sought to protect a federal judgment.in paramedics,we applied the china trade test to an injunction that was entered to protect a federal judgment compelling arbitration.see at.in doing so,we explained that t here is less justification for permitting a second action,as here,after a prior court has reached a judgment on the same issues,id.at quoting laker airways,at,and that a n injunction may be needed to protect the court jurisdiction once a judgment has been rendered,id.we also concluded that while p rinciples of comity weigh heavily in the decision to impose a foreign injunction where one court has already reached a the same issues,involving the same of comity have diminished force.id.at.
the china trade test is satisfied 
despite the district court legal error in not applying the china trade test,we do not think it necessary to vacate the injunction and remand for further proceedings given the particular circumstances of the instant case.the principal difference between the more lenient test applied by the district court and the china trade test lies in the threshold requirements that a party must surmount to obtain an injunction under the latter.based on the extensive record developed in the district court and in other united states and foreign courts,we conclude as a matter of law that those threshold requirements are met.turning to the discretionary factors under china trade,we find that the district court properly considered these factors,albeit under a different rubric,and found them supportive of injunctive relief 
a.the threshold requirements are met 
it is undisputed that the first threshold requirement of china trade is satisfied the parties are the same in both the proceedings before the district court and in the cayman islands action.application of the second threshold requirement of china resolution of the case before the enjoining court is dispositive of the action to be enjoined,see at further analysis.first,we must determine the substance of the case before the enjoining court.kbc obtained a judgment from the texas district court confirming the award and judgments from the southern district of new york enforcing the texas district court judgment collectively,the federal judgments.pertamina asserts that the only case before the enjoining court that is,the southern district of new the determination of whether certain funds located in new york could be used to satisfy a judgment against it.according to pertamina,the proceedings before the southern district of new york thus could not have been dispositive of the cayman islands action because the enforcement proceeding that took place there in no way alone was dispositive lawsuit for fraud in the cayman islands.pertamina argues further that the southern district of new york inappropriately arrogated to itself the role of defending the judgment of the southern district of texas confirming the arbitration award.
this argument is without merit.when kbc registered the texas district court judgment confirming the arbitration award in the southern district of new york,that judgment had the same effect,and was entitled to the same protection,as if it had been entered in the southern district of new york in the first instance.see stating that a registered judgment shall have the same effect as a judgment of the district court of the district where registered and may be enforced in like manner.the southern district of new york was therefore empowered to take any action to protect the judgment confirming the award that the texas district court could have taken.kbc did not need to return to texas in order to protect and enforce the judgment.see smith woosley,cir affirming injunction issued by connecticut federal court to protect judgment rendered by pennsylvania federal court covington,resintex,cir discussing power of court of registration to determine validity of judgment rendered in another federal district.thus,we conclude that the case before the enjoining court includes all of the federal judgments related to the case,including the texas district court judgment confirming the award and the judgments entered by the southern district of new york enforcing the texas district court judgment.
we also must examine whether the federal judgments that the southern district of new york sought to protect were dispositive of the cayman islands action.we agree with kbc that the federal judgments satisfy the china trade requirement because the award,and the federal judgments confirming and enforcing it,actually decided the claims raised in the cayman islands action.we also conclude that the new york convention permits the federal judgments to be treated as dispositive of the cayman islands action.
as discussed above,the texas district court confirmed,and the district court enforced,an award that was entered in a swiss arbitration proceeding.these courts confirmed and enforced the award against pertamina even though,as discussed above,pertamina had argued in the swiss arbitration that the resource and development estimates prepared by kbc were same allegation,though assertedly with new factual support,that pertamina makes in the cayman islands action.moreover,the fifth circuit,in affirming the texas district court confirmation of the arbitration award,rejected pertamina argument that enforcement of the award should be refused because it was procured by fraud.see fifth circuit confirmation opinion,at noting that e nforcement of an arbitration award may be refused if the award was procured by fraud and rejecting arguments that enforcement of the award against pertamina should be refused on this basis.
pertamina argues that the cayman islands action is a proceeding separate and independent of the arbitration proceedings and award.we,however,conclude that this characterization is inconsistent with the nature of the cayman islands action.beyond seeking to vitiate the award,the cayman islands action seeks a determination that the district court wrongfully ordered almost million to be paid to kbc pursuant to the federal judgments confirming and enforcing the award,and return of all funds obtained by kbc pursuant to the arbitral award and its enforcement.although pertamina makes new factual allegations in support of its claim that the award should not have been enforced against it,these new factual allegations are not sufficient to undermine the preclusive effect of several earlier federal court decisions that the award should be enforced and kbc is entitled to pertamina new york funds in an amount sufficient to satisfy the award.see campaniello imports,saporiti italia,cir holding that a district court properly dismissed,as barred by res judicata,an independent action for rescission of a prior judgment on the basis of fraud,where the plaintiff failed to mount a viable direct attack on the earlier judgment restatement second of judgments when an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment,and the determination is essential to the judgment,the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties emphasis added id.cmt.c i f the party against whom preclusion is sought did in fact litigate an issue of ultimate fact,an issue requiring application of law to fact and suffered an adverse determination,new evidentiary facts may not be brought forward to obtain a different determination of that ultimate fact paramedics,at concluding,without considering the factual basis for foreign litigation,that a federal judgment compelling arbitration was dispositive of foreign litigation because the foreign litigation concern ed issues that,by virtue of the district court judgment,are reserved to arbitration 
we also conclude that,under the new york convention,the federal judgments to be protected are dispositive of the cayman islands action.pertamina essentially argues that the federal judgments could not be dispositive because the federal courts involved in confirming and enforcing the award within the united states were only acting as court s under the convention,appellant br.quoting fifth circuit injunction opinion,at,and secondary jurisdictions,under the new york convention,are not entitled to protect judgments related to a foreign arbitral award from foreign interference in doing so,it relies on the fifth circuit earlier opinion vacating the texas district court injunction.in that decision,the fifth circuit noted that,because the new york convention contemplates multiple proceedings in several nations to procure and enforce a foreign arbitral award,it was not appropriate for a court to protect kbc from all the legal hardships it might undergo in a foreign country as a result of this foreign arbitration or the international commercial dispute that spawned it.fifth circuit injunction opinion,at.
we agree with the fifth circuit that federal courts should not attempt to protect a party seeking enforcement of an award under the new york convention from all the legal hardships associated with foreign litigation over the award.but it does not follow,as pertamina would have us hold,that a federal court can not protect a party who is the beneficiary of a federal judgment enforcing a foreign arbitral award from any of the legal hardships that a party seeking to evade enforcement of that judgment might seek to impose.federal courts in which enforcement of a foreign arbitral award is sought can not dictate to other secondary jurisdictions under the new york convention whether the award should be confirmed or enforced in those jurisdictions.see id.at noting that a federal judgment enforcing a foreign arbitral award under the new york convention does not automatically receive res judicata effect in other jurisdictions in which enforcement is sought.but federal courts do have inherent power to protect their own judgments from being undermined or vitiated by vexatious litigation in other jurisdictions.see ibeto petrochemical,at discussing whether the foreign action would be vexatious in affirming an injunction covanta onondaga onondaga county res.recovery agency,cir noting a court unquestioned authority to terminate and prevent the renewal of a protracted series of vexatious lawsuits filed by a litigant.moreover,e ven in the absence of a pattern of vexatious litigation a district court that has adjudicated the merits of a case may have authority to prevent relitigation.covanta onondaga,at.as the fifth circuit recognized,the new york convention does not divest federal courts of this inherent power.see fifth circuit injunction opinion,at given the absence of an express provision in the new york convention,we discern no authority for holding that the new york convention divests the district court of its inherent authority to issue an antisuit injunction.
in this case,the federal judgments reached a dispositive determination that kbc should be paid million of pertamina funds,held in new york bank accounts,pursuant to the award.this determination is entitled to protection from pertamina attempts to vitiate it through the cayman islands action.the existence of the federal judgments ordering pertamina to turn over million is one of the factors distinguishing the injunction issued by the district court from the injunction against the indonesian action,which was vacated by the fifth circuit in.in,the texas district court had only confirmed the award,and there had been no definitive determination that kbc was entitled to the funds that pertamina held in the new york bank accounts.by the time that the district court entered the injunction at issue in this appeal,however,additional federal judgments enforcing kbc award had been entered.as the district court noted,those judgments are not conditional,or qualified,or limited in any way as to kbc rights with respect to the monies awarded pursuant to the award and the federal judgment confirming it.district court opinion,d at.
the nature of the cayman islands action that the district court sought to enjoin also distinguishes the injunction at issue here from the injunction that was vacated by the fifth circuit.when the fifth circuit vacated the injunction prohibiting litigation in indonesia,pertamina had an ultimately for claiming that the indonesian proceedings were permissible under the new york convention.under the convention,a jurisdiction may decline to enforce a foreign arbitral award if it has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which,or under the law of which,that award was made.new york convention art.v e.pertamina argued that,because indonesian substantive law applied to the dispute between the parties,an indonesian court had the power to set aside or suspend the award.see fifth circuit confirmation opinion,at noting that pertamina suggests that both switzerland the host country and indonesia the country of governing law have primary jurisdiction over the arbitration in this case under article v e of the convention see also leonard quigley,accession by the united states to the united nations convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,yale,asserting that article v e provides that when an award is rendered in one state under the law of a second state,the courts of that second state may set aside or suspend the award in,after the texas district court injunction had been vacated,the fifth circuit concluded that only switzerland had authority to set aside the award in this case.see fifth circuit confirmation opinion,at.but when it initiated proceedings in indonesia in,pertamina at least had a colorable argument that indonesian courts had a role to play in determining whether the award should be enforced.
here,by contrast,the cayman islands has no arguable basis for jurisdiction to adjudicate rights and obligations of the parties with respect to the award.cayman islands courts have no power to modify or annul the award under the convention and pertamina does not even attempt to argue that the cayman islands action is one that would be contemplated by the convention.we conclude that in these circumstances the district court had power to prevent pertamina from engaging in litigation that would tend to undermine the regime established by the convention for recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards.c oncerns of international comity,respect for the capacities of foreign and transnational tribunals,and sensitivity to the need of the international commercial system for predictability in the resolution of disputes require that we enforce agreement s to submit disputes to binding international arbitration.mitsubishi motors soler,d.these considerations also require us to protect the regime established by the convention for enforcement of international arbitral awards,if necessary by enjoining parties from engaging in foreign litigation that would undermine it 
b.the additional china trade factors support issuance of an injunction 
as discussed above,where an injunction is sought to protect a federal judgment,the additional china trade factors will often favor issuance of an injunction when the threshold china trade requirements are met.despite adopting a more lenient test,the district court considered the discretionary factors set forth in china trade and determined they warranted an injunction.see district court opinion.at.we agree.
we turn first to the two additional factors that have been described as having greater significance,china trade,at,whether the foreign action threatens the jurisdiction or the strong public policies of the enjoining forum.as in paramedics,b oth considerations are salient in this case.at.china trade held that an injunction may be necessary to protect the enjoining court jurisdiction.at see also paramedics,at an injunction may be needed to protect the court jurisdiction once a judgment has been rendered.here,an injunction is necessary because the cayman islands action threatens to undermine the federal judgments confirming and enforcing the award against pertamina,and may also undermine federal jurisdiction to determine whether prior federal judgments should be invalidated on the basis of the fraud alleged by pertamina.campaniello imports,at res judicata does not preclude a litigant from making a direct attack upon the judgment before the court which rendered it.emphasis added quoting weldon united states,cir.the injunction is also supported by strong public policy considerations.we have noted the strong public policy in favor of international arbitration,and the need for proceedings under the new york convention to avoid undermining the twin goals of arbitration,namely,settling disputes efficiently and avoiding long and expensive litigation.encyclopaedia universalis encyclopaedia britannica,cir internal quotation marks omitted.these important objectives would be undermined were we to permit pertamina to proceed with protracted and expensive litigation that is intended to vitiate an international arbitral award that federal courts have confirmed and enforced.
we also conclude that one of the three remaining additional china trade the foreign action would be strongly in favor of the injunction.china trade noted that vexatiousness is likely to be present whenever parallel actions are proceeding concurrently,at.proceedings are apt to be especially vexatious,however,where a foreign proceeding threatens to undermine a federal judgment.here,the district court expressly and properly found that the entire point of the fraud allegations of the cayman islands action is to show that the arbitral award must be deemed to be,to be a nullity.district court opinion,at.in other words,the district court concluded that the subsequent litigation in this case,being aimed at the recovery by kbc in the federal courts,was entirely vexatious.as the district court noted 
a fter almost six years of litigation in district and appellate courts based on the arbitral award,the american courts had finally resolved all the issues presented to them about whether the arbitral award should be confirmed and about the method by which kbc should recover the large amount due.although procedures were available under federal law for pertamina to make its claim of fraud and to seek to prevent kbc from recovering the million,there was no attempt whatever by pertamina to make use of such procedures instead,pertamina engaged in the six years of litigation in the united states without any mention of its claim of fraud.finally,at the very moment when the litigation was to be legitimately ended,pertamina brought the action in the cayman islands after engaging in literal subterfuge in dealing with the court in new york.the purpose of this lawsuit is to effectively wipe out the effect of the united states judgments and to do this with as great an amount of delay as possible.
id.at as indicated above,federal courts have the authority to restrain a party before it from engaging in vexatious litigation.see,covanta onondaga,at.china trade indicates that this authority should be exercised where,as here,other factors also counsel in favor of issuance of an injunction.
finally,we note that comity considerations,though important,have diminished force when a court has already reached a judgment involving the same issues and parties.paramedics,at.comity concerns have particular importance under the convention a federal court should be wary of entering injunctions that may prevent parties from engaging in enforcement or annulment proceedings that are contemplated by the convention.but comity concerns under the convention have no bearing on our consideration of the cayman islands action,which is not a proceeding contemplated by the convention and is,moreover,intended to undermine federal judgments.as we have stated,orders of foreign courts are not entitled to comity if the litigants who procure them have deliberately courted legal impediments to the enforcement of a federal court orders.motorola credit uzan,cir quoting societe internationale rogers,d see also id.noting that the district of columbia circuit,in laker airways,at,refused to respect an english court order where the defendants involved in the american suit had gone into the english courts to generate interference with the american courts.accordingly,comity concerns do not weigh against entry of an injunction in this case.
c.the district court maintains jurisdiction to enforce the injunction 
in a supplemental letter brief requested by the court,pertamina asserts that,regardless of whether the district court had the authority to issue an injunction in the first instance,it now lacks jurisdiction to maintain the injunction because pertamina has paid the judgment against it.pertamina relies primarily on two supreme court opinions describing the boundaries of ancillary jurisdiction,kokkonen guardian life insurance company of america,d,and peacock thomas,d,as well as the eighth circuit recent decision in goss international man roland druckmaschinen aktiengesellschaft,cir,which vacated an injunction imposed to protect a federal money judgment once the judgment was satisfied,see id.at.
t he doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction recognizes federal courts jurisdiction over some matters otherwise beyond their competence that are incidental to other matters properly before them.kokkonen,at.emphasis added.the court,in kokkonen,found that jurisdiction to maintain ancillary proceedings may be exercised 
for two separate,though sometimes related,purposes to permit disposition by a single court of claims that are,in varying respects and degrees,factually interdependent and to enable a court to function successfully,that is,to manage its proceedings,vindicate its authority,and effectuate its decrees,see,chambers nasco,d power to compel payment of opposing party attorney fees as sanction for misconduct united states hudson,cranch.contempt power to maintain order during proceedings.
at.it also held that a federal court did not maintain ancillary jurisdiction to hear disputes over a settlement agreement that was not entered as an order of the court.see id.at.in peacock,the court observed that it had approved the exercise of ancillary jurisdiction over a broad range of supplementary proceedings involving third parties to assist in the protection and enforcement of federal attachment,mandamus,garnishment,and the prejudgment avoidance of fraudulent conveyances,id.at,but noted that recognition of these supplementary proceedings has not extended beyond attempts to execute,or to guarantee eventual executability of,a federal judgment,id.at.

while t he boundaries of ancillary jurisdiction are not easily defined and the cases addressing it are hardly a model of clarity,garcia teitler,cir,we conclude that federal courts have continuing jurisdiction,grounded in the concepts of res judicata and collateral estoppel,to enjoin a party properly before them from relitigating issues in a forum that were already decided in federal court.this source of jurisdiction remains even after a judgment has been of whether the judgment is one of dismissal or the font of jurisdiction for such an injunction is characterized as ancillary or otherwise see,choo,at.a federal court may prevent state litigation of an issue that previously was presented to and decided by the federal court.this power is founded in the concepts of res judicata and collateral estoppel.id.at.affirming injunction protecting from relitigation a ruling in earlier federal judgment of dismissal local loan hunt.that a federal court of equity has jurisdiction of a bill ancillary to an original case or proceeding in the same court,whether at law or in equity,to secure or preserve the fruits and advantages of a judgment or decree rendered therein,is well settled.smith,at affirming injunction based on judgment dismissing claims as paramedics,at an injunction may be needed to protect the court jurisdiction once a judgment has been rendered.see also covanta onondaga,at even in the absence of a pattern of vexatious litigation a district court that has adjudicated the merits of a case may have authority to prevent relitigation.james moore,moore federal practice perm.ed noting that a district court retains jurisdiction to enforce the judgments it enters charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure perm.ed.no independent basis of jurisdiction is required for a federal court to entertain an application to enjoin relitigation in state court.
accordingly,we conclude that the district court jurisdiction to maintain the injunction even though the federal judgments against pertamina have been satisfied.while an injunction should not be made permanent absent a need for such relief,see,ibeto petrochemical,at modifying injunction where there was no need for the permanent injunction that the district court seems to have issued entry of a permanent injunction was fully justified in this case.were we to vacate the district court injunction,pertamina would be free to engage in vexatious proceedings that,as discussed,are intended to undermine or vitiate federal judgments the district court did not err in determining that a permanent injunction was necessary in these circumstances.
d.the injunction should be modified slightly 
although the injunction could be read to bar any other action related to the award,the parties agree that the injunction does not bar confirmation proceedings currently underway in other nations.it would be inconsistent with our obligations under the convention to bar litigation over the award in switzerland,the jurisdiction with primary authority over the award accordingly,we modify the injunction slightly to clarify that the injunction has no effect on confirmation proceedings contemplated by the new york convention in other jurisdictions,and moreover,permits pertamina to return to the district court to seek relief from the injunction in the event that it demonstrates its good faith in seeking an opportunity to challenge the award in switzerland.smith,at modifying injunction to avoid having it inadvertently sweep too broadly.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,the judgment of the district court is affirmed as modified.
under the new york convention,the country in which,or under the arbitration law of which,an award was made is said to have primary jurisdiction over the arbitration award.all other signatory states are secondary jurisdictions,in which parties can only contest whether that state should enforce the arbitral award.fifth circuit injunction opinion,at quoting new york convention art.v e.as explained by the fifth circuit,the convention assignsdifferent roles to national courts to carry out the aims of the treaty.articles iv and v of the convention specify the procedures for courts of secondary jurisdictions to follow when deciding whether to enforce a foreign arbitral award.article iv provides that a party can obtain enforcement of its award by furnishing to the putative enforcement court the authenticated award and the original arbitration agreement or a certified copy of both.article v,in turn,enumerates specific grounds on which the court may refuse enforcement if the party contesting enforcement provides proof sufficient to meet one of the bases for contrast to the limited authority of courts to review the arbitral award,courts of primary jurisdiction,usually the courts of the country of the arbitral situs,have much broader discretion to set aside an award.by its silence on the matter,the convention does not restrict the grounds on which courts may annul an award,thereby leaving to a primary jurisdiction local law the decision whether to set aside an award.consequently,even though courts of a primary jurisdiction may apply their own domestic law when evaluating an attempt to annul or set aside an arbitral award,courts in countries of secondary jurisdiction may refuse enforcement only on the limited grounds specified in article.at footnotes omitted.
