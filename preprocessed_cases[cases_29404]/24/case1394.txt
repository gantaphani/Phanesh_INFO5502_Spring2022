this appeal concerns a dispute between a law firm and its client over the law firm right to be paid for professional services for handling the client personal injury lawsuit.the personal injury lawsuit was resolved when a judgment was entered under the client offer to compromise pursuant to code of civil procedure section for policy limits and the defendant insurance company satisfied the judgment by depositing the funds with the superior court.
the parties arbitrated their fee dispute through the california state bar in accordance with california mandatory fee arbitration act mfaa,business and professions code section et.the arbitrator awarded the law firm a contingency fee and costs.
the client objected to the arbitration award by filing a motion in opposition to the law firm lien for attorney fees in the personal injury lawsuit.the law firm filed a motion requesting that the superior court disburse part of the settlement proceeds to the law firm to satisfy the arbitration award.the superior court denied the client motion,granted the law firm motion,and ordered the clerk to disburse of the settlement funds to the law firm.
the client appealed,claiming the orders contained reversible error.the client contends the arbitration award is not binding and the underlying claim for attorney fees lacked merit or alternatively,if the arbitration award is binding,he should be granted relief from the award due to a mistake or excusable neglect.he further contends that,if the superior court lacked the authority to determine the arbitration award was not binding,it also lacked the authority to enforce that award.
we conclude that the client failed to follow the proper procedure for preventing the arbitration award from becoming binding.in the circumstances of this case,the client was required to file a new lawsuit and the client motion did not meet this requirement.therefore,the superior court correctly denied the client motion in opposition to the law firm lien.
we also conclude that the law firm failed to follow the correct procedures for enforcing an arbitration award.it did not file a petition to confirm the award and obtain a judgment of confirmation.therefore,the superior court erred in granting the law firm motion and directing the clerk of the court to deliver funds to it.
accordingly,the superior court december,order is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
facts and proceedings 
appellant edwin loeb is representing himself in this appeal.respondent baradat edwards is a law firm organized as a partnership.david edwards is a partner in that firm.baradat edwards represented loeb in a personal injury lawsuit and david edwards was the attorney of record who handled that lawsuit 
on april,loeb was in a motor vehicle accident at an intersection located in fresno,california.he alleges that a woman,who was on a cell phone at the time,ran a red light and crashed into his car at a high rate of speed.the woman was driving her mother vehicle,with permission,at the time of the accident.the mother maintained an insurance policy with amco insurance company that had per person policy limits of.
loeb asserts that the accident caused him moderate but permanent injuries to his back,neck,and a facial nerve.loeb asserts the nerve damage causes occasional spasms to the left side of his face,resulting in an unattractive and embarrassing squint.
approximately six weeks after the traffic accident,loeb had blood clots that paralyzed both of his legs.the clots were surgically removed and loeb spent almost a week in a critical care unit followed by two months recuperating at home.whether the blood clots were caused by the trauma of the traffic accident is a question of fact that remains uncertain at this stage of the proceedings.
the medical expenses incurred in treating loeb blood clots were covered under kaiser hospital adult care program kaiser.loeb is a member of that program and,as a result,he paid only for those medical services.notwithstanding the uncertainty over whether the blood clots were caused by the traffic accident,kaiser asserted it was entitled to reimbursement of medical expenses out of any judgment or settlement made with the driver of the car that struck loeb vehicle.
loeb apparently tried to settle his traffic accident claim by negotiating directly with amco insurance company.the negotiations did not result in a settlement,in part because the insurer doubted whether the blood clots were a problem caused by the traffic accident.
in august,loeb retained edwards to represent him in a lawsuit against the driver of the other car.loeb and edwards signed a written retainer agreement that provided in part 
client agrees to pay to attorneys for their services a retaining fee for legal services as negotiated between the attorneys and client on,is percent before arbitration or trial commences or percent thereafter of any amounts received or recovered by client in said matter by way of settlement,judgment,or otherwise after reimbursement to attorneys of the costs and disbursement made on behalf of client 
client hereby gives and grants unto attorneys a lien on said cause of action,and proceeds of any judgment or settlement thereunder,to the extent of the share and sums hereinbefore mentioned as attorneys fees and costs and disbursements and client expressly assigns to attorneys any proceeds and any judgment or settlement relative to said cause of action,to the extent of said attorneys fees and costs and disbursements.
edwards filed a complaint for loeb personal injuries in fresno superior court on february,the personal injury action.
on january,edwards served counsel for the defendants in the personal injury action with an offer to compromise under section.the offer was for the policy limits of,with the parties to bear their own costs.loeb appears to assert that the offer was extended by edwards without his knowledge or approval.in contrast,a declaration filed by david edwards asserts that he discussed the situation with loeb in detail,explained how insurance policy limits worked,and obtained his authority and consent before making the offer to compromise under section.
a mediation was held in the personal injury action on february.a disagreement arose between loeb and edwards regarding kaiser claim to reimbursement of medical expenses out of any settlement proceeds.david edwards describes part of the disagreement as follows 
at the mediation,it became clear that loeb insisted upon not dealing with his statutory and contractual obligations with,and refused to accept the reality that those liens needed to be addressed.
in any event,the mediation went on for some time with me,and frankly,the judge discussing many of these issues with loeb.when it became apparent to loeb that i would not and could not agree to ignore kaiser and medicare,he attempted to have us fraudulently claim that we were no longer claiming his accident had anything to do with his kaiser treatment,and that allied could pay him for his chiropractic injuries.i explained that i would not take that position as we were claiming the kaiser treatment,and in any event,his case had a value no where near with only his chiropractic injuries.
loeb account of what happened at the mediation is different.for example,a february,letter from loeb to counsel for the defendant stated that david edwards had resigned as loeb attorney,had stormed out of the mediation,and had announced his decision to quit being loeb attorney when it became apparent that your offer was unacceptable to me.the letter also indicates a willingness by loeb to end the litigation for.
shortly after the mediation,counsel for the defendants indicated a willingness to settle on the terms stated in the offer to compromise.defense counsel sent edwards a request for dismissal and a receipt and release.the receipt and release stated that loeb,in consideration of paid to him by amco insurance company released and discharged the defendant driver,her mother,and the insurance company from all claims and liabilities connected with the accident and personal injury action.
loeb did not sign and return the request for dismissal or the receipt and release.as a result,counsel for the defendants sought to implement the terms of the offer to compromise by another course.he filed a notice of acceptance of offer to compromise with the superior court in late february.
in march,edwards filed a motion to be relieved as counsel along with a supporting declaration.david edwards declaration stated that the relationship had eroded to the point that he could no longer represent loeb and that loeb refuse d to execute any documents to either consumate sic the resolution of the case or to allow attorney to be substituted out.the superior court granted the motion and filed an order on march,granting edwards motion to be relieved.
on march,judgment pursuant to the acceptance of the offer to compromise was signed and filed by the superior court.
on march,edwards filed a notice of lien for attorney fees and costs in the personal injury action.the notice asserted a lien against any recovery obtained by loeb in the amount of for costs incurred and reasonable attorney fees in the amount of 
notice of entry of the judgment in the amount of was filed in early april.
in july,counsel for the defendants in the personal injury action filed a motion for an order requiring loeb to execute a satisfaction of judgment or,alternatively,for an order to the clerk of the court to enter satisfaction of judgment.the motion asserted that loeb would not accept a settlement draft and would not execute a satisfaction of judgment.
in september,the superior court granted the unopposed motion for entry of satisfaction of judgment,ordered the defendants to deposit with the clerk of the court and directed the clerk to hold the funds in loeb name and to enter satisfaction of judgment.the superior court also noted the existence of edwards lien and that the money should not be disbursed to loeb without a court order.
in the meantime,loeb and edwards arbitrated their dispute over attorney fees and costs under the mfaa and the fee arbitration program of the fresno county bar association.the arbitration hearing was held in july and the arbitration award was served by mail on the parties on august.enclosed with the arbitration award was a document titled notice of your rights after fee arbitration revised october.
the notice described the steps that a party dissatisfied with the arbitration award must take to prevent the award from becoming binding and advised the dissatisfied party that the steps must be taken within days after the arbitration award was served.specifically,the notice stated that i f no lawsuit about the fees has been filed yet,then you must file your own lawsuit in the proper court to prevent the award from becoming binding.
in addition,the notice described how a party who was awarded money and was satisfied with the arbitration award could enforce the award.page five of the notice stated any party who is owed money has the right to request court orders allowing that party to take property or money from the other party paycheck,bank accounts.to get those court orders,you must first obtain a judgment confirming the arbitration award.the notice specifically addressed how to obtain a judgment confirming the arbitration award,how long a party had to file a petition for confirmation,and the party rights after confirmation of the arbitration award.in particular,the notice stated that after the award is confirmed and a judgment is entered,the party becomes a judgment creditor with a right to execute the judgment.that means you may be entitled to court orders allowing you to collect your money by garnishing the other party paycheck or bank accounts,placing a lien on his or her property.
the arbitrator ruled in favor of edwards.the arbitration award stated that loeb was to pay edwards the sum of as a fee for services rendered and the sum of for costs.
loeb was dissatisfied with the arbitration award and attempted to contest it by filing a motion in the personal injury action on august.loeb thought his motion prevented the arbitration award from becoming binding because it was filed within days after the arbitration award had been mailed.in his papers,loeb contended that edwards deliberately failed to inform me of his intention to pay kaiser and that i would only get one tenth of the settlement.i would have to be a complete idiot to agree to a settlement that i knew would only give me less than ten cents of every settlement dollar.in addition,loeb contended that he felt edwards sic actions diametrically opposed my best interest when he planned to give kaiser most of my settlement,when he was not legally obligated to do so.because of his failure to look after my interest,he is undeserving of a fee.
on september,edwards filed a notice of motion for partial disbursement of judgment or settlement proceeds,a memorandum of points and authorities in support of the motion,and a declaration in support of the motion.
edwards motion for partial disbursement asserted that the arbitration award had become binding and final.based on that assertion,edwards requested the superior court to order the distribution of part of the proceeds on deposit with the court to satisfy the arbitration award.edwards moving papers did not request confirmation of the arbitration award or entry of a judgment of confirmation.
a hearing on the two motions was held on october.the tentative ruling of the court was to deny loeb motion in opposition to the lien and to deny edwards motion to disburse fees and costs from settlement funds.with respect to the denial of loeb motion in opposition to the lien,the tentative ruling stated that former counsel was permitted to file such a notice and the court has no jurisdiction to determine the validity of the underlying lien or to expunge it.carroll interstate brands th,d.with respect to edwards motion,the tentative ruling stated that the court had no jurisdiction to deduct the fees and costs from the settlement proceeds and that,where the former counsel is not a party to the underlying action,former counsel must bring an independent action to enforce the contractual lien.
the superior court did not adopt its tentative ruling.instead,it filed a written ruling on december,denying loeb motion and granting edwards motion with directions to the clerk of the court to forward to baradat edwards and the balance of to loeb.
on february,loeb filed a notice of appeal from the december,ruling.
discussion 
standard of review 
the issues this court must decide to resolve this appeal concern the proper interpretation of provisions of the business and professions code and the application of that interpretation,as well as certain provisions from the code of civil procedure,to the facts of this case.issues of statutory interpretation and the application of that interpretation to a set of undisputed facts are questions of law subject to independent review by this court.twedt franklin th,d.
ii.arbitration of fee disputes between attorneys and clients 
in,california legislature enacted the mfaa to address disputes concerning the fees charged by attorneys for professional services.law offices of dixon howell valley th,d valley.the goal of the mfaa is to obtain the fair resolution of fee disputes.valley,at,d.to achieve this goal,the mfaa created a mechanism for the arbitration or mediation of fee disputes between attorneys and clients.bus,subd.a.the mediation and arbitration procedures were intended to reduce the inherent advantage that attorneys would have if such disputes were resolved through lawsuits.valley,supra,at,d.
under the mfaa,certain disputes between attorneys and clients are submitted to arbitration conducted by the local bar association.aguilar lerner cal th,d.the mfaa applies only to disputes concerning legal fees,costs,or both and specifically excludes claims for affirmative relief,such as damages resulting from attorney malpractice or misconduct.aguilar,at,d,see bus.
in contrast to the limited application of the mfaa,the california arbitration act caa,section et,sets forth a comprehensive statutory scheme regulating private arbitration in california.aguilar lerner,supra,cal th at,d.our supreme court has described the mfaa arbitration scheme as separate and distinct from the scheme established by the caa.aguilar,at,d.the separation of the two acts,however,is not total because business and professions code section,subdivision b incorporates certain provisions of the caa into the mfaa.
one of the distinct characteristics of arbitration under the mfaa is that it is voluntary for the client and mandatory for the attorney if commenced by the client.bus,subd.c.thus,a client can force an unwilling attorney to arbitrate the fee dispute,but an unwilling client can not be forced to arbitrate by an attorney.aguilar lerner,supra,cal th at,d.
another distinct characteristic of arbitration under the mfaa concerns the finality of the arbitration award.typical arbitration awards are binding.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,term arbitration connotes a binding award thus a private agreement to arbitrate generally is interpreted to include an implied agreement the arbitrator decision will be binding and final.in contrast,an arbitration award rendered under the mfaa becomes binding if it is not challenged by the proper procedure specifically,the award is not binding if either party initiates a trial after arbitration within days after mailing of the notice of the award.bus,subds.b c.this procedure places the burden on the party dissatisfied with the arbitration award to take steps to prevent the award from becoming binding.
the issues raised in this appeal include whether loeb followed the proper procedures to prevent the arbitration award from becoming binding and whether edwards followed the proper procedure for enforcing the arbitration award.
iii.loeb motion in opposition to lien 
grounds raised in loeb motion 
loeb disagreed with the arbitrator award.as a result,he filed a motion in opposition to edwards lien for attorney fees and costs and the arbitration award.loeb contended that edwards was intentionally deceitful and,misrepresented the facts and which constitutes fraud.
loeb asserted that edwards failed to inform him of significant information concerning the negotiations with amco insurance company and of edwards intention to pay kaiser from the anticipated settlement.in loeb view,he had paid kaiser its fee and kaiser was not entitled to any more.also,loeb asserted edwards altered the written retainer agreement by writing on its margin that there was a lien from kaiser that had to be paid and,because loeb had not agreed to the change,the retainer agreement was void.as a result,loeb requested the superior court to set aside the arbitration award and lien.
loeb made his motion based on the assumption that he had complied with the requirement contained in business and professions code section,subdivision b.his opening appellate brief asserts that he was informed of the arbitrator award on august,and that he filed a suit in opposition to the arbitrator award on august.my filing was twenty seven days after i was notified of the arbitrator biased award.this is proof that i had met the thirty day filing requirement.loeb states the superior court ruled that he had failed to file within thirty days as required by the bar association arbitration rules.it is this ruling that i am requesting that you appellate judges overturn.
the superior court determined that the personal injury action was not a pending action for purposes of the mfaa and loeb motion was not the equivalent of initiating a trial after arbitration by the commencement of an action.thus,the superior court concluded that the arbitration award had become binding.
based on loeb motion and his appellate brief,this court must decide the following questions.
first,for purposes of business and professions code section,was loeb personal injury action an action pending when loeb filed his motion challenging the arbitration award 
second,did loeb motion satisfy the statutory requirement that he initiate a trial after arbitration within days after mailing of the notice of the award and,as a result,prevent the arbitration award from becoming binding bus,subds.b c.
the steps that loeb took to challenge the arbitration award are not disputed.accordingly,the questions presented are questions of law that involve the interpretation of the mfaa and the application of that interpretation to the undisputed facts of this case.see part,ante.
action pending 
business and professions code section,subdivision b provides in relevant part that the arbitration award shall become binding upon the passage of days after mailing of notice of the award,unless a party has,within the days,sought a trial after arbitration pursuant to section.
business and professions code section,subdivision b sets forth the procedures that must be followed i f there is an action pending section,subdivision c of business and professions code addresses the alternative in which no action is pending 
to identify which alternative applies in this case,we must determine whether or not the personal injury action was an action pending for purposes of the mfaa.
action pending and necessary parties 
we conclude that the term action pending used in the mfaa refers to a lawsuit in which the parties include both the attorney and the client who had their fee dispute arbitrated.
the requirement that the attorney and client be parties to the lawsuit is not stated explicitly in sections and of the business and professions code.the requirement,however,must be implied as a matter of law because the court must have personal jurisdiction over both parties to the fee dispute before it can hold a trial on the dispute.without jurisdiction over both parties,the court could not enter a valid decision affecting the rights and obligations of each party.see brown superior court th,d attorney is not a party to underlying action therefore,court in underlying action acts in excess of its jurisdiction when it rules attorney is entitled to foreclose a lien on judgment entered in that action.
in addition,our interpretation that both the attorney and the client must be parties to the action pending is consistent with the principle that a statute is not construed in isolation,but is read with reference to the entire statutory scheme of which it is a part.see lincoln place tenants city of los angeles th,d statutory language is construed in context of statute as a whole.this principle ensures that the part operates in harmony with the whole.ibid.business and professions code section provides that an attorney must provide the client with a notice of the availability of arbitration under the mfaa before or when the attorney commences an action against the client for the recovery of fees,costs,or both.thus,it is reasonable to conclude that subsequent references in the mfaa to an action pending are to the type of action described in business and professions code section.
in this appeal,the personal injury action was not an action between loeb and his attorneys.furthermore,the notice of lien did not make edwards a party to that intervention or otherwise.see reconveyance reed th,fn,d limited circumstances in which an attorney may intervene as a party in a client lawsuit.therefore,we conclude that the personal injury action was not an action pending for purposes of business and professions code section,subdivision b.
meaning of action and pending 
a second and alternative reason why the personal injury action can not be regarded as an action pending for purposes of the mfaa is based on the meaning of those two words.
the interpretation of the phrase action pending is aided by the definitions set forth in the code of civil procedure.see pesce department of alcoholic beverage control cal d,rule that bus.and code civ.proc.are to be construed together.
first,the term action is defined in section to mean an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice by which one party prosecutes another for the declaration,enforcement,or protection of a right,the redress or prevention of a wrong,or the punishment of a public offense.clearly,the personal injury action qualifies as an action under section.
second,section provides an action is deemed to be pending from the time of its commencement until its final determination upon appeal,or until the time for appeal has passed,unless the judgment is sooner satisfied.this statutory definition is the same,for practical purposes,as the definition of pending adopted in case law 
this contention turns on the meaning of the word pending.but pending,as used with respect to court procedure,means remaining undecided.citation.black law dictionary ed thus defines pending begun,but not yet completed during before the conclusion of prior to the completion of unsettled undetermined in process of settlement or adjustment.meyers degnan,d.
because a judgment had been filed in the personal injury action pursuant to the offer to compromise,the issues presented are whether that judgment had become final because the time for appeal had passed or the judgment had been satisfied.we consider the latter issue only to note that loeb filed his motion challenging the arbitration award and attorney lien on august,and the motion for entry of satisfaction of judgment was not granted until september.the judgment,however,had not been sooner satisfied than the deadline for filing notice of appeal,and that deadline is thus the date we must use to determine whether the personal injury action was pending at the time loeb filed his motion.
whether the time for appeal of the judgment had passed by the date loeb filed his motion must be determined by applying the rules that set forth the deadline for taking an appeal.the usual deadline for filing a notice of appeal is days after the party filing the notice of appeal is served by a party with the notice of entry of judgment.cal.rules of court,rule a.in this case,the notice of entry of judgment was filed in the personal injury action in early april.therefore,the time period for appeal expired in june,at least two months before loeb filed his motion challenging the arbitration award.under the definition of pending set forth in section,the personal injury action was no longer pending when loeb filed his motion on august.
conclusion 
based on the foregoing,we conclude that,for purposes of business and professions code section,subdivision c,no action wa s pending between loeb and his attorneys during the days after the arbitration award was served.as a result,loeb was required to comply with that subdivision to prevent the arbitration award from becoming binding.
commencement of an action 
business and professions code section,subdivision c requires a party to initiate a trial after arbitration by the commencement of an action in the court having jurisdiction over the amount of money in controversy within days after mailing of notice of the award.
loeb august,motion did not satisfy this requirement.the motion did not commence an action because,among other things,it did not result in edwards becoming a party to the personal injury action or otherwise give the court jurisdiction over edwards.
in summary,the superior court correctly interpreted and applied the provisions of the mfaa when it determined that loeb had failed to take the steps necessary to prevent the arbitration award from becoming binding.as a result,the superior court properly denied loeb motion.
iv.relief from a mistake or excusable neglect 
in addition to challenging the superior court interpretation of the mfaa,loeb appellate brief presents an alternate argument based on section,subdivision b.
he contends that in representing himself he failed,through his mistake,inadvertence,surprise or excusable neglect,to file a separate action against his attorneys because he thought he had complied with the requirement in business and professions code section,subdivision b when he filed his motion opposing edwards lien.
edwards argues that the request for relief under section is untimely because it was not made within six months after the superior court december,ruling.
section,subdivision b provides that an application for relief from an order taken against a party through mistake,inadvertence or excusable neglect shall be made within a reasonable time,in no case exceeding six months,after the order was taken.loeb did not meet this time limit.he first raised this issue in his opening appellate brief,which was filed more than six months after the december,ruling.therefore,he is not entitled to relief under section,subdivision b.accordingly,we do not reach the question whether he is permitted to raise this argument for the first time on appeal or the merits of his claim of mistake.
edwards motion to disburse fees and costs from settlement funds 
edwards contention 
edwards appellate brief contended that the order disbursing part of the settlement funds deposited with the court was correct because the arbitration award became binding as a matter of law pursuant to the provisions of business professions code sections b and.underscoring omitted.
edwards appellate brief,like the points and authorities filed in the superior court,cited no case law,statute,regulation,or secondary authority for the proposition that a binding arbitration award may be enforced before a petition for confirmation is filed and a judgment of confirmation entered.
because confirmation of the arbitration award was not addressed in the appellate briefing or in the superior court,this court sent the parties a letter before oral argument asking,among other things,whether the arbitration award in this case was confirmed by petition for purposes of business and professions code section,subdivision b during oral argument,edwards asserted that his motion for partial disbursement of judgment or settlement proceeds was,in substance,a petition to confirm the arbitration award.
applicable law 
the issue raised concerns how to enforce an arbitration award made pursuant to the mfaa 
this subject is addressed in the second and third sentences of subdivision b of section of the business and professions code.the second sentence applies when a lawsuit between the attorney and client already has been filed.that sentence does not apply in this appeal.
the third sentence of subdivision b of section of the business and professions code provides 
if no action between the parties to the arbitration is pending in any court,the award may be confirmed,corrected,or vacated by petition to the court having jurisdiction over the amount of the arbitration award,but otherwise in the same manner as provided in chapter commencing with section of title of part of the code of civil procedure.
as discussed earlier see part,ante,there was no action pending between loeb and edwards.therefore,the third sentence applies to this case.as a result,any petition to confirm the arbitration award in favor of edwards is subject to part,title,chapter of the code of civil procedure.under that chapter,an arbitration award is not directly enforceable because it has the same force and effect as a contract in writing between the parties to the arbitration until it has been confirmed or vacated.see knight et,cal.practice guide alternative dispute resolution the rutter group.based on this rule,we examine how arbitration awards are confirmed and thus rendered enforceable.
section provides that a ny party to an arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court to confirm,correct or vacate the award.section delineates the powers of a court with respect to an arbitration award as follows 
if a petition or response under this chapter is duly served and filed,the court shall confirm the award as made,whether rendered in this state or another state,unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as corrected,vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.
pursuant to these statutory provisions,t he procedure by which the prevailing party in an arbitration obtains an enforceable judgment is a petition to confirm the award.knight et,cal.practice guide alternative dispute resolution,supra.
the contents that must be included in a petition are specified by section.the petition must set forth the substance of the agreement to arbitrate,the names of the arbitrators,the arbitration award,and any written opinion of the arbitrators.ibid.the contents of a response to a petition are specified by section.a response that requests the aw
