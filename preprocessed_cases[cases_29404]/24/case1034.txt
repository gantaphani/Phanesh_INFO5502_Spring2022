michael lewis brought suit against his former employer,circuit city,for wrongful termination,based on alleged retaliation against lewis for seeking workers compensation benefits,a tort recognized by kansas.however,lewis has already arbitrated a claim of retaliatory discharge against circuit city,pursuant to an arbitration agreement he signed with his employment application,and lost on the merits of that claim.yet lewis now brings the very same claim of retaliatory discharge in court based on the same incident and harm alleged in the arbitration proceeding against circuit city.looking to law,we conclude that lewis claim is barred by claim preclusion.we also hold that lewis has waived his argument that the arbitration agreement is invalid under contract law,because he proceeded through arbitration without objecting to the agreement enforceability.in addition,we conclude that lewis argument that the arbitration decision violates public policy has no merit.finally,we conclude that sanctions are not appropriate in this case.accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal of lewis suit on summary judgment and deny circuit city motion for sanctions.
background 
lewis employment with circuit city 
michael lewis became a employee of circuit city in september as a roadshop manager.in february,he injured his knee while installing an automobile alarm,and sought medical treatment through a workers compensation claim.he states that over the years he has continued to have problems with his knee and,at various times,notified circuit city of those problems.lewis informed his supervisor in writing in november that he still had pain in his knee and requested to see a medical specialist,but allegedly did not receive a response.
circuit city terminated lewis on january.the parties dispute the reason for lewis termination.lewis claims that after he requested additional medical treatment in november,his supervisor attitude toward lewis became hostile and retaliatory,and lewis was disciplined and suspended.on those facts,lewis claims that circuit city wrongfully terminated him in retaliation for filing a worker compensation claim.
circuit city states that it terminated lewis because he violated the company weapons policy,a violation brought to the company attention by employee mike guerrero in early december,lewis had a confrontation with guerrero that resulted in guerrero walking off the job.guerrero then called an telephone hotline to complain about lewis.his complaint included allegations that lewis had brought a gun to work and had cleaned it at the work counter.when questioned,lewis admitted that he had brought a pistol grip and slide to work to repair it,and that he worked on it out of view of any customers.he said these were only parts of a handgun,not an operable handgun,and therefore the weapons policy did not apply.however,four members of circuit city management reviewed this information,decided that it was a violation of the weapons policy,and concluded that termination was warranted 
the arbitration agreement 
when lewis applied for employment in,his application included a dispute resolution agreement the arbitration agreement in which he agreed to settle any claims arising out of his application process or any future employment with circuit city exclusively by final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator.the agreement covered any claims 
arising under federal,state or local statutory or common law includ ing,but not limited to title vii of the civil rights act of,as amended,state discrimination statutes,state statutes common law regulating employment termination,the law of contract or the law of tort including,but not limited to,claims for wrongful discharge and intentional negligent infliction of emotional distress or defamation.statutory or common law claims alleging that circuit city retaliated or discriminated against an associate shall be subject to arbitration.
the agreement contained a statement that signing the agreement was a condition of being considered for employment by circuit city,and that arbitration would be conducted in accordance with the circuit city dispute resolution rules and procedures the arbitration procedures.lewis signed this statement.he does not dispute that he received notice of the procedures.the procedures specified that although the substantive law of the state in which lewis was employed would apply to any claims raised in arbitration,decisions and awards would be enforceable through the federal arbitration act faa,et,and the uniform arbitration act of virginia,ann,et.
procedural history 
lewis submitted an arbitration request form in april,identifying his intended counsel as david alegria.in this form,he claimed that he was fired because he had informed his supervisor that my knee had been hurt at work and i needed medical attention.he requested that his position be restored with back pay.this form,which he signed,stated that he agreed to accept the decision and award of the arbitrator as final and binding.lewis submitted another arbitration request form in august,which included more details about the nature of his complaint,made specific claims under the kansas act against discrimination.stat.ann,et,and title vii of the civil rights act,et,and made a generalized claim for retaliatory discharge under state law lewis requested five years worth of annual compensation totaling,medical reimbursement,for emotional distress,unspecified punitive damages,and attorneys fees.this request,prepared by alegria,did not include the statement agreeing to accept the decision and award of the arbitrator.
the arbitration hearing commenced february,and ended february.pursuant to the procedures,a single arbitrator heard the matter.while it is not clear what the full extent of discovery was,or the nature of the hearing,the record includes a set of interrogatories completed by lewis,several references to witness testimony,an acknowledgment of evidence and briefs,and an apparently unsuccessful attempt to subpoena guerrero for the hearing.
the arbitrator issued a decision on april,that addressed lewis title vii and retaliatory discharge claims.specifically with respect to retaliatory discharge,the arbitrator cited to ortega ibp,which stated that kansas courts recognize the tort in the context of worker compensation filings and concluded that a plaintiff must establish that claim by a preponderance of the evidence,but the evidence must be clear and convincing in nature.noting that n umerous case decisions from state and federal kansas courts follow the requirements set forth in the united states supreme court decision of mcdonnell douglas green,d,for both claims of discrimination under the civil rights act of,and retaliatory discharge claims,the arbitrator proceeded to analyze the facts of the case and concluded that circuit city reason for termination was not mere pretext for discrimination or retaliation the arbitrator ruled that circuit city was justified in terminating lewis because it had interpreted the weapons policy in good faith.the arbitrator noted that it was possible that circuit city management misapplied the policy,but relied on sanchez philip morris,cir,which states that title vii is not violated by the exercise of erroneous or even illogical business judgment.although circuit city procedures permitted the arbitrator to shift the costs of the arbitration from circuit city to the claimant if he should lose,the arbitrator declined to do so in lewis case 
in december,the same counsel he used in suit against circuit city in kansas state court alleging wrongful termination based upon retaliation for exercising statutory rights under the kansas workers compensation act.lewis stated that he ha d exhausted his arbitration remedies,and contended that under kansas law,the tort of retaliatory discharge is a right inappropriate for resolution by arbitration.circuit city removed to federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy pursuant to.circuit city then filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that because lewis agreed to final and binding arbitration,he could not seek a second bite at the apple on the very same claim in court.the district court converted circuit city motion to a motion for summary judgment,and,after the requisite briefing,granted the motion.the court decided that lewis had not alleged any of the narrow bases permitted by the faa for vacating or modifying an arbitration award,and that he had missed the faa deadline for filing such a suit by several months.the court thus concluded that lewis suit improperly sought to relitigate a claim after a final judgment.lewis circuit city stores,wl.this timely appeal followed.

construction of lewis complaint 
lewis complaint brings a claim for relief based on the tort of retaliatory discharge,and lewis consistently represented to the district court that this was the nature of his claim.therefore,we construe his cause of action as the common law tort of retaliation for seeking workers compensation benefits,recognized by kansas courts as an exception to the doctrine.see coleman safeway stores,emphasizing the tort nature of the employee cause of action and the strong public policy of kansas underlying the workers compensation act,disapproved of on other grounds by cent.reg l juvenile facility.we observe that although lewis alleges he was retaliated against for exercising his statutory rights under the kansas workers compensation act,he provides no citation or argument that the act itself provides a cause of action for retaliatory discharge 
lewis complaint does not mention the faa or acknowledge the arbitration agreement generally.instead,lewis insists that under kansas law,he has a legal right to his day in court,citing coleman.notably,lewis does not argue that his complaint is intended to seek review of the arbitration decision under the limited grounds afforded by the faa in fact,lewis specifically conceded before the district court that t he admittedly narrow and strictly limited standards of appeal of an arbitrator decision made an appeal futile.before us,lewis does not appeal the district court conclusion that he did not avail himself of review under the faa,a petition that would have been untimely anyway pursuant to the deadline in.as such,we construe this action purely as one seeking to litigate a claim of retaliatory discharge under state tort law.
applicability of claim preclusion 
the doctrine of res judicata,or claim preclusion,will prevent a party from relitigating a legal claim that was or could have been the subject of a previously issued final judgment.mactec,gorelick,cir,cert.denied,d.in deciding the effect of a federal diversity judgment,we generally adopt the law that would be applied by state courts in the state in which the federal diversity court sits.hartsel springs ranch of,bluegreen,cir quoting matosantos commercial applebee int l,cir.the parties have not addressed the provisions in the arbitration agreement,specifically whether virginia or kansas doctrine of claim preclusion applies to enforcement of the arbitration award.we do not need to resolve this issue here because,under the law of either jurisdiction,lewis judicial claim against circuit city seeking damages for retaliatory discharge would be barred.
there is no dispute that lewis previously brought an action against the same party,complaining of the same wrongful discharge based on pursuit of worker compensation benefits,which resulted in a final arbitration decision on the matter.virginia doctrine of claim preclusion prevents relitigation of the same cause of action,or any part thereof which could have been litigated,between the same parties and their privies.bill greever tazewell bank.similarly,kansas law prevents lewis from proceeding with his claim anew.the doctrine of res judicata is a bar to a second action upon the same claim,demand or cause of action.in re estate of reed.the fact that lewis was ambiguous as to the legal source of his right of action for retaliatory discharge during arbitration does not undermine our conclusion that he brought the same claim then as he does now,particularly given that the arbitrator invoked kansas law on the tort of retaliatory discharge in deciding that lewis has not met his burden of proving retaliation.
furthermore,courts in both jurisdictions have applied claim preclusion to litigation subsequent to final and valid arbitration awards.see,waterfront marine,end sandbridge bulkhead groups a,b and c,merrill lynch,d.this court also has held that the doctrine applies to arbitration decisions.see mactec,at as for finality,a valid and final award by arbitration generally has the same effect under the rules of res judicata as a judgment of a court.
lewis judicial claim against circuit city seeking damages for retaliatory discharge fits squarely within claim preclusion although his arguments are vague and unstructured,he apparently seeks to avoid claim preclusion through two theories designed to undermine the finality of the arbitration decision first,that his arbitration agreement with circuit city was never valid under contract law and second,that kansas public policy prevents enforcement of the arbitration award.with regard to the first argument,we determine that he has waived it by proceeding without objection through arbitration.with regard to the second,we conclude that controlling precedent precludes the application of the public policy exception to judicial enforcement of arbitration awards to the facts of this case.
lewis argument that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable 
lewis argued to the district court that his arbitration agreement with circuit city was unenforceable as a matter of basic contract law.he continues to press this argument on appeal.we conclude that lewis waived this argument by proceeding with arbitration without placing any objection clearly on the record prior to or during the arbitration proceeding.
section of the faa provides that arbitration agreements shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.the supreme court has held that state contract law can therefore invalidate such agreements if that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity,revocability,and enforceability of contracts generally.doctor,casarotto,d quotation,emphasis omitted.thus,generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening.id.at.
the supreme court has observed that to the extent parties forcefully object to the arbitrators deciding their dispute,they preserve their objection even if they follow through with arbitration.first options of chicago,kaplan,d accord coady ashcraft gerel,cir finding no waiver when the party consistently and vigorously maintained its objection to the scope of arbitration china minmetals materials imp.exp,chi mei,cir same.
on the other hand,many courts have held that,absent an explicit statement objecting to the arbitrability of the dispute,a party can not await the outcome and then later argue that the arbitrator lacked authority to decide the matter.agco anglin,cir see also opals on ice lingerie,designs by bernadette,bodylines,cir i f a party participates in arbitration proceedings without making a timely objection to the submission of the dispute to arbitration,that party may be found to have waived its right to object to the arbitration.slaney int amateur athletic fed n,cir slaney could not sit back and allow the arbitration to go forward,and only after it was all done say oh by the way,we never agreed to the arbitration clause.that is a tactic that the law of arbitration,with its commitment to speed,will not tolerate.quotation omitted fortune,alsweet eldridge,daniel,cir per curiam holding that a party may not submit a claim to arbitration and then challenge the authority of the arbitrator to act after receiving an unfavorable result because it would frustrate th e policy behind arbitration.
we have not published an opinion regarding whether a party failure to raise a question of the enforceability of an arbitration agreement,followed by the party participation in arbitration,effectively waives that party right to object to arbitration however,in reviewing supreme court precedent and persuasive authority from other circuits,it is clear that our usual rules regarding waiver and estoppel apply to prevent a party from complaining about the enforceability of an arbitration agreement if he already has fully participated in arbitration without any relevant objection.in particular,a rule of waiver is important to advance the goals of arbitration as an efficient method of dispute resolution for which parties may contract in advance.it would be unreasonable and unjust to allow a party to challenge the legitimacy of the arbitration process,in which he had voluntarily participated over a period of several months fortune,alsweet eldridge,at.
lewis states that he objected to arbitration,that he never had a choice to opt out,and that he made it clear that he did not want to arbitrate.he points to a blank dispute resolution agreement that he and his attorney allegedly refused to sign.he also states that he followed through with arbitration to comply with defendant demands for arbitration and to exhaust such process.
but,importantly,at oral argument,lewis conceded that he had not expressly challenged the enforceability of the agreement during arbitration.the record here reveals only a general complaint about having to arbitrate,and is devoid of an objection to any legal aspect of the arbitration agreement or to the enforceability of the agreement generally.a party bare statement that he does not want to arbitrate a dispute is,of course,not a legal argument or objection,but instead merely signals buyer remorse that he agreed at the outset to arbitrate future disputes.furthermore,the evidence belies lewis claim that he never voluntarily agreed to arbitrate his employment claims,because he twice completed and signed arbitration request forms,the second time through counsel.
because lewis never adequately objected in arbitration to the arbitrability of his claims or raised a question as to the validity of the arbitration agreement,he waived his opportunity to do so and is estopped from raising such issues now 
lewis argument that kansas public policy prohibits enforcement of the arbitration award 
mindful of the strong federal policy favoring arbitration,a court may grant a motion to vacate an arbitration award only in the limited circumstances provided in of the faa,or in accordance with a few judicially created exceptions.bowen amoco pipeline,cir citations omitted.those judicially created exceptions apply to awards that violate explicit public policy,derive from a manifest disregard of the law,or were the result of an unfair hearing.denver rio grande union pac,cir citing grace local union,d.lewis contends that the arbitration award violates kansas public policy and therefore is void we conclude that controlling precedent from the united states and kansas supreme courts renders lewis argument meritless.
the public policy exception to enforcing arbitration awards is rooted in the common law that a court may refuse to enforce contracts that violate law or public policy.united paperworkers int l union misco,d.the supreme court has cautioned that a court refusal to enforce an arbitrator interpretation of such contracts is limited to situations where the contract as interpreted would violate some explicit public policy that is well defined and dominant,and is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests.id.at.quoting grace,at.emphasis omitted.we have emphasized the narrow application of the public policy exception,keeping in mind the admonition that an arbitration award is not to be lightly overturned.seymour blue shield,cir.specifically,we have observed that a party does not establish a public policy violation sufficient to overturn an arbitrator award if the arbitrator decision does not violate a clearly expressed law.id.at.if an arbitrator could have reasonably construed the facts of the case to eliminate such a conflict with established law,then the public policy exception does not apply.id.
lewis argues that kansas public policy allows him to file a retaliatory discharge tort claim independent of arbitration however,the kansas supreme court has held that where the faa applies to an arbitration agreement,it preempts any state law that otherwise might invalidate such an agreement.skewes shearson lehman.
the kansas uniform arbitration act kuaa provides that contract provisions requiring the parties to arbitrate future disputes are enforceable.stat.ann.b,but provides an exception for contracts between an employer and employees,or any provision of a contract providing for arbitration of a claim in tort,id.c.based on this statute and state public policy,the kansas supreme court held in coleman safeway stores,that a contract to arbitrate in the collective bargaining context did not preclude a labor worker from bringing an independent tort action in court for retaliatory discharge.the coleman court echoed the distinction the supreme court has drawn between direct arbitrations and those that are led by the employee labor union pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement,see gilmer,at,and concluded that t he potential result of a union emphasis on the collective good is that,in some cases,the employee may be left without a remedy for an employer violation of state public policy.coleman,at.lewis similarly points to hysten burlington santa fe ry,a case allowing an employee to file suit claiming retaliation after he already arbitrated the issue pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement,as support for the policy of the right to file retaliation claims independent of arbitration.
however,we have no doubt that when the faa applies to an arbitration agreement,the faa preempts conflicting state law and will enforce the agreement.in enacting of the federal arbitration act,congress declared a national policy favoring arbitration and withdrew the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration.southland keating,d.we see nothing in the act indicating that the broad principle of enforceability is subject to any additional limitations under state law.id.at.see also perry thomas,d same.
