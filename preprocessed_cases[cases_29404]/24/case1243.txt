california law is clear that arbitrators do not exceed their powers merely by rendering an erroneous decision on a legal or factual issue,so long as the issue was within the scope of the controversy submitted to the arbitrators.moshonov walsh cal th,moshonov.in this case,the potential applicability of the definition of prevailing party contained in section,subdivision b was plainly within the scope of the controversy submitted to the arbitrator.in fact,the record unambiguously demonstrates that safari and tarlov extensively briefed this very issue in the arbitration.in addition,there is no provision in the parties arbitration agreement that explicitly and unambiguously limited the arbitrator power to determine the applicability of section in awarding attorney fees.gueyffier ann summers,cal th,gueyffier.under these circumstances,the arbitrator acted within the scope of his powers in applying the definition of prevailing party found in section,subdivision b in awarding safari attorney fees.further,any error that the arbitrator may have committed would constitute legal error,which is not subject to correction in the trial court.
accordingly,we grant safari petition and direct the trial court to vacate its order correcting the arbitration award,and to conduct further proceedings,consistent with this opinion,on safari petition to confirm the award.
factual and procedural backgrounda.the release agreement containing the arbitration provision 
tarlov is the former managing general partner of safari.safari and tarlov entered into a release agreement agreement to resolve certain claims relating to tarlov management of safari.
the agreement specified that safari claims for reimbursement of monies paid by safari for the personal expenses of tarlov or tarlov family were not subject to the release,and that the parties would make a good faith effort to resolve these personal expense claims.the agreement further provided that the parties would submit any unresolved disputes concerning the personal expenses to binding arbitration pursuant to the following arbitration provision

another provision of the agreement provided that the agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of california.
b.the arbitration 
the parties were unable to resolve all of their disputes concerning the personal expense claims.thus,pursuant to the agreement,they submitted those claims to arbitration.in its arbitration brief,safari argued that tarlov was required to pay,at a minimum,to reimburse safari for tarlov personal expenses that safari had paid.the arbitrator conducted an arbitration hearing,and issued an interim award determining that tarlov was required to pay to safari.
both safari and tarlov filed a motion for attorney fees,each arguing that it was the prevailing party.in its brief,safari explained that section,subdivision b provides that the party prevailing on the contract shall be the party who recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract,while the agreement states that prevailing party means the party,if any,that obtains substantially the relief sought in the arbitration.italics added.safari argued that section not the prevailing party provision of the agreement must control,because under case law,any definition of prevailing party,inconsistent with the definition contained in section is void.safari further contended that it was the prevailing party because the arbitrator found that tarlov must repay more than less an offset for money admittedly wrongly taken,and thus,safari was the party who recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract.quoting,subd.b.
in his brief,tarlov argued that the arbitrator was required to apply the definition of prevailing party specified in paragraph of the agreement.tarlov further argued that,applying this definition,he was the prevailing party because he obtained substantially the relief sought in the arbitration.in support of this argument,tarlov contended that safari had obtained only a small percentage of the damages that it had sought in the arbitration.
after further briefing,the arbitrator issued a final award in favor of safari in the amount of.the final award included the in damages,as well as in attorney fees and in costs.in the award,the arbitrator determined that section is applicable to the action between safari and tarlov.the arbitrator further concluded,the definition of prevailing party in section,subdivision b is controlling over the definition found in the agreement.citations.l anguage in the attorney fee provision that conflicts with the prevailing party definition is void.citation.finally,the arbitrator found that safari recovered a greater relief on the contract,and that safari was therefore the prevailing party.
c.the parties pleadings in the trial court 
safari filed a petition in the trial court to confirm and enter judgment on the arbitration award.
in response,tarlov filed a motion to modify or correct the arbitration award pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,on the ground that the arbitrator had exceeded his powers ibid.in awarding safari attorney fees.specifically,tarlov argued that the arbitrator exceeded his powers in awarding attorney fees by applying the definition of prevailing party in civil code section,subdivision b,rather than the definition of prevailing party provided in the agreement.tarlov contended that an arbitrator power is confined by the express limitations of the arbitration agreement,and that when an arbitrator acts in disregard of such an express provision,he or she acts in excess of his or her powers.tarlov maintained that the arbitrator in this case had acted in excess of his powers through his decision to void the prevailing party definition in the agreement.tarlov supported his motion with numerous documents from the arbitration,including the briefing that the parties had submitted to the arbitrator,in which they addressed which definition of prevailing party the arbitrator was to apply in determining whether,to whom,to award attorney fees.
safari filed an opposition to tarlov motion in which it argued that the law is clear that an issue submitted in arbitration is immune from judicial correction pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.specifically,safari argued,w hen the parties submit the issue of prevailing party and attorney fee entitlement to an arbitrator,and the arbitrator interprets their agreement and awards fees,or does not,that decision whether factually or legally correct,whether even reversible error in civil litigation is not subject to correction under code of civil procedure section as made in excess of the arbitrator powers.safari contended that the parties had submitted the issue of their entitlement to attorney fees to the arbitrator,and that the trial court was therefore without authority to correct the arbitrator attorney fees award.in the alternative,safari argued that the arbitrator had properly applied the definition of prevailing party contained in section,subdivision b in awarding attorney fees.
d.the trial court ruling 
the trial court held a hearing on safari petition to confirm the arbitration award and tarlov motion to correct the award.at the conclusion of the hearing,the trial court entered an order correcting the award and remanding the matter to the arbitrator for further proceedings.in its order,the trial court ruled that t he arbitrator finding that civil code section is applicable to the arbitration proceeding and that the definition of prevailing party in civil code section,subdivision b is controlling over the definition found in the release agreement para are subject to judicial review the court further concluded that,the arbitrator finding that civil code section is applicable to the arbitration proceeding was in error.the court corrected the arbitration award by stating that the definition of prevailing party in paragraph of the release agreement must be applied,and remanded the matter to the arbitrator to determine the prevailing party,if any,and the amount of attorney fees and costs to be awarded the prevailing party,if any.

governing law 
code of civil procedure section specifies the grounds upon which a trial court shall correct an arbitrator award.that statute provides in relevant part 
t he court,unless it vacates the award pursuant to section,shall correct the award and confirm it as corrected if the court determines that 
b the arbitrators exceeded their powers but the award may be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted 
in gueyffier,supra,cal th,the supreme court outlined the following law governing the question whether an arbitrator has exceeded his powers in rendering an arbitration award such that the award is subject to correction pursuant to code of civil procedure section 
when parties contract to resolve their disputes by private arbitration,their agreement ordinarily contemplates that the arbitrator will have the power to decide any question of contract interpretation,historical fact or general law necessary,in the arbitrator understanding of the case,to reach a decision.citations.inherent in that power is the possibility the arbitrator may err in deciding some aspect of the case.arbitrators do not ordinarily exceed their contractually created powers simply by reaching an erroneous conclusion on a contested issue of law or fact,and arbitral awards may not ordinarily be vacated because of such error,for t he arbitrator resolution of these issues is what the parties bargained for in the arbitration agreement.citation.
an exception to the general rule assigning broad powers to the arbitrators arises when the parties have,in either the contract or an agreed submission to arbitration,explicitly and unambiguously limited those powers.citation.the powers of an arbitrator derive from,and are limited by,the agreement to arbitrate.citation.awards in excess of those powers may,under sections and,be corrected or vacated by the court.citation.the scope of an arbitrator authority is not so broad as to include an award of remedies expressly forbidden by the arbitration agreement or submission.citation.gueyffier,supra,at.
applying this law,the gueyffier court considered whether an arbitrator exceeded his powers by rendering an award that included a finding that a party failure to comply with a provision in the parties agreement was excused.the provision provided this is a material term of this agreement and may not be modified or changed by any arbitrator in an arbitration proceeding or otherwise.gueyffier,supra,cal th at.the gueyffier court concluded that despite this limitation on the arbitrator powers,the arbitrator had not exceeded his powers,reasoning 
while the contract limitation on arbitral powers to change the parties agreement was explicit,it did not unambiguously prohibit the arbitrator from excusing performance of a contractual condition where the arbitrator concluded performance would have been an idle act.the contract provision would have been effective to bar an actual change or modification.had the arbitrator,for example,decided the parties agreement should be reformed by changing the required days notice to days notice,he would have exceeded his powers.but to excuse performance of a contract term in a specific factual setting is not,in ordinary usage at least,to modif y or change the term.the clause did not explicitly and unambiguously ccitation bar the arbitrator from deciding that the provision was inapplicable on the facts of the case as he found them.id.at.
in a footnote following this language,the gueyffier court added,had the parties wished to mandate that performance of material conditions never be excused,they could have done so by,for example,expressly agreeing that the arbitrator would have no power to modify,change or excuse performance of a material term.gueyffier,supra,cal th at,fn,italics added.
the supreme court has squarely rejected the argument that there is a distinction in the law governing the scope of an arbitrator powers between the substantive merits of the arbitrated controversy and the ancillary question of costs,including attorney fees.moore first bank of san luis obispo cal th,moore see moshonov,supra,cal th at.as the moore c
