plaintiff thomas fair appeals the trial court denial of his motion to compel arbitration.the motion was based on an arbitration clause in a document that was signed at the conclusion of mediation by plaintiff and defendants karl bakhtiari bakhtiari and maryann fair maryann fair,as well as by defendants stonesfair financial corporation sfc,stonesfair management company,llc smc,and stonesfair corporation sc collectively stonesfair entities.plaintiff contends this document constitutes a valid,admissible settlement agreement between the parties and the trial court erred in ruling to the contrary.we find the trial court erred in denying the motion to compel arbitration because the settlement agreement satisfies a statutory exception to the inadmissibility of written or oral communications made during mediation,and the settlement agreement contains a valid agreement between the parties to arbitrate all disputes.we therefore shall reverse.

in early april,the attorneys for the various defendants filed with the trial court case conference questionnaires,in which they stated,after days of mediation,the case has settled.the settlement agreement is being circulated for approval and a request for dismissal with prejudice will be filed.
counsel for the stonesfair entities also drafted a document entitled settlement agreement and general release,which plaintiff counsel received on april.
at an april,hearing,counsel for bakhtiari informed the trial court that this matter was mediated on march the and.we reached a settlement agreement.we are now in the process of exchanging settlement agreements.and there are some complicated taxation matters involved.all counsel then requested a continuance,which the court granted,stating,if it settled and there a dismissal on file,you need not come in.the trial court also granted a request by plaintiff counsel to continue plaintiff time to respond to defendants for days.

on september,plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
plaintiff contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to compel arbitration pursuant to code of civil procedure section 
in its order denying plaintiff motion to compel arbitration,the court first sustained defendants objections to admission of the settlement terms document into evidence,citing evidence code section and stating that section has not been satisfied and the exceptions do not apply.there is no waiver.the court also sustained defendants objection to admission of a paragraph of plaintiff counsel declaration,in which he stated the intent of mediator lynch and all counsel involved in drafting the settlement terms document was for that document to be a binding,enforceable agreement.finally,the court denied plaintiff motion to compel arbitration,stating,there is insufficient demonstration of an arbitration agreement given the inadmissibility of the term sheet.further,condee longwood management th,d condee is distinguishable as the public policy factors underlying mediation are not involved.
in deciding whether the trial court should have granted plaintiff motion to compel arbitration,we must determine,first,whether the settlement terms document satisfies any of section exceptions to the confidentiality requirements of section and,if so,whether the arbitration provision in the settlement terms document constitutes a valid agreement to arbitrate disputes.
applicable standard of review 
the threshold question regarding whether the settlement terms it does in fact constitute an agreement between the any of the exceptions in section to the inadmissibility of settlement agreements reached during mediation,is subject to de novo review,since reviewing courts independently determine the proper interpretation of a statute.burden snowden cal th,d.likewise,
