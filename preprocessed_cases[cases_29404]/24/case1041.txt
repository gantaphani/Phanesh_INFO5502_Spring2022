rex shrum is both a law enforcement officer and a clergyman.after eight apparently successful years of juggling the two responsibilities,his relationship with the management of the police department soured,and the chief of police allegedly rearranged officer shrum work schedule so it would conflict with his duties as a minister.forced to choose between his police and his ministerial responsibilities,officer shrum resigned from the police department and filed this lawsuit.we must now decide whether the city of coweta and the chief of police violated officer shrum constitutional rights to freedom of association,free exercise of religion,and substantive due process.
factual background 
rex shrum has served as pastor of the coweta church of christ,in eastern oklahoma,since april.in,he joined the police force of the city of coweta.he arranged with his new employer to give him wednesday evenings and sundays off,so that he could continue to carry out his ministerial duties.he worked the day shift monday through friday as a detective.officer shrum was also a member of the local lodge of the fraternal order of police fop,which was the certified bargaining agent for its members in the coweta police department.
problems arose over officer shrum time sheets.he was supposed to put his time sheets in the report box of assistant chief of police derrick palmer on friday night,before leaving for the weekend,so the time sheets would be submitted by the monday morning deadline.officer shrum had repeatedly turned in time sheets late and had been reprimanded several times.on monday morning,june,the records clerk in the police department could not find officer shrum time sheet for the previous week.on this occasion officer shrum denied any wrongdoing.another officer,sergeant mike sullivan,stated that he saw officer shrum time sheet in assistant chief palmer box.nevertheless,officer shrum was suspended by the department for three days without pay.his suspension was announced in a letter from assistant chief palmer,dated june,which warned that further infractions would lead to progressive disciplinary action.officer shrum filed a grievance,which the city denied and which was submitted to arbitration on september,in accordance with the agreement between the city and the fop.
on october,officer shrum was again suspended by assistant chief palmer.this time,for submitting his time sheet late,he was suspended for five days without pay and put on probation for six months.officer shrum again filed a grievance.this grievance was later settled,with the city agreeing to pay officer shrum for the days he was suspended.
in early officer shrum was reassigned to work as a patrolman under sergeant joe gist.in the new position he would continue on the day shift but would not have sundays off.to clear sundays for his ministerial duties,officer shrum asked sergeant gist for permission to move to the evening or midnight shift.sergeant gist agreed,provided that officer shrum could arrange with the evening or midnight shift supervisor to have an officer replace him on the day shift.officer shrum made the necessary arrangements with sergeant sullivan,who was the midnight shift supervisor and also the president of the fop lodge.another officer moved to the day shift officer shrum worked the midnight shift and was off sundays and mondays.
on january,officer shrum received his performance review.in his review of officer shrum six months earlier,assistant chief palmer had marked two of the twelve evaluated areas as ones where improvement is necessary adherence to policy and interpersonal relationship.his new supervisor,sergeant gist,conducted the january review and marked the same two areas unsatisfactory.in explaining the rating for adherence to policy,sergeant gist noted that officer shrum had been disciplined this period.however,he has not had any problems recently.for interpersonal relationship,sergeant gist wrote that a situation with officer shrum had go ne bad with another supervisor in the presence of subordinate employees.employee seems to have now resolved that situation.assistant chief palmer signed and approved the performance review.
on january,the arbitrator reached a decision in the first dispute.the arbitrator found that officer shrum had not been late in submitting his time sheet due on june,and that the city violated the agreement by suspending him.the arbitrator directed the city to rescind its discipline in every respect,to make officer shrum whole,to eliminate any record of this discipline from his personnel file,and never to consider the event to officer shrum detriment.two weeks later,palmer,who had been promoted to chief of police,wrote to whitlock,the city manager,advising him to resist the arbitrator decision until compelled by a court to comply.in his letter to whitlock,chief palmer did not deny the substance of officer shrum allegations he insisted rather that the grievance was not timely filed.meanwhile,officer shrum continued to work the midnight shift with sundays and mondays off,under the arrangement worked out with sergeant gist and sergeant sullivan.
on march,chief palmer wrote to sergeant gist that he was very concerned about officer shrum performance level.chief palmer directed sergeant gist to assign officer shrum to the day shift for a minimum of days so he could receive remedial training in supervision,ethics and interpersonal relationships.at his deposition,chief palmer could not recall the specific problems with officer shrum performance or the specific remedial training that was needed.chief palmer did recall that if officer shrum failed to work sundays under this new arrangement,he could be fired.
remedial training was also ordered for sergeant sullivan,who had testified in officer shrum favor at arbitration.sergeant sullivan received a negative review in february,was demoted and assigned remedial training in march,and was fired in april.an arbitrator ordered his reinstatement and called the case a classic example of what not to do when administering discipline.the arbitrator later reiterated the order and found that sergeant sullivan halting reinstatement had been marked by the taint of retaliation.
on march,two days after the letter from chief palmer,sergeant gist instructed officer shrum to begin working the day shift on march.concerned about a conflict with his ministerial duties,officer shrum asked sergeant gist whether he could continue to have sundays off.the parties dispute sergeant gist answer.the defendants maintain that sergeant gist told officer shrum that he could not take sundays off because a more senior officer had selected that day,and according to the agreement were selected by seniority.officer shrum evidence is quite different.he submitted a deposition of sergeant gist to the effect that another officer was willing to trade sunday shifts with officer shrum.according to sergeant gist,chief palmer disapproved,insisting that officer shrum work on sundays so that he could be monitored.
on march,officer shrum wrote a resignation letter to chief palmer,effective april.in the letter,officer shrum described his hiring in as being done with the understanding by both the chief of police,and the city manager that my responsibilities at the church had to be met,and he described the ease with which his ministerial duties had been accommodated.according to officer shrum,in his eight years on the force he had created no problems and caused no complaints from other officers.nevertheless,officer shrum said he was resigning because of chief palmer continued religious harassment by forcing me to work on sunday you have given me no other choice.
on august,officer shrum filed this suit in federal district court.he brought many claims violations of his federal constitutional rights of free speech,freedom of,and free exercise of religion violation of the oklahoma fire and police arbitration act wrongful termination against public policy violation of the oklahoma constitution lack of substantive due process intentional infliction of emotional distress and violation of the oklahoma religious freedom act.officer shrum sought actual and compensatory damages from the city and actual,compensatory,and punitive damages from chief palmer and from the city manager,whitlock,both of whom he sued in their individual capacities.
by consent of the parties,the case was presided over by a magistrate judge,whose decision will be referred to as that of the district court.see.c.the defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.the district court granted the motion in part,dismissing all claims against whitlock on qualified immunity grounds,dismissing the first amendment free speech claim and the equivalent claim under the state constitution,dismissing the claim under the oklahoma fire and police arbitration act,and dismissing the state tort law claims of wrongful termination and intentional infliction of emotional distress.the district court allowed officer shrum to proceed against the city and against chief palmer on three of his federal of association,free exercise of religion,and substantive due on the state law claims that track them.chief palmer appeals the partial denial of his motion for summary judgment on the federal constitutional claims on qualified immunity grounds.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
orders denying qualified immunity before trial are appealable only to the extent they resolve abstract issues of law.behrens pelletier,d.an interlocutory appeal is improper when the question is the sufficiency of the evidence or the correctness of the district court findings with respect to a genuine issue of material fact.johnson jones,d.because chief palmer argues that he is entitled to qualified immunity even under the plaintiff version of the facts,we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal notwithstanding its interlocutory character.deanzona city of denver,cir.our inquiry on interlocutory qualified immunity appeals is limited,however,to abstract issues of law.johnson,at.we must take,as given,the facts that the district court assumed when it denied summary judgment to the defendant.id.at.
government officials are entitled to qualified immunity from liability for civil damages under when their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.we review de novo a denial of a summary judgment motion raising qualified immunity questions.holland ex rel.overdorff harrington,cir.once a defense of qualified immunity has been raised,we consider two questions whether the alleged conduct violated a constitutional right,and if so,whether the law was clearly established at the time of the defendant actions.saucier katz,d.we address each of these questions for officer shrum claims of freedom of association,free exercise,and substantive due process.
iii.freedom of association 
officer shrum first claim against chief palmer is based on interference with his first amendment freedom of,his association with a labor union,the fraternal order of police.he alleges that the defendants assigned him to sunday duty in retaliation for his membership in the union and his invocation of his collective bargaining rights 
in the slightly different context of free speech claims by public employees,the supreme court has formulated the balancing test of pickering bd.of education,d see connick myers,d.one requirement for such a claim is that the speech address a matter of public concern.id.at.neither this court nor the supreme court has determined,as a general matter,whether pickering public concern requirement applies to freedom of association claims.see schalk gallemore,cir requiring public concern where the association was nothing more nor less than an audience for the employee speech but explicitly declining to hold that public concern is always required flanagan munger,cir expressing some doubt whether the pickering test,particularly the public concern prong,applies in freedom of association cases 
that question has divided the courts of appeals in this case,however,we need not reach the broader question.in the specific context of public employee labor unions,this court has rejected the requirement that a worker demonstrate that his association with the union be a matter of public concern.in butcher city of mcalester,we upheld a jury verdict in favor of a public employee union member freedom of association claim without applying the public concern test.three firemen sued the city of mcalester,oklahoma,for violating their first amendment right to participate in union activities.id.at styling the constitutional interest a first amendment right to peaceably assemble and to participate in the activities of local.among other arguments,the city insisted that the firemen had no constitutional claim because their union activities were not protected under pickering.id.at.we rejected that argument.id.at.see also morfin albuquerque pub,cir reversing a grant of summary judgment to a defendant on a union association claim without applying the public concern test.
in these cases we offered no lengthy explanation for not applying the public concern test,but we did emphasize the character of the agreement.we noted that the city had no license,where there is a agreement,to embark on activities.butcher,at.the reason is apparent.the pickering test is predicated on the government interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees,which differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general.pickering,at.those interests relate to the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.id.where a public employer has negotiated with an employee union and signed a agreement,it has contractually agreed to the legitimacy of the union and of its employees association with the union.the public employer has presumably received the benefit of its bargain,and is estopped from claiming that its interests as an employer are inconsistent with the freedom of its employees to associate with the union or to file grievances in accordance with its procedures.see butcher,at once a public employer signs a collective bargaining agreement,it no longer can assert a legitimate interest in whether its firefighters elected to join the union and participate in its activities.if a public employer retaliates against an employee for engaging in acts protected by the officer shrum alleges the employer can not rely on the pickering test to avoid first amendment scrutiny.
not only does the first amendment freedom of association protect public employees from retaliation for participation in a union with which their employers have signed a agreement,butcher,at,but as this court held in morfin,at,t he unconstitutionality of retaliating against an employee for participating in a union is clearly established.we therefore affirm the district court denial of summary judgment on officer shrum freedom of association claim.
on remand,the district court should neither require public concern nor engage in judicial balancing of the government interest in efficient operations against the officer shrum interest in union association.the city of coweta already balanced those interests when it agreed to a collective bargaining agreement.the defendants are estopped from reneging on this agreement,either by claiming that union association is not a matter of public concern or by saying that its interest in efficient operations outweighs officer shrum right to union association.
iv.free exercise of religion 
the district court also denied chief palmer motion for summary judgment on officer shrum free exercise claim,based on qualified immunity.the court offered two rationales.first,it noted that at least one court has found any religious activities of employees that can be accommodated without undue hardship to the governmental employer,see j,are also protected by the first amendment.order,at quoting brown polk county,iowa,cir en banc.second,the court noted that there is a factual dispute regarding whether officer shrum attempted exercise of his religious freedoms guaranteed by the first amendment,and defendants knowledge of that attempt,was a motivating factor in the actions taken against him.id.chief palmer urges two grounds for reversing the district court denial of summary judgment.
applicability of the free exercise clause to executive action 
chief palmer first offers the intriguing assertion that the free exercise clause protects citizens only from enactment or enforcement of any law,regulation or ordinance,and not from the actions or decisions of an executive official,such as the decision to move officer shrum to the day shift and to forbid him from trading shifts with another officer.this argument is predicated on a narrow reading of the first and fifth words of the first amendment congress shall make no law,amend.congress is the legislative branch,and the amendment is directed at the making of law.even after incorporation of the first amendment against the states,appellant evidently is arguing,the amendment applies only to federal,state,and local legislative activity and the direct enforcement thereof,and not to the independent exercise of executive functions.
the supreme court has never explicitly held that the free exercise clause applies to executive action,though it has assumed on countless occasions that it does.see,lyng nw.indian cemetery protective ass n,d decision by forest service to build a road through territory sacred to certain indian tribes thomas review bd.of.employment sec,d decision by state unemployment compensation commission to deny benefits to a worker unemployed on account of religious scruples cruz beto,d administrative actions by prison officials affecting buddhist prisoner sherbert verner,d denial of unemployment compensation pickering,supra free speech claim arising from executive personnel action see also johnson,cir reviewing executive action under the free exercise clause.professor leonard levy posed the question without offering any clear resolution 
t he first amendment,when read literally,raises the question whether any special significance should be attached to the fact that the prohibition on power was imposed exclusively upon congress instead of upon the government of the united states.did the specification of congress imply that restraints were not intended to be imposed upon other federal authorities 
leonard levy,legacy of suppression freedom of speech and press in early american history emphasis in original.
the answer to chief palmer argument and professor levy question,we believe,is that the first amendment applies to exercises of executive authority no less than it does to the passage of legislation.the drafters use of the term congress was a result of two structural decisions to limit the reach of the first amendment as well as other protections of personal rights in the first eight amendments to the federal government,and to set forth these freedoms as a freestanding bill of rights,separate from the main body of the constitutional document.neither of these evinced any intention to confine the amendment to actions of the legislative branch.
the early state constitutions,on which the first amendment was patterned,uniformly applied their versions of the free exercise clause to all branches of government.see the complete bill of rights the drafts,debates,sources,origins neil cogan,quoting the religious freedom provisions in the constitutions and charters of all thirteen original states.the delaware declaration of rights of,for example,provided that no authority can or ought to be vested in,or assumed by any power whatever that shall in any case interfere with,or in any manner controul the right of conscience in the free exercise of religious worship.id.at emphasis added.the new york constitution of,xxxviii,provided t hat the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship,without discrimination or preference,shall forever hereafter be allowed within this state to all mankind.id.at.the pennsylvania constitution of,art.ix,adopted contemporaneously with the first amendment,provided that no human authority can,in any case whatever,controul or interfere with the rights of conscience.id.at emphasis added.
the first draft debated in the house of representatives of what was later to be the religion clauses read no religion shall be established by law,nor shall the equal rights of conscience be infringed.annals of cong,joseph gales.it was proposed as an amendment to article i,which sets forth limitations on the powers of the federal government.the proposal came under criticism because of the fear that it might be interpreted as a limitation on state governments,many of which then had establishments of religion of some sort.moreover,for independent reasons,the first congress decided that the proposed amendments should be attached to the end of the document,rather than interpolated within it this exacerbated the federalism problem because it was only the placement of the religion amendment within article i,that confined its reach in any way to the federal government.madison suggested that the problem could be most easily resolved by adding the word national to the proposal,so that it would read that no national religion shall be established by law,annals of cong,but this idea encountered opposition from those still sensitive to the consolidationist implications of the word national.see id.at statement of gerry the solution was to employ the word congress,thus making clear that the limitations of what is now the first amendment did not apply to the states.that limitation to the federal government,of course,was later abrogated by incorporation of the first amendment against the states through the medium of the fourteenth amendment.cantwell connecticut.
as this history shows,there was no intention to confine the reach of the first amendment to the legislative branch.indeed,the first time anyone in congress explicitly argued that the strictures of the first amendment applied only to the passage of a law in,in connection with the right of petition the suggestion was roundly rejected with ridicule,according to the leading scholar on constitutional debates in congress.see david currie,the constitution in congress descent into the maelstrom,at.
one scholar has argued that the legislative history of the establishment clause shows that t he word congress was intentionally inserted to limit the scope of the restrictions on the government to that single branch.mark.denbeaux,the first word of the first amendment,nw.professor denbeaux bases his argument on a remark by representative huntington of connecticut,a state that at the time had an establishment of religion in the form of compulsory taxation for the support of religion.see thomas curry,the first freedoms church and state in america to the passage of the first amendment.huntington feared that the original version of the religion amendment would lead to federal lawsuits preventing enforcement of the bylaws that had been enacted for a support of ministers,or building of places of worship.annals of cong.the substitution of the word congress came shortly after huntington remark and can be seen as a response to it.see id.at.we can not agree with professor denbeaux interpretation of this incident.huntington concern stemmed from uncertainty over whether the proposal would extend to state establishments,not over any particular concern about a particular branch of the federal government.at this juncture,the judiciary act had not yet been enacted,and huntington presumably assumed that the federal courts would be vested with the full jurisdiction implied by article all cases arising under the constitution.he thus worried that an opponent of the connecticut establishment could go to federal court,invoke the proposed language no religion shall be established by law,and obtain an injunction or other relief preventing enforcement of the obligation to pay for support of ministers and buildings of worship his concern was satisfied by confining the reach of the religion proposal to the federal government.indeed,after the proposal was further amended to forbid any law respecting the establishment of religion,which prohibited the federal government both from establishing religion at the federal level and from interfering with establishments at the sta
