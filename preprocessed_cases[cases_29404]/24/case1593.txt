we confront what one commentator has characterized as the thorny question of contract construction raised by the generic clause in an agreement calling for the resolution of disputes by arbitration appellant health net of california,health net appeals from the denial of its petition to compel arbitration of the claims of respondent mount diablo medical center and to stay the litigation in which diablo asserts those claims.the trial court denied the petition under code of civil procedure section,subdivision c hereafter section c,finding that the arbitration would create a risk of rulings that conflict with rulings in pending litigation involving third parties.health net contends the clause choosing california law in the contract between the parties does not evince an intention to render their agreement to arbitrate subject to the terms of the california code of civil procedure,so that section c has been preempted by the federal arbitration act,united states code section et.faa,and that the federal statute requires that the arbitration agreement be enforced despite the potential for conflicting results.the trial court read the provision more broadly and therefore rejected this contention.we interpret the authorities on the subject to require the court to look first to the language of the contract to determine what portions of state law the parties intended to incorporate,and then,if any ambiguity exists,to determine whether the provision in question conflicts with the objectives of the faa.under this approach,we conclude that the parties intended to incorporate california procedural law governing the enforcement of their agreement to arbitrate,and that these provisions are not preempted.therefore we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the relevant facts are not controverted.diablo is an acute care hospital located in concord,california.as of june,it entered into a agreement,entitled the health net per diem hospital agreement for diablo medical center health.diablo agreement,with health net,a health care service plan under which health net agreed to pay diablo specified fees for providing health care services to plan members as contemplated by the health.diablo agreement,effective january,health net entered into a third party payor capitation agreement with alta bates medical center alta bates the health bates agreement,under which alta bates agreed to be responsible for providing medical services to health net plan members on the basis of capitated or prepaid rates,as distinguished from rates,with the understanding that alta bates would subcontract its obligations to individual providers or hospitals such as diablo.alta bates in turn had a preexisting hospital participation agreement with diablo,under which diablo agreed to provide covered services at the capitated rates to health net members who selected the alta bates network of providers.as of may,diablo purported to terminate its hospital participation agreement with alta bates.
the underlying controversy relates to who is responsible and in what amounts for services that diablo rendered to health net members after the termination of the hospital participation agreement.diablo complaint asserts several causes of action against health net and alta bates,and also against east bay medical network ebmn,which is the processing agent for alta bates,and against pacificare of california pacificare,another health care service plan with which diablo and alta bates had contractual arrangements similar to those with health net and with which a similar controversy exists.the complaint alleges,among other things,that health net breached the health.diablo agreement by failing to pay diablo at the rate for hospital services rendered health net members between may and december,and it also alleges that alta bates and ebmn breached an oral agreement to pay these same amounts to diablo.the complaint alleges breach of implied contract,open book account,quantum meruit,and unjust enrichment claims against all of the defendants.
the health.diablo agreement contains a broad arbitration agreement,which unquestionably encompasses the present controversy between these two parties the agreement also contains a separate provision concerning choice of law,which reads in relevant part the validity,construction,interpretation and enforcement of this agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of california.the health bates agreement and the hospital participation agreement also contain arbitration provisions,but no party other than health net has attempted to resolve any aspect of the present controversy through arbitration,nor has any attempt been made to arbitrate diablo similar claim against pacificare.
after being served with diablo complaint,health net filed a petition to compel arbitration of the dispute.diablo opposed the petition on the ground that its claim against health net overlapped its claims against alta bates and ebmn,and that the court should exercise its discretion under section c to refuse to compel arbitration because of the potential for inconsistent rulings if the controversy were adjudicated in multiple forums.diablo argued that because its agreement with health net provided for the application of california law,section c rather than the faa,which gives the court no discretion to deny arbitration on this ground,applies.volt info.sciences leland stanford,d volt.the trial court denied the petition on this basis,ruling that a the supreme court decision in volt is controlling b the parties to the arbitration agreement expressed a clear intent to incorporate the california rules of arbitration code of civil procedure section,et.into their agreement through a general california clause and c allowing arbitration to proceed would create a risk of conflicting rulings as described in section c.
health net has timely appealed the denial,as it may do under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.on appeal,it does not dispute the manner in which the trial court exercised its discretion under section c,but it contends that the provision in the health.diablo agreement should not be interpreted to call for the application of section c.therefore,it argues,the faa has preempted this provision of california law and the court was required to enforce the arbitration provision.as the parties agree,this issue presents a question of law subject to de novo review by the appellate court.hour fitness,superior court th,d.
discussion 
section c authorizes the court to refuse to enforce a contractual arbitration provision if arbitration threatens to produce a result that may conflict with the outcome of related litigation not subject to arbitration.section provides that on petition of a party to an arbitration agreement,the court shall order the parties to arbitrate the controversy unless it determines that c a party to the arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court action with a third party,arising out of the same transaction or series of related transactions and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact,in which case the court may refuse to enforce the arbitration agreement and may order intervention or joinder of all parties in a single action may order intervention or joinder as to all or only certain issues may order arbitration among the parties who have agreed to arbitration and stay the pending court action pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding or may stay arbitration pending the outcome of the court action 
the faa,however,contains no similar provision.the federal statute was enacted in to overrule the judiciary longstanding refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate dean witter reynolds,byrd,d,and to place arbitration agreements upon the same footing as other contracts scherk,d.it provides for the enforcement of arbitration provisions in any contract evidencing a transaction involving interstate commerce.the modern era of supreme court interpretation of the faa begins with moses cone hospital mercury constr,d,in which the court held that the faa establishes that,as a matter of federal law,any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver,delay,or a like defense to arbitrability.however,the faa leaves room for states to enact some rules affecting arbitration.volt,supra,at.hayford and palmiter,arbitration federalism a state role in commercial arbitration.state laws that apply to contracts generally can be applied to arbitration agreements,but c ourts may not invalidate arbitration agreements under state laws applicable only to arbitration provisions.doctor associates,casarotto,d.and the faa preempts a state law that withdraws the power to enforce arbitration agreements.southland keating,fn,d.the faa gives the courts no discretion to refuse to order arbitration that has been agreed to by the parties.dean witter reynolds byrd,supra,d.
despite the apparent inconsistency between section c and the faa,the united states supreme court gave its blessing to section c in volt.after pointing out that t he faa contains no express provision,nor does it reflect a congressional intent to occupy the entire field of arbitration at,the court concluded that a rbitration under the faa is a matter of consent,not coercion,and parties are generally free to structure their arbitration agreements as they see fit.just as they may limit by contract the issues which they will arbitrate citation,so too may they specify by contract the rules under which that arbitration will be conducted.where the parties have agreed to abide by state rules of arbitration,enforcing those rules according to the terms of the agreement is fully consistent with the goals of the faa,even if the result is that the arbitration is stayed where the faa would otherwise permit it to go forward.id.at.the provision at issue in volt specified that the contract shall be governed by the law of the place where the project is located,which was california.id.at.by this provision,the california court had concluded that the parties had incorporated the california rules of arbitration,including c,into their arbitration agreement.volt,supra,at.the supreme court held that the parties had thereby agreed that arbitration would not proceed in situations that fell within the scope of section c volt,supra,at.and that the faa did not prevent application of this provision to stay the arbitration.id.at.a pplication of the california statute is not by the faa in a case where the parties have agreed that their arbitration agreement will be governed by the law of california.id.at.
the parties are in essential agreement with these general propositions.where they part company,however,is with respect to the interpretation of the provision in the health.diablo agreement.diablo points out that volt itself arose out of an agreement subject to california law,but health net correctly observes that the united states supreme court did not express an opinion concerning the manner in which the clause should be interpreted,but felt itself bound to accept the interpretation of the california court that by the provision in that contract,the parties had agreed to arbitrate in accordance with california law.see volt,supra,at.health net urges this court to construe the present agreement differently.relying on the supreme court subsequent decision in mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,d mastrobuono,and federal cases that have followed it,health net argues that the generic provision was not intended to designate california arbitration law in preference to federal arbitration law for the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration agreement.absent an explicit choice of california law for this purpose,health net argues that federal law must apply.
the circumstances in mastrobuono were very different from those involved in the present case.the issue there was whether to apply new york decisional law,which permitted punitive damages to be awarded by courts but not by arbitrators the garrity rule the plaintiffs argued that the garrity rule was preempted by the faa,while the defendants relied on volt for the proposition that because the parties arbitration agreement provided that the entire agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of new york,the garrity rule should apply to the dispute.mastrobuono,supra,at.the court observed that t he provision,when viewed in isolation,may reasonably be read as merely a substitute for the analysis that otherwise would determine what law to apply to disputes arising out of the contractual relationship id.at,that it might include only new york substantive rights and obligations,and not the state allocation of power between alternative tribunals,and that it was not in itself,an unequivocal exclusion of punitive damages claims id.at.the court reiterated that the faa was designed to overcome the refusal of many state courts to enforce arbitration agreements id.at.and found that because the arbitration provision there did not specifically address the powers to be conferred on the arbitrator or the availability of punitive damages,a t most,the clause introduces an ambiguity into an arbitration agreement that would otherwise allow punitive damages awards id.at.relying on the federal policy favoring arbitration,as well as the rule that a court should construe ambiguous contract language against the interest of the party that drafted it,the court concluded that the parties did not intend to incorporate the garrity rule,so that punitive damages could be awarded by an arbitrator to the same extent they could be awarded by a court.id.at.we think the best way to harmonize the provision with the arbitration provision is to read the laws of the state of new york to encompass substantive principles that new york courts would apply,but not to include special rules limiting the authority of arbitrators.id.at.
the decisions in volt and mastrobuono have given rise to a good bit of commentary as well as criticism volt was criticized because it ceded to the states authority to regulate the meaning and effect of contractual provisions concerning arbitrability that many had assumed was provided on a uniform national basis by the faa.see,becker,choice of law and the federal arbitration act the shock of volt arb.mastrobuono has been regarded by some as a first step in returning to the jurisprudence of not allowing the inclusion of a provision to undermine the federal policy favoring arbitration.micheletti,supra.at.others have questioned the precedential value of mastrobuono see mastrobuono,supra,at.dis.opn.of thomas,appel,supra,ohio on.trainor,mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton.all the while,lower courts have been struggling with the extent to which and the manner by which the incorporation of state law may be effectively accomplished.appel,supra,at micheletti,supra,at see also wolsey,foodmaker,cir roadway package system,kayser cir,cert.denied roadway package gateway technologies mci telecommunications,mastrobuono stands for the proposition that arbitrators have the power to award punitive damages unless the parties unequivocally state otherwise lanier old republic ins,the court must admit the difference between the two cases,while there,is difficult to grasp.
among the numerous federal decisions that have considered the meaning of mastrobuono and its relationship to volt,the case that undoubtedly is most helpful to health net position is wolsey,foodmaker,supra.pointing out that the united states supreme court in volt felt constrained to accept the interpretation of the california court that the provision in that agreement was intended to incorporate section c,the court in wolsey stated that in the diversity case before it,the federal court was required to interpret the agreement for itself.purporting to apply mastrobuono,the wolsey court felt that the relevant question is whether section c is a substantive principle that california courts would apply or is instead a special rule limiting the authority of arbitrators.wolsey,supra,at.the ninth circuit concluded that b ecause mastrobuono dictates that general clauses do not incorporate state rules that govern the allocation of authority between courts and arbitrators,the district court erred in applying c to deny foodmaker motion to compel arbitration.wolsey,supra,at.
the court in roadway package,supra,also a diversity case,interpreted another provision,this one reading that the agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania.a divided panel of the third circuit,in the interests of simplicity and uniformity,formulated a default rule that a generic clause,standing alone,is insufficient to support a finding that contracting parties intended to opt out of the faa default standards.id.at.
in our view,the starting point in the interpretation of the clause,like any contractual provision,is with the language of the contract itself.while health net attempts to group all clauses that make no explicit reference to arbitration under the rubric generic,the term has no precise definition.if by that term is meant a provision that states that the agreement will be governed by the law of a particular state without elaborating the specific provisions of state law to which it applies see roadway package,supra,at,fn.conc.opn.of ambro,and if such a generic provision is insufficient to incorporate the state laws concerning the enforcement of arbitration agreements,requiring such a redundancy before the provision will have any effect leads logically to the conclusion that other provisions may also need to contain that redundant choice,provisions treating indemnification rights or termination events in contracts involving the interstate transportation of products.id.at.we agree with the observation of the concurring judge in roadway package,who rejected the approach that the faa controls absent extrinsic evidence of an intent to contract out of the faa default regime id.at in favor of the traditional attempt to discern the intention of the parties,that t he choice of law almost invariably is meant to encompass the entire agreement id.at.
the provision in the present case may be generic in the sense that it does not mention arbitration or any other specific issue that might become a subject of controversy,but it is nonetheless broad,unqualified and all,encompassing.it provides that t he validity,construction,interpretation and enforcement of this agreement shall be governed by california law.the explicit reference to enforcement reasonably includes such matters as whether proceedings to enforce the agreement shall occur in court or before an arbitrator.chapter in which section appears of title of part iii of the california code of civil procedure is captioned enforcement of arbitration agreements.an interpretation of the provision to exclude reference to this chapter would be strained at best.
in contrast,the agreement in mastrobuono provided only that it shall be governed by the laws of the state of new york.at.in wolsey,the contract provided that it shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of the state of california,at.the breadth of the provision in the health.diablo agreement is emphasized by comparison with the provision that was involved in health net th,d.in that case,the contract containing an arbitration agreement provided only that a ll arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the california code of civil procedure,commencing with section,supra,at,d,italics added,and the court therefore held that the parties had not agreed that the enforceability of the arbitration agreement would be determined by california law.the court pointed out that there was no express language indicating that california law shall apply for all purposes,and that the agreement limits the scope of california law to that law pertaining to the manner in which the arbitration is to be conducted.ibid.thus,although reaffirming that under volt a petition to compel arbitration may be denied under section if the parties have agreed to the application of california law for this purpose,supra,at,d,the court found that the limited purpose for which california law had been designated under that contract did not constitute such an agreement id.at,d.
several of the federal cases following mastrobuono contain provisions that use language similar to that in mastrobuono and wolsey,to the effect that the agreement would be governed by the law of a particular jurisdiction,without reference to enforcement,nat.union fire ins.belco petroleum cir,the construction,validity and performance of this policy shall be governed by the law of the state of new york,porter hayden century indem.cir all disputes concerning the validity,interpretation and application of the agreement and all disputes concerning issues within the scope of the agreement shall be determined in accordance with applicable common law of the states of the united states uhc management computer sciences cir,to the extent not preempted by erisa or other federal law,this agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the state of minnesota.t the clause itself specifically provides that minnesota law must yield whenever preempted by federal law,which cuts against the argument that the parties intended that the faa not apply.
the significance of this difference in language is also reflected by the decision of the court of appeals of new york in smith barney,luckie.in holding that the governing clause,which made no explicit reference to arbitration rules,nonetheless should be interpreted to include new york arbitration law rather than the faa,the court emphasized that the parties choice that new york law would govern the agreement and its enforcement emphasis added indicates their intention to arbitrate to the extent allowed by this state law,even if application of the state law would relieve the parties of their responsibility under the contract to arbitrate.id.at.the chief judge concurred,also emphasizing that because the form arbitration agreements at issue plainly provide that new york law governs the agreement and its enforcement emphasis added,the parties can fairly be understood to have agreed that all of new york arbitration law would apply.id.at conc.opn.of kaye.
health net suggests that the clause in the arbitration provision of the present agreement that the arbitrator shall be bound by applicable state and federal law somehow qualifies the reference to california law in the provision.however,there is no inconsistency between these two paragraphs.the arbitration provision merely confirms that the arbitrator must adhere to applicable state and federal substantive law in resolving the merits of the controversy.the paragraph provides that issues of contract validity,interpretation and enforcement shall be governed by california law.whether the court should compel compliance with the arbitration provision is a question of enforcement to be resolved under this agreement under california law.the reference to federal law in the arbitration provision does not indicate otherwise.
if the language of the clause is broad enough to include state law on the subject of arbitrability,as it unquestionably is in this case,the second step in the court analysis,under mastrobuono,must be to determine whether the particular provision of state law in question is one that reflects a hostility to the enforcement of arbitration agreements that the faa was designed to overcome.if so,the clause should not be construed to incorporate such a provision,at least in the absence of unambiguous language in the contract making the intention to do so unmistakably clear.in mastrobuono itself,the state law in question would have denied an arbitrator the ability to award the same relief as a court,and the supreme court held that the ambiguity in the contract should be resolved by reading the clause not to include special rules limiting the authority of arbitrators.at.
many of the cases cited by health net involved provisions which,like the new york rule in mastrobuono,tended to restrict rather than to facilitate the use of arbitration,which was the reason the courts concluded that application of state law would contravene the faa,ferro garrison industries,cir,unlike california section c,the ohio law does not relate to the
