opinion following rehearing 
it is not often that a trial court vacates an arbitration award and an appellate court affirms the order.we shall explain why that happened here,but first 
uncertainty and a little history 
we look to legal precedent in deciding cases.we believe the law is predictable and provides litigants and counsel a reasonable degree of certainty.true,but not always.
in,we wrote what we thought was a routine arbitration opinion.moncharsh heily blase,nonpub.opn.we relied on decades of precedent in our unpublished decision to affirm the arbitration award because no error appeared on the face of the award.in dicta,we noted that had the error appeared on the face of the award and created substantial prejudice,we would have reversed.
to our surprise,our supreme court granted review.our holding was affirmed,but our dicta reversed.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.oh well,nobody perfect.moncharsh held that judicial review of an arbitrator decision regarding questions of fact or law is extremely limited.thus,even though an error of law appears on the face of an arbitration award and causes substantial injustice,it is not subject to judicial review in the absence of a limiting clause or as provided by statute.id.at,d.
for the next decade,courts have wrestled with the question of when and under what circumstances judicial review of an arbitration award is proper.cable connection,directv,cal th,d,cable connection gives us some answers,but unfortunately not the answer to the question here.our conclusion that arbitrators have a great deal of power,but not absolute power,provides the key to our answer.
petitioners roger and cheryl burlage,trustees of the burlage family trust,purchased a house from real party martha martinez spencer.the parties arbitrated a dispute over the sale of the house.the arbitrator awarded the burlages approximately million in damages and costs.on motion from spencer,the trial court vacated the award.the burlages filed a petition for writ of mandate,challenging the trial court order.
we conclude the arbitrator excluded material evidence that substantially prejudiced spencer pursuant to code of civil procedure section we deny the petition and affirm the trial court order vacating the arbitration award.
facts and procedural history 
the burlages purchased a house from spencer in a gated community next to a country club.after escrow closed,they learned,among other things,that the swimming pool and a wrought iron fence on the property encroached upon land owned by the country club.the burlages claim spencer knew of these encroachments at the time of sale,but intentionally and fraudulently failed to disclose this information to them.
the parties chose a retired judge associated with judicial arbitration and mediation services,jams to arbitrate their dispute and they agreed to be bound by the jams arbitration rules.
two years after the purchase,but before the arbitration was held,the title company paid the country club in exchange for a adjustment that gave the burlages clear title to the encroaching land.nevertheless,the burlages sought damages for the diminution in value of their property and for the cost of moving the pool and fence that were on the encroaching land they now owned.
the burlages moved in limine to exclude evidence of the adjustment.they argued that damages must be measured from the date escrow closed.under this theory,spencer could not introduce evidence of the adjustment to show the burlages were not damaged.spencer argued that later circumstances can and should be considered in measuring damages.
the arbitrator granted the motion and excluded evidence concerning the financial effect the adjustment had on the burlages damages.
after days of testimony,the arbitrator found spencer knew the pool and fence encroached on the country club land she did not disclose this to the burlages and the encroachment materially affected the property value.he awarded the burlages in compensatory damages,in punitive damages,and in attorney fees and costs.
the burlages moved to confirm the award.thereafter,spencer moved to vacate the award.her motion rested upon section,subdivision a,which requires vacation of an arbitration award when a party rights are substantially prejudiced by the arbitrator refusal to hear evidence material to the controversy.
the trial court ruled that the arbitrator refusal to admit evidence of the adjustment substantially prejudiced spencer ability to dispute the amount of damage suffered by the burlages.it vacated the arbitration award.
we issued an alternative writ of mandate.better to have issued an order to show cause.but after further review of the record and consideration of the arguments in the briefs and at oral argument,we now conclude the trial court did not err in vacating the award.
discussion 
the burlages contend that a private arbitration award may not be reviewed for errors in law.moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at,d.they argue the trial court therefore exceeded its authority when it vacated the award for what it believed to be the arbitrator error in awarding damages.
judicial review of a contract arbitration award is extremely limited.moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at,d,see cable connection,supra,cal th at,d.the court may not review the merits of the underlying controversy or the arbitrator reasoning,even when an error of law is apparent on the face of the award and causes substantial injustice.cable connection,at,d,moncharsh,at,d.
we review the trial court order de novo but apply the substantial evidence standard to the extent the trial court ruling rests upon a determination of disputed factual issues.malek blue cross of california th,d reed mutual service th,d.
a contractual arbitration agreement gives the arbitrator the power to decide all questions of contract interpretation,historical fact or general law necessary,in the arbitrator view,to reach a decision.cable connection,supra,cal th at,d,moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.inherent in that power is the possibility the arbitrator may err in deciding some aspect of the case.arbitrators do not ordinarily exceed their contractually created powers simply by reaching an erroneous conclusion on a contested issue of law or fact,and awards may not be vacated due to such error because t he arbitrator resolution of these issues is what the parties bargained for gueyffier ann summers,cal th,d,see cable connection,at,d.when parties opt for the forum of arbitration they agree to be bound by the decision of that forum knowing that arbitrators,like judges,are fallible.that way production directors guild of america,d.
but tolerance for fallibility has its limits.section,subdivision a provides that a court shall vacate an award when a party rights were substantially prejudiced by the refusal of the arbitrator to hear evidence material to the controversy this section has been interpreted as a safety valve in private arbitration that permits a court to intercede when an arbitrator has prevented a party from fairly presenting its case.hall superior court th,d.
this is what happened here.the arbitrator excluded evidence that the title company paid for the adjustment and purchase of the encroaching land.the arbitrator did not state his reasons for the evidentiary ruling,but likely it stemmed from his earlier ruling that damages are fixed at the date escrow closed.
the question whether the arbitrator was right or wrong about the proper date from which to measure damages is not subject to judicial review.but it is that his ruling excluding evidence that the title company solved the problem through a modest payment to the country club was more than a mere erroneous evidentiary ruling.the trial court found on substantial evidence that the arbitrator ruling substantially prejudiced spencer and undermined the fundamental principle embodied in section,subdivision a that an arbitrator must consider material evidence.
evidence of an absolute problem is fixed 
what could be more material than evidence that the problem was fixed and there are no damages yet,the burlages presented expert testimony about the effect of what had become a nonexistent encroa
