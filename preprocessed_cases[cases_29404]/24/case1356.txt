background 
f h motion to compel arbitration 
on september,f h filed a complaint against smylie,alleging breach of contract and common counts.the first cause of action alleged that in august,f h and smylie entered into an oral agreement for legal services in connection with cosmetics manufacturing,smylie,orange superior court case.it alleged that smylie breached the agreement by failing to pay legal fees and costs in the sum of.the second cause of action alleged the same facts as the first but added that there existed a written fee agreement,which had been lost.the third cause of action alleged that in september,the parties entered into a written fee agreement with regard to a bad faith action that smylie intended to file against his insurance carrier because of its refusal to defend him in the litigation.it was alleged that smylie breached the agreement by failing to pay the sum of.the third cause of action also alleged that f h had instituted binding arbitration,as provided in the written agreement,and that the third cause of action had been included in the complaint solely for the purpose of obtaining provisional relief.the final three counts of the complaint were common book account,account stated,and unjust enrichment.
in october,f h filed a motion to compel binding arbitration and to consolidate arbitration proceedings.in support of the motion,f h submitted the declaration of its partner,jerold fagelbaum,who stated that f h was a subtenant in smylie suite of law offices,and that when smylie failed to pay fees under the agreement,the parties agreed that smylie would reduce the debt by allowing f h a rent credit each month.in april,after smylie had refused to accept further credits and demanded that f h pay rent,f h initiated binding arbitration,as provided in the fee agreement,by submitting a demand to action dispute resolution services,adr.
fagelbaum stated that,in response to the demand,smylie initiated nonbinding mfaa arbitration by submitting a client request for resolution of a fee dispute to the beverly hills bar association bhba form on june.a copy of the bhba form is attached as an exhibit to fagelbaum declaration.the form states that the arbitration would be nonbinding unless both client and attorney agreed to a binding arbitration.the box next to was checked.the form shows that the total amount in dispute was,of which smylie claimed to have paid f h the sum of.a refund of the latter amount was claimed,which would leave a balance of zero.the form includes an attachment alleging that f h malpractice had damaged smylie in an amount exceeding the amounts already paid plus those claimed by f h as still owing.
fagelbaum also stated that on august,smylie served f h with a notice to pay rent or quit.f h invoked the arbitration clause in the sublease by submitting a demand to the american arbitration association aaa.on september,smylie responded to the aaa demand by serving a in which he alleged that he owed nothing in legal fees,that he was entitled to a refund of fees,and that those issues were then subject to a nonbinding arbitration before the bhba.the alleged that smylie had notified f h that it could no longer offset the rent with outstanding legal fees.smylie demanded relief in the sum of in unpaid rent,plus ongoing rental damages,late fees,interest,and attorney fees.
in september,the parties submitted to mediation through the bhba,but they did not come to an agreement.fagelbaum asserted in his declaration that,after smylie left the mediation site,his attorney,mark egerman,agreed that the mediation should conclude the parties use of the services of the bhba and that the parties should be deemed to have complied with the requirements of the mfaa.in addition,fagelbaum asserted that he and egerman also agreed in principle that the parties disputes should be consolidated,but that egerman later reneged on this agreement.
f h also submitted the declaration of its attorney,frank nemecek,who stated that he attempted,without success,to obtain egerman written confirmation of the agreement alleged by f h in his declaration.nemecek also stated that he attempted to go forward with the adr arbitration,but adr refused to do so without a court order.
f h argued to the trial court that smylie had waived his right to an mfaa arbitration under the procedures adopted by the bhba.it argued that because smylie both the bhba form and the aaa f h committed legal malpractice,he waived his right to nonbinding mfaa arbitration.
smylie opposition to motion 
in opposition to f h motion to compel arbitration,smylie submitted his declaration,in which he stated that he had searched but found no written retainer agreement relating to the litigation and did not believe that one was ever executed.he denied having orally agreed to arbitrate disputes with f h.he also submitted egerman declaration,in which he denied agreeing to waive his client rights under section,to deem the parties in compliance with its requirements,to conclude the parties use of the bhba,or to consolidate arbitrations.egerman denied that he had the authority to bind his client to any of the agreements alleged by fagelbaum and denied that he had entered into any such agreements.
order compelling arbitration 
the trial court granted f h motion to compel arbitration november.in a written decision,the court consolidated the mfaa arbitration and the aaa arbitration into the adr binding arbitration,which would proceed immediately.the court gave no reasons for its order and made no express findings.the order also stated in the event the arbitrator s in the adr arbitration determine that any of f h claims against smylie are not subject to an arbitration agreement,such claim or claims shall remain a subject of this action.
motion to confirm award opposition and request to vacate award 
the binding adr arbitration went forward with a panel,which issued a unanimous award september.the award recited the issues presented as f h claim for legal fees relating to the litigation,legal fees and third party vendor fees relating to the bad faith action,and smylie eviction claim.the panel found that the parties had executed the lost written retainer agreement relating to the litigation and that it contained an arbitration clause.it rejected smylie statute of limitations defense and awarded f h its fees for the litigation.the panel found that f h had not committed legal malpractice in the course of the bad faith litigation,and that,if it had done so,there was no prejudice to smylie.f h was thus awarded its fees and the amounts owed to third party vendors arising out of the bad faith litigation.the panel rejected smylie claims under the sublease and enforced the parties agreement permitting f h to deduct the rent owed each month from the outstanding legal fees.
the panel awarded f h its attorney fees incurred in the arbitration in the sum of and costs in the sum of.the total award against smylie was.smylie submitted an application to amend the award,which the panel denied.
on november,f h moved to confirm the award.smylie opposed the motion to confirm the award,and in his opposition,requested that the trial court vacate the award,on the ground that the arbitrators had been without power to proceed with a binding arbitration because smylie had demanded,but was not afforded,his right to a nonbinding mfaa arbitration.in the alternative,smylie sought correction of the award as set forth in a motion he had brought at arbitration.
judgment and appeal 
the trial court granted f h motion to confirm and issued a statement of decision.in its statement of decision,the court found that smylie had waived any right to other arbitration on the grounds successfully argued by f h in its motion to compel arbitration.the court enumerated the facts upon which it found that smylie had waived his right to nonbinding mfaa arbitration on five occasions by alleging that f h committed malpractice.the court explained that the first two waivers were effected by the allegations on the bhba form demanding mfaa arbitration and by the aaa.in addition,the court cited smylie opposition to f h application for a right to attach order,his opposition to f h motion to compel arbitration,and his having participated fully in the adr arbitration,without asserting that the arbitrators lacked jurisdiction because of his pending claim for mfaa arbitration.
judgment was entered december,and the statement of decision was filed the same day.a superseding judgment was entered january,nunc pro tunc as of december.smylie filed a timely notice of appeal january.
discussion 
standard and scope of review 
smylie contends that the trial court erred in compelling caa arbitration while his mfaa arbitration was pending and that the court erred in confirming the award.f h contends that smylie failed to preserve appellate review of the order compelling arbitration by failing to file a petition for writ review or a separate petition to vacate the award.f h cites no authority requiring intermediate writ review of an order compelling arbitration.further,none of the authorities cited by f h in support of this contention involved an appeal challenging an order compelling arbitration after entry of the final judgment the appellants in those cases raised arbitrability issues for the first time on appeal from the judgments confirming the awards,without having objected prior to submission or having filed petitions to vacate within days after the issuance of the award.see berg traylor th,d louise gardens of encino homeowners,truck ins.exchange,th,d knass blue cross of california d.
the rule of forfeiture invoked by f h applies not to parties like smylie who have been compelled to arbitrate but to those who fail to raise the invalidity of the arbitration process at the outset,so that prompt judicial resolution may take place before wasting the time of the adjudicator s and the parties.if a trial court compels arbitration nonetheless,the party resisting arbitration may seek review of the ruling on appeal from an order that confirms the award.citation.if the arbitration process is found to be invalid,the responsibility for a waste of resources would then lie with the trial court,not the litigant cummings future nissan th,d,fn.omitted.thus,w ith respect to an order compelling arbitration,the question is not whether an aggrieved party is entitled to appellate review,but when n o immediate,direct appeal lies from an order compelling arbitration.citations.but such an order is subject to review on appeal from the final judgment.citations.abramson juniper networks,th,d see also code civ,subd.d.
the standard of review of an order compelling arbitration is substantial evidence where the trial court decision was based upon the resolution of disputed facts or de novo where the facts are not in conflict.hartnell community college dist.superior court th,d.as smylie does not challenge the court factual findings,we independently review the order compelling arbitration.our review of the written agreements and arbitration demands and in evidence is de novo,as well,as there was no conflicting extrinsic evidence.see parsons bristol development cal d.
relevant principles relating to mfaa arbitration 
the mfaa required the state bar to establish and maintain a system for the arbitration and mediation of disputes regarding fees and costs,to be administered by local bar associations,and subject to review by the state bar board of governors,subds.a,d.under the statutory scheme,once a client demands mfaa arbitration,participation by the attorney is mandatory,and the attorney action or other proceeding shall be automatically stayed until the award of the arbitrators is issued or the arbitration is otherwise terminated,subd.c,subds.b,c.
so long as the client was properly served with a notice of the right to mfaa arbitration,t he request for arbitration shall be served and filed prior to the filing of an answer in the action or equivalent response in the other proceeding commenced by the attorney failure to so request arbitration prior to the filing of an answer or equivalent response shall be deemed a waiver of the client right to arbitration under the provisions of this article,subd.b.in addition,the client right to request or maintain an mfaa arbitration is deemed waived if the client commences an action or files any pleading seeking either judicial resolution of a fee dispute or a ffirmative relief against the attorney for damages or otherwise based upon alleged malpractice or professional misconduct,subd.d.
further,a demand for mfaa arbitration may not include a c laim for affirmative relief against the attorney for damages or otherwise based upon alleged malpractice or professional misconduct,except as provided in subdivision a of section,subd.b.pursuant to section,subdivision a,evidence of malpractice and professional misconduct is admissible only to the extent that it relates to the fees or costs to which the attorney is entitled,and any refund to the client may consist only of unearned fees,costs,or both previously paid to the attorney.
the parties may agree to be bound by the award,subd.a.in the absence of such an agreement,either party may,within days after the mailing of notice of the award,request a trial de novo,or binding arbitration if provided by the parties fee agreement,subds.c,d schatz allen matkins leck gamble mallory llp cal th,d.
smylie contends that the trial court erred in finding that he waived mfaa arbitration on any of the five cited the bhba form demanding mfaa arbitration,in his opposition to f h application for a right to attach order,in his opposition to f h motion to compel arbitration,in the adr arbitration,by his full participation,and in the aaa.he contends that he merely alleged on those occasions that f h committed malpractice,causing him to suffer damages,but did not seek to recover those damages.thus,he argues,he can not be deemed to have waived his right to mfaa arbitration because he did not seek affirmative relief due to alleged malpractice or professional misconduct,subd.d.
with regard to the first four occasions which the trial court found to have effected a waiver,smylie arguments that these actions were merely defensive may have merit.however,because we conclude that the court ruling was correct for at least one smylie waived mfaa arbitration by requesting affirmative relief in the aaa judgment must be sustained regardless of the court other reasons.see board of medical examiners cal d.we therefore need not reach smylie contentions with regard to the court first four reasons.
smylie contends that his aaa sought no affirmative relief on account of f h alleged malpractice,because he sought only unpaid rent.the aaa alleged that smylie had paid f h in legal fees and costs,and that f h claimed that was still owing,but that due to overbilling and malpractice,not only was no amount due,smylie was entitled to a refund.smylie claims that such allegations do not seek affirmative relief,because the also alleged that the dispute concerning fees and costs was then pending before the bhba.
we note that smylie has not denied that at one time,he had an agreement with f h whereby f h was permitted to apply rents as a credit against smylie outstanding debt for legal fees.indeed,smylie alleged in the aaa that f h paid the rent in the form of an offset from legal fees for numerous months,and that the notice to quit or pay rent alleged rents beginning in jul
