this is an appeal by the city of quincy from a jury verdict against the city in favor of kathleen bandera.the jury awarded bandera in punitive damages for sexual harassment,seemingly under state law.the appeal presents two different the claim was barred by a prior purported settlement agreement and whether the trial was infected by error.the background facts follow.
in september,bandera was hired by the city of quincy as executive director of a newly established,or to be established,community policing commission.in the role she reported to james sheets and police chief thomas frane.according to testimony at the later trial,both men warned her that she would encounter difficulties in her new post both as a woman and as a civilian.
bandera testified at trial that she was subject to discriminatory treatment during her brief tenure as director that she was excluded from meetings,ridiculed,and subjected by male officers to graphic details of their sexual exploits.further,she said,sheets and frane failed to take steps to halt this harassment although they were advised of at least some of bandera concerns.she told the jury that in early june frane asked sheets to replace her with a male police officer.on june,bandera was terminated effective at the end of the month.
bandera responded by suing the city,frane,and sheets in the federal district court,alleging gender discrimination of two kinds sexual harassment and wrongful termination.her claims were based on two federal vii of the civil rights act of,and section,and on the massachusetts fair employment practices act.laws ch.after initial discovery,the district court in september scheduled trial for november.
the parties then conferred over two days at the end of october october and with a mediator.this resulted in a handwritten agreement,dated october,and signed separately by counsel for the defendants,by counsel for bandera,and by bandera herself.the text of the memorandum of agreement is as follows 
the parties will enter a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice,and without costs.
the city will pay to wendy kaplan,as attorney for kathleen bandera.the city will issue a for this amount to wendy kaplan.
the city will cause the quincy school committee to issue an employment contract to kathleen bandera for a position in the quincy public schools as a permanent substitute for the balance of the school year.
if bandera is not hired by the quincy public schools for a permanent teaching position on or before the start of the school year,mayor sheets will recommend to the superintendent that bandera be offered a contract as a permanent substitute for the school year.if the superintendent declines to offer the contract because of lack of funds,the mayor will take all necessary steps to attain sufficient funding.
the parties will execute a general release of all claims asserted or unasserted and a comprehensive settlement document which shall include and provisions.
both the facts of an agreement,and the terms of this agreement,shall not be disclosed,except to the district court prior to november.
this settlement,and the terms of settlement,shall not be deemed or construed as an admission or finding of a violation of any law,policy,custom,or procedure,and shall not be introduced as evidence of such a violation in any other proceeding.
david grunebaum has the authority to sign for the defendants.
at some point in early november,bandera herself apparently called defendants counsel to disavow the settlement agreement and she thereafter refused to sign a typewritten version of the agreement and consonant release.in the election held on november,sheets was defeated by another candidate.on november,bandera own counsel filed a motion to withdraw.on november,the parties appeared before the district court and the city moved to enforce the settlement agreement.
bandera responded that she had been coerced into the settlement by her attorney alleged threats,that bandera might be held in contempt.further,bandera said that there had been at the time of the written agreement an oral agreement between both attorneys and bandera bandera signed and remained silent until the agreement would be redrafted afterwards to address bandera concerns and that if mayor sheets were not,the agreement would be null and void.
the district court then gave bandera days to retain new counsel.in december,incident to her request to withdraw,bandera counsel made filings including an affidavit disputing in general terms bandera version of what had occurred at the mediation and settlement and countering certain of bandera specific allegations.her counsel did not say one way or the other what she had said to bandera incident to the signing but did say that the terms of the agreement had originally been proposed by bandera herself.
at a status conference on january,representing to the motion to enforce the settlement agreement,saying that the agreement was only preliminary and that sheets was no longer mayor.the district judge told bandera that the city would still have to follow through with its commitment but bandera said that she wanted to get out of the settlement agreement and to proceed with a new attorney.the defendants repeated that they had a valid settlement.the district judge then stated 
that referring to the signed memorandum of agreement is going to lead to another trial,whether she,you know,whether she intended to do it or she did intend to do it.
what i am going to do think the case should be settled.this is america.if she wants to try her case,she can try it.i am going to give her a trial date three months from now.give her a date.no continuances.if you do get a lawyer,you are going to have to try the case yourself.
responding to a further objection from the defendants,the court responded,just for the record,i am going to deny the request to enforce the settlement agreement.
on january,the district court issued a written decision denying defendants motion to enforce the settlement.the district court noted that the parties signed only the memorandum of agreement anticipating a final comprehensive agreement,and never signed the final agreement,and continued 
as a general rule,a trial court may not summarily enforce a settlement agreement if there is a genuinely disputed question of material fact regarding the existence or terms of that agreement quoting malave carney,cir.in this case,the parties disagree about the significance of the memorandum of settlement.defendants motion,therefore,is denied.
the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration seeking enforcement of the settlement agreement or at least an evidentiary hearing.following the denial of both requests,the defendants sought to appeal to this court from the refusal to enforce the settlement agreement but the appeal was dismissed for lack of a final appealable order.in due course,the case was set for trial before a magistrate judge on the consent of both parties.c.at the ensuing trial bandera represented herself.
at trial,bandera testified in detail as to her experience and sought compensatory front and back pay to avoid further discovery and no claim for emotional suffering.she also adduced testimony from a number of witnesses including nancy coletta,a female police officer in the quincy police department.coletta,who had filed sexual harassment claims of her own against the police department,gave damaging testimony,more fully described below,as to her own experience and her view of bandera treatment.
the defense offered testimony from several witnesses including frane and two other police officials.after two days of deliberation,the jury returned a set of special verdicts addressing,as to each defendant,each theory of recovery urged against that defendant not every theory was directed against each defendant.the jury rejected all claims made against the mayor and police chief and all claims against the city save for the sexual harassment claims made under title vii and chapter.the jury also ruled that bandera had proved no damages as to front or back pay but was entitled to in punitive damages 
on this appeal,the city one would that the settlement agreement foreclosed b
