introduction 
julia bono and elicia david were two of several parties to a memorandum of understanding mou that contained a clause requiring mediation and arbitration of a ny controversy among the parties involving the construction or application of any provision of this agreement the mou was executed in by several tenants in common of lake county property the group planned to develop.in,respondent bono brought an action for defamation against appellant david based on the contents of a david sent to a third party who was apparently attempting to resolve disputes between those two individuals concerning details of the development.david moved to compel mediation and arbitration of bono defamation action pursuant to the arbitration provision of the mou and code of civil procedure section.the trial court denied the motion,ruling that bono defamation action was essentially a action that did not involve contractual interpretation.we agree and hence affirm.
ii.factual and procedural background 
in march,the two parties to this lawsuit,plus several others,took title as tenants in common to some acres of unimproved real property near middletown in lake county.both parties to this action received a percent interest in the property the other tenants in common were and are brian and laura behlendorf,husband and wife,who received a percent interest as joint tenants,and chris dolan and stephanie dolan,also husband and wife,who received a percent interest as joint tenants.
on march,six days before the deed conveying the property was recorded,the several grantees executed the mou.the text of the mou consumed only two pages appended to it were signature pages,which also designated the amount of cash to be contributed by each of the parties to the purchase price of the property and an exhibit showing a map of the property.
the mou contemplated that a parcel composing the larger part of the acres would be retransferred to the behlendorfs in consideration of their substantial monetary contribution toward the original purchase,but with a right of first refusal in an entity to be created by the other original owners to repurchase that portion of the property,and with agreements to both allow rights of passage over that portion of the property and to lease portions of it for the development of community projects.the remaining acres were to be transferred to a limited partnership to be known as eleusis of which david,bono then carter and chris dolan shall be the limited partners.the mou contemplated that this entity or a successor to it shall be the structure for development of a greater community on this parcel of land.
one of the substantive provisions of the mou was a clause reading,in pertinent part arbitration.any controversy among the parties involving the construction or application of any provision of this agreement shall be submitted first to mediation of a disinterested chosen by a two thirds majority of the parties hereto i f the written determination of said mediator is unacceptable to any one of the parties involved,said grievance shall be subject to binding arbitration in san francisco,california.any such arbitration shall comply with and be governed under the provisions of the rules of the american arbitration association.all parties agree to be bound by the final findings and determinations of the chosen arbitrator.emphasis added.
by march,a number of disagreements had developed among the tenants in common.via some process or another the record is not clear on this,an individual named richard van donk of middletown had been designated to try to iron out disagreements between bono and david regarding various aspects of what was known to the owners of the property as the eleusis project.in the course of these efforts,david sent van donk an which contained various aspersions on bono emotional stability.
in any event,van donk settlement efforts regarding various aspects of the project apparently failed,because in the ensuing months three lawsuits were filed amongst the parties to the greater community project.more specifically,in april,the several other grantees filed an action against bono for partition of the property and an accounting in the lake county superior court hereafter partition action.the following month,may,bono sued the behlendorfs for a personal injury she allegedly suffered in may while hiking on that portion of the property which might later revert to their sole ownership hereafter personal injury action.and in july,bono and an entity known as eleusis management,filed a declaratory relief action against the other tenants in common seeking a declaration as to plaintiffs and defendants respective rights and duties under the mou hereafter declaratory relief action.
in her answer to the partition action,in pro per,as she is that the mou constituted an agreement that effectively foreclosed such an action and thereafter moved to compel mediation and,if necessary,arbitration pursuant to the mou clause quoted above.the plaintiffs in the partition action,the other tenants in common,accepted this demand in so doing,they also moved for a stay of the partition action,a continuance of a hearing on bono motion,and even nominated a potential mediator.
the trial court declined to grant the continuance requested by the defendants in the partition action and,instead,held the hearing on the scheduled date of august.on september,it issued an order staying the partition action and ordering it submitted for mediation and,failing that,arbitration.in so doing,it framed its order somewhat differently than the language of the mou its order read,in pertinent part t he disputes and disagreements among the parties to this action shall be determined by the following procedure any controversy among the parties shall be submitted first to mediation and then continued along the same lines as the wording in the mou.emphasis added.two month later,in november,the trial court granted the other tenants in common motion to consolidate the partition action and the declaratory relief action and to compel arbitration of the consolidated action.a formal order to that effect was entered on december.after the court was advised that mediation efforts were unsuccessful,on march,it ordered the consolidated action to arbitration.
meanwhile,the personal injury action filed by bono against the behlendorfs in may was challenged by a demurrer of the two defendants on december.that demurrer was sustained on february.on february,bono filed an amended complaint alleging the same injury albeit on a different legal theory.the defendants demurred to that complaint,also,and this demurrer was likewise with leave to april.a demurrer to bono second amended personal injury complaint was also sustained on july,albeit this time without leave to amend.
while all this was going on,on february,bono pro defamation complaint that is at the core of this appeal.attached to it was a copy of the sent by david to van donk in march.the parts of the that bono complaint singled out as defamatory were david several descriptions of her as unstable,not capable of trust or honesty,absolutely untrustworthy.
appellant david demurred to the complaint on may.her demurrer was based on the theory that the at issue was subject to the mediation privilege under civil code section,subdivision b,and her statements therein were otherwise inadmissible.on august,the trial court overruled the demurrer on the basis that it could not determine from the face of the complaint and the attached document whether the latter was a communication a mediation communication as to which privilege would apply and the communication would be inadmissible.
on september,david filed a motion to consolidate the defamation action with the partition and declaratory relief actions,to compel arbitration of all three actions,and to stay proceedings in them until the arbitration was completed.although not the central point of her motion,david supporting papers cited section and noted that she was entitled to both mediation and arbitration of all three actions because,among other things,this is all one controversy.a few days later,david also renoticed a hearing on her february demurrer,noticing the hearing for october.accompanying her notice of motion was an additional memorandum of points and authorities in the defamation action only,arguing that the demurrer should be sustained because of bono failure to exhaust her remedies of mediation and arbitration.
in opposition to david motion and renewed demurrer,bono argued that her defamation action did not involve the construction or application of any provision contained in the mou 
the trial court heard oral argument on david motion and demurrer on october.after hearing argument from david counsel and bono,it denied the motion to compel arbitration of the defamation claim.the court stated that it did not agree that the alleged defamation arose from the contract or that the contract needs to be interpreted somehow in order to determine the defamation action.an order denying david motion to compel arbitration and overruling her demurrer was filed the same day and a notice of appeal by david one week later.
iii.discussion 
a.our standard of review and some relevant legal principles.
where there is no factual dispute as to the language of the agreement coast plaza doctors hospital blue cross of california th,d coast plaza or conflicting extrinsic evidence regarding the terms of the contract vianna doctors management th,d vianna,our standard of review of a trial court order granting or denying a motion to compel arbitration under section is de novo.coast plaza,supra vianna,supra see also buckhorn jude heritage medical group th,d buckhorn maggio windward capital management th,d larkin williams,woolley,cogswell,nakazawa russell th,d larkin.such is the case here.
our supreme court has emphasized,indeed several times,that arbitration of disputes is favored and that,when there is doubt as to the meaning and construction of an agreement for mediation arbitration,that doubt should be resolved in favor of those processes.thus,in engalla permanente medical group,cal th,d,the court wrote california law incorporates many of the basic policy objectives contained in the federal arbitration act,including a presumption in favor of arbitrability citation and a requirement that an arbitration agreement must be enforced on the basis of state law standards that apply to contracts in general id.at,d.and in its earlier landmark decision in moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,the court,quoting from even earlier decisions,stressed that through the provisions of the code of civil procedure governing arbitration,the legislature has expressed a strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution and that the courts will indulge every intendment to give effect to such proceedings.id.at,d.
the coast plaza court cited moncharsh and other precedent in summing up the general law in this area thusly california has a strong public policy in favor of arbitration and any doubts regarding the arbitrability of a dispute are resolved in favor of arbitration.citations.as the supreme court recently noted,the decision to arbitrate grievances evinces the parties intent to bypass the judicial system and thus avoid potential delays at the trial and appellate levels citation.this strong policy has resulted in the general rule that arbitration should be upheld unless it can be said with assurance that an arbitration clause is not susceptible to an interpretation covering the asserted dispute.citation.citations.it seems clear that the burden must fall upon the party opposing arbitration to demonstrate that an arbitration clause can not be interpreted to require arbitration of the dispute.thus,if there is any reasonable doubt as to whether coast plaza claims come within the service agreement arbitration clause,that doubt must be resolved in favor of arbitration,not against it.citations.coast plaza,supra,th at,d.in her briefs to us,david relies strongly on the principles just noted.
but there is another principle that needs to be considered.as our supreme court stressed several decades ago,the contractual terms themselves must be carefully examined before the parties to the contract can be ordered to arbitration although t he law favors contracts for arbitration of disputes between parties citation,there is no policy compelling persons to accept arbitration of controversies which they have not agreed to arbitrate citations.in determining the scope of an arbitration clause,t he court should attempt to give effect to the parties intentions,in light of the usual and ordinary meaning of the contractual language and the circumstances under which the agreement was made citation.citation.victoria superior court cal d.
following on from this,and as other courts of appeal have regularly observed,the terms of the specific arbitration clause under consideration must reasonably cover the dispute as to which arbitration is requested.this is so because t here is no public policy favoring arbitration of disputes which the parties have not agreed to arbitrate.engineers architects community development th,d see also medical staff of doctors medical center in modesto kamil th,d kamil larkin,supra,th at,d united public employees city and county of san francisco th,d county of contra costa kaiser foundation health plan,th,d hayes children leasing ncr th,d luster collins th,d.
indeed,this principle is effectively prescribed by civil code section,which provides however broad may be the terms of a contract,it extends only to those things concerning which it appears that the parties intended to contract.
does the language of the mou cover bono defamation action 
increasingly over recent years,in deciding whether or not a particular arbitration clause applies to the dispute in question,our sister courts have carefully considered the lack the arbitration clause of the pertinent agreement.thus,in wolitarsky blue cross of california th,d,a case relied upon by david,the court addressed the argument of appellant blue cross that an arbitration clause in a health insurance policy issued by it covered a claim that it had violated state and federal laws against gender discrimination by imposing an additional deductible charge for maternity benefits on the plaintiff insureds.the clause at issue provided any dispute between the member and blue cross regarding the decision of blue cross must be submitted to binding arbitration if the amount in dispute exceeds the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court.id.at,d,emphasis added.the court found that this clause was written with sufficient breadth to encompass the issue in the litigation.ibid.
similarly,in larkin,supra,th at pages,d,a case also relied upon by david,the court was faced with an appeal by a law partnership from an order of the trial court denying its motion to compel arbitration of a dispute with a withdrawing partner who had filed a complaint for dissolution and an accounting.the partnership agreement provided any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to any provision of this agreement or the breach thereof shall be settled by arbitration id.at,d,emphasis added.in reversing the lower court and ordering the matter into arbitration,the appellate court specifically noted the arbitration clause at issue is very broad.plaintiff complaint for dissolution and an accounting clearly arises out of and relates to the partnership agreement.id.at,d,emphasis added.
and in coast plaza,supra,th at pages,d,yet another case relied upon by david,the appellate court reviewed a lower court order denying a motion to compel arbitration of the plaintiff hospital suit against blue cross,a suit based on numerous tort theories,all related to the reimbursement rates paid by blue cross pursuant to a service agreement with coast plaza.id.at,d.that agreement contained,predictably,a very broad arbitration clause requiring the arbitration of a ny problem or dispute arising under this agreement concerning the terms of this agreement id.at and fn,d.based on this wording,the court reversed the trial court order,stating it has long been the rule in california that a broadly worded arbitration clause,such as we have here,may extend
