fyrnetics hong kong fhk and walter kidde portable equipment kidde sued quantum group,alleging that quantum sold fhk defective carbon monoxide co sensors,thereby causing kidde to recall co detectors made using the allegedly defective sensors.quantum filed a motion to dismiss the complaint,or in the alternative to stay the action under,asserting that various agreements between the parties required the stay in favor of arbitration.the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the matter and subsequently entered judgment dismissing fhk and kidde claims in favor of arbitration pursuant to one agreement.we affirm in part and remand in part.
background 
quantum is a technology firm based in san diego,california that manufactures co detectors using a biomimetic sensor that it developed and patented.in june,quantum entered into a license agreement effective january,with fyrnetics pursuant to this agreement,fyrnetics was licensed to make,have made,use,import,export,sell or offer to sell co detectors containing quantum patented sensor technology.in return for this license,fyrnetics agreed to pay to quantum royalties of two and percent of its gross co detector sales.around the same time,quantum entered into a manufacturing agreement with fhk whereby fhk manufactured quantum brand of co detectors using quantum patented co sensor technology.pursuant to the manufacturing agreement,the finished co detectors were to be sold by fhk exclusively to quantum for resale to quantum clients.
in relevant part,the license agreement between fyrnetics and quantum provided that a ny claim or controversy arising between the parties hereto in connection with this agreement shall be determined by arbitration to be held in accordance with the rules of the american arbitration association the license agreement also granted fyrnetics the right to sublicense its affiliates e ach affiliate so sublicensed shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement.the term affiliate was defined as entities that control or were controlled by fyrnetics,or had common ownership with fyrnetics.at all relevant times,fyrnetics and fhk were considered affiliates pursuant to the terms of the license agreement.this is so because when the license agreement was first entered into both fyrnetics and fhk were owned by the same holding company,management investment technology international,mit.later,fhk and fyrnetics remained affiliates when williams holding international limited williams purchased the stock of fhk,and kidde,a subsidiary of williams,purchased the stock of fyrnetics.
in july,fhk and kidde filed a complaint,alleging that during late and early,quantum sold defective co sensors to fhk.kidde and fhk sounded their complaint in tort,alleging that quantum committed misrepresentation and negligence and that quantum breached certain warranties with regard to the sensors.additionally,fhk and kidde alleged that fhk sold to fyrnetics co detectors made using the defective sensors,and fyrnetics in turn resold the detectors in canada and the united states.because of the allegedly defective sensors,kidde claimed that many of the co detectors that fyrnetics sold in the united states and canada failed.consequently,kidde was forced to engage in a costly recall of the faulty co detectors.thus,in their complaint kidde and fhk sought to recoup all compensatory and consequential damages suffered as a result of quantum allegedly tortious actions.
quantum moved to dismiss fhk and kidde complaint or to stay the action under,arguing that provisions in the manufacturing agreement and provisions in the license agreement mandated the stay in favor of arbitration.the district court denied quantum motion to dismiss,finding that an issue of fact existed as to whether the parties were acting pursuant to either the manufacturing agreement,the license agreement,or an alleged oral agreement,which fhk and kidde asserted controlled the parties relationship.the district court then held an evidentiary hearing to decide this issue.
at the evidentiary hearing,fhk and kidde called thomas russo to testify.in,when quantum and fyrnetics entered into their license agreement,russo was the president and ceo of fyrnetics.during this same time period,russo was also the managing director of fhk.russo testified that the license agreement either never went into effect or was abandoned.according to russo,in december,he and mark goldstein,president and ceo of quantum,reached an oral agreement,allowing fhk to purchase co sensors from quantum directly and then to manufacture co detectors for resale to fyrnetics.therefore,russo asserted that in late and early,when the allegedly defective sensors were sold to fhk,quantum and fhk were acting pursuant to this oral agreement and not the license agreement,which contained the arbitration provision.
on,russo was confronted with multiple memoranda and letters between the parties referencing the license agreement.for example,on january,quantum attorney,peter leal,wrote kidde attorney,byron gregory,and stated that if fyrnetics were sold to kidde,quantum would require that kidde agree to be bound by the license agreement.gregory responded and explained that the transactions were being structured as a sale of stock.therefore,he further explained,because no sale of business or asset transaction would be occurring,it was unnecessary for kidde to attain quantum consent to use quantum patented sensor technology.as a second example,on january,kidde and fyrnetics executed a share purchase agreement that specifically disclosed to kidde the license agreement as a current asset of fyrnetics.no evidence was presented at the evidentiary hearing by fhk or kidde to corroborate russo testimony about the existence of an oral contract.
goldstein testified on behalf of quantum,stating that at all relevant times,the parties business relationship and the sale of co sensors to fhk was governed by the license agreement.goldstein asserted that there was not another agreement that gave either fhk or fyrnetics the right to use quantum patented technology.goldstein further denied reaching an oral agreement with russo and denied agreeing to any abandonment of the license agreement.rather,goldstein explained that in late and early,when the allegedly defective senors were sold to fhk,fyrnetics was allowing its affiliate,fhk,to manufacture the co detectors on its behalf pursuant to the license agreement.
on august,the district court dismissed fhk and kidde complaint in favor of arbitration.the district court explained that e ven though russo testified,and the plaintiffs maintain,that the license agreement was a dead letter,documents confirm that fyrnetics was treating the agreement as alive and well as late as june.moreover,the district court explained that the fact that the royalty rate paid by fyrnetics and then by kidde to quantum was the same as the rate set out in the license agreement two and percent further supported its conclusion that the parties were acting pursuant to the license agreement.the district court determined that the license agreement permitted fyrnetics to sublicense any affiliate,and that the license agreement passed to kidde as part of kidde acquisition of fyrnetics.thus,the district court concluded that in purchasing the co sensors and other components from quantum for use in the co detectors sold to fyrnetics and kidde,fhk was acting as fyrnetics sublicensee under the license agreement,which contains the arbitration clause.
in january,the district court denied fhk and kidde subsequent motion for reconsideration and reaffirmed its order dismissing fhk and kidde claims.in this denial,the district court further explained that it rejected as lacking in credibility the testimony of thomas russo that in purchasing the co sensors,fhk was acting pursuant to a verbal understanding with quantum rather than pursuant to the written license agreement.
ii.analysis 
fhk and kidde present several arguments on appeal.first,they contend that the district court erred when it disregarded their version of the events.they continue to insist that the license agreement was abandoned or,alternatively,never went into
