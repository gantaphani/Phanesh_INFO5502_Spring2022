in this writ proceeding,petitioners mary and lee medeiros collectively,medeiros challenge the trial court order compelling them to arbitrate a dispute with their health insurer,real party in interest health net medeiros contends the arbitration provision at issue is unenforceable because it does not comply with the disclosure requirements set forth in health and safety code section health net asserts,as a member of a group health plan negotiated between health net and medeiros employer,medeiros is not entitled to the protection of these disclosures.moreover,health net argues the requirements of section do not apply to the benefits election form medeiros signed and submitted to his employer in order to enroll in the group health plan.health net claims section disclosure obligations would only have been triggered if it had required medeiros to sign an enrollment form in order to enroll in the health plan.we reject health net contention consumers who enroll in a group health plan negotiated between their employer and the insurance company,and consumers who sign their employer benefits election form instead of an enrollment form provided by the insurance company,are entitled to some lesser form of disclosure concerning arbitration than consumers who individually subscribe to a health insurance plan.we conclude the disclosure requirements of section are applicable to the arbitration provision health net seeks to enforce against medeiros,and the arbitration provision is unenforceable for failure to comply with these requirements.accordingly,we direct the trial court to vacate its order requiring medeiros to arbitrate this dispute with health net,and to issue an order denying health net motion to compel arbitration.
facts and proceedings below 
apparently medeiros filed a lawsuit against health net for breach of contract and bad faith,among other claims in response,health net filed a motion to compel arbitration and to stay the trial court proceedings pending completion of arbitration.health net explained it had entered into a group service agreement with medeiros employer,the county of san bernardino the county to provide health insurance services and benefits to the county employees and their families.in its application for a group service agreement,the county agreed to the following term any dispute or controversy,except medical malpractice,that may arise between the applicant,a member and health net regarding the performance,interpretation or breach of the agreement between applicant and health net,whether arising in contract,tort or otherwise,must be submitted to arbitration in lieu of a jury or court trial.
pursuant to the group service agreement,health net and the county contemplated employees seeking coverage under the group plan would complete enrollment forms,which would become part of the agreement between the parties.the agreement between health net and the county also states health net will make available to each subscriber an evidence of coverage which will set forth a statement of services and benefits to which the members are entitled and an identification card.
in its motion to compel arbitration,health net stated it does not obtain individual applications from county employees who elect to enroll in the health net health service plan.instead,county employees who wish to become health net members notify the county which,in turn,sends a copy of the benefits election form to health net according to the county own procedures.those procedures do not include sending health net any application or enrollment form signed by the member.
health net attached to its motion a copy of the county of san bernardino benefits election agreement lee medeiros signed on june,indicating he wanted to enroll himself and his family in the health net plan as opposed to blue cross or kaiser permanente.in the middle of the signature page,the agreement states an employee enrolling in one of the plans will agree to a list of five things,including to abide by the rules of binding arbitration as described in the evidence of coverage and disclosure brochures for health net and blue cross medical plans.claims against these medical plans or their providers are subject to binding arbitration after exhaustion of the medical plans grievance procedure.claims against these medical plans for the professional negligence of the medical plans providers are not subject to this requirement of binding arbitration.printed under this language is a heading stating,kaiser permanente arbitration agreement applies to kaiser participants only,and the text of that particular arbitration provision.immediately above lee medeiros signature on the benefits election form agreement is language concerning the required duration of enrollment in the plan.
health net also attached to its motion the evidence of coverage eoc referenced in the benefits election agreement lee medeiros signed.the eoc includes a arbitration clause under a heading entitled binding arbitration.health net argued medeiros was required to arbitrate the claims against health net pursuant to the arbitration provisions in the benefits election agreement and the eoc.
in opposition to the motion to compel arbitration,medeiros submitted declarations stating neither mary nor lee medeiros received the eoc until after a health net representative agreed to mail the document to mary in november.in addition,medeiros argued the arbitration provision in the benefits election agreement lee medeiros signed is unenforceable because it does not comply with the mandatory disclosure requirements set forth in section in that the arbitration provision is not prominently displayed and is not located immediately before the signature line as required by the statute.
in its reply brief,health net argued section disclosure requirements apply only to the application for group service agreement and the group service agreement with the county,and not the benefits election form prepared by the lee medeiros signed and submitted to the county.health net asserted california law and section in particular does not require health net to obtain an application or enrollment form from plaintiffs.instead,it requires that if health net obtains an application from them that certain disclosures be made.since health net did not obtain an application from plaintiffs,the requirements governing such applications do not apply here.health net further asserted,where the hmo does not require individual applications or enrollment forms,there is no vehicle in which to require the disclosures to be made to the individual.health net also stated,in any event,the benefits election agreement lee medeiros signed provided actual notice of the arbitration provision contained in the eoc.
apparently,the trial court originally denied health net motion to compel arbitration under code of civil procedure section,subdivision c on the ground medeiros also had sued other parties in this lawsuit who were not subject to any arbitration agreement medeiros did not oppose the motion on this basis.health net filed a motion for reconsideration,arguing the trial court could not deny the motion to compel under code of civil procedure section,subdivision c because the arbitration clause contained in the eoc is governed by the federal arbitration act.medeiros conceded that point,but nevertheless urged the trial court to deny health net motion for reconsideration on the ground the arbitration provision is unenforceable for failure to comply with the disclosure requirements set forth in section.in a reply brief in support of its motion for reconsideration,health net made the arguments it had raised previously and also asserted for the first time that a court can not refuse to enforce an arbitration agreement for failure to comply with section because the department of managed health care has exclusive authority to enforce section and all other provisions of the act.
at oral argument on health net motion for reconsideration,the trial court stated it had originally denied health net motion to compel arbitration on an incorrect ground.the court rejected medeiros argument about noncompliance with section disclosure requirements stating,i think that the disclosure in the contract group service agreement is what is contemplated,not an individual enrollment form.on june,the trial court issued an order granting the motion for reconsideration and compelling arbitration of medeiros claims against health net.
medeiros filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the trial court june,order after receiving health net preliminary opposition,this court issued an alternative writ directing the trial court to vacate the june order or show cause before this court why it had not done so and why a peremptory writ of mandate requiring it to vacate the order should not issue.health net filed a return and medeiros filed a reply.
discussion 
in the petition for writ of mandate,medeiros contends the arbitration provisions in the benefits election agreement and the eoc are unenforceable against medeiros because health net did not comply with the disclosure requirements set forth in section.we agree.our interpretation of section and our determination of its applicability to the undisputed facts in this case are questions of law subject to our independent review 
section provides any health care service plan that includes terms that require binding arbitration to settle disputes and that restrict,or provide for a waiver of,the right to a jury trial shall include,in clear and understandable language,a disclosure that meets all of the following conditions a the disclosure shall clearly state whether the plan uses binding arbitration to settle disputes,including specifically whether the plan uses binding arbitration to settle claims of medical malpractice.b the disclosure shall appear as a separate article in the agreement issued to the employer group or individual subscriber and shall be prominently displayed on the enrollment form signed by each subscriber or enrollee.c the disclosure shall clearly state whether the subscriber or enrollee is waiving his or her right to a jury trial for medical malpractice,other disputes relating to the delivery of service under the plan,or both,and shall be substantially expressed in the wording provided in subdivision a of section of the code of civil procedure.d in any contract or enrollment agreement for a health care service plan,the disclosure required by this section shall be displayed immediately before the signature line provided for the representative of the group contracting with a health care service plan and immediately before the signature line provided for the individual enrolling in the health care service plan.
the disclosure requirements set forth in section are mandatory california appellate courts have refused to enforce arbitration clauses which do not satisfy these requirements courts have concluded that strict compliance with section is required to enforce an arbitration provision in a health service plan t echnical violations of the as the failure to prominently display an arbitration provision immediately above the signature line on the enrollment form render the arbitration provision unenforceable regardless of whether the person enrolling in the health plan received some notice of the arbitration clause by reviewing the provision 
neither the benefits election agreement nor the eoc satisfies the disclosure requirements of section.neither contains an arbitration provision which is prominently displayed immediately above a line for the enrollee signature.a lengthy discussion about compliance or noncompliance is not warranted here because health net does not claim these arbitration provisions comply with section.what health net argues is a signed arbitration agreement complying with the disclosure requirements of section is not necessary in this case for the courts to compel medeiros to arbitrate its dispute.health net states a variety of reasons for its conclusion,each of which we address and reject below.
first,health net asserts medeiros is bound by the arbitration provisions found in the group service application and group service agreement between health net and the county,regardless of whether medeiros received the protection of section disclosures.health net cites madden kaiser foundation hospitals a case the california supreme court decided more than years before the legislature enacted section.the supreme court in madden held the board of administration of the state employees retirement system board acted as an agent or representative of state employees when it negotiated a group health plan with kaiser foundation health plan,and the board had implied authority to agree to arbitration of malpractice claims of enrolled employees arising under the contract.
a little over a year ago,in viola department of managed health care division four of this appellate district had an opportunity to revisit and interpret madden in light of section.viola is not a case about proper disclosures.the plaintiffs did not argue the arbitration provisions at issue failed to comply with section requirements the plaintiffs contended it was improper for the department of managed health care,the agency which licenses and regulates california health service plans under the act to approve plans containing mandatory binding arbitration clauses.the plaintiffs asserted this practice violated their right to jury trial.the court of appeal disagreed.
finding the legislature was aware of madden when it enacted section,the appellate court in viola concluded rather than abrogating the madden decision by requiring an individual waiver of right to jury trial by a person enrolling in a health care service plan requiring binding arbitration,the legislature extended to enrollees the more limited protection of disclosure.we agree with the trial court that the enactment of section evinces a legislative intent to allow binding arbitration in health care service plans negotiated by employers acting as agents for their employees.because a health care service contract may contain an arbitration clause so long as it complies with the disclosure requirements of section,an employer is empowered under madden to negotiate a waiver of jury trial on behalf of its employees by negotiating a contract including such a clause with a health care service plan.the appellate court went on to explain,where an employer negotiates a health care plan which imposes binding arbitration on employees who enroll in it,the employees have the choice to enroll in the plan and give up a right to jury trial,or decline to enroll and forego coverage under the plan.
the madden and viola decisions do not support health net position in this case.medeiros is not arguing county employees should have been given the choice to enroll in a health plan which preserved their right to a jury trial.medeiros is arguing a group health plan which has binding arbitration as a term must include a disclosure to the which meets the requirements of section.neither madden nor viola holds otherwise.we interpret section to provide protection in the form of certain disclosures to all consumers,not just consumers who individually subscribe to a health plan.the statute clearly indicates an individual who enrolls in a health care service plan will receive a certain type of disclosure which is prominently displayed immediately before the signature line on the form the individual signs to enroll in the plan 
when it comes to making the decision whether to enroll in a health plan and be bound by an arbitration clause,we can see no reason why employees who enroll in a group plan should be afforded some lesser right of disclosure.the legislative history supports our interpretation of section.the bill was drafted due to a concern some health care service plans fail to adequately advise prospective enrollees that terms of the plan restrict or waive the right to a jury trial in medical malpractice cases.in the context of a group health plan,it is the employees,not the employers,who are the prospective enrollees.considering the reason for the legislation and the plain language of the statute,we can not hold a health plan satisfies its obligations under section when it makes the required disclosure to the em
