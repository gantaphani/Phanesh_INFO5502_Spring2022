the heads own property in trabuco canyon that is subject to conditions,covenants,and restrictions cc r and is governed by the association.the heads and the association agreed in correspondence to submit to nonbinding arbitration of a dispute over various alleged violations of the cc r and delinquent assessment fees and noncompliance penalties the association imposed on the heads 
after the arbitration hearing,the arbitrator,retired judge luis cardenas,issued a binding arbitration award and decision in the association favor.in essence,the award compelled the heads to comply with the cc r by remedying their violations and to pay all assessments owed and the association attorney fees and costs about three months later,at the association behest,the arbitrator issued a supplemental decision,which added the amount of the attorney fees and costs to the award.
about two months later,nancy attended an association meeting and asserted the arbitrator had mistakenly characterized the arbitration as binding.the association took the position it had been binding.the next month,the association filed a petition to confirm the arbitration award.
nancy called the arbitrator office in an attempt to confirm the arbitration had been nonbinding,and the arbitrator asked for input from the parties.the association submitted a letter with a declaration from the association property manager,dori kagan,asserting the parties had agreed at the outset of the arbitration hearing that the arbitration would be binding.the heads did not respond.the arbitrator issued a letter indicating his notes conformed with the association position and that b oth dori kagan on behalf of the association and head agreed to seek a final resolution of this dispute.he rul ed that the proceeding was a binding arbitration.
the heads response to the petition to confirm the arbitration award requested the court to vacate the award on the grounds of fraud and that the arbitrator exceeded his powers by purporting to render a binding award.in support of the motion,nancy declared that although she expressed her desire to put the whole ugly dispute behind them and that she would be so relieved when the dispute was finally resolved,she never agreed to make the arbitration binding.indeed,she asserted that when she asked why the association was listed as the plaintiff,the arbitrator said she should not worry because the hearing was nonbinding.michael head recollection was in accord.
in support of the award,the association attorney submitted a supplemental declaration to which the arbitrator letter was attached.he later filed another declaration averring he was present at the arbitration hearing and the heads agreed to make the arbitration binding.he agreed they said they were happy the matter would be finally resolved but asserted they made the statement after they agreed to binding arbitration.he also said the heads expressed a concern about why the association had been listed as the petitioner,but he contended the arbitrator told them it did not matter because they could present their entire case.the attorney also averred the heads did not leave halfway through the arbitration as they claimed but did so only after the arbitrator had announced his ruling.
at the hearing on the petition,the court declined to hear any testimony,although both sides indicated they were willing to offer it.the court responded,it done by declaration.the association has a declaration by the arbitrator who indicates we have binding arbitration.the heads attorney pointed out it was not a declaration but rather a letter.the court responded,i accepting it for what it says to the court,and for you,that he the arbitrator,and it is binding your client sat on it.did nothing.let the time go by.if it were not binding,and she did like the award,she still had her remedies.did do anything.the court confirmed the award 
the heads filed motions for reconsideration to set aside the judgment on the grounds of mistake,inadvertence,and excusable neglect the court denied the motions after a hearing.
the heads contend the trial court erroneously found the arbitration was binding.in a related claim,they argue the court improperly found they did not timely file a request for a trial de novo.we conclude that although the trial court might properly have found the arbitration was binding,it reached its result by an impermissible means and the case must be reversed and remanded to properly determine whether the heads agreed to binding arbitration.
california has a policy favoring arbitration as a speedy and inexpensive means of settling disputes the present contractual arbitration law functions as a comprehensive scheme regulating contractual arbitration.the purpose of this law is to promote contractual arbitration,in accordance with a strong public policy in favor thereof citation as a more expeditious and less expensive means of resolving disputes than litigation.citation.to support this policy and encourage parties to settle their disputes through arbitration,it is essential that arbitration judgments be both binding and final.thus,as a general rule,courts will indulge every reasonable intendment to give effect to arbitration proceedings.citations.to ensure that an arbitrator decision is the end of the dispute,arbitration awards are subject to very narrow judicial review.classic construction,development th,d.
section lists the exclusive grounds for vacating an arbitration award,which include in relevant part the award was procured by corruption,fraud or other undue means.there was corruption in any of the arbitrators.the rights of the party were substantially prejudiced by misconduct of a neutral arbitrator.the arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted beyond this,arbitration awards are immune from judicial review in proceedings to confirm or challenge the award.classic construction,development,supra,th at,d.
in moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,our supreme court examined this statutory limitation and the policies in favor of arbitration finality and concluded that except for narrow exceptions,an arbitrator decision may not be reviewed for factual or legal errors.nevertheless,the courts do not abandon all scrutiny of awards.when the issue goes to the integrity of the arbitration process itself,appellate courts have mandated de novo review of an arbitrator ruling.
for example,in britz,food dairy th,d,the court held that a trial court considering a petition to confirm or vacate an arbitration award is required to determine,de novo,whether the circumstances disclose a reasonable impression of arbitrator bias,when that issue is properly raised by a party to the arbitration.the court found it necessary to remand the matter to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing at which the full extent and nature of the relationships at issue may be ascertained.citation.ibid.likewise,in circumstances similar to those we consider,the court in haumeder lipsett d,held evidence was required to explain whether the parties had agreed that the arbitrator report would be binding.
