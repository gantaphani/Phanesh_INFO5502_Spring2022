introduction 
defendant,stephen carrigan,individually and doing business as national real estate council,appeals from an order denying his petition pursuant to code of civil procedure section to compel plaintiffs,arthur hedges and dimity hedges,to arbitrate a dispute.the dispute arose from plaintiffs purchase of a single family residence from the sellers and defendants,lane weinman and cynthia weinman.in the published portion,we discuss whether section is subject to the limited preemptive effect of the united states arbitration act.we affirm.
ii.background 
on september,plaintiffs filed their action on a number of contractual and tort theories against the weinmans carrigan,who was plaintiffs broker and todd olsen realty and debbie schreve,who was the weinmans broker.the complaint alleged that defendants failed to disclose several defects in the residence,which plaintiffs discovered after they purchased and occupied the home in september.
on february,carrigan filed a petition for an order compelling plaintiffs to mediate and to arbitrate the controversy.the parties subsequently agreed to mediate the dispute.the petition to compel alleged that on january,carrigan was served with the summons and complaint by letter dated january,carrigan counsel demanded mediation and arbitration and plaintiffs have refused his demand.the following are the pertinent facts.carrigan acted as plaintiffs broker in connection with the purchase of the residence.on august,plaintiffs executed a written residential purchase agreement,joint escrow instructions,and deposit receipt which contains an arbitration clause.the august,residential purchase agreement,joint escrow instructions,and deposit receipt was in legal effect an offer to purchase the residence under specified terms.paragraph of the august,residential purchase agreement,joint escrow instructions,and deposit receipt required that the controversy be arbitrated if agreed to by the parties.paragraph provides brokers buyer and seller agree to mediate and arbitrate disputes or claims involving either or both brokers,provided either or both brokers shall have agreed to such mediation or arbitration,prior to or within a reasonable time after the dispute or claim is presented to brokers.any election by either or both brokers to participate in mediation or arbitration shall not result in brokers being deemed parties to the agreement.paragraph of the agreement is entitled dispute resolution and provides in part mediation buyer and seller agree to mediate any dispute or claim arising between them out of this agreement,or any resulting transaction,before resorting to arbitration or court action,subject to paragraphs and d below.mediation fees,if any shall be divided equally among the parties involved.if,for any dispute or claim to which this paragraph applies,any party commences an action without first attempting to resolve the matter through mediation,or refuses to mediate after a request has been made,then that party shall not be entitled to recover attorney fees,even if they would otherwise be available to that party in any such action.this meditation provision applies whether or not the arbitration provision is initialed.arbitration of disputes buyer and seller agree that any dispute or claim in law or equity arising between them out of this agreement or any resulting transaction,which is not settled through mediation,shall be decided by neutral,binding arbitration,including and subject to paragraphs and d below notice by initialing in the space below you are agreeing to have any dispute arising out of the matters included in the arbitration of disputes provision decided by neutral arbitration as provided by california law and you are giving up any rights you might possess to have the dispute litigated in a court or jury trial.by initialing in the space below you are giving up your judicial rights to discovery and appeal,unless those rights are specifically included in the arbitration of disputes provision.if you refuse to submit to arbitration after agreeing to this provision,you may be compelled to arbitrate under the authority of the california code of civil procedure.your agreement to this arbitration provision is voluntary.we have read and understand the foregoing and agree to submit disputes arising out of the matters included in the arbitration of disputes provision to neutral arbitration.plaintiffs initialed the space as required by paragraph.
on august,the weinmans,the sellers,made a written counteroffer.on the same date,plaintiffs accepted the weinmans written counteroffer.the august,written counteroffer executed by both the weinmans and plaintiffs was a single document.
the august,written counteroffer referred to the august,residential purchase agreement,joint escrow instructions,and deposit receipt as follows,paragraphs in the purchase contract offer which require initials by all parties,but are not initialed by all parties,are excluded from the final agreement unless specifically referenced for inclusion in paragraph of this or another counter offer.paragraph of the august,written counteroffer made no reference to paragraph,the arbitration clause,in the august,residential purchase agreement,joint escrow instructions,and deposit receipt.defendants never initialed paragraph,the arbitration clause,in the august,residential purchase agreement,joint escrow instructions,and deposit receipt.
on march,the trial court denied the petition to compel arbitration.this timely appeal followed.because this is a case involving enforcement of an arbitration clause,we have treated the case as a preference matter as required by statute.cal.rules of court,rule.
iii.discussion 
plaintiffs contend the arbitration clause in the august,residential purchase agreement,joint escrow instructions,and deposit receipt is unenforceable because it does not comply with the notice and format provisions required by section section imposes various requirements on arbitration clauses in specified real estate agreements including in part point size and bolded font specifications a specific reference to arbitration of disputes and a warning that certain rights attendant to judicial proceeding are being lost by initialing the agreement to arbitrate.plaintiffs contend the arbitration clause at issue did not comply with section and the failure to do so rendered the agreement to arbitrate unenforceable.we need not address the question as to whether the arbitration clause complied with section.nor need we discuss whether the purported failure to comply with section invalidates the arbitration clause.
rather,we conclude that the united states arbitration act would preempt a statutory requirement or judicial holding that compliance with section is a condition precedent to enforcement of an arbitration clause contained in one of the specified contracts.the limited preemptive effect of united states arbitration act is based on title united states code,section,which states in pertinent part a written provision in any contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction,or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof,or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract,transaction,or refusal,shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.see mcmanus cibc world markets th,d siegel prudential ins.th,d.thus,an arbitration contract must be enforced according to its terms subject to state law defenses applicable to all disputes under general contract law principles such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability.doctor associates,casarotto,d terminix dobson,d rosenthal great western fin.securities cal th,d.a court may not invalidate an agreement to arbitrate under state laws that are only applicable to arbitration clauses.doctor associates,casarotto,supra,at.terminix dobson,supra,at.in perry thomas,footnote,d,the united states supreme court explained,a court may not,then,in assessing the rights of litigants to enforce an arbitration agreement,construe that agreement in a manner different from that in which it otherwise construes nonarbitration agreements under state law.see broughton cigna healthplans cal th,d.as justice stephen breyer plainly explained what states may not do is decide that a contract is fair enough to enforce all its basic terms price,service,credit,but not fair enough to enforce its arbitration clause.the act makes any such state policy unlawful,for that kind of policy would place arbitration clauses on an unequal footing,directly contrary to the united states arbitration act language and congress intent.see volt info.sciences leland stanford,d.terminix dobson,supra,at.
these general principles describing the limited preemptive effect of the united states arbitration act control the effect of section in the present case.in doctor associates,casarotto,supra,at page,the united states supreme court examined a montana law that invalidated any arbitration clause unless n otice that the contract is subject to arbitration was typed in underlined capital letters on the first page of the contract.after adverting to the supreme court prior decisions in southland keating,d,which held a portion of california franchise investment law was preempted by the united states arbitration act,and perry thomas,at pages,which invalidated on preemption grounds this state prohibition of arbitration of wage claims,associate justice ruth bader ginsburg wrote in doctor associates montana directly conflicts with of the united states arbitration act because the state law conditions the enforceability of arbitration agreements on compliance with a special notice requirement not applicable to contracts generally.the united states arbitration act thus displaces the montana statute with respect to arbitration agreements covered by the act.see macneil,speidel,stipanowich,shell,federal arbitration law,under southland and perry,state legislation requiring greater information or choice in the making of agreements to arbitrate than in other contracts is preempted.doctor associates,casarotto,supra,at,fn.omitted accord,mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,d preempts new york prohibition against arbitrating punitive damages terminix dobson,supra,at.united states arbitration act preempts alabama statute making predispute arbitration agreements unenforceable.as with the notice requirements in doctor associates,section does to apply generally to contracts.rather,section applies only to arbitration clauses in specified real estate transaction documents.under the compulsion of justice ginsburg analysis in doctor associates,section,with its font and point size,notification,and warning requirements taken together,can not be judicially construed to invalidate the arbitration clause at issue without violating the united states arbitration act.
one final note is in order concerning the application of the united states arbitration act.the limited preemptive effect of the united states arbitration act applies only in the case of an arbitration clause in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce.the arbitration clause in the august,residential purchase agreement,joint escrow instructions,and deposit receipt is contained in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce within the meaning of title united states code section.the united states supreme court has explained that the words involving commerce reflect an intent to exercise the congressional commerce clause powers to the full are broad and the functional equivalent of the adjective affecting interstate commerce are not to be construed so as to apply only when the parties contemplate the transaction will involve interstate commerce and require that the united states arbitration act apply when a transaction in fact involve s interstate commerce.terminix dobson,supra,at.thus,in,the supreme court held that a contract providing for termite eradication in and repairs to a residence involved interstate commerce and hence was subject to the limited preemptive effect of the united states arbitration act.id.at.
the united states supreme court later synthesized its holding in in citizens bank alafabco,d,a case involving an arbitration clause in a debt restructuring agreement,as follows we have interpreted the term involving commerce in the united states arbitration act as the functional equivalent of the more familiar term affecting commerce words of art that ordinarily signal the broadest permissible exercise of congress commerce clause power.terminix,at.because the statute provides for the enforcement of arbitration agreements within the full reach of the commerce clause,perry thomas,d,it is perfectly clear that the united states arbitration act encompasses a wider range of transactions than those actually in commerce that is,within the flow of interstate commerce,terminix,supra,at.internal quotation marks,citation,and emphasis omitted.the court continued congress commerce clause power may be exercised in individual cases without showing any specific effect upon interstate commerce if in the aggregate the economic activity in question would represent a general practice subject to federal control.mandeville island farms,american crystal sugar.see also perez united states,d wickard filburn.only that general practice need bear on interstate commerce in a substantial way.maryland wirtz,d nlrb jones laughlin steel.citizens bank alafabco,supra,at.at.
in the present case,the august,residential purchase agreement,joint escrow instructions,and deposit receipt as well as the accepted august,counteroffer was a contract which evidenced a transaction involving commerce within the meaning of title united states code section.the anticipated financing involved the use of a federal housing administration home loan,which is subject to the jurisdiction of the united states department of housing and urban development headquartered in washington,further,the various copyrighted forms used by the parties and their brokers could only be utilized by members of the national association of realtors.these documents included the august,residential purchase agreement,joint escrow instructions,and deposit receipt the august,counteroffer and a real estate transfer disclosure statement,which the weinmans were alleged to have filled out in a deceptive fashion.in citizens bank alafabco,supra,at.at,the supreme court explained the relationship between lending agreements and commerce w ere there any residual doubt about the magnitude of the impact on interstate commerce caused by the particular economic transactions in which the parties were engaged,that doubt would dissipate upon consideration of the general practice those transactions represent.mandeville island farms,supra,at.no elaborate explanation is needed to make evident the broad impact of commercial lending on the national economy or congress power to regulate that activity pursuant to the commerce clause.lewis bt investment managers,d b anking and related financial activities are of profound local concern nonetheless,it does not follow that these same activities lack important interstate attributes perez,supra,at.extortionate credit transactions,though purely intrastate,may in the judgment of congress affect interstate commerce.given the foregoing language in citizens bank,the present transaction involves financing,which evidences a transaction in commerce.
no doubt the connection with interstate commerce in this case is not as strong as in others.citizens bank alafabco,supra,at.at interstate entity entered into a debt restructuring agreement terminix companies,dobson,supra,at.supplies to fumigate and repair residential termite damage came from out of the state where the dispute arose basura home th,d alleged defective fixtures in construction defect litigation manufactured outside california.however,the federal financing in this case supervised by an organ of the united states government located in washington,plus the use of copyrighted transaction documents promulgated by a national organization which could only be used by its members lead us to the conclude the agreement at issue evidenc es a transacti
