as we have repeatedly recognized,judicial review of arbitral awards is extremely limited,and we do not sit to hear claims of factual or legal error by an arbitrator as we would in reviewing decisions of lower courts.teamsters local union united parcel,quoting kanuth prescott,ball turben.the federal arbitration act faa,a,lists only four grounds upon which an arbitration award may be vacated neither oscar gruss nor wagenheim contends that any of those grounds is applicable here.

oscar gruss proffers two arguments in support of its claim that the arbitration panel award to kurke was made in manifest disregard of the law.first,the company contends that,under the terms of his margin agreement,kurke failure to object to the unauthorized trades in writing within the stipulated time frame effectively ratified those trades.second,oscar gruss asserts that kurke failure to mitigate his damages after he became aware of the unauthorized trading relieves the company of some or all of its liability for kurke losses.
