this case comes before this court for the third time.in an order and judgment disposing of nukem first appeal,this court set out the background facts,as follows 
plaintiff usecc is a joint venture comprised of two uranium mining companies,plaintiffs energy and crested,which held several mining claims in wyoming and a number of contracts to supply uranium to utility companies.cycle resource investment cric is a subsidiary of defendant nukem,formed specifically to enter into the agreements at issue in this case.on december,usecc and cric entered into a transaction for the purpose of mining uranium in wyoming and selling it to domestic utilities.in an asset purchase agreement,usecc agreed to sell a interest in its mining claims and supply contracts to cric.in a separate partnership agreement,usecc and cric each agreed to make capital contributions of their interest in the mining claims and supply contracts to the new partnership,sheep mountain partners hereafter smp.the partnership agreement contained an arbitration clause and required smp to enter into independent contract agreements with usecc to operate the mines and with cric to market the uranium produced.cric subsequently assigned its rights and duties under the marketing agreement to nukem.
after usecc and cric entered into their partnership agreement,nukem negotiated uranium importation contracts with the commonwealth of independent states hereafter cis,whose members include uzbekistan,kazakhstan and kirgizstan.in order to prevent members of the cis from dumping uranium in the united states at prices below fair market value,the united states had imposed a tariff in excess of of the value of the imported cis uranium.the united states,however,agreed to permit some shipment of cis uranium into the united states without tariff if the purchaser had a utility supply contract executed prior to march.if a supply contract met this requirement,the contract was considered grandfathered.acting in its own right,nukem subsequently submitted utility supply contracts to the department of commerce for grandfathering.these contracts included five supply contracts owned by smp.the grandfathering of the contracts allowed nukem to purchase cis uranium in amounts necessary to meet the delivery requirements of those utility supply contracts.nukem did not,however,supply the cis uranium to smp to satisfy the five utility supply contracts requirements,but instead sold the uranium to other buyers.as a result,smp purchased uranium from other suppliers at higher prices to meet its contractual obligations.
from these and other transactions,numerous disputes arose among the parties.in,plaintiffs filed this action in the district court.in,the parties stipulated to binding arbitration.the parties raised more than claims before the arbitration panel.one of those claims involved the cis uranium contracts.plaintiffs argued that by entering into cis contracts on its own account,nukem violated the marketing and partnership agreements.plaintiffs also argued that nukem improperly used the five smp utility supply contracts to avoid the tariff on the cis uranium.
the arbitration panel conducted a hearing and issued a written arbitration order and award on april.the arbitration panel rejected the claim that nukem violated the marketing and partnership agreements by entering into the cis contracts.in regard to the five smp utility supply contracts,the arbitration panel concluded that nukem without authority and without smp permission or consent used the smp uranium supply contracts,which were partnership assets,to obtain purchase rights for cis uranium.the panel further found that the uranium should have been made available to smp to meet deliveries required by smp grandfathered supply contracts.as a result of nukem conduct,the panel impressed a constructive trust in favor of smp over those purchase rights,the uranium acquired pursuant to those rights and the profits therefrom the panel also determined that as a result of nukem conduct regarding the five supply contracts,smp suffered damages in the amount of and awarded plaintiffs,as holders of a interest in smp,half that amount or plus interest.
on july,in response to motions by defendants,the panel amended the arbitration award to clarify the order and correct errors.on november,the district court entered an order and judgment confirming the arbitration award.the district court subsequently amended the order and judgment on march,and june.
energy nukem,wl cir,unpublished nukem i.
paragraph of the arbitration award has been at the center of much of the controversy in this case.in paragraph,the arbitration panel stated 
it is clear that nukem without authority and without smp permission or consent used the smp uranium supply contracts to obtain purchase rights for cis uranium.since the rights to purchase the cis uranium were obtained through the use of smp contracts partnership assets,those purchase rights,the uranium acquired pursuant to those rights and the profits therefrom are impressed with a constructive trust in favor of smp,and we conclude that smp is entitled to damages in the amount of half payable to plaintiffs to compensate it for its past and future lost profits.the uranium should have been made available to smp to meet deliveries required by smp grandfathered supply contracts.we enter awards for those past and future profits denied to the partnership,together with statutory interest at per annum.the relevant amounts are as follows 
vol.i,doc.at emphasis added.
as suggested by paragraph,there are two sets of contracts at issue smp five grandfathered contracts to supply uranium to certain domestic utility companies,and four contracts entered into,by nukem,with cis countries to buy uranium.it appears from the district court judgment that the district court concluded the latter set of contracts were somehow obtained by nukem through the misappropriation of the former set of contracts.
the connection between the smp supply contracts and the cis uranium purchase contracts is somewhat tenuous.on appeal,nukem denies that there is any evidence establishing a connection between the smp supply contracts and the cis purchase contracts.in fact,however,the arbitration panel heard the testimony of ronald witzel,an expert introduced by energy.among other things,witzel testified that nukem could not have obtained the cis contracts without the existing smp supply contracts.aplee.vol.i,doc.at.plaintiffs contend that the arbitration panel adopted witzel testimony on this issue,aplee.br.at,but they have not directed this court attention to any indication in the record that the arbitration panel officially adopted witzel testimony regarding the connection between the smp supply contracts and the cis purchase contracts.the arbitration panel did,however,state that the numbers shown in paragraph were based upon plaintiffs expert witness.moreover,it is undisputed that pursuant to the cis purchase contracts,nukem purchased much more uranium pounds than was required to fill smp grandfathered supply contracts pounds.app.vol.ii,doc.at.
in nukem i,nukem argued that the district court erred by entering a monetary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and imposing a constructive trust of undetermined value separate and apart from the damages award.nukem i,wl at.nukem asserted that by imposing a separate constructive trust the district court exceeded the relief granted by the arbitration panel.id.this court rejected that argument,stating 
amended paragraph clearly retains both a constructive trust and a damage award.assuming that the arbitration panel erred by impressing a constructive trust and awarding damages,we can not reverse an arbitration panel erroneous interpretations or applications of the law.we may only reverse the panel award if it evidences a manifest disregard for the law.the arbitration panel decision to impress a constructive trust and award damages is not willful inattentiveness to the governing law.
id.at internal citations and quotations omitted emphasis in original.alternatively,in nukem i,nukem argued that the district court judgment imposing the constructive trust was vague and ambiguous.this court rejected that argument,stating 
the second amended judgment provides pursuant to paragraph of arbitrators order,as modified by arbitrators order,the rights to purchase those rights,and the profits therefrom are impressed with a constructive trust in favor of smp defendants argue that this language creates a trust of indeterminable corpus and must be set aside.we disagree.amended paragraph explains that the purchase rights,uranium,and profits acquired through nukem use of smp five utility supply contracts were impressed with a constructive trust.paragraphs and of the arbitration award list the five grandfathered supply contracts duke,ipc,tuco,beco,and psf g.when read in conjunction with the arbitration order and award,the district court judgment is clear and unambiguous.the judgment impresses the trust pursuant to paragraph of the arbitration order,incorporating language identifying the proceeds from the five grandfathered smp supply contracts as the corpus of the constructive trust.
in its second appeal,nukem challenged the district court order denying its motion,made pursuant to.b,requesting a finding that it had fully satisfied the judgment against it.energy nukem,wl cir,nukem ii.nukem had submitted documents showing that the monetary judgment had been satisfied,but the district court held that the payment would not satisfy the constructive trust obligation.id.at.the district court concluded that nukem was required,but failed,to provide an accounting of the value of the cis purchase rights,the uranium purchased,and the profits therefrom.id.on appeal,this court affirmed the district court,concluding that the defendants had failed to provide an accounting and,therefore,failed to demonstrate that the judgment was satisfied.id.
following nukem ii,plaintiffs filed a motion in the district court to obtain a valuation of the constructive trust and to enforce the judgment.the district court entered orders referring the matter to a special master,attorney raymond freidlob,for an accounting,docs,at.the district court stated 
the special master shall conduct an accounting pertaining to 
all of defendant transactions in cis uranium based on cis purchase rights obtained through the use of smp uranium supply contracts 
the profits realized therefrom 
the location and poundage of all such cis uranium and 
the status of such cis purchase rights 
with reference to and consistent with arbitration order arbitration order this court june,second amended judgment nukem i and nukem ii.
on may,with the assistance of a denver accounting firm and after more than hours of work,the special master issued his report.the special master framed the issue before him as follows 
what is at issue here is what is required to do equity as a result of the defendants misappropriation of partnership assets,opportunities and unjust enrichment as a result of defendants gaining the ability to obtain,nurture and develop an important business relationship with the cis for their own benefit the method used to calculate that value would be to impress in the constructive trust a payment to the smp partnership which includes such amounts to adequately compensate the smp partnership for the loss of the fruits of the business relationship which was developed,utilized,maintained and expanded by defendants.
vol.ii,doc.at.the special master came to several conclusions about the arbitration award.first,he concluded that the purchase rights were worth,including interest at the rate used by the arbitration panel in computing the damage award,or payable to the plaintiffs.the master valuation of purchase rights was based upon an assumption that their value was equal to of nukem gross cis uranium sales through december,the total of which was.vol.ii,doc.at.the special master settled on the figure based on a fee that nukem had paid to a third party that facilitated nukem relationship with another uranium source.id.at.the special master concluded that,by december,the purchase rights were extinguished because all deliveries due under the five grandfathered smp contracts had been made by that time.id.at.
the special master concluded that it would be equitable to find that the smp business relationship contributed to the defendants success in developing the cis business relationship which should have inured to the benefit of the smp partnership.id.at.relatedly,the special master concluded that nukem net profit from the sale of cis uranium pursuant to four cis purchase contracts totaled.id.at.the net profit figure was arrived at by subtracting in costs from nukem gross profit of on the sale of cis uranium.id.at.in one chart included within his report,the special master subtracted the arbitration panel previous damage award of from nukem net profit,arriving at negative.vol.ii,doc.at.the special master failed to explain the significance of that figure.
further,the special master concluded that had smp filled its grandfathered supply contracts with cis uranium,its hypothetical profit would have been.id.at.in connection with that figure,the special master stated it should be noted that the arbitration panel awarded smp to compensate it for its past and future profits related to the smp grandfathered supply contracts.id.the special master did not provide any valuation of the constructive trust as a whole,and he did not expressly state what he considered to be the corpus of the constructive trust.
the district court adopted some of the special master conclusions.specifically,the district court adopted the special master valuation of purchase rights the special master calculation of nukem net profits on the cis contracts and the special master conclusion that the purchase rights were extinguished on december.unlike the special master,the district court declined to engage in any review of the previous damages award.as a result,the district court rejected nukem argument that the constructive trust award should be reduced to reflect such a recalculation.according to the district court,the arbitration panel intended for the damages award and the constructive trust to be separate and distinct remedies.vol.ii,doc.u at.the district court stated that it was way too late for a recalculation of the damages award through the guise of the constructive trust accounting.id.at.on august,the district court entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs and against nukem in the amount of,which represented of the value of the cis uranium purchase rights,and in the amount of,which represented of nukem net profits on the sale of cis uranium.
on august,nukem filed a motion asking the district court to remand the matter to the arbitration panel,or,in the alternative,to alter or amend the judgment.vol.v,doc.at.nukem argued that the arbitration panel constructive trust award was ambiguous and that the matter should be remanded to the panel for clarification.alternatively,nukem argued that the judgment entered by the district court was inconsistent with the findings of the special master.on the same day,plaintiffs also filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment.vol.v,doc.at.plaintiffs argued that the district court had erred in concluding that the purchase rights were extinguished on december.further,plaintiffs argued that they were entitled to statutory prejudgment interest on the award of,which plaintiffs calculated to be.the district court denied these motions.vol.vi,docs.and.
federal arbitration act faa 
the faa provides that a written provision in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.although the faa does not create independent federal jurisdiction,the supreme court has held that the faa creates a body of substantive federal law governing arbitration agreements within its coverage.see bowen amoco pipeline,cir citing terminix dobson,d.
here,the parties partnership agreement contained an arbitration clause and the parties stipulated to binding arbitration pursuant to the faa and the commercial rules of the american arbitration association.in consenting to arbitration,a party trades the procedures and opportunity for review of the courtroom for the simplicity,informality,and expedition of arbitration.brown coleman,cir quoting gilmer lane,d.because the primary purpose behind arbitration agreements is to avoid the expense and delay of court proceedings,it is well settled that judicial review of an arbitration award is very narrowly limited.foster turley,cir internal citations omitted.

there is no dispute that nukem has satisfied the district court first judgment against it in the amount of.further,this court has decisively ruled that the arbitration panel intended to impose a constructive trust as an award above and beyond that damages award.the lingering controversy involves the value of the constructive trust.and,at the core of that controversy is the question what does those purchase rights,the uranium acquired pursuant to those rights and the profits therefrom mean 
on appeal,nukem argues the arbitration panel description of purchase rights was too vague to permit any valuation of purchase rights and that the matter should be remanded for clarification the district court valuation of the constructive trust erroneously included nukem net profits from the sale of cis uranium and the special master report was not clearly erroneous and should have been adopted in full by the district court.
vague description of purchase rights 
other circuits have held there are circumstances where a district court can remand to the arbitrators for clarification see green ameritech,cir stating remand proper to clarify an ambiguous award colonial penn ins.omaha indem,cir concluding trial court had authority to remand award to arbitrators for clarification of ambiguous award.c ourts have uniformly stated that a remand to the arbitration panel is appropriate in cases where the award is ambiguous.id.such a remand avoids the court misinterpretation of the award and is therefore more likely to give the parties the award for which they bargained.id.in short,for a court to engage in guesswork as to the meaning and application of an ambiguous arbitration award is inconsistent not only with federal policy,but also with the parties own agreement to submit their dispute to arbitration.m c erwin behr gmbh,cir.when there is more than one reasonable interpretation of an arbitration award,a remand for clarification is appropriate.mutual fire,marine inland ins.norad reinsurance,cir stating a district court itself should not clarify an ambiguous arbitration award but should remand it to the arbitration panel for clarification bell aerospace.div.of textron,local,cir stating c onstruing ambiguous provisions of an arbitration award is the proper province of the arbitrator,not the courts american postal workers postal,d,remanding for clarification where the arbitrator award was susceptible to more than one interpretation.such remands,however,are to be used sparingly in order not to thwart the interest of achieving finality.see fischer cga computer,recognizing remand frustrates the basic purposes of arbitration because it delays execution of the final judgment.
in nukem i,nukem argued the district court judgment imposing the constructive trust was vague and ambiguous.wl,at.this court indicated that the district court judgment was clear when read in conjunction with the arbitration order and award.id.however,this court was not asked to,nor did it,directly address the valuation of purchase rights,and the award offers no guidance on fundamental issues related to the valuation of purchase rights.for example,there is no indication what the purchase rights are,how they are to be valued,or when or how they are to be extinguished.the special master equated the value of purchase rights to the value of a third party facilitation of a relationship between nukem and another uranium service for which nukem paid the third party percent of the resulting uranium sales.the special master did not explain how rendering such a service was comparable to purchase rights.further,there is absolutely no support in the arbitration panel award for the special master formula for valuing purchase rights,of proceeds of nukem cis uranium sales prior to december.
although the special master interpretation of the arbitration award was arguably a reasonable one,our role is not one of interpretation rather,it is to determine whether the arbitration panel acted within its authority and whether the arbitration panel decision evinces a manifest disregard for the law.because there is more than one reasonable interpretation of the arbitration panel award,we conclude a remand for clarification is necessary.
in reaching this conclusion,we note that neither the passage of time nor the fact that one of the three arbitration panel members has died precludes remand.the parties in this case stipulated that the arbitration proceeding would be governed by the commercial rules of the american arbitration association aaa and the faa.aaa rule sets forth a procedure to address any vacancies that may occur in the panel 
a if for any reason an arbitrator is unable to perform the duties of the office,the aaa may,on proof satisfactory to it,declare the office vacant.vacancies shall be filled in accordance with the applicable provisions of these rules.
b in the event of a vacancy in a panel of neutral arbitrators after the hearings have commenced,the remaining arbitrator or arbitrators may continue with the hearing and determination of the controversy,unless the parties agree otherwise.
c in the event of the appointment of a substitute arbitrator,the panel of arbitrators shall determine in its sole discretion whether it is necessary to repeat all or part of any prior hearings.
