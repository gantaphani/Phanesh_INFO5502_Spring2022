factual and procedural background 
the parties to the master franchise agreement mfa 
red brick pizza is the franchisor of the red brick pizza franchise system.jim and lynn are cofounders of the franchise.
jay bharat is a california corporation owned and operated by morari and patel.in,pursuant to the mfa,jay bharat became a master franchisee of red brick pizza in southern california.the mfa permitted jay bharat to sell franchises within a certain territory.morari and patel executed the mfa on behalf of jay bharat.
the mfa explains the terms of the parties business relationship.as is relevant to this appeal,the mfa contains a royalty payment schedule,which sets forth jay bharat royalty payment obligations to red brick pizza.
the mfa also sets forth the circumstances under which red brick pizza can terminate the mfa.in addition to other grounds,i f jay bharat fails to perform any obligation imposed upon it by this mfa and such default is not totally cured within days after written notice of such default to jay bharat,then red brick pizza may terminate this mfa at any time thereafter.
and,the mfa contains an arbitration provision.excluded from the parties arbitration agreement are disputes in which injunctive relief is sought.
as a condition of their agreement,morari and patel agreed to own and operate a red brick pizza restaurant within the territory of cerritos,california pursuant to a unit franchise agreement,which contains substantially similar terms to the mfa.
the complaint 
on july,appellants initiated a lawsuit against respondents,alleging causes of action.in particular,appellants averred that respondents fraudulently induced them to enter into the mfa by failing to disclose pending litigation in the franchise offering circular and by misrepresenting that they could adequately train and support franchisees,had sufficient vendor contacts,and ownership of the trademark rights pertaining to the red brick pizza brand.appellants later filed a first amended complaint,with largely similar allegations and claims.
the parties are ordered to arbitration 
respondents moved to compel arbitration pursuant to the mfa.over appellants opposition,on november,the trial court granted the motion and ordered the case to arbitration.
red brick pizza terminates the mfa 
on august,red brick pizza terminated jay bharat mfa.according to red brick pizza,jay bharat had been in breach of the mfa by failing to pay royalties and advertising fees.jay bharat then permitted its registration as a franchisor with the state of california to lapse,operated franchises outside of its territory,failed to report income,and committed other contract violations.red brick pizza provided jay bharat numerous opportunities to cure the defaults,but terminated the contract when no cure was forthcoming.the notice of termination demanded that jay bharat comply with all posttermination obligations under the mfa.
red brick pizza 
on or about february,red brick pizza filed a against jay bharat,morari,and patel.red brick pizza alleged,inter alia,that jay bharat refused to honor the termination of the mfa and continued to receive royalties from its former franchisees and withhold them from red brick pizza.
red brick pizza motion for preliminary injunction 
the was accompanied by a motion for a preliminary injunction.red brick pizza argued that jay bharat,morari,and patel should be enjoined from continuing to represent themselves as a red brick pizza master franchisee and from using franchise trademarks.red brick pizza further asserted that the franchise relationship was properly terminated and that the injunction was warranted to prevent further economic harm.
in support of the motion,red brick pizza offered lynn declaration.lynn,the and chief financial officer of red brick pizza,testified that in august,morari and patel executed the mfa with red brick pizza on behalf of jay bharat.under the terms of the mfa,jay bharat became a master developer for a protected territory that included los angeles,ventura,and mono counties.however,the antelope and santa clarita valleys were specifically excluded from the territory.jay bharat paid an initial fee of for the right to act as a subfranchisor in the protected territory using the franchise system and its proprietary marks.as a master developer,jay bharat was responsible for selling a certain number of third party franchises in the territory as well as operating its own red brick pizza restaurant in cerritos.
lynn further attested that the franchise relationship began to deteriorate before jay bharat commenced litigation.for example,jay bharat sold a franchise outside of its territory,in santa clarita valley.jay bharat ignored lynn request for to add this new territory to the mfa.
moreover,jim was attempting to address various issues that were impacting the franchise relationship,including jay bharat operation of its own restaurant in cerritos,its failure to use approved vendors,its default on royalty payments,the failure to properly close down one of the franchises within its territory,and unprofessional behavior.thus,red brick pizza gave it notice that it was in material breach of the mfa.red brick pizza demanded that the defaults be cured within days.
ultimately,the breaches were not cured and,on august,red brick pizza terminated the mfa.although red brick pizza demanded that jay bharat comply with its posttermination obligations,it failed to do so,proceeding as if the termination were ineffective.
appellants opposed the motion for preliminary injunction on several grounds.in particular,they asserted that section prohibited the issuance of a preliminary injunction and that respondents could not establish a likelihood of success on the merits,in part because of respondents alleged unclean hands.
after entertaining oral argument,the trial court granted respondents motion.appellants motion for reconsideration was denied.
this timely appeal ensued.
