masteneh appeals from a judgment entered against her after the court granted a motion for summary judgment.sued her employer,the regents of the university of california,and her supervisor,mani vannan,collectively the regents,alleging sexual harassment in violation of the fair employment and housing act feha.the court granted the summary judgment after concluding lawsuit was barred because she initiated,but did not complete,an internal grievance process set forth in a collective bargaining agreement entered into between the university and her union.the court reasoned that although would have been entitled to bypass the internal process entirely,and proceed directly with her feha claim,she was required to complete the internal process once she had initiated it.
we reverse.while the grievance process offered to allowed her an opportunity for informal resolution of her grievances,it did not provide for a hearing with sufficient due process to generate a legally binding result.the only evidentiary hearing even mentioned in the grievance process was a step binding arbitration,and the right to invoke that hearing belonged exclusively to the herself was given no right to compel any arbitration of her claims.
because had no right to an evidentiary hearing as part of her grievance certainly never participated in authorities relied upon by the trial court in concluding she was bound to complete that process,and then to challenge its result through a writ of mandate proceeding,are inapposite.we can discern no reason to declare that she should be bound by the university rejection of her claims merely because she chose to participate in an informal meeting convened to discuss them the second step of the grievance process.
moreover,even assuming herself had been given some right to initiate the step binding arbitration,and had completed that arbitration,its result would not,in fact,have been entitled to binding effect against her in a subsequent lawsuit based upon the feha.marcario county of orange th,d.we perceive no basis for according binding effect to a partially completed grievance process,when even the completed process would not have been entitled to such effect.
the judgment is reversed,and the case remanded for further proceedings.
although there appear to be no disputed factual issues material to our resolution of this appeal,we are nonetheless required to view the evidence in the manner most favorable to party opposing the summary judgment.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.that evidence reveals the following from april of through february of,was employed as a research assistant in the cardiology department of the university of california,irvine,school of medicine.defendant vannan assumed the role of associate chief of the cardiology department in late,and almost immediately began subjecting to sexual harassment 
reported the harassment to another doctor in the department,who told her there was nothing he could do about it.at his suggestion,she reported the problem to the department office manager,who suggested that if vannan conduct was a real problem for her,she should look into finding another position.
in december of,she reported the problem to the dean of the school of medicine.he told her he did not wish to get involved,and suggested she go through the proper channels with human resources.shortly thereafter,was informed she was being laid off due to cessation in funding.
filed eight grievances pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement between the university and the university professional and technical employees cwa,local.her grievances asserted not only that she had been sexually harassed and improperly laid off,but also that she had been inadequately compensated for overtime work,and for out of class assignment.she also claimed the university had improperly failed to review her reclassification request,and failed to provide her with a copy of her personnel file when she requested it.
the grievance process set forth in the collective bargaining agreement consists of a maximum of four steps.step of the process is the delivery of a formal written grievance to the labor relations office at the campus where the employee works.the university has calendar days from receipt of the grievance to respond.if the university does not timely respond,or the employee is dissatisfied with the response,the employee may proceed to step,by filing a written appeal within calendar days of when the response was issued or was due.
the step appeal is a meeting convened by the designated university local official with the employee and her representative,no later than calendar days following receipt of the appeal to step.the purpose of that meeting is to discuss information and contentions relative to the grievance and to attempt to resolve it.within calendar days after the step meeting,the university is required to issue a written decision regarding the grievance 
step of the process is an appeal filed with the director of labor relations in the office of the president.step does not provide for any meeting or other mutual exchange of information.the university has days from the receipt of that step appeal to issue its written answer.
the fourth,and final,step of the grievance process is a binding arbitration.however,the employee has no right to initiate a step arbitration.only the union itself has that right.
grievances were rejected by the university in step,and she timely filed a step appeal on june.however,the step meeting was not convened within calendar days,as required.instead,months passed,with no meeting.on february,consulted with counsel,and filed a claim with the department of fair employment and housing.two days later,on february,the department issued a right to sue letter to both and the university.
the very next day,the university sent a letter scheduling her step meeting for february,five days later.the letter reflected that the hearing officer for the meeting would be michelle quint,labor relations specialist.attended that meeting,accompanied by her counsel.however,neither she,nor anyone else was placed under oath no documents were permitted to be introduced no witnesses were allowed to be present and her counsel was not allowed to question vannan,who was also present but did not speak.transcription of the meeting was not provided.
as anticipated in the collective bargaining agreement,the step meeting did result in a decision,issued on march.that decision was not issued by quint,the meeting hearing officer,but instead by david tomcheck,associate vice chancellor 
he rejected harassment claim on the basis that she had made no complaint to the office of equal opportunity and diversity and thus there had been no formal investigation of her harassment complaint.his quite remarkable explanation of the flaw in case was that,in the absence of a formal investigation,i can only base my decision on the evidence presented at the hearing.since all that was submitted at the hearing was the grievant verbal account of events,i can not say that the grievant has presented a prima facie case that she was subjected to sexual harassment it is difficult to imagine a more palpable and fundamental failure to understand the term prima facie case.
did not appeal to step of the grievance process.instead,on january,she filed her complaint in superior court alleging causes of action for sexual harassment and wrongful termination.on september,the regents filed their motion for summary judgment,arguing the complaint was barred because of failure to exhaust her administrative remedy and her failure to exhaust her judicial remedies 
over the opposition of,the court granted the summary judgment.relying upon schifando city of los angeles cal th,d,and page los angeles county probation th,d,the court concluded that although a public employee such as may elect to pursue an employment discrimination,harassment or retaliation claim either through an internal grievance procedure or under the provisions of the fair employment and housing act if the employee chooses to invoke an internal grievance procedure,the employee must see that procedure through to a conclusion and then exhaust any available judicial review of that procedure before seeking relief through the feha the courts.
the court went on to explain that although would have had no right to proceed beyond the step meeting based upon her harassment claim alone,the fact it was combined with other claims entitled her to proceed to step of the grievance process.he felt her failure to do so amounted to a failure to exhaust that administrative remedy.
the regents cite campbell regents of university of california cal th,d,in support of the proposition that e xhaustion of administrative remedies is a jurisdictional prerequisite to resort to the courts.however,as the regents concede,because harassment claim is governed by the feha,she was not obligated to exhaust any available administrative remedy,and could have proceeded directly with a claim to the department of fair employment and housing,and then to the courts.schifando city of los angeles,supra,cal th,d.
nonetheless,the regents successfully argued below that once had initiated the internal grievance process outlined in her union agreement,she was required either to participate in that process until its conclusion or be bound by any adverse result.they are wrong.
the regents rely upon page los angeles county probation,supra,th,d,in support of their contention could not abandon the grievance process once she had initiated it.however,in page,the plaintiff administrative remedy was governed by the los angeles county civil service rules,and she was entitled to a full adversarial hearing before a civil service commission hearing officer.she participated in that hearing,and then waited until after she had learned of the hearing officer adverse decision,before filing her feha claim.analogizing from those facts to these requires an investment of considerably more imagination than stare decisis allows.
as the page court explained,it was the fact the plaintiff had waited until after the hearing,and the issuance of the hearing officer comprehensive decision,which prevented her from simply walking away.that hearing had constituted a sufficient process to trigger res judicata and collateral estoppel effect,and consequently its result could not simply be ignored page chose the civil service commission process and proceeded through three days of hearing over the course of four months,resulting in a comprehensive decision by the hearing officer.page was not then free to ignore and abandon the administrative process and proceed to a feha action for damages.page had to await a final commission decision and,if it was adverse,then file a petition for writ of mandate in the trial court to overturn the commission decision.only if she had done so and prevailed in the writ proceedings,thus vacating the commission decision,could she have then filed a lawsuit,since the commission decision has issue and claim preclusive effect.page los angeles county probation,supra,th at,d.that is a time zone or two from our facts.
the significance of a claimant participation in a hearing before walking away from an administrative proceeding was also highlighted in schifando city of los angeles,supra,cal th,d,the case in which the supreme court concluded that a feha plaintiff such as was not obligated to exhaust an administrative remedy.the schifando court explained that its reasoning was not inconsistent with its prior opinion in johnson city of loma linda cal th,d,in which it held a feha plaintiff was required to overturn the adverse result of an administrative proceeding through a writ of mandate prior to proceeding on a claim for damages in court.johnson held that when employees have availed themselves of the administrative remedies a local statute affords,and have received an adverse finding,that finding is binding on subsequent discrimination claims under the feha unless set aside through a timely mandamus petition.thus,johnson held only that because the employee had exhausted the remedies the city offered,and had not exhausted his judicial remedies,the city agency findings were binding on his subsequent feha claims.citation.we reasoned that refusing to give binding effect to those findings would undermine the efficacy of such proceedings,rendering them in many cases little more than rehearsals for litigation.citation.schifando city of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d.in other words,both page and johnson are founded on the rationale that a plaintiff is entitled to only one opportunity to try her claim.if she takes that opportunity in the context of an administrative process,she can not merely ignore an adverse result and ask for a in court.
but,in this case,by contrast to both page and johnson,was afforded no hearing at all,let alone a one,prior to abandoning her grievance process.nothing in the description of the step meeting convened by the university local designated official suggests it was intended to afford an opportunity to prove her case.to the contrary,the meeting is described as merely an opportunity for the parties to discuss information and contentions relative to the grievance.and for all appearances,even that is an expansive description of what actually happened.
although was entitled to be accompanied by a representative,the meeting included no provisions for sworn testimony no opportunity for,for the questioning of witnesses,or for the admission or consideration of other evidence.no record of the meeting was made,and despite the fact that vannan,the man who allegedly harassed,was present at the meeting he was not required to be she was not allowed to question him.he remained a silent observer.
moreover,while a hearing officer was present at the step meeting,the record reflects she was not the person who issued the university subsequent decision.what,if any,communications she might have had with the person or persons who ultimately made that decision is unknown.the step procedures include no provisions requiring her to make any recommendations or communicate any particular details about the meeting to anyone 
and of course,the decision ultimately issued by the university following the step meeting does nothing but demonstrate how wholly inadequate this proceeding was for resolving claim of harassment.the conclusion reached was that because presented only her version of the facts,she could not prevail.in other words,the process allowed for nothing but her verbal description of events and then dismissed the dispute on the basis that a mere verbal description could not suffice to make a case.this is justice a la lewis carroll.
specifically,the decision states that s ince all that was submitted was the grievant verbal account of events,i can not say that the grievant has presented a prima facie case of course,in any true evidentiary hearing,testimony about the alleged harassment would have been viewed as establishing her case,since if believed,it demonstrates the fact of the harassment.once that evidence was admitted,it would then be incumbent upon vannan,the alleged wrongdoer,to counter it with evidence that the alleged statements were either not made,or were unreasonably construed by the.in this case,however,the fact that vannan was allowed to remain silent throughout the meeting strongly suggests the hearing was not intended as a means for evaluating the truth of contentions.it was merely a discussion.
because never participated in a hearing as part of her aborted grievance process,there was no decision rendered that would be entitled to preclusive effect in a subsequent court proceeding.page and johnson are consequently inapplicable,and we can perceive of no other reason why should be obligated to continue with a grievance process which seems to us wholly unsatisfactory,and in which she was not required to participate in the first place.
on the other hand,we can see the disadvantage of a rule that would automatically obligate an employee to complete every step of a internal grievance process,merely because he or she had started requirement we can only think of as a clean plate rule the disadvantage of that inflexible approach is its tendency to discourage an employee from ever attempting to resolve a complaint interna
