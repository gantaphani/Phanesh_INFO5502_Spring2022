background 
defendant michael schneickert hired plaintiff kelly sutherlin mcleod architecture,ksma,to renovate and restore schneickert historic residence in pasadena.the parties entered into an architectural services contract the contract,which contained an arbitration clause.the arbitration clause stated in relevant part that,a ny claim,dispute or other matter in question arising out of or related to this agreement shall be subject to arbitration,that the arbitrator award shall be final,and judgment may be entered upon it in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof,and that the arbitration would be conducted in accordance with the construction industry arbitration rules of the american arbitration association aaa rules.
after a dispute arose under the contract,the parties filed related superior court actions.ksma filed a complaint against schneickert,who was not served,for breach of contract,specific performance,quantum meruit,account stated,foreclosure of mechanic lien,defamation,and declaratory relief.schneickert filed a complaint against ksma principal,kelly sutherlin mcleod,for professional negligence,conversion,fraud,and violation of the unfair competition law bus.
ksma submitted its claims against schneickert to contractual arbitration and obtained a stay of its complaint.in light of his pending arbitration with ksma,schneickert agreed to submit his complaint to the same arbitration.pursuant to the parties stipulation,the superior court stayed both actions while the parties voluntarily pursued contractual arbitration of their respective claims.
as previously mentioned,the main issue on appeal is whether the arbitrator exceeded his powers by requiring a published retraction of schneickert defamatory statements the retraction order.our discussion is focused with this issue in mind.
during arbitration,ksma presented evidence that schneickert made false and defamatory statements to persons in the historic restoration community regarding ksma performance of the contract.consistent with the prayer in its complaint,ksma submitted to the arbitrator a request for a full retraction of schneickert defamatory statements against ksma and its principal to the effect that neither ksma nor its principal engaged in any misconduct,nor were negligent in performing any duties.this retraction shall be sent to the same people to whom schneickert sent his malicious lies.
in the march,interim award,the arbitrator found schneickert comments to be defamatory and granted ksma request for a retraction of the defamatory remarks.the arbitrator stated that schneickert comments were unprivileged,defamatory and clearly beyond rhetorical hyperbole.claimant is entitled to such sum as both per se and punitive damages and a retraction as shall be determined by the arbitrator after a further telephonic hearing 
after the interim award was issued,the parties filed postarbitration briefs on the proposed retraction order.although schneickert postarbitration brief is not contained in our record,we infer from ksma postarbitration brief that schneickert brief contained an objection based on a claim that the arbitrator lacked authority to compel a retraction of the defamatory statements.in response to that objection,ksma cited advanced micro devices,intel cal th,d,advanced micro devices and the aaa rules.ksma argued that arbitrators are empowered to grant equitable relief,including mandatory injunctions,and that a rbitrators have even greater authority to issue equitable relief than the courts.ksma also pointed out that schneickert had agreed to be bound by the aaa rules,which places no limits on the arbitrator authority to grant the appropriate equitable relief.ksma stated that unless a retraction is ordered to undo some of the damage caused by schneickert defamatory remarks,ksma damages should be increased accordingly.
after considering the parties postarbitration briefs on the proposed retraction order,the arbitrator issued a march,supplemental interim award in which he cited advanced micro devices and rule r of the aaa rules in support of his authority to select such remedies as are consistent with the evidence presented which are just and equitable.the arbitrator stated that a compelled retraction was an appropriate equitable remedy because the defamatory statements were causing continuing harm to ksma reputation that was difficult to measure.
in the july,final award,the arbitrator awarded ksma monetary damages as damages per se and as punitive damages and ordered schneickert to issue a retraction of the defamatory remarks the retraction order,which is the main issue on appeal,required schneickert to distribute the following letter of retraction

michael schneickert 
the parties filed competing petitions in superior court to vacate and confirm the final award.the superior court concluded that the arbitrator had exceeded his powers by requiring a retraction of the defamatory remarks in violation of the free speech provision of the first amendment.the superior court stated in relevant part that the first amendment protects against compelled speech.although some federal courts have permitted compelled retractions,no california court has done so.this court declines to enforce the compelled speech of the letter of retraction as it is in violation of the rights to freedom of speech.
after correcting the award by vacating the retraction order,the superior court entered a judgment confirming the award as corrected.code civ,subd.b superior court may correct and confirm the award as corrected if the arbitrator exceeded his or her powers and the award may be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision.both parties appealed from the judgment confirming the corrected award.they each contend that the superior court erred in failing to grant their respective petition in full.
schneickert argues that the superior court should have vacated the entire award because the retraction order violates public policy the free speech provisions of the state and federal constitutions and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the arbitrator decision,subd.a superior court shall vacate the award if the arbitrator exceeded his or her powers and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision and he was substantially prejudiced by the arbitrator denial of his motion to compel production of evidence of economic loss resulting from the defamatory statements,subd.a superior court shall vacate the award if the rights of the party were substantially prejudiced by the arbitrator refusal to hear evidence material to the controversy.
ksma argues that the superior court should have confirmed the entire award because false and defamatory statements are not protected speech and,therefore,their compelled retraction does not violate an explicit,and dominant public policy and there are no valid grounds for vacating the retraction order.
before oral argument,we issued a letter requesting that the parties address whether any part of the letter of retraction included in the arbitrator award is valid.we have considered the parties responses in the discussion below.
discussion 
i.the arbitrator was authorized to grant the requested relief of a retraction of the defamatory statements 
under section,the superior court has only four options when a petition to confirm or vacate an arbitration award is filed.the superior court may confirm the award as made correct the award and confirm it as corrected vacate the award or dismiss the proceeding.
in moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,moncharsh,the california supreme court rejected a line of earlier cases that had held or suggested that notwithstanding these statutory criteria for vacating an arbitration award,an award may also be vacated when an error of law appears on the face of the arbitrator decision and causes substantial injustice.moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.instead,after an extensive review of the historical development of arbitration and judicial review of arbitration awards,the court made clear that in the absence of some limiting clause in the arbitration agreement,the merits of the award,either on questions of fact or of law,may not be reviewed except as provided in the statute.id.at,d.fn.omitted.pearson dental supplies,superior court cal th,d,pearson.
the court in moncharsh also rejected the argument that code of civil procedure section,subdivision d now subd.a,which authorizes an arbitration award to be vacated if the arbitrators exceeded their powers,was a basis for reviewing errors of law in an arbitration award.it is well settled that arbitrators do not exceed their powers merely because they assign an erroneous reason for their decision.citations.a contrary holding would permit the exception to swallow the rule of limited judicial review a litigant could always contend the arbitrator erred and thus exceeded his powers moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.pearson,supra,cal th at,d.
in determining whether an arbitrator exceeded his powers,we review the trial court decision de novo,but we must give substantial deference to the arbitrator own assessment of his contractual authority.advanced micro devices,supra,cal th at,d,fn.jordan department of motor vehicles th,d jordan.
a.the arbitrator powers derive from the parties arbitration agreement and submission of issues 
an arbitrator powers derive from,and are limited by,the agreement to arbitrate.moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.although code of civil procedure section permits the court to vacate an award that exceeds the arbitrator powers,the deference due an arbitrator decision on the merits of the controversy requires a court to refrain from substituting its judgment for the arbitrator in determining the contractual scope of those powers.citations.advanced micro devices,supra,cal th at,d.jordan,supra,th at,d.
the arbitrator powers may be expanded or restricted by the scope of the issues submitted to arbitration.greenspan ladt,llc th,d greenspan.the parties may submit for decision issues they were not contractually compelled to submit to arbitration.in such event,courts look both to the contract and to the scope of the submissions to determine the arbitrator authority.knight et,cal.practice guide alternative dispute resolution the rutter group,to accord,gury nippon carbide industries usa th,d.arbitration submissions are usually construed as broadly as possible in order that differences between the parties may be resolved quickly and economically.under the principle of broad construction an arbitrator is authorized to determine all questions which he needs to determine in order to resolve the controversy submitted to him,and the arbitrator himself decides which questions need to be determined.if participants in the arbitral process begin to assert all possible legal or procedural defenses in court proceedings before the arbitration itself can go forward,the arbitral wheels would very soon grind to a halt.kennedy,cabot national of securities dealers,th,d,citations omitted,italics added.greenspan,supra,th at,d.
b.the arbitrator was empowered to grant any just and equitable remedy that is within the scope of the contract 
in this case,the parties agreed to apply the aaa rules.under aaa rule r a,the arbitrator may grant any remedy or relief that the arbitrator deems just and equitable and within the scope of the agreement of the parties,including,but not limited to,equitable relief and specific performance of the contract.this rule,when read in conjunction with ksma submission of a request for a published retraction of defamatory statements,compels the conclusion that the arbitrator was empowered to grant any remedy or relief that is just and equitable and within the scope of the contract,including a published retraction of defamatory statements.
although a california court arguably may not have the power to compel a party to retract defamatory statements,the parties may allow an arbitrator to do so.as the california supreme court explained in advanced micro devices a rbitrators are not generally limited to making their award on principles of dry law.moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.for that reason,parties who submit their disputes to arbitration may expect not only to reap the advantages that flow from the use of that nontechnical,summary procedure,but also to find themselves bound by an award reached by paths neither marked nor traceable and not subject to judicial review.citations.ibid.as new york highest court expressed the same idea,i n the final analysis arbitrators may do justice and the award may well reflect the spirit rather than the letter of the agreement citation in other words a court may not vacate an award because the arbitrator has exceeded the power the court would have,or would have had if the parties had chosen to litigate,rather than arbitrate the dispute.those who have chosen arbitration as their forum should recognize that arbitration procedures and awards often differ from what may be expected in courts of law.rochester city school dist.rochester teachers,italics added.this principle applies fully to arbitral awards of nonmonetary relief.arbitrators have broad discretion in fashioning a remedy for the injustice which is found to have occurred.baltimore county mayor city council of baltimore.because the parties to an arbitration have the freedom to determine the rules by which their dispute will be resolved,including the scope of available relief,courts will uphold awards of specific performance by arbitrators in instances in which the equitable remedy would not have been available if the dispute had originally been litigated in court.domke on commercial arbitration ed.as one federal court succinctly stated,a n arbitration panel may grant equitable relief that a court could not.sperry international trade,government of israel,affd.cir.advanced micro devices,supra,cal th at,d.
