singerlewak llp appeals from a trial court order denying its petition to confirm an arbitration award.the arbitrator determined a agreement andrew gantman signed as a partner in singerlewak was enforceable.the trial court concluded judicial review of the arbitration award was required and vacated the award.after a de novo review,the trial court found the agreement was unenforceable under california law.we conclude the general rule prohibiting review of an arbitration award applied in this case.we therefore reverse the trial court order.
factual and procedural background 
the relevant underlying facts are largely undisputed.singerlewak is an accounting firm.in,gantman became a partner in the firm he had previously worked for the firm as an employee.in,gantman withdrew or was terminated from the partnership.upon admission to the partnership,gantman had agreed to be bound by the partnership agreement which contained the following provision paragraph 
in the event that a withdrawing,retired,terminated,or removed partner breaches any of the covenants contained herein or is terminated by reason of default or provides services at any time during a period of four years from withdrawal as an individual or as an employee,agent,consultant,officer,director,member or shareholder of any entity and provides the same or similar type as that of the partnership to any then current clients of the partnership,then in addition to any other remedies the partnership may have at law or in equity,the partnership may,at its option,reduce the liquidation payments payable to said partner pursuant to paragraph,above,by an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent of the greater of the gross fees billed in the twelve months preceding the termination date to any client of the partnership that the partner services within four years after the termination date,or the gross fees billed to any such client in that client last twelve months as a client of the partnership.in the case of any client who was a client of the partnership for less than a twelve month period,the gross fees billed to that client shall be annualized at the same rate in order to estimate the amount of fees which the partnership might have received for a full twelve month period.should the reduction in the liquidation payment,pursuant to the above,exceed the amount paid to the withdrawing,retired,terminated or removed partner,said partner shall pay the excess to the partnership within sixty days after the amount of excess has been determined.
after his departure from the firm,gantman provided services to several singerlewak clients.singerlewak demanded that gantman pay the firm over,pursuant to paragraph.gantman did not make the payment.
the parties submitted the dispute to arbitration,as required under the partnership agreement.gantman argued paragraph was not enforceable under california law.he asserted business and professions code section providing an exception to the general prohibition against restraints on competition for certain agreements made by partners did not apply because he was not a partner within the meaning of the provision he further argued paragraph was invalid under section because it contained no geographic limitation.
the arbitrator concluded gantman was a partner within the meaning of section.the arbitrator also determined paragraph was enforceable.he agreed with singerlewak argument that the provision was not a covenant not to compete,but was instead a provision allowing competition but imposing a cost on departing partners who service clients of the firm.the arbitrator reasoned section was not directed at such provisions.the arbitrator further found paragraph was not void for lack of an express geographical limitation because it contained an implicit geographical limitation.the decision noted the termination fee was imposed only when a departing partner serviced clients of the firm.the arbitrator then reasoned those clients do business only in certain areas,and the firm and its former partners would necessarily service their clients from locations accessible to the clients locations.a departing singerlewak partner who services clients of the firm is necessarily constrained to a geographical area in which the clients operate and in which the firm has goodwill.thus,the provision does not conflict with the policies underlying section.
singerlewak filed a petition to confirm the arbitration award in the superior court.gantman opposed the petition and filed a competing petition to vacate the award.gantman argued the arbitration award was illegal and violated public policy because it enforced an illegal restraint on competition.gantman asserted paragraph was void because it lacked any geographical limitation.the trial court concluded de novo review of the evidence was required after review,the court determined paragraph was invalid and unenforceable because it did not contain any geographic restrictions as required by section.the court further concluded reformation of the agreement was not proper.the court therefore vacated the arbitration award.singerlewak timely appealed.
discussion 
judicial review of the arbitration award was not appropriatea.judicial review and the statutory policy exception to the general rule 
in general,judicial review of an arbitration award is extremely limited.as the california supreme court explained in moncharsh heily blase cal th,moncharsh,an arbitrator decision is not generally reviewable for errors of fact or law,whether or not such error appears on the face of the award and causes substantial injustice to the parties.this is because parties who enter into arbitration agreements are presumed to know the arbitrator decision will be final and binding arbitral finality is a core component of the parties agreement to submit to arbitration.id.at.courts do not review the validity of an arbitrator reasoning,and,while code of civil procedure sections and set forth grounds for vacating or correcting an arbitration award,a n error of law is not one of those grounds.citation.moncharsh,at.code of civil procedure section,subdivision d allows a court to vacate an arbitration award when the arbitrator has exceeded his or her powers and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted.but,i t is well settled that arbitrators do not exceed their powers merely because they assign an erroneous reason for their decision.citation.moncharsh,at baize eastridge companies,llc th,alleged improper application of california law not a basis for judicial review marsch williams th,arbitrators did not exceed their powers in failing to apply corporations code provision,even if it was error.the moncharsh court further explained the contention that the parties contract or transaction was illegal provides a ground for judicial review of the arbitration award only where the party claims the entire contract or transaction is illegal,not just one provision of the contract.moncharsh,at.
yet,the moncharsh court noted there may be some limited and exceptional circumstances justifying judicial review of an arbitrator decision when a party claims illegality affects only a portion of the underlying contract.such cases would include those in which granting finality to an arbitrator decision would be inconsistent with the protection of a party statutory rights without an explicit legislative expression of public policy,however,courts should be reluctant to invalidate an arbitrator award on this ground.the reason is clear the legislature has already expressed its strong support for private arbitration and the finality of arbitral awards in title of the code of civil procedure.et absent a clear expression of illegality or public policy undermining this strong presumption in favor of private arbitration,an arbitral award should ordinarily stand immune from judicial scrutiny.moncharsh,at.the court summarized its conclusion t he normal rule of limited judicial review may not be avoided by a claim that a provision of the contract,construed or applied by the arbitrator,is illegal,except in rare cases when according finality to the arbitrator decision would be incompatible with the protection of a statutory right.id.at.
our high court has subsequently applied this exception to review challenged arbitration awards.in board of education round valley teachers cal th round valley,the underlying dispute concerned whether a school board could agree through collective bargaining to give probationary employees greater procedural protections than those set forth in the education code.id.at.when a probationary teacher challenged his notice of,arguing it did not comply with provisions in the collective bargaining agreement between the teachers association and the school district,the school district asserted the grievance was not arbitrable.the superior court,however,granted a motion to compel arbitration.the arbitrator found the school district had violated the collective bargaining agreement and ordered it to comply with the agreement provisions.the school district challenged the validity of the relevant collective bargaining agreement provisions,but the arbitrator left that issue to judicial determination.id.at.the district then filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award.it argued the arbitrator exceeded his powers because provisions of the education code preempted any contradictory provisions in the collective bargaining agreement regarding procedures for reelection of probationary teachers.ibid.further,according to the district,pursuant to provisions of the government code,the reelection issue could not be the subject of collective bargaining.the district thus asserted the entire subject of reelection of probationary teachers was never properly subject to the arbitration provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.id.at.
in its review,the court explained the threshold issue was whether it had authority to review the arbitrator award,and this question was independent of the issue of whether the award should be upheld.round valley,at.judicial review was justified because if the school district was correct concerning the scope of its statutory rights under the education and government codes,the case presented the exceptional circumstance allowing for judicial review of the arbitrator decision.the court reasoned should district interpretation of the law prevail,we would be faced with an explicit legislative expression of public policy that issues involving the reelection of probationary teachers not be subject to arbitration.citation.this expression of public policy would thus conflict with the expressed legislative intent to limit private arbitration awards to statutory grounds for judicial review.thus,rigidly insisting on arbitral finality here would be inconsistent with the protection of a party,district statutory rights.citations.id.at.
our high court applied the exception again in aguilar lerner cal th aguilar,to review an arbitration award in an attorney fee dispute.after losing in arbitration,the plaintiff client moved to vacate the arbitration award,contending the parties arbitration agreement was unenforceable because it was contrary to the mandatory fee arbitration act,set forth in section,et.the plaintiff contended the arbitrator exceeded his powers in resolving the parties dispute because the agreement to arbitrate contravened both plaintiff statutory rights as set forth in the mandatory fee arbitration act and the public policy underlying the statute.aguilar,at.the court agreed judicial review was appropriate because enforcement of an arbitration agreement that violates a plaintiff rights under the mandatory fee arbitration act would exceed the arbitrator powers.id.at.
round valley and aguilar both involved a party statutory rights that directly affected the propriety of the arbitration itself.recent california supreme court cases have approached judicial review of an arbitration award in the context of mandatory arbitration of statutory employment claims.for example,in pearson dental supplies,superior court cal th pearson,our high court vacated an arbitration award based on a legal error,explaining c onstruing the california arbitration act in light of the legislature intent that employees be able to enforce their right to be free of unlawful discrimination under feha,an arbitrator whose legal error has barred an employee subject to a mandatory arbitration agreement from obtaining a hearing on the merits of a claim based on such right has exceeded his or her powers within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,and the arbitrator award may properly be vacated.id.at.yet,in richey autonation,cal th richey,the court characterized the pearson decision as creating only a narrow rule,and the case emphasized that its legal error standard did not mean that all legal errors are reviewable.richey,at.
several courts of appeal have applied the statutory rights or public policy exception to review an arbitration award,even when the statutory right or public policy at issue was unrelated to the legitimacy of the arbitration itself.in city of palo alto service employees internat.union th,city of palo alto,the court reviewed and vacated an arbitration award that ordered the reinstatement of an employee who was terminated after he made threats of violence against another employee.the employer,the city of palo alto,had also secured an injunction prohibiting the terminated employee from being near city work sites.the employee challenged his termination in arbitration.the arbitrator concluded the termination violated the employee procedural rights and was unsupportable on the merits.he ordered the employee reinstated.id.at.
the city challenged the arbitration award,arguing in part the award violated the public policy requiring employers to provide a safe workplace.city of palo alto,at.although the court agreed there was such an express public policy,it found the arbitration award requiring reinstatement of an employee who had made violent threats did not necessarily violate that policy.the court reasoned the city had not established the public policy obligated the city to automatically fire any employee who makes a threat of violence,regardless of the circumstances.further,the arbitrator had implicitly concluded the employee did not intend to carry out his threat.the court concluded reinstatement of an employee who had no intention of carrying out his or her threat of violence was not necessarily precluded because there is no absolute public policy against employment of persons who make threats of violence,which operates regardless whether there is an actual risk of violence.id.at.however,the court vacated the arbitration award because it was irreconcilable with the public policy requiring obedience to court orders the employee could not return to work without violating the injunction.id.at.
in jordan department of motor vehicles th jordan,the court reviewed and vacated an arbitration award the court determined was an unconstitutional gift of public funds.in that case,the legislature had,by legislative enactment,authorized a certain maximum amount of attorney fees for a separate litigation.the arbitrator award exceeded the amount authorized by the legislature.likewise,in department of personnel administration california correctional peace officers th,the court reviewed and vacated an arbitration award reforming a memorandum of understanding between a state agency and public employee union.the legislature had already approved the terms of the memorandum prior to the arbitration.the arbitrator award changing those terms violated the public policy of legislative oversight of state employee contracts.id.at.
more recently,in ahdout hekmatjah th ahdout,the court concluded judicial review of an arbitration award was required because,if the losing party was correct,the award would contravene the explicit legislative expression of public policy embodied in section regarding unlicensed contractors.in the underlying arbitration,the appellant sought,among other things,disgorgement of construction costs,pursuant to section,which mandates disgorgement of compensation received by an unlicensed contractor.the arbitrators rejected the claim,concluding the respondents were not required to disgorge the construction costs and,essentially,that section did not apply.id.at.the trial court rejected the losing party petition to vacate the award,reasoning it did not have the power to review the arbitrators decision for errors of fact or law.id.at.
the court of appeal disagreed,reasoning that because section constitutes an explicit legislative expression of public policy regarding unlicensed contractors,the general prohibition of judicial review of arbitration awards does not apply w here a public policy is articulated explicitly by the legislature,as with section,courts are vested with the final word on whether the provision applies.ahdout,at.while in moncharsh,the court concluded nothing in the rules of professional conduct suggested resolution by an arbitrator of what was essentially an ordinary fee dispute would be inappropriate or would improperly protect the public interest,the ahdout court indicated the contractor licensing laws are intended to protect the general public from shoddy construction work,and thus judicial review of arbitration awards that allegedly fail to enforce the law is appropriate.ahdout,at moncharsh,at.the court reversed the judgment and remanded to the trial court with directions to conduct a de novo review of the evidence to determine whether section was applicable.id.at.
however,courts have refused to apply the exception when no explicit legislative expression of public policy is involved,or where the sole issue is merely an alleged error in the interpretation or application of the law governing the claim properly subject to arbitration.thus,in jones humanscale th jones,the plaintiff employment agreement with the defendant contained noncompetition and arbitration clauses.the agreement expressly declared that its provisions were to be construed in accordance with new jersey law.id.at.the arbitrator rejected the plaintiff argument that under new jersey choice of law analysis,the noncompetition agreement should be interpreted under california law.id.at.the arbitrator concluded the noncompetition agreement could be enforced against the plaintiff,and awarded the defendant damages for the plaintiff previous violation of the agreement.id.at.the plaintiff opposed the defendant petition to confirm the award.he contended the award was based on an illegal contract that violated california policy against covenants not to compete.ibid.
the trial court reviewed and vacated the arbitration award.it concluded the arbitrator erred in failing to apply california law and the covenant not to compete was illegal on its face under section.jones,at.the court of appeal disagreed.the court acknowledged moncharsh allows for judicial review of an arbitration award when granting finality to the arbitrator decision would be inconsistent with the protection of a party statutory right.but the jones court concluded the issue before it was different because the parties agreement authorized the arbitrator to determine the applicable law and the enforceability of the covenant not to compete.jones,at.the court further concluded the arbitrator findings were not palpably erroneous because some limits on a former employee right to pursue his or her occupation are permissible under california law.id.at.moreover,the alleged illegality of the covenant not to compete did not render the dispute.since the alleged illegality affected only a portion of the contract that did not include the arbitration agreement,the arbitrator had the authority to determine whether the covenant not to compete was enforceable.id.at.
likewise,in city of richmond service employees internat.union local th,the court rejected the public policy exception as a basis to review an arbitration award.the underlying case involved an employee who was terminated after being accused of sexual harassment and dishonesty.the employee challenged the termination in arbitration.the arbitrator concluded the sexual harassment claims were and the evidence did not support the dishonesty charges.the arbitrator accordingly found no cause for termination and ordered the employee reinstated.id.at.on appeal,the court concluded the arbitration award did not violate public policy.although there is a strong public policy against sexual harassment in the workplace,the court concluded that policy did not preclude an arbitrator from ordering an accused harasser reinstated where the accusations were.id.at.
judicial review is not appropriate in this case 
as the california supreme court summarized in richey arbitrators may exceed their powers by issuing an award that violates a party unwaivable statutory rights or that contravenes an explicit legislative expression of public policy.richey,at.round valley and aguilar indicate that evaluating a challenge to an arbitration award is a process first the court must determine whether the award is reviewable,and only if review is appropriate does the court consider whether the award should be upheld.round valley,at aguilar,at.the threshold question here,then,is whether according the arbitration award finality would be inconsistent with protecting gantman statutory rights.we must consider whether,if gantman is correct concerning his rights under section and,the award would contravene an explicit legislative expression of public policy that undermines the strong presumption in favor of private arbitration.we conclude it would not,and judicial review is therefore not appropriate.
section states except as provided in this chapter,every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession,trade,or business of any kind is to that extent void.it is well established that section evinces a settled legislative policy in favor of open competition and employee mobility.citation.the law protects californians and ensures that every citizen shall retain the right to pursue any lawful employment and enterprise of their choice.citation.it protects the important legal right of persons to engage in businesses and occupations of their choosing.citation.edwards arthur andersen llp cal th,edwards.at least one court has indicated this is an unwaivable right.weber,lipshie christian th.
yet,the policy embodied in section has exceptions,and this case concerned one of those exceptions.under section,any partner may,upon or in anticipation of a dissolution of the partnership or dissociation of the partner from the partnership,agree that he or she will not carry on a similar business within a specified geographic area where the partnership business has been transacted,so long as any other member of the partnership,or any person deriving title to the business or its goodwill from any such other member of the partnership,carries on a like business therein,subds.a b.
thus,when it comes to partners and a partnership,the public policy in favor of open competition is not absolute.as the california supreme court explained in edwards,s ection embodies the original,strict common law antipathy toward restraints of trade,while the section and exceptions incorporated the later common law rule of reasonableness in instances where those exceptions apply.edwards,at.in howard babcock cal th,our high court explained not every agreement between partners in restraint of competition is permitted.we have held that the common law rule of reason should apply to evaluate the noncompetition agreement under business and professions code section.id.at.because section incorporates the common law rule of reasonableness,courts have at times enforced partnership covenants not to compete to the extent that such agreements are lawful under section,even if the agreements were facially invalid when taken as a whole.swenson file cal d,swenson roberts pfefer d,trial court directed to make findings as to the reasonableness of a covenant restriction barring doctor from practicing within a portion of the county statute at the time allowed restriction only as to city or town.
in swenson,for example,our high court explained the applicable version of section substantially restrict ed the scope and effect of the covenant not to compete at issue in the case.the covenant contained two provisions,a blank
