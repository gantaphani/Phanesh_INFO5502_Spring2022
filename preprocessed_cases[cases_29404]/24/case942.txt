disputed termination of royalty agreement and subsequent action to compel arbitration 
in december,mayne informed that the royalty agreement was terminated because mayne had purchased napro and believed this acquisition relieved mayne of any obligations to continue making payments.replied that the purchase did not relieve mayne of its obligation to pay,and that if the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the matter within thirty days,would seek to compel arbitration under paragraph six of the royalty agreement.mayne did not reply,and filed suit in the district court to compel arbitration.pursuant to a stipulated order,the district court ordered the dispute referred to the icc for arbitration and dismissed the case without prejudice.
proceedings before the icc 
filed a request for arbitration with the icc in july.upon submission of the request,the icc required to pay a deposit.the icc then required a provisional advance from of with credit for the previously paid.after some delay,principals personally loaned the company the money to pay the balance due.the icc confirmed the parties choices of one arbitrator each,appointed a third arbitrator to act as chairman of the tribunal,and set the advance costs at to be split by and mayne,with credit to for the amount it had previously paid.
objected to the amount as confiscatory and punitive,and as wholly unforeseeable to the parties.mayne also objected to the amount,saying it appears excessive and is unduly burdensome to both parties.neither party submitted further payment to the icc.under the icc rules,for the arbitration to proceed,as the claimant,was required to pay the entire amount due,or some form of security in lieu of cash,if mayne did not pay.after a number of extensions of payment deadlines,the icc deemed the arbitration withdrawn.the icc fixed the costs already incurred in the arbitration at,deducted that amount from payments of,and refunded to.

in a subsequent,motion for declaratory judgment,requested a speedy declaratory judgment hearing pursuant to rule,and argued that the arbitration clause was substantively unconscionable because of the alleged unreasonable financial burden it placed on as a precondition to arbitration.to support its position,offered sworn testimony that it would be unable to pay the arbitration fee and proceed with its claims if the district court enforced the arbitration clause.mayne responded by asserting that motion was actually a motion for summary judgment because the motion sought to skip a hearing and obtain a merits ruling on the issue of unconscionability.mayne also asked the district court to stay the action pending arbitration in accordance with the royalty agreement.

discussion 
argues that the district court erred in determining that the arbitration clause in the royalty agreement is not substantively unconscionable under the faa and washington law.also asserts that the district court ruling denied right to a jury trial,disregarded request for an evidentiary hearing,and ignored sworn testimony about alleged financial hardship.
substantive unconscionability 
first argues that the costs required by the icc render the arbitration clause in the royalty agreement substantively unconscionable.the faa provides that an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of a contract shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.accordingly,while the supreme court has emphasized that the faa clearly enunciates a congressional intention to favor arbitration,moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d,general contract defenses such as unconscionability,grounded in state contract law,may operate to invalidate arbitration agreements,circuit city stores,adams,cir.
