in this appeal,we consider whether a party opposing a petition to compel arbitration may defeat the petition by demonstrating that the relief sought by the petitioner in arbitration is precluded by statute.plaintiff california correctional peace officers association the union represents both correctional officers and their supervisors.supervisors and officers negotiate separately with the state representative,the california department of personnel administration the department,over their respective terms and conditions of employment.nonetheless,pursuant to ground rules negotiated between the union and the department,for several years supervisory employees had been permitted to sit in as observers during labor negotiations between the department and employees,and vice versa.after two occasions on which observers disrupted negotiations between the department and supervisory employees,the department refused to continue with the practice.the union sought to arbitrate its right to have observers present.when the department refused to arbitrate,the union filed a petition to compel arbitration.
the department opposed the union petition to compel largely on the basis of government code section,which states that supervisory employees shall not participate in meet and confer sessions on behalf of employees,and vice versa.the department argued that section precluded the presence of observers as a matter of law,superseding anything to the contrary in the negotiated ground rules.the department further contended that it should not be required to arbitrate this issue of statutory interpretation on the ground that only courts,not arbitrators,are permitted to interpret statutes.the trial court accepted the department argument and denied the union petition.finding no authority for the department contention that arbitrators are not permitted to interpret statutes,we reverse and remand for arbitration.
background 
the union is the exclusive representative for approximately correctional officers employed by the state.the union also represents the correctional officers who are employed as supervisors of these officers the department,an agency of the state,is the designated representative of the state in dealing with these employees.the department duties include meeting and bargaining with the correctional officers and the union.
although supervisors and officers engage in separate negotiations with the department,the union alleges that since representatives of the supervisors have been allowed to observe bargaining sessions between the department and officers.as one supervisor,who served as the lead negotiator for supervisory officers during bargaining in june,described the process,negotiations with respect to supervisory issues effectively shadowed negotiations.your declarant and others on our supervisory team would sit in the same room while negotiations were ongoing,and then take our place at the bargaining table to discuss supervisory issues.
beginning in march,the department took the position that it would no longer permit supervisory officers to observe negotiations with officers,and vice versa.in march and april,representatives of the department twice abandoned negotiations with representatives because supervisory personnel,present as observers,refused to leave the room in which the negotiations were to be conducted.the first aborted negotiation involved the state plan to convert two youth conservation camps,under the authority of the california youth authority now known as the california division of juvenile justice,into california department of corrections camps.the second negotiation involved the state plans for implementing the terms of a consent decree at two youth detention facilities.in a declaration filed with the trial court,a department negotiator explained that the change in position came about after two occasions on which employees who were allowed to observe supervisor negotiations failed to restrict their activities to observation.as the negotiator stated with respect to one of the observers,he repeatedly disrupt ed the negotiation process and interject ed himself into the parties discussions.
two agreements between the parties are relevant to this issue.first,the department and the union operate under written ground rules that govern the conduct of their negotiations.under the ground rules in effect from through,observers were allowed to attend bargaining sessions by mutual agreement only.in april,however,the parties negotiated a new set of ground rules,one of which states that w ith prior notice,observers may attend negotiation sessions.on each of the two occasions in,when department negotiators had refused to proceed in the presence of supervisory observers,the union had given prior notice of the observers presence,consistent with the ground rules.
also relevant is the primary agreement governing relations between the state and correctional officers,a memorandum of understanding mou entered into on july,by the union and the state.of particular importance is section,entitled entire agreement.the first portion of section is a standard integration clause,stating that the mou constitutes the full and entire understanding of the parties regarding the matters contained herein and supersedes any prior agreements.pursuant to this portion of section,each party voluntarily waives its rights to negotiate with respect to any matter raised in negotiations or covered in this agreement.the second portion of the clause recognizes that,following execution of the mou,the state may elect to make changes in the working conditions of correctional officers with respect to matters not expressly covered in the mou.in that event,subdivision b of section requires the parties to negotiate with respect to the impact of those changes if the changes would affect the working conditions of a significant number of employees,the subject matter of the changes is within the scope of the union representation,and the union requests negotiation.if the parties reach agreement in the course of such negotiations,section requires the agreement to be put in writing and provides that the writing shall become an addendum to the mou.the mou also contains a complex grievance resolution procedure that allows binding arbitration of grievances which involve the interpretation,application or enforcement of the provisions of this mou.
contending that the department refusal to conduct negotiations in the presence of observers violated the parties agreements,the union served grievances with respect to both of the abandoned negotiations,including demands to arbitrate the disputes under the mou.the department refused to proceed with arbitration,arguing that the dispute was not arbitral and permitting supervisors to observe negotiations,and vice versa,would violate california law.
the union responded by filing this petition to compel arbitration.the department opposition to the petition was premised on government code section,subdivision c,which states excluded employees,supervisors shall not participate in meet and confer sessions on behalf of nonexcluded employees.nonexcluded employees shall not participate in meet and confer sessions on behalf of supervisory employees.this statute,the department argued,prohibits supervisory employees from observing bargaining sessions of employees,superseding any inconsistent language in the mou or the ground rules.from this premise,the department argued that the petition to compel arbitration should be denied because courts have exclusive power to interpret and apply state statutes.alternatively,the department contended that the mou did not require arbitration of this particular dispute.
the trial court denied the petition to compel arbitration,holding that government code section,subdivision c governed the parties dispute the statute must be interpreted by the courts and not an arbitrator and the parties could not and did not negotiate any terms in the current mou that serves sic to supercede the provisions of section,subdivision c.
ii.discussion 
when,as here,no conflicting extrinsic evidence is introduced to aid the interpretation of an agreement to arbitrate,the court of appeal reviews de novo a trial court ruling on a petition to compel arbitration.hartnell community college dist.superior court th,d.
petitions to compel arbitration are governed by code of civil procedure section,which states in relevant part that the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists,unless it determines that a t he right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner or b g rounds exist for the revocation of the agreement.accordingly,in ruling on a petition to compel,the court must determine whether the parties entered into an enforceable agreement to arbitrate that reaches the dispute in question,construing the agreement to the limited extent necessary to make this determination.fittante palm springs motors,th,d.if such an agreement exists,the court must order the parties to arbitration unless arbitration has been waived or grounds exist to revoke the agreement.valsan partners limited partnership calcor space facility,th,d.section expressly forbids the court from reaching the merits of the parties dispute,instructing that i f the court determines that a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy exists,an order to arbitrate such controversy may not be refused on the ground that the petitioner contentions lack substantive merit.
doubts are resolved in favor of arbitration.in determining whether a matter is subject to arbitration,courts apply the presumption in favor of arbitration citation doubts as to whether an arbitration clause applies to a particular dispute are to be resolved in favor of sending the parties to arbitration.the court should order them to arbitrate unless it is clear that the arbitration clause can not be interpreted to cover the dispute.citation.amalgamated transit union local los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority th,d.
a.the parties agreement to arbitrate 
the arbitration clause of the mou states that grievances which involve the interpretation,application or enforcement of the provisions of this mou may be appealed to binding arbitration.we agree with the union that the arbitration clause reaches the parties dispute because the union grievances seek enforcement of the provisions of the mou.
as noted above,section b of the mou requires the state to negotiate with respect to changes in the working conditions of correctional officers if the changes would affect the working conditions of a significant number of employees,the subject matter of the changes is within the scope of the union representation,and the union requests negotiation.the department does not argue that the two negotiations it abandoned failed to satisfy these criteria.indeed,by raising no objection to the occurrence of the negotiations other than the presence of observers,the department implicitly acknowledged that the proposed changes were proper subjects of negotiation under section b.the union grievances over the department refusal to proceed with negotiations on these two subjects therefore constituted an attempt to enforce the state obligations under the mou,bringing the grievance squarely within the arbitration clause 
in resisting arbitration,the department argues that n owhere in the mou do the parties discuss supervisors attending sessions for employees.therefore,this issue is not subject to the contractual grievance process as set forth in the mou.this argument is premised on an impermissibly narrow interpretation of the mou arbitration clause,particularly in light of our obligation to construe the clause broadly in favor of arbitration,amalgamated transit union local los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority,supra,th at,d arbitration is required unless it is clear that the arbitration clause can not be interpreted to cover the dispute.there is nothing in the arbitration clause that requires a topic to be expressly mentioned in the mou in order to qualify for arbitration.rather,the arbitration clause broadly permits arbitration of grievances which involve the interpretation,application or enforcement of the mou.for the reasons discussed above,the union grievances sought to enforce the state obligation to negotiate under section of the mou.the department is,of course,free to raise with the arbitrator the issue of the union insistence on observers to explain its refusal to comply with the obligation to negotiate 
the department only other argument regarding the scope of the arbitration clause is the claim that the ground rules were not intended as an exception to the prohibitions in government code section,subdivision c.in this context,the argument is nothing more than a claim that the dispute should not be submitted to arbitration because the union position lacks merit.under the express terms of code of civil procedure section,such an argument is not a proper basis for a court refusal to compel arbitration 
b.the right to judicial interpretation of statutes 
because the union and the state entered into an agreement to arbitrate that covers this dispute,the trial court was required,under code of civil procedure section,to grant the petition to compel arbitration unless the union had waived arbitration or grounds existed to revoke the mou.the department asserts neither of these defenses.instead,the department contends that it was entitled to avoid arbitration because its defense to the grievance relied on rights derived from a state statute.only the courts,the department argues,have the power to interpret and apply such statutes.
we have found no california case that directly addresses this contention.in support of its position,the department relies almost exclusively on an explication of the separation of powers doctrine in mcclung employment development cal th,d,the powers of state government are legislative,executive,and judicial.persons charged with the exercise of one power may not exercise either of the others except as permitted by the california constitution.citation.the judicial power is conferred upon the courts by the constitution and,in the absence of a constitutional provision,can not be exercised by any other body.citation.ultimately,the interpretation of a statute is an exercise of the judicial power the constitution assigns to the courts.citation.id.at,d.
the separation of powers doctrine has no bearing on the department claim.the purpose of the doctrine is to define the core powers of the three branches of government and prevent unwarranted infringement by one upon another core powers.see marine forests society california coastal com.cal th,d,in re rosenkrantz cal th,d,the separation of powers doctrine limits the authority of one of the three branches of government to arrogate to itself the core functions of another branch.we recognize that the phrase the interpretation of a statute is an exercise of the judicial power the constitution assigns to the courts might appear superficially to support the department position.the phrase must be understood,however,in the larger context of the doctrine of separation of powers.read in that context,it means only that legislative and executive officers may be restricted from exercising the judicial power of statutory interpretation.arbitrators are not agents of either the executive or legislative branch they act only upon the agreement of the parties.the separation of powers doctrine was not intended to reach arbitrators handling of state statutes and does not prohibit them from interpreting those statutes in reaching their decisions.the department cites no case even suggesting the contrary.
while no california case has expressly ruled on the exclusive right of judges to consider otherwise arbitrable cases raising issues of statutory interpretation,the department position runs counter to the assumptions that underlie many california decisions,which anticipate that arbitrators will engage in statutory interpretation.in broughton cigna healthplans cal th,d,for example,the supreme court considered whether a party could be required to arbitrate a cause of action asserted under the consumer legal remedies act,e
