the superior court issued an order compelling the county of riverside county to arbitrate unresolved compensation issues as provided by senate bill reg.sess.sb.sb,which went into effect on january,allows unions representing local public safety employees to demand binding arbitration of economic issues.in its petition for writ of mandate,the county asks this court to order the superior court to set aside its order compelling arbitration and enter a new order denying the riverside sheriff association rsa motion to compel arbitration.the county argues that sb is invalid under article xi of the california constitution because it delegates to a private body the power to interfere with county money and perform a municipal function,subd.a and impinges on the county power to provide for the compensation of county employees,subd.b.as described below,we grant the writ of mandate because sb is invalid under both constitutional provisions.

section,subdivision a 
section,subdivision a,provides that,the legislature may not delegate to a private person or body power to make,control,appropriate,supervise,or interfere with county or municipal corporation improvements,money,or property,or to levy taxes or assessments,or perform municipal functions.sb does delegate to a private arbitration power to control or interfere with county money.this is because sb empowers the panel to choose which compensation package,between the two last best offers,the county budget will have to fund.rsa argues that should the arbitration panel choose rsa last best offer,the county can then opt to reduce staffing levels to keep compensation within the amount budgeted by the riverside county board of supervisors.this is not a desired choice in the public safety arena.further,this option would in fact be a consequence of the private arbitrators interference with county money rather than a reason to declare that the interference does not exist.so,we accept the premise that sb does violate section,subdivision a unless the statewide concern exception articulated in people ex rel.younger county of el dorado cal d,applies this is an issue of first impression in california.

local employee salaries are a matter of local concern 
california law is quite clear that the determination of salaries paid to local employees is a local matter,not one of statewide concern.see,san francisco labor council regents of university of california cal d,a prevailing wage requirement is not a matter of statewide concern sonoma county organization of public employees county of sonoma cal d,the determination of the wages paid to employees of charter cities as well as charter counties is a matter of local rather than statewide concern.the question then is whether the status of the employees as public safety personnel transforms the determination of their salaries into a matter of statewide concern.because california courts have not yet answered this question,we must look at the case law concerning state intervention into labor relations generally between public safety personnel and local agencies.
state intervention in local public safety labor relations 
one of the key cases cited by rsa is baggett gates cal d,baggett.in baggett,police officers who were demoted petitioned for a writ of mandate,alleging that they had not been afforded an administrative appeal as required by the public safety officers procedural bill of rights act the act,et the city for whom the officers worked argued that the act did not apply to charter cities because it violated the home rule provisions of the california constitution.baggett contains some very convincing language about how the maintenance of stable employment relations between police officers and their employers is a matter of statewide concern.specifically,baggett talks about how the effects of labor unrest and strikes by police officers are felt beyond a city borders which is a major point made by rsa and amici curiae.this language initially appears to bolster rsa position,but as explained below,the actual holding of baggett stops well short of validating sb.
the california supreme court in baggett goes out of its way to point out that the act does not interfere with the setting of peace officers compensation.baggett,supra,cal at.rather,the supreme court emphasizes that the act create s uniform fair labor practices throughout the state and secure s basic rights and protections to public employees id.at.the supreme court stops well short of endorsing state interference with local peace officer compensation,and implies that such interference would be much more serious than that necessary to ensure basic fair labor practices.equally important,rsa can not convincingly argue that having the power to compel arbitration of compensation issues is a basic right of public safety employees or that its absence is an unfair labor practice.overall,then,despite its remarks about the multijurisdictional implications of unstable public safety employee labor relations,the california supreme court in baggett declares only that ensuring fair labor practices and basic protections for public safety employees is a matter of statewide concern it is not authority that the compensation of these employees is a matter of statewide concern.
in a case prior to baggett,the california supreme court differentiated between delegating individual grievances to an arbitrator and delegating general policymaking power,including,specifically,the power to set compensation the power to set the terms and conditions of public employment is broader and more intrusive upon the functions of city government than the arbitrator authority in this case to resolve an individual grievance.taylor crane cal d.thus,the supreme court has on at least two occasions recognized the intrusiveness of interfering with local governments when they determine employee compensation.
finally,we must distinguish another california supreme court case with language seemingly helpful to rsa position.we emphasize that there is a clear distinction between the substance of a public employee labor issue and the procedure by which it is resolved.thus there is no question that salaries of local employees of a charter city constitute municipal affairs and are not subject to general laws.citation.nevertheless,the process by which salaries are fixed is obviously a matter of statewide concern and none could,at this late stage,argue that a charter city need not meet and confer conce
