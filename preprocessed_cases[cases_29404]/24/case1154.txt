local,an unincorporated labor organization,challenged in district court the committee decision to affirm the discharge of mark thompson,a ups package pickup and delivery driver.local and ups are bound by collective bargaining agreements known as the national master united parcel service agreement nma and the atlantic area supplemental agreement supplement.the agreements mandate that if a grievance can not be resolved on the job by management,it must be submitted to the committee for arbitration.see generally supplement,article,section.the committee meets monthly for a period.see supplement,article,section b.each monthly committee is to consist of an equal number of representatives from management and the fewer than two and no more than three members each.see supplement,article,section e.the supplement requires in a discharge or suspension case that an impartial arbitrator serve as the fifth or seventh member and further provides that he shall render a bench decision on sic all deadlocked cases.supplement,article,section c.
the january committee designated to consider the thompson grievance consisted of seven management members,three union members and the impartial arbitrator,joseph sharnoff.shortly after the january hearing began,local questioned the committee authority to hear the case in view of an alleged agreement between the parties that discharge cases involving productivity were not to be resolved by arbitration.raising a point of order local argued that ups was precluded from defending thompson discharge on the ground that he had failed to meet production standards.the committee then considered the issue in executive session.during the session,one management member moved to deny local point of order.before the motion was seconded,however,the three union members left the room.they did not return that day.
the committee reconvened on january,recommenced its executive session and resumed discussions regarding the productivity issue.once again a management member moved to deny the point of order.the motion was seconded but,once again,the three union members left the room before a vote could be taken.when the arbitrator efforts to get the three to return were unsuccessful,he ruled that their absence amounted to three votes to uphold local point of order and to dismiss the thompson grievance on the basis that it involved productivity.the three management members then voted to deny the productivity point of order,creating a deadlock.the arbitrator broke the deadlock by voting to deny the point of order and to proceed to the merits.
when the committee reconvened on january to hear the merits,two of the three union committee members refused to participate in the hearing and remained instead in an adjoining room.local then raised a point of order that there was no quorum.the arbitrator again attempted to get the union members to participate and again he failed.upon returning to the hearing room,the arbitrator stated that we do not have,to my view,a properly constituted panel b ecause there are two u nion members absent,for whatever reason.ja.he recommended that we proceed to put the record on tape a nd at such point as everybody finished stating what their positions are we proceed,i guess,with however ups determines that we can proceed.ja.ups then raised a point of order asserting that the union committee members refusal to proceed violated article of the nma,which provides in part that t he u nion agrees it will not unreasonably delay the processing of discharge or suspension cases.nma article.ups threatened to remove thompson from the payroll but the remaining union committee member objected that doing so would violate both the nma and the supplement.the committee did not rule on the article point of order before adjourning.
a different committee convened on february with two management members,two union members and the same arbitrator in attendance.when the committee called the thompson case,one union member refused to participate.local again raised a point of order that there was no quorum,although four of the five committee members two management members,one union member and the arbitrator remained present.in executive session,the committee denied local point of order.local then stated that it would not participate any further or be bound by any committee decision,again spite of the committee ruling to the there was no quorum.when ups began presenting its case,the remaining union committee member left the hearing,echoing local objection that there was no quorum.after ups presentation,the panel ruled in favor of the company,ja,and upheld thompson discharge,ja.
local sought in district court to vacate the committee decisions,arguing that both the january decision to proceed and the february decision on the merits were invalid because they were made without a quorum.on september,the district court granted ups motion for summary judgment.
our review of a district court decision on a summary judgment motion is de novo.see shields eli lilly,since pretrial summary judgment decisions are rendered exclusively on the basis of a paper record,an appellate court is equally as a trial judge to assess the evidence at issue.we will affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to ups only if ups has demonstrated in view of all the the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to local,the there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see also celotex catrett,d.local appeals the grant of summary judgment to ups on three grounds.
first,local argues that the district court had the broad authority and even the duty to scrutinize strictly the committee january decision to proceed because that decision was substantive,not procedural,and because it seriously undermined the integrity of the arbitral process.br.of appellant at.we reject this contention.
it is that the courts play only a limited role when asked to review the decision of an arbitrator.united paperworkers int l union,misco,d.indeed,we are not authorized to reconsider the merits of an award even though the parties may allege that the award rests on errors of fact or on misinterpretation of the contract.see also united steelworkers of am.enter.wheel car,d the federal policy of settling labor disputes by arbitration would be undermined if courts had the final say on the merits of the awards.we have repeatedly recognized that judicial review of arbitral awards is extremely limited and that we do not sit to hear claims of factual or legal error by an arbitrator as we would in reviewing decisions of lower courts.kanuth prescott,ball turben,quoting misco,at.at.the united states supreme court recently reaffirmed these general principles,holding that if an arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,the fact that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.major league baseball players ass garvey,d per curiam internal quotations omitted emphasis added.judicial deference to an arbitrator is broader still if the arb
