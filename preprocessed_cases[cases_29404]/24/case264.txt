tradearbed,ta appeals from an order entered on march,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york mckenna,denying its motion to stay the action pending arbitration pursuant to the federal arbitration act,the faa and to dismiss the action pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure before the district court,ta argued that it entered into three separate contracts to sell steel to aceros prefabricados,aceros through three confirmation orders dated january,january,and march,each of which operated as a separate acceptance of aceros prior offers to purchase steel.ta further claimed that aceros bound itself to the arbitration provision that was incorporated by reference into each of the confirmation orders.the district court rejected ta argument,holding instead that an earlier letter from ta to aceros,dated january,the january letter,constituted ta acceptance of aceros offers,thereby forming a single contract on that date and the arbitration provisions were proposed additional terms that materially altered the contract and therefore that they did not become part of that contract.aceros prefabricados,tradearbed,wl,at,aceros.accordingly,the court denied ta motion to stay the action pending arbitration.the court also denied ta motion for reconsideration.aceros prefabricados,tradearbed,wl,at.
on appeal,ta argues that the district court erred in finding that aceros was not bound by the arbitration provisions.ta contends that this is so regardless of the date of contract formation.specifically,ta claims that if january is deemed the date of contract formation,aceros is bound to arbitrate its disputes with ta because the arbitration provisions do not materially alter the contract aceros expressly accepted the second confirmation order,thereby agreeing to modify the original contract to include arbitration.if,instead,the first of three contracts was formed by the january confirmation order,ta claims that the arbitration provisions still became part of the contracts because aceros signed one order confirmation and retained the others without objection,and even without aceros express acceptance of one order confirmation,retention without protest is sufficient to bind aceros to the arbitration provisions.as a consequence,ta requests that the district court order be reversed and the case remanded with instructions to stay the action pending arbitration.
for the reasons that follow,we vacate and remand.
background 
on december,ta,an affiliate of the world largest steel manufacturer,and aceros,a major central american contractor,began exchanging letters,most of them written in spanish,in connection with aceros prospective purchase of steel from ta.this correspondence included a list from aceros of the products it desired,and several purchase orders from aceros that included tonnages and proposed prices.the parties agree that,prior to the january letter from ta to aceros,no contract had been formed.they disagree,however,as to the significance of the january letter.the january letter states that ta hereby confirm s the orders for beams as follows.the parties dispute the proper english translation of the letter next sentence.aceros asserts that it reads we hereby confirm that the orders will be shipped in the next few days.in contrast,ta contends that the correct translation is the confirmations of the orders will be shipped in the next few days.
aceros argues that the january letter demonstrates ta intent to contract and therefore constituted an acceptance of aceros prior offers,resulting in a binding contract between the parties as of that date.ta maintains that it accepted aceros offers only when it sent three confirmation orders dated january,january,and march,that each confirmation constituted a separate acceptance,and that the parties therefore entered into three distinct contracts for the sale and purchase of steel.each of the three confirmation orders was sent with a cover sheet stating that the confirmation includes the sale terms and conditions for the steel,and the last page of each confirmation order contains a n ote that provides subject to terms stated on general conditions of sale enclosed.your failure to object to any term within days of receipt of this contract shall be deemed an acceptance by you.aceros contends,and ta does not dispute,that the general conditions of sale were not included with any of the three confirmation orders.nonetheless,the general conditions of sale contain the following arbitration provision any controversy arising under or in connection with the contract shall be submitted to arbitration in new york city in accordance with the rules then obtaining of the american arbitration association.aceros did not sign or return the january confirmation,and it is undisputed that aceros never objected to any term in any of the confirmation orders.it is also undisputed that an aceros agent accepted the january confirmation order,by writing a ceptado on and signing each of the four pages of the confirmation order and then mailing it back to ta.as with the first confirmation order,aceros neither signed nor returned the third confirmation order dated march.
on december,aceros commenced this diversity action against ta for breach of contract.on january,relying on the arbitration clause,ta moved to stay the action pending arbitration pursuant to section of the faa or to dismiss the action pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.aceros responded that the arbitration clause was not part of the parties agreement as memorialized on january because the general conditions of sale were not accepted by aceros not incorporated by reference into the confirmation orders and not enclosed with the confirmation orders as the orders themselves stated.
in a memorandum and order dated march,the district court denied ta motion.aceros,wl,at.the court found that the january letter evidenced the formation of a contract between the parties because while all prior correspondence from ta to aceros contained language indicating an intent not to be bound,such as pending confirmation from our principals or pending confirmation from our main office,the january letter did not contain any similarly limiting language.id.at.in reaching its conclusion,the court relied,without explanation,on aceros translation of the disputed confirmation language.having found a contract formed by the january letter,the court viewed the terms of the january,january,and march confirmation them,the requirement to arbitrate proposals for additional terms to the contract.id.without any mention of aceros acceptance of the january confirmation order,the court held,as a matter of law,that an arbitration provision materially alters legal rights under a contract,and therefore that the arbitration clause was not part of the parties agreement.id.
on april,ta filed a motion requesting that the court reconsider its order denying ta motion to stay the case pending arbitration.in seeking reconsideration,ta contended that the district court erroneously relied on aceros translation of the january letter rather than the translation offered in an affidavit of ta vice president.in a memorandum and order dated april,the district court denied the motion for reconsideration.the court held that the affidavit of ta vice president does not undermine the court reliance on the translation provided by aceros,and even under ta proposed translation,the language not disputed is sufficient to support the court denial of ta motion to stay the proceedings.aceros prefabricados,wl,at.this interlocutory appeal followed.
discussion 
we have jurisdiction to hear this interlocutory appeal pursuant to section a of the faa we review de novo the district court legal conclusion that the parties did not contractually bind themselves to arbitrate disputes,chelsea square textiles,bombay dyeing manufacturing,cir,and review factual findings underlying those conclusions for clear error.id.in regard to the contract at issue,we apply new york law 
aceros maintains that it could not have accepted the arbitration clause because the general conditions of sale which include the arbitration clause were not enclosed with the order confirmations nor mentioned by ta.that the general conditions of sale were not themselves included with the order confirmations does not render the arbitration provisions invalid.applying new york law,we have found that p arties to a contract are plainly free to incorporate by reference,and bind themselves inter sese to,terms that may be found in other agreements.ronan assocs.local,int l union of operating eng rs,cir.indeed,we have specifically found that parties were bound to arbitrate under arbitration clauses they never signed,where those clauses were contained in other documents that were incorporated by reference.see,id.finding employment contract incorporated by reference union collective bargaining agreement including right to compel arbitration of questions of discharge progressive cas.ins.reaseguradora nacional de venezuela,cir finding insurance contract incorporated by reference separate document that included arbitration provision binding the parties to arbitrate.thus,ta failure to include the general conditions of sale with the confirmation orders does not prevent those terms from being included in its contract with aceros.
the district court held that the january letter constituted an acceptance by ta of aceros offers to purchase steel,thereby forming a contract between the parties.for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that whether the january letter formed a single contract or the confirmation orders formed three separate contracts,the parties are bound by the arbitration provisions.we therefore find it unnecessary to determine the precise moment of contract formation.
under the new york uniform commercial code the ucc an expression of acceptance or written confirmation that sets forth terms in addition to those initially agreed upon will not defeat formation of a binding contract.see mckinney instead,a contract will be found and the additional terms in this case,the general conditions of sale,including the arbitration clause are then treated as proposals for addition to the contract.id.this analysis applies to both expressions of acceptance that form the contract,see id.bayway ref.oxygenated mktg.trading,cir plaintiff fax is effective to form a contract as an though it stated or referenced additional terms applying new york law,and written confirmations of agreements already reached,see mae,warshow sons,dep t resolving issue of whether a clause in a confirmation invoice constitutes a material alteration of an existing contract between merchants within the meaning of ucc.an official comment to section makes clear the applicability of that provision to these two situations 
under this article a proposed deal which in commercial understanding has in fact been closed is recognized as a contract.therefore,any additional matter contained either in the writing intended to close the deal or in a later confirmation falls within subsection and must be regarded as a proposal for an added term 
cmt.emphasis added.therefore,were we to find that the contract between aceros and ta was formed on january,as aceros claims and as the district court held,then the three confirmation orders would constitute written confirmations stating terms additional to the january agreement,and analysis would proceed under section.
were we to agree instead with ta argument that each of its order confirmations served as a separate acceptance of individual prior offers by aceros to purchase steel,the confirmations would then constitute acceptances proposing additional terms and analysis would likewise proceed under section,albeit of three individual contracts both contract formation scenarios lead us to the same conclusion regarding the parties obligation to arbitrate disputes.
we therefore turn to an examination of whether the arbitration provisions are part of the parties contract pursuant to section it is undisputed that both ta and aceros are merchants for the purposes of the ucc.see id.under the ucc,proposed additional terms become part of a contract between merchants unless one of three statutory exceptions is satisfied.see id.aceros invokes only the material alteration exception of section b,which prohibits inclusion in a contract of a proposed additional term that would materially alter the contract unless the other party agrees.id.b.aceros agreed to arbitrate disputes in regard to goods shipped under the january confirmation order when it wrote a ceptado on and signed every page of that confirmation order and mailed it back to ta aceros therefore bound itself to arbitrate disputes arising out of that order of goods.in contrast,neither the january nor the march confirmation order was expressly accepted by aceros,and we must therefore determine whether the arbitration clause,as a proposed additional term in those two confirmation orders,is included in the parties contract.
the district court stated that a s a matter of law,an arbitration provision materially alters ones sic legal rights under a contract.aceros,wl,at.the two authorities cited by the district court,demarco california fabrics,nygard international,civ,wl,at,and mae,in turn relied on the new york court of appeals case,marlene industries carnac textiles.marlene industries restated the new york rule that parties to a commercial transaction will not be held to have chosen arbitration as the forum for the resolution of their disputes in the absence of an express,unequivocal agreement to that effect absent such an explicit commitment neither party may be compelled to arbitrate.id.at,internal quotation marks omitted.thus,unlike nonarbitration agreements,which need only be proven by a preponderance of the evidence,new york law requires a higher degree of proof for arbitration agreements.see progressive,at schubtex,allen snyder.while state law generally governs issues of contract interpretation in cases arising under the faa,progressive,at,such disparate treatment of arbitration provisions is not permitted.perry thomas,d.
in perry,the supreme court held that under the faa a court may not,in assessing the rights of litigants to enforce an arbitration agreement,construe that agreement in a manner different from that in which it otherwise construes nonarbitration agreements under state law.id.at.following the dictates of perry,we have considered the rule cited in marlene industries preempted by the faa because of its discriminatory treatment of arbitration provisions.chelsea square textiles,at see also progressive,at because perry prohibits discriminatory treatment of arbitration agreements,the rule set forth in marlene industries is preempted.thus,contrary to the district court holding,arbitration agreements do not,as a matter of law,constitute material alterations to a contract rather,the question of their inclusion in a contract under section b is answered by examining,on a basis,their materiality under a preponderance of the evidence standard as we would examine any other agreement.see hatzlachh supply moishe,vacated on other grounds by.
t he burden of proving the materiality of the alteration must fall on the party that opposes inclusion.bayway,at.this is so because the ucc presumes that between merchants additional terms will be included in a contract.id.thus,if neither party introduced any evidence,the proposed additional term would,by the plain language of,become part of the contract.id.aceros was therefore required to establish that the arbitration provision constituted a material alteration to its contract with ta.
a material alteration is one that would result in surprise or hardship if incorporated without express awareness by the other party.cmt.bayway,at.surprise includes both a subjective element of what a party actually knew and an objective element of what a party should have known.id.we have stated that a profession of surprise and raised eyebrows are not enough.id.instead,t o carry its burden the nonassenting party must establish that,under the circumstances,it can not be presumed that a reasonable merchant would have consented to the additional term.id.
