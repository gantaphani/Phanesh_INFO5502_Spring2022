clifton,circuit judge 
abdul mohamed and ronald gillette,former uber drivers,filed an action in district court alleging on behalf of themselves and a proposed class of other drivers that defendants uber technologies,rasier,llc,and hirease,llc,violated the fair credit reporting act fcra and various state statutes.gillette has also brought a representative claim against uber under california private attorneys general act of paga alleging that he was misclassified as an independent contractor rather than an employee.the district court denied uber motion to compel arbitration of the claims.mohamed uber technologies,supp.cal.uber argues on appeal that the district court erroneously considered whether the arbitration provisions were enforceable when that question was clearly delegated to an arbitrator,and that even if the district court properly considered arbitrability,it erred in concluding that the arbitration provisions were invalid and in declining to compel arbitration.
we conclude that the district court erred at the first step and improperly assumed the authority to decide whether the arbitration agreements were enforceable.the question of arbitrability as to all but gillette paga claims was delegated to the arbitrator.under the terms of the agreement gillette signed,the paga waiver should be severed from the arbitration agreement and gillette paga claims may proceed in court on a representative basis.all of plaintiffs remaining arguments,including both mohamed challenge to the paga waiver in the agreement he signed and the challenge by both plaintiffs to the validity of the arbitration agreement itself,are subject to resolution via arbitration.
background 
plaintiff abdul mohamed began driving for uber black car service in boston in,and for uberx around october.like all uber drivers,mohamed used a smartphone to access the uber application while driving,which enabled him to pick up customers.
in late july,mohamed was required to agree to two new contracts with uber the software license and online services agreement and the driver addendum jointly,the agreement before he was allowed to sign in to the application.the agreement provided that it was governed by california law.it included an arbitration provision requiring uber drivers to submit to arbitration to resolve most disputes with the company.it also included a provision requiring drivers to waive their right to bring disputes as a class action,a collective action,or a private attorney general representative action.drivers could opt out of arbitration by delivering notice of their intent to opt out to uber within days either in person or by overnight delivery service.mohamed accepted the agreements and did not opt out.
nearly a year later,in june,uber released an updated version of the software license and online services agreement and the driver addendum jointly,the agreement.the agreement also provided that it was governed by california law.it included an updated arbitration provision with an easier procedure that enabled drivers to opt out via as well as in person or by delivery service.it also included a provision requiring all disputes with the company to be resolved only by an arbitrator through final and binding arbitration on an individual basis only,and not by way of court or jury trial,or by way of class,collective,or representative action.mohamed accepted these agreements and did not opt out.in early october,mohamed accepted a similar agreement with rasier,a wholly owned subsidiary of uber rasier software sublicense online services agreement rasier agreement 
in late october,shortly after he began driving for uberx,mohamed access to the app was cut off due to negative information on his consumer credit report,effectively terminating his ability to drive for uber.
ronald gillette began driving for uber in the san francisco bay area in march.like mohamed,he was required to agree to the agreement before signing into the uber application in late july.also like mohamed,he did not opt out.in april,gillette access to the app was cut off because of negative information on his consumer credit report.this effectively terminated his relationship with uber.
on november,mohamed filed a class action in the northern district of california against uber,rasier,and hirease,an independent company that conducted background checks.mohamed alleged that the use of his consumer credit report violated the fcra,the massachusetts consumer credit reporting act mccra,and the california consumer credit reporting agencies act ccraa.two days later,on november,gillette filed a separate lawsuit against uber,also in the northern district of california.gillette alleged that the company use of his consumer credit report violated the fcra and the california investigative consumer reporting agencies act icraa.he also alleged that uber had misclassified him and other employees as independent contractors in violation of california paga statute.
uber moved to compel arbitration in both lawsuits,arguing that gillette was bound by the arbitration provision in the agreement and mohamed by the arbitration provision in the agreement.the district court denied both motions,mohamed,supp.at,and uber now appeals.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo an order denying a motion to compel arbitration.oracle,myriad grp,cir.
both the and the agreements contained provisions that provided,using very similar language,that disputes would be resolved by arbitration and,further,that any dispute as to arbitrability with one exception discussed below would be resolved by the arbitrator.these provisions stated 
except as it otherwise provides,this arbitration provision is intended to apply to the resolution of disputes that otherwise would be resolved in a court of law or before a forum other than arbitration.this arbitration provision requires all such disputes to be resolved only by an arbitrator through final and binding arbitration and not by way of court or jury trial 
such disputes include without limitation disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision,including the enforceability,revocability or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision.
the agreement continued all such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge.
both the and agreements also contained provisions that required drivers to waive the right to bring class,collective,and representative actions including claims under the paga statute,either in court or in arbitration.the agreement,but not the agreement,carved out challenges to these waivers from the general delegation provision notwithstanding any other clause contained in this agreement,any claim that all or part of the class action waiver,collective action waiver or private attorney general waiver is invalid,unenforceable,unconscionable,void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
the district court concluded that the delegation clauses in both the and the agreements were ineffective because they were not clear and unmistakable.mohamed,supp.at.the court also concluded that even if the delegation clauses were clear and unmistakable,they were unenforceable because they were unconscionable.id.at.we disagree.the agreement clearly and unmistakably delegated the question of arbitrability to the arbitrator except as pertained to the arbitrability of class action,collective action,and representative claims.the agreement clearly and unmistakably delegated the question of arbitrability to the arbitrator under all circumstances.neither delegation provision was unconscionable.thus,all of plaintiffs challenges to the enforceability of the arbitration agreement,save gillette challenge to the enforceability of the paga waiver in the agreement,should have been adjudicated in the first instance by an arbitrator and not in court.
delegation of the issue of arbitrability 
u nlike the arbitrability of claims in general,whether the court or the arbitrator decides arbitrability is an issue for judicial determination unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise.oracle,at quoting howsam dean witter reynolds.in other words,there is a presumption that courts will decide which issues are arbitrable the federal policy in favor of arbitration does not extend to deciding questions of arbitrability.id.clear and unmistakable evidence of an agreement to arbitrate arbitrability might include a course of conduct demonstrating assent or an express agreement to do so.momot mastro,cir.quoting,jackson,stevens,dissenting.
in momot,we held that language delegating to the arbitrators the authority to determine the validity or application of any of the provisions of the arbitration clause constitutes an agreement to arbitrate threshold issues concerning the arbitration agreement.id.quoting,at internal quotation marks omitted.here,both the and the agreements delegated to the arbitrators the authority to decide issues relating to the enforceability,revocability or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision.this language is similar to but more expansive than the language at issue in momot,and thus also clearly and unmistakably indicates the parties intent for the arbitrators to decide the threshold question of arbitrability.id 
the district court determined that the delegation provisions themselves were unambiguous,but it nonetheless held that they conflicted with venue provisions elsewhere in the and agreements.mohamed,supp.at.both venue provisions stated that any disputes,actions,claims,or causes of action arising out of or in connection with this agreement or the uber service or software shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the city and county of san francisco.the district court concluded that the language in the venue provisions granting state or federal courts in san francisco exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes,actions,claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with this agreement was inconsistent and in considerable tension with the language of the delegation clauses,which provide d that without limitation arbitrability will be decided by an arbitrator.id.at.the court also identified an inconsistency between the without limitation language and the provision in the agreement granting courts jurisdiction over challenges to the paga waiver.id.at.
these conflicts are artificial.the clause describing the scope of the arbitration provision was prefaced with e xcept as it otherwise provides,which eliminated the inconsistency between the general delegation provision and the specific in the agreement.as for the venue provision,the california court of appeal has observed that n o matter how broad the arbitration clause,it may be necessary to file an action in court to enforce an arbitration agreement,or to obtain a judgment enforcing an arbitration award,and the parties may need to invoke the jurisdiction of a court to obtain other remedies.dream theater,dream theater,cal.rptr,cal.app,as modified on denial of reh g.it is apparent that the venue provision here was intended for these purposes,and to identify the venue for any other claims that were not covered by the arbitration agreement.that does not conflict with or undermine the agreement unambiguous statement identifying arbitrable claims and arguments.
the delegation provisions clearly and unmistakably delegated the question of arbitrability to the arbitrator for all claims except challenges to the class,collective,and representative action waivers in the agreement.in accordance with supreme court precedent,we are required to enforce these agreements according to their terms and,in the absence of some other generally applicable contract defense,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,let an arbitrator determine arbitrability as to all but the claims specifically exempted by the agreement,at.
b.the delegation provisions were not unconscionable 
the district court also held that,even if the delegation provisions were clear and unmistakable,they were both unenforceable due to unconscionability.mohamed,supp.at.under california law,unconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element,the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,the latter on overly harsh or results.armendariz found.health psychcare,cal.quoting a m produce fmc,cal.rptr,cal.app.both substantive and procedural unconscionability must be present in order for a court to find a contract unconscionable,but they need not be present in the same degree.id.recently,the california supreme court has emphasized that unconscionability requires a substantial degree of unfairness beyond a simple bad bargain.baltazar forever,cal.quoting a,moreno,cal.rather,unconscionable contracts are those that are so as to shock the conscience.id.at quoting pinnacle museum tower pinnacle mkt.dev.us,llc,cal.when considering an unconscionability challenge to a delegation provision,the court must consider only arguments specific to the delegation provision,at 
the district court concluded that the delegation provisions in both the and agreements were procedurally and substantively unconscionable.for the agreement,the court concluded that the provision was procedurally unconscionable because it was hidden in a prolix printed form,nagrampa mailcoups,cir.en banc quoting flores transamerica homefirst,cal.rptr,cal.app,and because there was no meaningful opportunity for the drivers to reject the contract.mohamed,supp.at.for the agreement,the court concluded that the delegation provision was procedurally unconscionable because the agreement utterly failed to notify drivers of a specific drawback of the delegation clause namely,that drivers may be required to pay considerable forum fees to arbitrate arbitrability,and because employees likely felt at least some pressure not to opt out of arbitration despite the presence of a clear provision.id.at.the court also concluded that both the and agreements were substantively unconscionable because they required arbitration costs and fees to be shared equally between uber and the driver.id.at.as a result,it concluded that both delegation provisions should be invalidated.id.at.
uber argues that the delegation provisions could not have been procedurally unconscionable because both agreements gave drivers an opportunity to opt out of arbitration altogether.the district court agreed with uber that,under ninth circuit precedent,the existence of a meaningful right to of arbitration necessarily renders the arbitration clause and the delegation clause specifically procedurally conscionable as a matter of law.id.at.as to the agreement,the court concluded that the right to opt out was not meaningful because drivers were required to opt out either in person at uber san francisco offices or by overnight delivery service,both of which were so burdensome as to make the right illusory.id.at.as to the agreement,which contained a much less burdensome procedure,the court held that our precedent failed to apply california law as announced by the california supreme court,and as such,declined to apply it id.at.
the district court does not have the authority to ignore circuit court precedent,and neither do we.binding authority must be followed unless and until overruled by a body competent to do so.hart massanari,cir.see miller gammie,cir.en banc identifying the limited circumstances when a panel of this court is not bound by our precedent.in nagrampa,we determined that t he threshold inquiry in california unconscionability analysis is whether the arbitration agreement is adhesive.at quoting armendariz,at.in circuit city stores,ahmed,we held that an arbitration agreement is not adhesive if there is an opportunity to opt out of it,cir.see also kilgore keybank,nat.ass n,cir.en banc.taken together,these two principles compel us to find that the agreement,at least,is not adhesive,which supports our holding that the delegation provision is not unconscionable.
the district court conclusion that the right to opt out of the agreement was illusory fares no better.an illusory promise is one containing words in promissory form that promise nothing and which do not purport to put any limitation on the freedom of the alleged promisor.flores am.seafoods,cir.quoting corbin on contracts ed.while we do not doubt that it was more burdensome to opt out of the arbitration provision by overnight delivery service than it would have been by,the contract bound uber to accept from those drivers who followed the procedure it set forth.there were some drivers who did opt out and whose uber recognized.thus,the promise was not illusory.the fact that the provision was buried in the agreement does not change this analysis.mohamed.at.as we noted in ahmed,one who signs a contract is bound by its provisions and can not complain of unfamiliarity with the language of the instrument.at quoting madden kaiser found,cal.
the delegation provisions were not procedurally unconscionable in either the or the agreements.because the agreements were not procedurally unconscionable,and because both procedural and substantive unconscionability must be present in order for an agreement to be unenforceable,see armendariz,at,we need not reach the question whether the agreements here were substantively unconscionable.the district court should have ordered the parties to arbitrate their dispute over arbitrability with a narrow exception for the argument over the paga waiver in the agreement,as discussed below,and we remand with instructions that it do so 
c.the effective vindication doctrine 
plaintiffs also argue that even if the delegation provisions are otherwise enforceable,they are invalid because both the and agreements contain a fee term requiring drivers to split the costs of arbitration equally with uber and thus preclude drivers from effectively vindicating their federal statutory rights.effective vindication provides courts with a means to invalidate,on public policy grounds,arbitration agreements that operat e as a prospective waiver of a party right to pursue statutory remedies.am.exp.italian colors,quoting mitsubishi motors soler.in italian colors,the supreme court stated that effective vindication may cover filing and administrative fees attached to arbitration that are so high as to make access to the forum impracticable.id.at see also chavarria ralphs grocery,cir.finding that the effective vindication doctrine was implicated when administrative and filing costs,even disregarding the cost to prove the merits,effectively foreclose pursuit of the claim.evidence submitted by the plaintiffs suggests that the costs of arbitration in this case may exceed per day.
however,uber has committed to paying the full costs of arbitration.so long as uber abides by this commitment,the fee term in the arbitration agreement presents plaintiffs with no obstacle to pursuing vindication of their federal statutory rights in arbitration.as a result,we decline to reach the question of whether the fee term would run afoul of the effective vindication doctrine if it were enforced as written.
d.the paga waiver 
plaintiffs argue that the arbitration provisions in the and agreements were invalid under california law because they both contained unenforceable,unseverable waivers of plaintiffs claims under the california paga statute.because we conclude that the district court should not have reached the question of whether the arbitration agreements were enforceable in the first place,it is not necessary to address this argument pertaining to the agreement.plaintiffs challenges to the enforceability and severability of the paga waiver in the agreement fall to the arbitrator to decide.
as noted above,however,the agreement specifically required the district court,and not the arbitrator,to consider certain challenges to the arbitration provision,including challenges to the enforceability of the paga waiver.because of that,it remains for us to consider on the merits whether the paga waiver in that agreement is enforceable,and what effect the waiver has on the arbitration provision as a whole.
the district court concluded that the arbitration provision in the agreement was procedurally unconscionable because it was adhesive,oppressive,and a surprise to drivers who accepted the agreement,and that it was substantively unconscionable because it contained a paga waiver that was unenforceable under california law.mohamed,supp.at.the district court also concluded that the paga waiver was unseverable from the remainder of the agreement and that the entirety of the arbitration agreement fails because the paga waiver fails.id.at.for the reasons stated above,the district court holding on unconscionability was erroneous.
perhaps recognizing that the district court unconscionability analysis ran counter to existing ninth circuit precedent,plaintiffs argue on appeal that even if the district court erred in finding that the arbitration provision in the agreement was unconscionable,the paga waiver was still invalid under california law and unseverable from the remainder of the arbitration provision under the terms of the contract.plaintiffs argue that the invalid paga waiver thus dooms the entire arbitration provision,such that claims governed by that agreement,all of gillette claims must be litigated in court.although we agree that the paga waiver in the agreement was invalid under california law,we conclude that it is severable from the remainder of the agreement.
in iskanian cls transp,llc,cal,the california supreme court held that where an employment agreement compels the waiver of representative claims under the paga,it is contrary to public policy and unenforceable as a matter of state law.id.at.we have held that the federal arbitration act does not preempt this rule.sakkab luxottica retail,cir.uber attempts to distinguish this case from iskanian because drivers were able to opt out of the agreement,but its effort is unavailing.drivers presented with the
