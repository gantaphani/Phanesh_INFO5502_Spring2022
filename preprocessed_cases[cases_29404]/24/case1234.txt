background 
defendants own and operate an airport charter transport business.from about june until june,plaintiff worked for defendants as an airport shuttle van driver.plaintiff picked up and dropped off people primarily at lax.
plaintiff entered into an owner operator sub carrier agreement agreement with defendant rideshare port management,llc,doing business as prime time shuttle,llc the agreement provides for binding arbitration of any controversy or claim between the parties arising out of or relating to this agreement or any alleged breach hereof,including any issues that this agreement or any part hereof is invalid,illegal,or otherwise voidable or void 
the agreement also provides by this agreement,sub carrier and prime carrier acknowledge and agree that there does not exist between them the relationship of either express or implied.sub carrier will not be treated as an employee of prime carrier for any purpose,statutory or otherwise thus,according to the terms of the agreement,plaintiff was an independent contractor and not an employee.

in the trial court,the question whether california law or the faa applies to the arbitration agreement was not raised in defendants motion to compel arbitration,nor in plaintiff opposition,nor in defendants reply.plaintiff chief argument in opposition to the motion to compel arbitration,both in the trial court and in the court of appeal,has been that defendants waived the right to compel arbitration.plaintiff has never contended the arbitration agreement was unconscionable.
at the initial hearing on the motion to compel arbitration,held september,the court granted plaintiff an opportunity to submit supplemental briefing by october,and gave defendants a chance to file a response by october.the court continued the hearing on the motion to october.at the hearing held october,the court granted defendants an opportunity to file a second supplemental brief.defendants filed the second supplemental brief,along with supplemental declarations and a request for judicial notice,on november,asserting faa preemption for the first time.the record does not include any further briefing by plaintiff.no reporter transcripts are included in the record.the court took the matter under submission and issued its minute order february,denying the motion to compel arbitration.
the trial court order denying arbitration prepared and proposed to the court by plaintiff made no reference to the faa.first,the court concluded defendants waived the right to arbitrate by litigating.second,the court concluded that plaintiff did not agree to arbitrate his statutory labor claims.the court explained that because the complaint is based principally on the violation of labor code statutes,defendants could not compel arbitration.the court relied on california law and did not address defendants contention that the faa governed the interpretation of the arbitration agreement.

california labor code section provides that a cause of action that seeks to collect due and unpaid wages pursuant to labor code sections through can be maintained in court,despite an agreement to arbitrate.lane francis capital management llc th,lane.thus,if california law governs the interpretation of the arbitration agreement,then plaintiff two causes of action for due and unpaid wages under labor code sections through the fifth and sixth causes of action can be maintained in court.but if the faa applies,all of plaintiff statutory claims may be arbitrated.see perry thomas,where faa applies,it preempts labor code.paga claims are not subject to private arbitration agreements iskanian cls transportation los angeles llc cal th,iskanian,but plaintiff has not alleged a paga claim.

defendants cite abel southern shuttle services,cir abel in support of their argument that this dispute involves interstate commerce.in abel,the court considered whether a former supershuttle employee was entitled to overtime pay under the federal labor standards act flsa.in the context of analyzing whether the plaintiff fell within the motor carrier act exemption to the overtime pay requirement the court concluded that the purely intrastate transport of passengers to and from an airport may,under certain circumstances,constitute interstate commerce abel,at.in abel,the circumstances justified finding the employee and his employer were engaged in interstate commerce because the passengers using the employer service often travelled from other states.in addition,passengers purchased package deals on the internet which included hotel accommodations,airfare,and vouchers for free airport transportation which the customers used to board the employer airport shuttles.in other words,the local transport of these travelers has a practical continuity of movement with the overall interstate journey.id.at.
defendants submitted evidence and a request for judicial notice in support of their second supplemental brief demonstrating their operations are substantially the same as the operations of the employer in abel.defendants also provide shuttle service to and from major airports and harbors throughout california,contract with expedia and other web vendors to advertise on their websites,and permit passengers to use the internet to make a shuttle reservation and pay for their reservation online.plaintiff was a shuttle driver who picked up and dropped off people primarily at lax.plaintiff acknowledges that defendants evidence clearly shows defendants were involved in interstate commerce but contends he was not engaged in interstate commerce because he only drove shuttles within california.presented with virtually the same facts as those before the court in abel,we follow the reasoning of that decision in finding the agreement between the parties involves interstate commerce.california law is consistent with this conclusion.shepard,supra th at.
c.the dispute falls within the arbitration provisions.
arbitration is strongly favored,and any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues will be resolved in favor of arbitration.steelworkers warrior gulf,united transportation union southern cal.rapid transit dist.th.when deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a dispute,courts generally apply ordinary principles of contract interpretation.first options of chicago,kaplan.notwithstanding the policy favoring arbitration,because arbitration is a matter of contract,a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.citation.at t technologies communications workers,see also lawrence walzer gabrielson d.the party opposing arbitration has the burden to show that the agreement does not apply to the dispute.buckhorn jude heritage medical group th.
the agreement between the parties here provides there does not exist between them the relationship of either express or implied.sub carrier will not be treated as an employee of prime carrier for any purpose,statutory or otherwise the agreement also provides that any controversy or claim between the parties arising out of or relating to this agreement or any alleged breach thereof,including any issues that this agreement or any part hereof is invalid,illegal,or otherwise voidable or void,shall be submitted to binding arbitration.
the complaint alleges that plaintiff was misclassified as an independent contractor,and was entitled to protections conferred upon employees by the labor code,notwithstanding the representations made in the agreement.the resolution of plaintiff claims requires a determination whether the agreement sets the terms of plaintiff compensation or whether instead the agreement is invalid,illegal,or otherwise voidable or void for inaccurately characterizing the parties relationship in order to deprive plaintiff of his rightful compensation under the labor code.in short,this dispute concerns a controversy or claim between the parties arising out of or relating to their agreement,including plaintiff claim that the compensation provisions of the agreement are invalid,illegal,voidable or void.
the language arising out of or relating to as used in the parties arbitration provision is generally considered a broad provision.larkin williams,woolley,cogswell,nakazawa russell th,holding complaint for dissolution of partnership arises out of and relates to partnership agreement baudoin mid louisiana anesthesia consultants,cir,broad arbitration clauses are those where the language of the clause requires arbitration of any dispute that arises out of or relates to the agreement,or disputes that are in connection with the agreement.in southland keating,the united states supreme court found a contract covering any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement or the breach hereof to encompass claims under the california franchise investment law.id.at,fn.
broad arbitration clauses such as this one are consistently interpreted as applying to disputes between the contracting parties.coast plaza doctors hospital blue cross of california th,fn,where parties agreed to arbitrate a ny problem or dispute arising under this agreement concerning the terms of this agreement,the arbitration agreement was broad enough to encompass tort claims berman dean witter,d,the phrase any controversy arising out of or relating to this contract is certainly broad enough to embrace tort as well as contractual liabilities so long as they have their roots in the relationship between the parties which was created by the contract.
indeed,the high court has established that statutory claims are arbitrable when the parties contract involves interstate commerce and is therefore governed by the faa.mitsubishi motors soler chrysler plymouth,there is no reason to depart from the policy favoring arbitration where a party bound by an arbitration agreement raises claims founded on statutory rights.given the preference for arbitration,and the broad language of the agreement,plaintiff claims that the labor code governs his compensation,and not the compensation terms of his agreement with defendants,fall within the ambit of the arbitration clause.
plaintiff filed his first amended complaint on october.defendants demurred to the complaint.the demurrer was taken off calendar when the parties agreed plaintiff could file a second amended complaint.a second amended complaint was filed march.defendants answered the second amended complaint on april.
discovery was limited.plaintiff demanded documents and sent form interrogatories to one defendant,prime time.prime time responded to the demand for production of documents.prime time propounded one set of requests for production of documents and one set of special interrogatories on plaintiff.plaintiff produced pages of documents.defendants contend that for about of the interrogatories,plaintiff responded with only this statement discovery is ongoing,and has not yet been completed,and this responding party will amend his responses when discovery is completed.according to defendants,i n response to the remaining interrogatories,plaintiff merely restated the allegations and conclusions in the operative pleading.neither party included the responses in the record,and plaintiff does not dispute defendants characterization of his responses.
trial was set for october.
in finding waiver,the court found that the month delay between the filing of the complaint and the filing of the motion to compel was unreasonable,and that defendants actively participated in discovery and case management conferences and meetings with opposing counsel.the court also found that o nly after exhausting all other means defendants demurrer was overruled,defendant motion to strike was denied,defendants were required to file an answer to plaintiff second amended complaint,and defendants filed said answer and with an impending trial looming,do defendants now seek a court ordered arbitration.
our supreme court recent discussion of waiver of the contractual right to arbitrate is dispositive.california courts have found a waiver of the right to demand arbitration in a variety of contexts,ranging from situations in which the party seeking to compel arbitration has previously taken steps inconsistent with an intent to invoke arbitration citations to instances in which the petitioning party has unreasonably delayed in undertaking the procedure.citations.the decisions likewise hold that the bad faith or willful misconduct of a party may constitute a waiver and thus justify a refusal to compel arbitration.citation.citation.the fact that the party petitioning for arbitration has participated in litigation,short of a determination on the merits,does not by itself constitute a waiver.iskanian,supra,cal th at.
the supreme court reaffirmed the factors relevant to the waiver inquiry whether the party actions are inconsistent with the right to arbitrate whether the litigation machinery has been substantially invoked and the parties were well into preparation of a lawsuit before the party notified the opposing party of an intent to arbitrate whether a party either requested arbitration enforcement close to the trial date or delayed for a
