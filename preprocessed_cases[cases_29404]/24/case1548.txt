in december,scea purchased all the assets of red zone and entered into an incentive agreement with certain employees of red zone.according to scea complaint,ryan and sevigny secretly conspired to make sevigny a signatory of the incentive agreement so that she would be placed on the payroll of the red zone division of scea after the acquisition,even though she had held no position at red zone and had performed no work for the company.scea paid sevigny approximately in salary,pay,and incentive bonus between december,and december,without knowing that sevigny performed no duties for the company.

ryan against scea 
on august,ryan filed a against scea and scea shu yoshida.ryan alleged that before scea acquisition of red zone,he had informed yoshida that he intended to resign from scea and join red zone so that he could participate in the financial benefits of the acquisition.ryan told yoshida that whaley and walker were agreeable to such an arrangement.however,yoshida did not want to lose ryan as an employee of scea.according to the,yoshida orally agreed that red zone could put sevigny on its payroll so that she would receive the financial benefits ryan would have received as an employee of red zone,and ryan would remain an employee of scea as manager of studios.
ryan alleged in his that he was wrongfully terminated by scea on february,and that yoshida falsely disavowed the oral promises he had made about putting sevigny on scea payroll.ryan asserted causes of action for breach of employment contract,breach of third party beneficiary contract,fraud and deceit,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,implied indemnity,and negligent misrepresentation.
whaley and walker complaint against scea 
on the same day that ryan filed his,whaley and walker filed a separate action against scea and yoshida.whaley and walker were represented by the same law firm as ryan,and their complaint contained substantially the same allegations concerning yoshida alleged oral agreement that sevigny would be added to the red zone payroll.whaley and walker further alleged that,as part of the acquisition agreement between scea and red zone,they had entered into written employment agreements and an incentive agreement with scea.according to the complaint,scea wrongfully terminated whaley and walker on february.the complaint asserted causes of action for breach of employment contract,breach of incentive agreement,unpaid wages,fraud and deceit,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,and negligent misrepresentation.
though not specifically alleged in the pleadings,the parties do not dispute that ryan,whaley and walker were each terminated for their involvement in the alleged conspiracy to defraud scea by arranging to have sevigny placed on the payroll.
d.the motion to compel arbitration 
on september,scea and yoshida filed a motion to compel arbitration of the claims asserted by whaley and walker.in the motion,scea and yoshida alleged that whaley and walker had refused to submit the matter to arbitration,despite the fact that the asset purchase agreement,the incentive agreement,and the employment agreements all required arbitration of any claims arising out of or relating to the agreements.
whaley and walker argued that the court should deny arbitration and consolidate their complaint with ryan against scea and yoshida,pursuant to section,subdivision c.whaley and walker asserted that their suit against scea and yoshida arose out of the same set of facts as ryan and raised the same factual issue whether sevigny employment was the result of a fraudulent conspiracy or an agreement between yoshida,ryan,whaley,and walker.because ryan was not a party to the arbitration agreements and could not be compelled to arbitrate his claims,whaley and walker argued that scea motion to compel arbitration should be denied and the matter consolidated with ryan.
the trial court denied the motion to compel arbitration under the authority of section,subdivision c.the court reasoned in relevant part 
the court finds that although an arbitration agreement exists between the parties to this action,that a party to the arbitration agreement scea is also a party to a pending court action with third parties kelly ryan and tracy ann sevigny ryan,arising out of the same transaction or series of related transactions.there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on common issues of law or fa c t should the matter proceed to arbitration.
specifically,there is the possibility that an arbitrator might find in case no.that shu yoshida,as an authorized agent of scea,agreed to allow traci ann sevigny ryan to participate in the financial benefits of the acquisition of red zone by scea,and that the termination of walker and whaley was therefore an unjustified breach of their employment contract.
on the other hand,there is a possibility that a judicial officer in case no.might find that shu yoshida,acting on behalf of scea made no such agreement with the ryans,walker,and whaley that the ryans,walker,and whaley acted independently to defraud scea and that scea was justified in filing an action against the ryans.such a finding would also justify the termination of walker and whaley and would be inconsistent with the arbitration award on a material fact.
scea and yoshida appeal from the trial court order denying their motion to compel arbitration.the order is appealable pursuant to section,subdivision a.
discussiona.standard of review 
an order staying or denying arbitration under section,subdivision c is ordinarily reviewed for abuse of discretion.henry alcove investment,d.however,the sole issue raised by scea on the trial court erred in allowing whaley and walker to invoke the protections of section one of statutory construction.accordingly,we apply a de novo standard of review.see do superior court th,d.
b.the trial court did not misapply the law in denying the motion to compel arbitration 
scea asserts that section,subdivision c may be applied only at the request of a party to an arbitration agreement who is caught in the middle of a dispute in which some litigants are bound by the arbitration agreement,and others are not.because whaley and walker are not involved in litigation with anyone other than scea concerning the matters at issue they are not parties to the ryan argues that whaley and walker lack standing to invoke the protections of the statute we reject this contention.
