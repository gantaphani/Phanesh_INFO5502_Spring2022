may parties engaged in private dispute resolution stipulate to the appointment of a judicial referee or judge pro tempore to secure a settlement enforceable by the court under code of civil procedure section not unless they seek the reference in pending litigation.
this appeal was taken from an order of the superior court of san francisco county purporting to enforce an insurance coverage settlement entered pursuant to section and enter partial judgment thereon.we conclude that the superior court lacked jurisdiction and the order was void.
the original filing in the superior court of san francisco county was a stipulated petition for the appointment of a judge pro tempore to preside over the entry of a settlement.although no dispute was pending between the parties in the superior court,the court appointed a judge pro tempore,and the parties recorded a settlement at a hearing before him.thereafter,a dispute arose in which the insured contended the insurer had not fulfilled its obligations under the settlement.the insured filed a motion to enforce the settlement in superior court.the insurer responded on the merits,disputing the insured interpretation of the settlement,and also complained the superior court was not the proper tribunal for enforcement,since the court had referred the matter to a temporary judge.after the court granted the motion and entered partial judgment,the insurer raised these same arguments on appeal.
although the parties did not initially address the issue,we called for supplemental briefing on the following question in the absence of a preexisting lawsuit or agreement between the parties for appointment of a referee,by what authority did the superior court obtain jurisdiction over the dispute in this case we conclude the superior court never obtained subject matter jurisdiction,despite the parties attempt to confer jurisdiction by stipulation.accordingly,we reverse the partial judgment for lack of jurisdiction and do not address the substantive issues raised in the appeal.
background 
in march,the housing group thg and united national insurance company uni were in the midst of negotiating a settlement of their dispute over uni insurance coverage obligations.thg had previously filed a coverage lawsuit against uni and scottsdale insurance company scottsdale in federal court.in addition,thg had filed claims against uni in two state court actions filed in solano county and contra costa county superior courts no action had been filed or was pending between these parties in the san francisco county superior court.
after many private mediation sessions before daniel weinstein,a retired judge of the superior court,on march,the parties filed a petition in san francisco county superior court.this petition set forth several stipulations.together,the parties asked the court to take jurisdiction over the pending settlement negotiations and mediation appoint judge weinstein as a judge pro tempore to preside over the entry of a settlement in the form of a stipulated judgment and permit judge weinstein to retain jurisdiction until the settlement has been fully documented and all funds required by the settlement have been delivered to petitioners thg.the following day,the court accepted jurisdiction and appointed judge weinstein as a judge pro tempore to carry out the purpose and intent of the parties to this stipulation.
on march,counsel for the parties appeared before judge weinstein and acknowledged on the record their clients consent to be bound pursuant to of the code of civil procedure by the provisions of a settlement agreement.they had prepared a writing,referred to as exhibit a at the hearing,which laid out in detail the rights and obligations of thg,uni and subscribing underwriters for the insurance policies in question.the settlement included a sharing agreement,which required thg to share with uni certain recoveries it might obtain from scottsdale.from the record on appeal,it appears the parties did not immediately file the transcript of the march,hearing,or exhibit a memorializing the settlement agreement,in the san francisco superior court.
in july,following a mediation before former united states district court judge layn phillips,thg settled its coverage dispute with scottsdale.after learning of this settlement,uni demanded reimbursement from thg pursuant to the sharing agreement.thg initially refused.after a private mediation of the dispute,thg agreed to pay half of the scottsdale settlement fund to uni,and uni promised to repay thg dollar for dollar when and if thg later withdrew money,for defense and indemnity payments from the scottsdale fund.this provision was called a matching agreement.thg and uni eventually memorialized this settlement in a formal stipulation and order amending settlement on the record between the parties hereto stipulation and order which was signed by judge weinstein and filed in san francisco superior court.
thg later sought reimbursement from the scottsdale fund for defense and indemnity costs in nine cases.uni objected to disbursement of most of the amounts requested,as was its right under the stipulation and order,and the matter proceeded to arbitration before judge phillips.on august,judge phillips approved reimbursements from the scottsdale fund totaling,roughly half the amount thg had requested.
on august,thg filed in san francisco superior court a motion to enforce settlement on the record and for partial judgment thereon.thg argued that uni and generali as a subscribing underwriter agreed to be bound by the of the record before judge weinstein and the attached exhibit by the amendments set forth in the stipulation and order.pursuant to the matching agreement in the stipulation and order,thg claimed uni and generali were obligated to match the scottsdale fund disbursement dollar for dollar.citing the fact that the settlement was a stipulated judgment pursuant to section,thg prayed for partial judgment in the amount of,plus interest.uni and generali opposed the motion on the merits but also asserted that judge weinstein,and not a judge of the superior court,was the proper person to adjudicate the matter.the court ultimately granted thg motion,and this appeal followed 
discussion 
we obtained supplemental briefing to clarify the basis of the superior court jurisdiction over this matter.both sides contend their petition properly invoked the court jurisdiction.in this petition,the parties stipulated that this court take jurisdiction over the pending settlement negotiations and mediation between petitioners and respondent currently taking place under the auspices of,with the honorable daniel weinstein,retired judge of the california superior court,presiding.they also asked the court to appoint judge weinstein,as judge pro tempore,to preside over the current settlement negotiations between petitioners and respondent so that a settlement can be entered into on or before march,in the presence of judge weinstein,so that it will be enforceable under california code of civil procedure section.
neither party filed a complaint to initiate a civil action in the san francisco county superior court,nor was any case pending between the parties in that court.rather,the petition itself was treated as the first filing of a new case.yet the petition did not describe the substance or amount of any controversy between thg and uni,nor did it reference any pending litigation between the parties.it simply related that the parties had participated in a mediation and,without describing the dispute,asked the court to take jurisdiction of the pending settlement negotiations and mediation and immediately confer such jurisdiction upon the mediator the parties intention was clear to convert the settlement they had reached before a private mediator into a stipulated judgment that could be enforced in the future using the relatively expeditious procedure of section.see weddington productions,flick th,d section was enacted to provide a summary procedure for specifically enforcing a settlement contract without the need for a new lawsuit.but their execution fell short because the petition did not present the superior c
