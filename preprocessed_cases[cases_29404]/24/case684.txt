peters,peters sought a declaratory judgment that it effectively repudiated its agreement with international association of bridge,structural and reinforcing iron workers,local unit union.peters also moved to stay arbitration proceedings initiated by the union before joint arbitration board jab,a body created by the union and associated steel erectors of chicago,illinois associated steel erectors,a bargaining unit,to resolve grievances arising out of their collective bargaining agreement.the district court denied peters requested relief and dismissed the action.for the reasons stated herein,we vacate the district court order.
background 
since,peters has been a signatory to a agreement between the union and associated steel erectors governed by f of the national labor relations act,f nlra or act the agreement establishes rates of pay,wages,hours of employment,fringe benefit contributions and other terms and conditions of employment for union members.
on december,peters executed a compliance agreement with the union,which extended the terms of the existing to expire on may,may.the december,compliance agreement provides in relevant part 
the employer acknowledges the union claim and evidence that the union represents an uncoerced majority of the employer employees in a unit acknowledged and stipulated as appropriate,and therefore and hereby recognizes the union as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining agent for all journeymen and apprentice iron workers now or hereafter employed in the bargaining unit with respect to and for the purpose of establishing rates of pay,hours of employment,fringe benefit contributions and other terms and conditions of employment within the geographical jurisdiction in which the union is authorized to act or does act as such representative 
ex.the compliance agreement also sets forth the following terms for terminating the agreement 
this compliance agreement shall remain in effect and shall be governed by principal agreements entered into in the future and covering future time periods unless and until it has been terminated by either party giving written notice of termination to the other at least four months prior to the termination date of the applicable principal agreement in which event this agreement shall terminate on the last day of the then applicable principal agreement.in the event no such timely notice is given this agreement shall remain in effect until terminated in accordance with its terms.any such notice as hereinabove provided for in this article whether specifying a desire to terminate or to change at the end of the current contract year shall have the effect of terminating this agreement at such time.
on april,peters sent the union a letter purporting to repudiate the agreement,effective immediately.peters asserted that it had not employed any ironworkers since and,during the past two years,had not employed any ironworkers for a period of more than days.joint appendix at.peters also stated that it had no intention of employing any ironworkers in the future.id.peters sought confirmation of this repudiation from the union,stating 
while peters,could assume that this letter effects an end to any and all contractual relationships between peters,and the ironworkers union,we would appreciate a written confirmation of this fact from the union.if we do not receive confirmation of this fact by april,we will have to assume that the ironworkers union continues to claim to represent employees of peters,and therefore,we will be forced to file the appropriate petition with the nlrb challenging any such claims.
peters purported repudiation set into motion a series of actions by both peters and the union.the union initially responded by letter dated april,insisting that the agreement remained in full force because peters failed to submit written notice of termination at least four months prior to may.
the union did not receive a further response from peters.on april,the union filed a grievance and request for arbitration with the jab pursuant to of the agreement.ex.at.the arbitration request advised that there is a dispute between the union and peters sons,as to whether the contractor can now terminate its compliance agreement with iron workers,local.at.the union requested that a hearing be scheduled before the jab as soon as possible and that peters be notified to appear and participate in that hearing.id.
the following day,april,peters filed a representation petition with the regional director of the national labor relations board nlrb or board in chicago pursuant to c of the nlra in response to that petition,the regional director issued notice of a representation hearing for april.peters subsequently withdrew its petition and refiled an identical petition on april.the regional director rescheduled the representation hearing for may.
on april,while the representation petition was pending,peters filed a complaint in federal district court seeking a declaratory judgment that the collective bargaining agreement between associated steel erectors and the union had been repudiated and was no longer in effect with respect to peters.the complaint alleged that through their participation in,and conducting of,a hearing,and because there can be no jab hearing without the existence of a valid and enforceable collective bargaining agreement,associated steel erectors and the jab maintain that there is a collective bargaining agreement in effect between peters,and the iron workers union.compl.peters further alleged 
because the defendants seek to compel the company to arbitration,and because,if the agreement has been properly repudiated,there is no contractual obligation to participate in arbitration,plaintiff,peters,brings this action seeking a declaration that the agreement has been properly and effectively repudiated and is no longer in effect.
on april,peters filed a separate motion in the district court to stay the arbitration proceedings before the jab,arguing that the jab lacked jurisdiction.
on april,following a hearing,the district court denied peters motion to stay the arbitration proceedings and dismissed the action.citing this court decision in nlrb bufco,cir,the district court concluded that peters purported unilateral repudiation of the agreement was a nullity and totally invalid.at.it held that the agreement remained in full force and effect and is in turn governed by the most recent agreement between the associated steel erectors of chicago,illinois and union for the period beginning june,and ending may.id.at.
on may,the day before the rescheduled representation hearing,the nlrb regional director dismissed peters representation petition,finding that further proceedings were not warranted because there are no employees employed by the employer in the bargaining unit at this time,and there is no evidence that there have been employees employed during the relevant eligibility period.at.
on may,peters filed a rule e motion to amend the district court april order,relying in part on the regional director may dismissal of its petition as new evidence not previously available.on may,peters sought review by the board of the dismissal of the representation petition.on may,peters sought leave to file an amended complaint for declaratory judgment in the district court,incorporating the particulars relevant to the plaintiff employment of defendant union bargaining unit members.at.
on june,while its motions were pending in the district court,peters filed an unfair labor practice charge against the union with the nlrb.peters alleged that the union had filed grievances and attempted to enforce a collective bargaining agreement that peters had lawfully repudiated on april,in violation of b a and b of the nlra.
on june,the district court denied peters motion to amend judgment and motion to file an amended complaint.the court concluded that its prior ruling would remain in effect unless and until the board itself holds that the unilateral repudiation is effective in this circumstance.at.
this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
in reviewing a decision to deny declaratory or injunctive relief,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.of maint.way employees union pac,cir.the parties raise only legal issues on appeal.
jurisdiction 
we begin with the threshold question of jurisdiction.despite the concerns expressed by the district court about the existence of a live controversy,both parties argue that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to resolve the dispute that was before it.we agree.
section of the labor management relations act lmra provides 
suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this chapter,or between any such labor organizations,may be brought in any district court of the united states having jurisdiction of the parties,without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.
in international brotherhood of electrical workers,local,this court held that under a any disputes about the meaning or validity of collective bargaining agreements come within the jurisdiction of the federal courts,cir holding that district court had jurisdiction over claim filed by union alleging that employer improperly repudiated collective bargaining agreement between union and association,overruling ndk local of the united food commercial workers int l union,cir.
although the supreme court subsequently held in textron lycoming reciprocating engine div.united automobile workers,d,that s uits for violation of contracts under are not suits that claim a contract is invalid,but suits that claim a contract has been violated,textron does not foreclose jurisdiction in this case.in textron,the union sought a declaratory judgment that its collective bargaining agreement with employer textron was invalid after textron announced that it would subcontract out a substantial volume of work,causing half of the union members to lose their jobs.id.at.the union alleged that textron had fraudulently induced it to sign the agreement by concealing its plans to subcontract work.id.the union did not allege,however,that either it or textron ever violated the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.id.the court concluded because the union complaint alleges no violation of the agreement,neither we nor the federal courts below have subject matter jurisdiction over this case under a of the relations act.id.at.
the supreme court specifically stated,however,that a declaratory judgment plaintiff accused of violating a agreement may ask a court to declare the agreement invalid and emphasized that,in the case before it,the union neither alleges that textron has violated the contract,nor seeks declaratory relief from its own violation.id.at.in this case,by contrast,peters was accused of violating the terms of the collective bargaining agreement by attempting to terminate the collective bargaining relationship without providing proper notice.peters sought declaratory relief from this alleged violation.thus,this is a suit for violation of contracts within the meaning of.moreover,unlike in textron,where the court found that there was no evidence of a concrete dispute between the parties over the contract voidability at the time the suit was filed,id.at,here,there is undoubtedly a ripe dispute between the parties.the district court therefore had jurisdiction to resolve the legal issues and decide whether peters unilateral repudiation was valid,or whether it should allow the case to proceed to arbitration before the jab.we now turn to that question.
unilateral repudiation 
this court has recognized that,generally,a signatory to a f agreement is bound to its terms for the duration of the agreement unless the employees covered by that agreement reject the signatory union in a board conducted election.bufco,at relying on the decision of the board in john deklewa sons,nlrb,enf.sub nom.int l ass of bridge workers,local nlrb,cir.deklewa marked a significant change in the policy of the nlrb.prior to that decision,the board interpreted f as permitting the unilateral repudiation of agreements until the union achieved majority support.id.at.in bufco,we determined that the board had not been precluded by supreme court or seventh circuit precedent from reversing its prior policy,and stated that we must enforce the board deklewa rule if we deem it to be based upon a reasonably defensible construction of the act.id.at.finding it reasonable and consistent with the act,we joined several of our sister circuits in accepting the board deklewa rule.id.
the issue before us now is whether this case falls within a recognized exception to the deklewa rule in situations involving bargaining units of one or no employees peters points to several decisions in which the board articulated this unit rule.in stack electric,nlrb,the board explained 
it is settled that if an employer employs one or fewer unit employees on a permanent basis that the employer,without violating section a of the act,may withdraw recognition from a union,repudiate its contract with the union,or unilaterally change employees terms and conditions of employment without affording a union an opportunity to bargain.
id.at citations omitted.
the board first explained the basis for this rule in foreign car center,nlrb,t he principle of collective bargaining presupposes that there is more than one eligible person who desires to bargain.the act therefore does not empower the board to certify a unit.internal citations omitted,quoted in stack electric,nlrb at.
the board also applied the unit rule in haas garage door,nlrb.in that case,the employer was a member of a association,through which it signed a f agreement effective from through.id.at.at some point during that period,the employer refused to execute the collective bargaining agreement despite explicit requests from the union that it do so.id.the employer also refused to furnish information requested by the union,arguing that it was not bound by the agreement because it had no employees doing unit work.id.the administrative law judge alj found that the employer had violated a and of the act.id.relying on the unit rule,the board reversed the alj decision,stating w e disagree with the judge finding that even if an employer has no employees doing unit work it can not repudiate an f contract.id.at.because the board found no evidence that the employer had more than one employee performing unit work at all material times,it concluded that the employer did not violate section a and by repudiating the contract,by refusing to execute the contract,or by refusing to furnish information to the union.see also searls refrigeration,nlrb,upholding alj conclusion that employer repudiation of a f agreement did not violate nlra because the appropriate unit consisted of no employees for approximately years garman constr,nlrb,relying on unit rule to affirm alj dismissal of allegations that employer violated a and by repudiating a f contract and withdrawing recognition from union.
appellees argue that these nlrb decisions stand for the limited proposition that an employer unilateral repudiation of a collective bargaining agreement applicable to a one or bargaining unit would not be a violation of the employer statutory duty to bargain.according to appellees,these cases do not speak to the continued validity of the collective bargaining agreement itself,or to the employer contractual obligations thereunder.the board decisions do not support appellees argument.while many of its decisions specifically addressed the statutory duty to bargain,the board has not limited the unit rule to excusing an employer from this particular duty.rather,the board decisions explicitly allow an employer,more generally,to repudiate a agreement and discontinue its duties under the agreement where it employs no more than one employee in the relevant unit.see,sunray,nlrb,t he board will not enforce a contract covering a unit.nor will we certify or find appropriate a unit in a representation proceeding.sac constr,nlrb,where employer had a unit consisting of only one employee,it did not violate section a and of the act by discontinuing payments to th
