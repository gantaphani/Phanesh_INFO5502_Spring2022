in august the arbitrator issued an award approximately,including for attorney fees in favor of marcus millichap against woodman and sasson.the arbitrator found woodman liable on the parties agreement and sasson liable as woodman alter ego.woodman claims against marcus millichap were denied.
postarbitration judicial proceedings 
marcus millichap initiated a superior court action pursuant to section,petitioning the court for confirmation of the arbitration award.woodman and sasson filed a response to the petition,as well as their own to vacate the arbitration award on the ground the arbitrator had exceeded her authorized powers and the award could not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision.woodman and sasson argued,because sasson was not a signatory to the parties agreement,which included the agreement to arbitrate,the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction over him.
on december,the trial court denied marcus millichap petition to confirm and granted woodman and sasson to vacate.marcus millichap did not request,and the court order vacating the arbitration award did not include,an order for rehearing the arbitration pursuant to section.on december,woodman and sasson filed a motion to recover attorney fees and costs pursuant to section,which authorizes the court to award costs in postarbitration judicial proceedings.two days later,on december,marcus millichap filed a motion for clarification of the order vacating the arbitration award,requesting the court to confirm the award as to woodman only.
on march,the trial court denied marcus millichap motion for clarification and granted woodman and sasson request for attorney fees and costs,awarding them as the prevailing parties in the judicial proceedings.marcus millichap filed a notice of appeal of the award only no appeal has been taken from the trial court orders vacating the arbitration award or denying the motion for clarification.

contention 
marcus millichap contends the trial court erred as a matter of law in awarding attorney fees and costs to woodman and sasson pursuant to section because the underlying dispute between the parties remains unresolved.
discussion 
governing law 
section provides,the court shall award costs upon any judicial proceeding under this title governing arbitration as provided in chapter commencing with section of this code.section,part of chapter of the code of civil procedure,provides that items recoverable as costs include attorney fees when authorized by contract,subd.a a.the judicial proceedings covered by this provision include petitions to confirm or vacate an arbitration award.
the award of costs pursuant to section,including attorney fees when authorized by contract,is mandatory.corona amherst partners th,d a court must award costs in a judicial proceeding to confirm,correct or vacate an arbitration award.carole ring associates nicastro th,d carole ring the superior court was required to award the prevailing party reasonable attorney fees and costs for postarbitration judicial proceedings,pursuant to the statutory scheme governing arbitration.
in carole ring,supra,th,d,division three of this court considered whether section permitted the award of postarbitration attorney fees and costs to the party prevailing on a claim under a contract that provided for arbitration and authorized attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party even though the arbitrator had directed the parties to bear their own attorney fees and costs.id.at,d.reversing the trial court order denying a motion for award of fees,the court held the determination under section which party,if either,is the prevailing party in postarbitration proceedings is a judicial function distinct from the arbitrator decision to award or not to award fees in the arbitration proceeding itself.id.at,d.
the arbitrator earlier refusal to award attorney fees in the arbitration proceeding was not dispositive on the issue of postarbitration attorney fees.the arbitrator obviously did not,and could not,make a determination with respect to which,if either party,would be the prevailing party in subsequent postarbitration proceedings.for these reasons,the arbitrator refusal to award attorney fees did not dictate a similar result with respect to nicastro request for attorney fees in postarbitration judicial proceedings.because nicastro was the prevailing party as a matter of law,the mandatory language of the contractual attorney fees clause and section entitle nicastro to reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in postarbitration judicial proceedings.carole ring,supra,th at,d.
woodman and sasson were properly awarded fees and costs 
woodman and sasson were the prevailing parties in the postarbitration judicial proceedings 
in the postarbitration judicial proceedings in this case,commenced on august,by marcus millichap after the arbitrator made her award in its favor,the trial court denied marcus millichap petition to confirm and granted woodman and sasson to vacate the award without ordering a rehearing pursuant to section.considering the judicial proceedings initiated by marcus millichap pursuant to section as distinct from the arbitration itself,as did division three in carole ring,woodman and sasson were entirely successful not only did they defeat marcus millichap effort to have the arbitration award confirmed but also they persuaded the trial court to vacate the arbitration award as to both woodman and sasson.as a matter of law,with respect to the postarbitration judicial proceedings,woodman and sasson must be considered the prevailing party within the meaning of section,subdivision a prevailing party includes a defendant or other party against whom a complaint has been filed in whose favor a dismissal is entered,as well as a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.
b.the judicial proceeding initiated by marcus millichap to confirm its arbitration award is final for purposes of an award of fees 
whether or not marcus millichap is correct in asserting it may initiate another arbitration proceeding to determine its right to a commission without an express order for rehearing pursuant to section issue not presented by marcus millichap appeal from the order awarding costs and attorney fees and as to which we express no argument that the judicial proceeding it initiated is not yet final is unpersuasive.section,subdivision c,expressly provides that an order vacating an arbitration award is appealable unless a rehearing in arbitration is ordered.thus,while an order vacating an arbitration award and ordering rehearing is an intermediate ruling,a similar order vacating an award without ordering rehearing is,of necessity,final.long beach iron works,international molders of north america,local d.it is quite obvious that the legislature philosophy and intent in drafting section was that there should be no appellate consideration of intermediate rulings in arbitration disputes if the superior court was of the view that there should be initial or further proceedings in arbitration t he legislature expressly excepted orders vacating awards but directed rehearings in arbitration from a roster of appealable rulings in section.
the trial court belated,march,order of clarification does not alter our conclusion as to the finality for purposes of a cost and fee award of its earlier order vacating the arbitration award without an order for rehearing.the court explanation of its intent that rehearing of the arbitration shall take place between all parties,as emphatic as it may be,is simply a ruling that the absence of an express order for rehearing does not necessarily bar a ruling,as the court itself notes,it had also made on three occasions prior to its march,ruling.indeed,notwithstanding marcus millichap argument to the contrary,the trial court appears to have carefully worded its clarification to avoid suggesting it was attempting to correct nunc pro tunc its december,order to include an order for a rehearing.because no rehearing of the arbitration was ordered by the trial court and marcus millichap did not appeal from the order vacating the arbitration award or,for that matter,from the trial court subsequent denial of its motion for clarification of the order vacating the arbitration award,the trial court decision to vacate the original arbitration award is now final.
green diablo hospital dist.d,upon which marcus millichap relies,does not support a contrary result.in green the court of appeal affirmed an order denying a petition to compel arbitration of disputes arising from an employment contract and a agreement between green and the hospital district.the petition had been filed at least partially in response to a complaint for declaratory relief by a taxpayers group alleging that the termination agreement between green,the hospital district chief executive officer,and the hospital district was void.id.at.affirmance of the order denying green request for arbitration left the taxpayers action for declaratory relief and green breach of contract claim against the hospital district subject to judicial determination of whether or not the agreement is illegal.id.at.
in rejecting the hospital district arguing that the trial court should have awarded it attorney fees following denial of green petition to compel arbitration,the court of appeal held an award of fees would be premature because the claims of the parties remained before the court and subject to judicial determination.t he trial court has not reached the merits of the case the trial court,therefore,correctly concluded that there has been no final determination of the rights of the parties green diablo hospital,supra,d at.because no rehearing of the arbitration was ordered and marcus millichap did not appeal the order vacating the arbitration award in this case,unlike the situation presented by green,no claim of either party remains before the court or otherwise subject to judicial determination the trial court rulings are final.see long beach iron works,international molders of north america,local,supra,d at.
finally,although not raised in its briefs on appeal,marcus millichap suggested at oral argument that,even if woodman and sasson are prevailing parties and entitled to an award of costs under section,they are not entitled to attorney fees under the parties contract until they prevail on the underlying contract claim.the listing agreement,however,authorizes the award of attorney fees i n any litigation,arbitration or other legal proceeding which may arise between any of the parties hereto.this contractual language,like section itself,requires postarbitration judicial proceedings to be considered a discrete legal proceeding for purposes of determining a party right to an award of attorney fees.
marcus millichap motion for sanctions is denied 
all parties agreed to participate in the mediation program administered by the second district court of appeal notice of the conference date and location sent by the clerk of the court specifically advised the parties,in boldface type,it is mandatory that all parties and their counsel as well as any other individual whose presence is necessary to effect a settlement of the case be present at the settlement conference f ailure to either participate in good faith or to attend is likely to result in the imposition of appropriate sanctions.
marcus millichap was represented at the scheduled mediation conference by both outside litigation counsel and the general counsel of marcus millichap real estate investment,who traveled from northern california to attend the session.woodman and sasson were represented only by their outside litigation counsel,who stated he had full authority to settle the issue of attorney fees and costs raised in the instant appeal.neither appellants tony azzi and john walsh nor respondent eli sasson attended the conference.
at the outset of the conference counsel disputed whether they had agreed to attempt to mediate only the attorney fee dispute,the issue presented by marcus millichap appeal woodman and sasson position,or to discuss settlement of both the appeal and the underlying dispute regarding marcus millichap claim to a commission under the listing agreement marcus millichap position.as a result no productive discussions of any sort occurred.
following the fruitless mediation conference,marcus millichap moved for sanctions against woodman and sasson for sasson failure to personally appear at the mediation conference.the motion is supported by a declaration from marcus millichap litigation counsel and related exhibits.woodman and sasson filed an opposition at our request,which likewise includes a declaration from counsel who attended the mediation conference,as well as related exhibits.
because it is impossible for us to determine from the conflicting declarations what,if any,agreement had been reached by counsel to discuss a possible global resolution of the parties disputes,rather than to address the single issue actually raised in this appeal,we deny the motion for sanctions.what is apparent is that both sides to the dispute failed to have all parties to the appeal present at the mediation and,more importantly,that the failure of counsel to communicate with each other clearly and forthrightly about their positions and intentions prior to the mediation conference resulted in a waste of the volunteer mediator valuable time.we expect more.
disposition 
the order awarding attorney fees and costs is affirmed.the stay of proceedings in los angeles superior court case no.is terminated.woodman and sasson are to recover their costs on appeal.
i respectfully dissent from that portion of the opinion holding that the arbitration proceedings in the trial court were final thereby entitling woodman to c
