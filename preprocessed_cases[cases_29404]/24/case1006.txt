discussion 
circuit city arbitration agreement 
circuit city compels all of its employees and job applicants to sign an arbitration agreement requiring arbitration of all legal claims.the circuit city dispute resolution rules and procedures rules and procedures determine the substance and procedures of the arbitration agreement.ingle and circuit city agree that the arbitration agreement ingle signed provided that the rules and procedures governing an arbitration would be those in effect at the time the claim arose.because the rules and procedures were in effect at the time ingle civil rights claims arose,we examine these rules in analyzing whether this arbitration agreement is enforceable.however,our holdings as to substantive unconscionability reside with the discrete provisions we examine,and therefore would likely extend beyond this particular version of the rules and procedures.
ii.the doctrine of unconscionability 
the federal arbitration act faa provides that arbitration agreements generally shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable.but when grounds exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,courts may decline to enforce such agreements.doctor,casarotto,d ferguson countrywide credit,cir.
it is a settled principle of law that arbitration is a matter of contract.united steelworkers of america warrior gulf nav,d.federal law directs courts to place arbitration agreements on equal footing with other contracts.eeoc waffle house,d.arbitration agreements,accordingly,are subject to all defenses to enforcement that apply to contracts generally.see.to evaluate the validity of an arbitration agreement,federal courts should apply ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts.first options of chicago,kaplan,d.ingle was employed in california we therefore evaluate circuit city arbitration agreement under the contract law of that state.circuit city stores,adams,cir adams iii see also ticknor,at applying montana law to determine whether arbitration clause was valid.
because unconscionability is a generally applicable defense to contracts,california courts may refuse to enforce an unconscionable arbitration agreement.see ferguson,at.unconscionability refers to an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party.a m produce fmc,d.see also cal.restatement second of contracts.thus,a contract to arbitrate is unenforceable under the doctrine of unconscionability when there is both a procedural and substantive element of unconscionability.ferguson,at accord armendariz found.health psychcare,cal th,d.significantly,the california supreme court has noted that procedural and substantive unconscionability need not be present in the same degree.id.in armendariz the court held that 
e ssentially a sliding scale is invoked which disregards the regularity of the procedural process of the contract formation,that creates the terms,in proportion to the greater harshness or unreasonableness of the substantive terms themselves.in other words,the more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.
id.at quoting williston on contracts,at ed.other citations omitted.
procedural unconscionability 
to determine whether the arbitration agreement is procedurally unconscionable the court must examine the manner in which the contract was negotiated and the circumstances of the parties at that time.kinney united healthcare,th,d.an inquiry into whether circuit city arbitration agreement involves oppression or surprise is central to that analysis.a contract is oppressive if an inequality of bargaining power between the parties precludes the weaker party from enjoying a meaningful opportunity to negotiate and choose the terms of the contract.stirlen supercuts,th,d,citation omitted.surprise involves the extent to which the supposedly terms of the bargain are hidden in the prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce the disputed terms.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
there is no doubt that circuit city arbitration agreement is oppressive.in adams iii,we held that the arbitration agreement at issue in that case was procedurally unconscionable under california law because 
circuit city,which possesses considerably more bargaining power than nearly all of its employees or applicants,drafted the contract and uses it as its standard arbitration agreement for all of its new employees.the agreement is a prerequisite to employment,and job applicants are not permitted to modify the agreement must take the contract or leave it.
adams iii,at.procedurally,there is absolutely no difference between the version of the arbitration agreement we evaluated in adams iii and the version we review in this case.because of the stark inequality of bargaining power between ingle and circuit city,we conclude that circuit city arbitration agreement is also procedurally oppressive.see ferguson,at armendariz,cal th at,d,at see also stirlen,th at,d finding procedural unconscionability when an arbitration clause was part of a contract of adhesion in which the employee was presented with an employment contract on a take it or leave it basis.
circuit city argues that because ingle had sufficient consider the terms of the arbitration agreement,the court should not find this agreement procedurally unconscionable.we disagree.the amount of time ingle had to consider the contract is irrelevant.we follow the reasoning in szetela discover bank,th,d,in which the california court of appeal held that the availability of other options does not bear on whether a contract is procedurally unconscionable.id.at,d.rather,when a party who enjoys greater bargaining power than another party presents the weaker party with a contract without a meaningful opportunity to negotiate,oppression and,therefore,procedural unconscionability,are present.ferguson,at szetela,th at,d.
circuit city contended at oral argument that our recent decisions in circuit city stores,najd,cir,and circuit city stores,ahmed,cir,should bear on our analysis regarding procedural unconscionability.however,we clearly stated that the arbitration agreements in those cases were not procedurally unconscionable only because najd and ahmed each had a meaningful opportunity to opt out of the arbitration program.see najd,at ahmed,at.to invoke the holdings in ahmed and najd,circuit city must show that it provided ingle a meaningful opportunity to decline to enter into the arbitration agreement ingle had no such opportunity,and therefore our holding in adams iii controls in this decision.
the california supreme court decision in armendariz is also instructive in this case.the armendariz court held that it is procedurally unconscionable to require employees,as a condition of employment,to waive their right to seek redress of grievances in a judicial forum.see armendariz,cal th at,d,at.circuit city arbitration agreement similarly requires,as a condition of employment,that employees waive their right to bring future claims in court.see ferguson,at.ingle had no meaningful opportunity to opt out of the arbitration agreement,nor did she have any power to negotiate the terms of the agreement.therefore,because circuit city presented the arbitration agreement to ingle on an basis,we conclude that the agreement is procedurally unconscionable.
substantive unconscionability 
substantive unconscionability centers on the terms of the agreement and whether those terms are so as to shock the conscience.kinney,th at,d internal quotation marks omitted.in evaluating the substance of a contract,courts must analyze the contract as of the time it was made.a m produce,d at.
several substantive terms of circuit city arbitration agreement are.the provisions concerning coverage of claims,the statute of limitations,the prohibition of class actions,the filing fee,remedies,and circuit city unilateral power to modify or terminate the arbitration agreement all operate to benefit the employer inordinately at the employee expense.because these provisions grossly favor circuit city,we conclude that,under california law,these terms are substantively unconscionable,and address each term in turn.
claims subject to arbitration 
the coverage we found objectionable in adams iii remains in the version of the arbitration agreement we evaluate in this case see adams iii,at.circuit city arbitration agreement applies only to any and all legal disputes,controversies or claims of an associate,thereby limiting its coverage to claims brought by employees.by the terms of this agreement,circuit city does not agree to submit to arbitration claims it might hypothetically bring against employees.without a reasonable justification for such a glaring disparity based on business realities,it is unfairly for an employer with superior bargaining power to impose arbitration on the employee as plaintiff but not to accept such limitations when it seeks to prosecute a claim against the employee.armendariz,cal th at,d,at see cal.b.therefore,as we held in adams iii,this unjustified deprives the arbitration agreement of the modicum of bilaterality that the california supreme court requires for contracts to be enforceable under california law.adams iii,at armendariz,cal th at,d,at.
this case presents a broad concern with respect to arbitration agreements between employers and employees.circuit city argues that the arbitration agreement subjects circuit city to the same terms that apply to its employees.but this argument is exceedingly disingenuous,because the agreement is anyway.because the possibility that circuit city would initiate an action against one of its employees is so remote,the lucre of the arbitration agreement flows one way the employee relinquishes rights while the employer generally reaps the benefits of arbitrating its employment disputes 
the only claims realistically affected by an arbitration agreement between an employer and an employee are those claims employees bring against their employers by essentially covering only claims that employees would likely bring against circuit city,this arbitration agreement coverage would be substantively even without the express limitation to claims brought by employees 
thus,we conclude that,under california law,a contract to arbitrate between an employer and an employee,such as the one we evaluate in this case,raises a rebuttable presumption of substantive unconscionability.unless the employer can demonstrate that the effect of a contract to arbitrate is is required under california respect to a particular employee,courts should presume such contracts substantively unconscionable see ferguson,at adams iii,at armendariz,cal th at,d,stirlen,th at,d.
circuit city arbitration agreement expressly limits its scope to claims brought by employees,which alone renders it substantively unconscionable.even if the limitation to claims brought by employees were not explicit,an arbitration agreement between an employer and an employee ostensibly binds to arbitration only actions.circuit city does not furnish any evidence that would indicate that the coverage of the arbitration agreement is mutual.therefore,we conclude that the coverage of the arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable 
statute of limitations 
the circuit city arbitration agreement states that the form by which an employee requests arbitration 
shall be submitted not later than one year after the date on which the associate knew,or through reasonable diligence should have known,of the facts giving rise to the associate claim s.the failure of an associate to initiate an arbitration within the time limit shall constitute a waiver with respect to that dispute relative to that associate.
we have already expressly criticized circuit city statute of limitations provision,adams iii,at,finding that circuit city strict one year statute of limitations on arbitrating claims would deprive associates of the benefit of the continuing violation doctrine available in feha suits.id.this rule is identical to the one we held unconscionable in adams iii.id.while circuit city insulates itself from potential damages,an employee foregoes the possibility of relief under the continuing violations doctrine.therefore,because the benefit of this provision flows only to circuit city,we conclude that the statute of limitations provision is substantively unconscionable.
prohibition of class actions 
circuit city arbitration agreement directs arbitrators not to consolidate claims of different employees into one proceeding and generally prohibits the arbitrator from hearing an arbitration as a class action.we find that this bar on arbitration is patently,and conclude that it is substantively unconscionable.
the ability to pursue legal claims in a class proceeding has firm roots in both the federal and california legal systems.the united states supreme court has held that the class suit was an invention of equity to enable it to proceed to a decree in suits where the number of those interested in the subject of the litigation is so great that their joinder as parties in conformity to the usual rules of procedure is impracticable.hansberry lee.the california class action statute rests upon considerations of necessity and paramount convenience,and was adopted to prevent a failure of justice.weaver pasadena tournament of roses ass n,cal d,see cal.civ.proc.
in szetela,the california court of appeal severed a provision barring arbitration from a credit card company arbitration agreement.szetela,th at,d.in the court view,by barring class arbitration in a contract of its own drafting,the defendant sought to create for itself virtual immunity from class or representative actions despite their potential merit,while suffering no similar detriment to its own rights.id.at,d.the szetela court found the bar on class arbitration harsh and unfair to those who could benefit from proceeding as a class and offensive to the policies underlying class actions,such as promoting judicial economy and streamlin ing the litigation process in appropriate cases.id.at,d the court reasoned that the 
manifest of the no class action provision at issue here is blindingly obvious.
although styled as a mutual prohibition on representative or class actions,it is difficult to envision the circumstances under which the provision might negatively impact discover,because credit card companies typically do not sue their customers in class action lawsuits.
szetela,th at,d 
the szetela court rejected discover bank bar on proceedings as substantively unconscionable because the actual effect of the provision was to deny a procedural benefit only its customers would employ.in the context of an arbitration agreement between an employer and an employee,circuit city adopts just such a provision.we can not conceive of any circumstances under which an employer would bring a class proceeding against an employee circuit city,through its bar on arbitration,seeks to insulate itself from class proceedings while conferring no corresponding benefit to its employees in return.this provision proscribing an employee ability to initiate arbitration operates solely to the advantage of circuit city.therefore,because circuit city prohibition of class action proceedings in its arbitral forum is manifestly and shockingly,it is substantively unconscionable 
filing fee 
under the terms of the arbitration agreement,to initiate a complaint against circuit city,an employee must submit an arbitration request form with a required filing fee of made payable with a cashier check or money order to circuit city stores.under california law,when an employer imposes mandatory arbitration as a condition of employment,the arbitration agreement or arbitration process can not generally require the employee to bear any type of expense that the employee would not be required to bear if he or she were free to bring the action in court.armendariz,cal th at,d,emphasis in original.
though denominated a filing fee,the must pay the required dollars here directly to circuit city,rather than to the arbitration service circuit city identifies in the arbitration agreement.it thus appears that the employee is required to pay circuit city for the privilege of bringing a complaint.while a true filing fee might be appropriate under armendariz,the fee required by circuit city is not the type of expense that the employee would be required to bear in federal court,and is therefore inappropriate under armendariz.moreover,by requiring employees to pay the fee to the very entity against which they seek redress,circuit city may very well deter employees from initiating complaints.
the dollar fee poses an additional problem.in federal court,plaintiffs in all types of cases may be exempt from paying court fees upon a showing of indigence.see a.circuit city arbitration agreement,however,makes no similar provision for waiver of the filing fee or other fees and costs of arbitration.without such a provision for waiver in cases of indigence,employees in that category might well find it prohibitively expensive to pay dollars to file a complaint.for these reasons,the arbitration agreement fee provision is manifestly.
we therefore find the fee provision substantively unconscionable.
we have previously rejected the circuit city arbitration agreement provision.adams iii,at.in adams iii,we held that circuit city fee allocation scheme alone would render an arbitration agreement unenforceable.id.although in that case we evaluated an older version of the arbitration agreement,the version we review here contains the same provision that each party shall pay of the costs of arbitration following the issuance of the arbitration award.moreover,the arbitration agreement provides that the arbitrator may require the associate to pay circuit city share of the costs of arbitration and incidental costs should circuit city prevail at arbitration.under circuit city arbitration agreement,even an employee who has succeeded on her claim against circuit city could be held liable for her share of the costs of the arbitration,because the arbitrator authority to require circuit city to pay in such circumstances is discretionary.furthermore,the circuit city arbitration agreement provides that if an employee does not succeed on her claim,the arbitrator has the discretion to charge the employee for circuit city share of the arbitrator services.
by itself,the fact that an employee could be held liable for circuit city share of the arbitration costs should she fail to vindicate claims renders this provision substantively unconscionable combined with the fact that circuit city scheme would sanction charging even a successful litigant for her share of arbitration costs,this scheme blatantly offends basic principles of fairness.see ting,at armendariz,cal th at,d,at.because circuit city provision is harsh and unfair to employees seeking to arbitrate legal claims we conclude that it is substantively unconscionable 
in adams iii,we criticized the limitations on available remedies in circuit city arbitration agreement the arbitration agreement we evaluate in this case,as in adams iii,similarly fails to provide for all the types of relief that would otherwise be available in court.adams iii,at see also paladino avnet computer,cir holding unenforceable an arbitration agreement that limited remedies otherwise available in court.
the circuit city arbitration agreement delimits what relief is available to employees who succeed in arbitration claims against circuit city.the agreement grants the arbitrator the discretion to award injunctive relief,including reinstatement one year of full or partial back pay,subject to reductions by interim earnings or public or private benefits received two years of front pay compensatory damages in accordance with applicable law and punitive damages up to or the equivalent of a claimant monetary award back pay plus front pay,whichever is greater.this provision is identical to the one we held substantively unconscionable in adams iii.see adams iii,at accord morrison,at.because the remedies limitation improperly proscribes available statutory remedies we again conclude that it is substantively unconscionable.
unilateral 
circuit city arbitration agreement provides that circuit city may alter or terminate the agreement and these dispute resolution rules and procedures on december of any year upon giving calendar days written notice to associates.circuit city,then,may modify or terminate any and all dispute resolution agreements with its employees unilaterally.notably,the arbitration agreement affords no such power to employees.the united states supreme court has held that arbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.united steelworkers of america warrior gulf nav,d see also mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,d confirming that arbitration under the faa is a matter of consent,not coercion.although the agreement requires circuit city to provide exiguous to its employees of termination or any modification,such notice is trivial when there is no meaningful opportunity to negotiate the terms of the agreement.by granting itself the sole authority to amend or terminate the arbitration agreement,circuit city proscribes an employee ability to consider and negotiate the terms of her contract.compounded by the fact that this contract is adhesive in the first instance,this provision embeds its adhesiveness by allowing only circuit city to modify or terminate the terms of the agreement therefore,we conclude that the provision affording circuit city the unilateral power to terminate or modify the contract is substantively unconscionable 
california law grants courts the discretion either to sever an unconscionable provision or refuse to enforce the contract in its entirety.adams iii,at cal.a.in exercising this discretion,courts look to whether the central purpose of the contract is tainted with illegality or the illegality is collateral to its main purpose.adams iii,at quoting armendariz,cal th at,d,at.even though the arbitration agreement is a revised version of the agreement we held unconscionable in adams iii,it is nonetheless permeated with objectionable provisions.while many of the terms of circuit city arbitra
