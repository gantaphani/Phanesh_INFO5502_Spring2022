appellant triplefine international corporation triplefine appeals from an order of the district court for the southern district of new york lawrence mckenna,judge dated october,enjoining it from claiming as contract damages in arbitration those attorneys fees and costs incurred in opposing motions to stay arbitration made by appellees stone webster,stone webster,its affiliate,stone webster asia,s w asia,and their parent company,the shaw group shaw,in the state and federal courts.triplefine submits that the injunction should be vacated because the district court erred in holding that the arbitrability of triplefine claim for fees and costs was an issue for the court rather than the arbitrator,and concluding that the claim was outside the scope of the arbitration agreement.stone webster,s w asia,and shaw from the district court order dated april,staying the injunction against triplefine pending resolution of this appeal or an arbitral award on the fee claim.
because the arbitration agreement at issue in this case provides for all disputes between the parties to be referred to the international chamber of commerce icc,and because the rules of that organization expressly provide for the international court of arbitration ica to resolve in the first instance any disputes about its own jurisdiction,we conclude that the arbitrability of triplefine contract claim for attorneys fees and costs was a question for the arbitrator rather than the court.accordingly,we vacate the district court injunction.
background 
the issue on appeal concerns one aspect of a complex commercial dispute that has presented the district court with a host of motions,and motions for reconsideration over many months.we discuss only those facts necessary to place our decision in context.
a.the triplefine agreement with stone webster international 
triplefine is a taiwan corporation that on november,entered into a contract the representation agreement with stone webster international corporation stone webster international,a delaware corporation,to assist with the latter business projects in taiwan,notably,the construction of a nuclear power plant for the taiwan power company.pursuant to section iii,paragraph,of the representation agreement,the parties agreed to submit any disputes concerning or arising out of their contract to the icc for arbitration.
on june,with the taiwan plant only partially completed,stone webster international filed for federal bankruptcy protection in the district of delaware.its assets and liabilities were acquired at auction in,by a louisiana corporation,shaw,which in turn arranged for their formal assumption by shaw newly created subsidiary,stone webster.in connection with this acquisition,and pursuant to,stone webster international rejected its contract with taiwan power,and a new contract to complete the power plant was entered into by another shaw subsidiary,s w asia.
soon thereafter,on july,stone webster international advised triplefine that it was cancelling the representation agreement,which in turn prompted triplefine to file a bankruptcy claim against stone webster international for approximately million.later that same year,triplefine attempted to garnish stone webster international assets in taiwan,but the bankrupt corporation persuaded a taiwan tribunal that triplefine was first obligated to arbitrate the parties dispute pursuant to the representation agreement.
triplefine files for arbitration 
on april,triplefine filed a request for arbitration with the icc,naming as respondents not only stone webster international,but also shaw,stone webster,and s w asia.before filing an answer to the arbitration notice,shaw,stone webster,and s w asia,on may,petitioned the new york supreme court to stay the arbitration.shaw and s w asia asserted that they were not bound by the representation agreement,and stone webster submitted that it should not be required to arbitrate a claim then pending in the bankruptcy court.triplefine promptly removed the action to the united states district court for the southern district of new york.
c.the district court decisions 
the august,order denying a stay of arbitration between triplefine and stone webster 
after reviewing extensive written submissions and hearing argument,the district court,in an unpublished memorandum and order dated august,denied stone webster motion to stay arbitration with triplefine.shaw group,triplefine int l,civ,wl filed.relying on our decision in,american arbitration ass n,cir discussing theories on which can be bound to arbitration agreements,the court concluded that stone webster,by assuming the assets of stone webster international,had obligated itself to comply with the arbitration provision of the representation agreement regarding any dispute over monies due triplefine on the taiwan power plant project.further,because stone webster was not itself a bankrupt entity,the court declined to stay icc arbitration pending the outcome of stone webster international bankruptcy proceedings.on the other hand,because the district court found no evidence that shaw or s w asia had assumed or directly benefitted from the representation agreement,it granted these parties motion to stay arbitration with triplefine.
on this appeal,the parties challenge none of these rulings instead,they focus on ensuing events and orders.
the october,order enjoining triplefine from pursuing an arbitration claim for attorneys fees and costs 
on august,triplefine amended its icc arbitration request to charge stone webster with breaching the representation agreement by pursuing a court stay of arbitration.it sought damages in an amount equal to its attorneys fees and costs in opposing the stay motions.
stone webster,shaw,and s w asia moved to enjoin triplefine from pursuing its amended arbitration claim.in an unpublished memorandum and order dated october,the district court granted appellees motion.see shaw group,triplefine int l,civ,wl filed.preliminarily,it found that the arbitrability of triplefine claim for fees and costs was a question for the court since the parties had not expressly committed the issue to the arbitrator in their representation agreement.id.at.the court then concluded that triplefine claim was not arbitrable because it did not concern or arise out of the agreement containing the arbitration clause,but rather,it concern ed and ar ose out of separate,if related,court proceedings.id.
the april,order staying the october,injunction 
on reconsideration,the district court refused to vacate its injunction,but granted triplefine request for a stay until this appeal was decided or an arbitral award was entered,whichever occurred earlier.shaw group triplefine int l,civ,wl,at filed.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo the district court conclusion that it rather than an arbitrator should decide the arbitrability of triplefine claim for attorneys fees and costs.see bell cendant,cir and cases cited therein.
arbitrability 
the arbitration clause at issue in this case is found at section iii,paragraph,of the parties representation agreement,which provides as follows 
all disputes between you triplefine and us stone webster concerning or arising out of this agreement shall be referred to arbitration to the international chamber of commerce,new york,new york,in accordance with the rules and procedures of international arbitration.this agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of new york.
because this provision is part of a contract affecting interstate and international commerce,it is governed by the federal arbitration act faa.see,terminix companies dobson,d moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d painewebber bybyk,cir.pursuant to the faa,the role of courts is limited to determining two issues i whether a valid agreement or obligation to arbitrate exists,and ii whether one party to the agreement has failed,neglected or refused to arbitrate.painewebber bybyk,at.
in addressing these issues,courts are mindful that arbitration is a matter of contract,at t technologies,communications workers of america,d,and that parties can not be compelled to ar
