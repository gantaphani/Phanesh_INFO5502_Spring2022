introduction 
the question in this case is whether an arbitration provision in an employee handbook is legally enforceable.the employee handbook containing the arbitration provision included a welcome letter as the first page,which stated,t his handbook is not intended to be a contract express or implied,nor is it intended to otherwise create any legally enforceable obligations on the part of the company or its employees.the employee signed a form acknowledging she had received the handbook,which mentioned the arbitration provision as one of the policies,practices,and procedures of the company.the acknowledgement form did not state that the employee agreed to the arbitration provision,and expressly recognized that the employee had not read the handbook at the time she signed the form.under these circumstances,we find that the arbitration provision in the employee handbook did not create an enforceable agreement to arbitrate.we therefore affirm the trial court denial of the employer petition to compel arbitration.

welcome aboard 
we will refer to this page of the employee handbook as the welcome letter.
a section titled agreement to arbitrate spanned pages and of the employee handbook.unlike the rest of the employee handbook,this section was printed in all capital letters,and it was written in the first person from the employee perspective.the section began,i further agree and acknowledge that the company and i will utilize binding arbitration to resolve all disputes that may arise out of the employment context.both the company and i agree that any claim,dispute,controversy that either i may have against the company or the company may have against me shall be submitted to and determined exclusively by binding arbitration under the federal arbitration act the section discussed the scope of disputes under the agreement,the qualifications for an arbitrator,and other procedural issues relating to arbitration.it continued,i understand and agree to this binding arbitration provision,and both i and the company give up our right to trial by jury of any claim i or the company may have against each other.
the handbook then explained employment basics such as the company policy,the attendance policy,the dress code,and payroll.the last two pages of the page employee handbook consisted of identical copies of a policy acknowledgement,one labeled as the employer copy,and one labeled as the employee copy.the policy acknowledgement stated 
this handbook is designed to provide information to employees of sand sea,shore hotel regarding various policies,practices and procedures that apply to them including our arbitration agreement.shore hotel and its employees acknowledge that their relationship is at will and that either party can terminate that relationship at any time for any reason.shore hotel reserves the right to modify,alter or eliminate any and all of the policies and procedures set forth herein at any time,for any reason,with or without notice.neither this manual nor its contents constitute,in whole or in part,either an express or implied contract of employment with shore hotel or any employee.emphasis added.
while this handbook is not intended to state all of the conditions of employment and all of the principles which help to guide our people in the performance of their duties,it will give you general information in regard to certain policies and benefits related to your employment.

esparza signed the policy acknowledgement on november,her first day of work.esparza employment with shore hotel ended on august.on july,esparza filed a complaint against shore hotel she later added steve farzam,identified as the owner of the hotel,as a defendant.in her first amended complaint,which was the operative complaint below,esparza alleged causes of action for sexual harassment,sex discrimination,wrongful termination,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
on july,more than a year after esparza first filed her complaint,defendants filed a petition to compel arbitration.defendants argued that esparza claims arose from her employment at shore hotel,and because plaintiff signed her assent to a conspicuous and unambiguous agreement to arbitrate claims of the very type at issue here,arbitration is mandatory.defendants acknowledged that both parties had served discovery requests,and defendants demurrer to the first amended complaint was pending before the court.with their motion,defendants submitted the entire employee handbook,including the welcome letter and the policy agreement signed by esparza.
esparza opposed defendants petition to compel arbitration.she argued,esparza did not assent or agree to arbitration esparza simply acknowledged that she received shore hotel employee handbook,and she also acknowledged that she was to have read the employee handbook one week after receiving it.esparza also argued that the arbitration provision was procedurally and substantively unconscionable,and that defendants forfeited their right to demand arbitration by engaging in litigation for a year before seeking to enforce the arbitration provision.
in their reply,defendants argued that esparza freely agreed to arbitrate all disputes arising from her employment.they argued that the policy acknowledgment esparza signed expressly incorporated the employment terms and conditions of employment sic set forth in the preceding pages.because esparza had a week to review the handbook,defendants argued,she had the opportunity to accept employment subject to the handbook terms,or to seek employment elsewhere.defendants also argued that the terms of the employment agreement were not unconscionable,and that defendants participation in the very early stages of litigation should not be deemed a forfeiture of their right to arbitrate.
the trial court denied defendants petition.it held,in full,defendants motion to compel arbitration is denied.there is no agreement to arbitrate.the policy acknowledgement signed by plaintiff does not impose an obligation to arbitrate nor is the arbitration provision in the handbook incorporated by reference.to the contrary,the acknowledgement states that the handbook is not an employment agreement.
defendants timely appealed.
