ifg network securities,ifg appeals the district court september,order compelling arbitration of its dispute with rex king,now deceased,and rua king king.on appeal,ifg argues that the district court erred by finding king entitled to arbitration under the national association of securities dealers nasd code of arbitration procedure code and by refusing to conduct an evidentiary hearing to resolve alleged fact issues.we hold,generally,that the code is a written agreement binding ifg to arbitrate and,specifically,that the instant dispute is between a member ifg and a customer king and arises in connection with that member business,thereby satisfying the code enumerated requirements we,consequently,affirm the district court order compelling arbitration.
background 
at the time ifg filed its complaint,it was a member of the nasd.following the advice of anthony micciche micciche,a registered representative of ifg,king and her late husband entered into a trust agreement with intrados,intrados,a panamanian company.on may,king tendered two checks totaling to intrados.intrados,in turn,invested that money in evergreen securities,evergreen.evergreen now is bankrupt and king has lost her entire investment.in connection with his association with evergreen,micciche pled guilty to the crime of selling unregistered securities.
according to king,she relied,at least in part,on micciche affiliation with ifg in making the investments at issue.in support of that reliance,king submitted to the district court a copy of an ifg business card which micciche allegedly provided her in the course of their business dealings.on its face,the business card indicates that micciche is affiliated with ifg.micciche countered i did not provide king with a business card or correspond with king on letterhead referring to ifg i did not provide king with any documents referring to ifg or indicating that ifg was involved with her offshore trust,its trustee or the evergreen security investment the trustee made in their trust.micciche never reported his activities involving king,intrados,or evergreen to ifg,ifg did not approve of the sale of evergreen by its representatives,ifg does not have any record of the purchase of this investment by or for king,king never opened an account with ifg,king does not have any written contract with ifg,and ifg did not receive or disburse funds for this transaction.
on september,king initiated an arbitration proceeding against ifg,claiming that it violated federal and state securities laws,breached a contract,engaged in fraud,negligence,and gross negligence,and breached a fiduciary duty.king substantive claim,in essence,is that ifg failed to supervise micciche,contrary to its obligations,resulting in her losses through the failed evergreen investment.although king did not have a contract with ifg,she demanded arbitration under rules c and a of the code.in response,on january,ifg filed this action against king demanding a declaratory judgment that arbitrability is an issue for judicial determination,that the parties have no valid agreement to arbitrate,that micciche had no authority to act on ifg behalf with respect to evergreen,and that ifg did not violate the federal securities laws.ifg complaint also seeks an injunction against the arbitration proceedings.king,in response,filed a motion to compel arbitration under the faa.
a magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny both ifg injunction request and king motion to compel arbitration because there is disputed evidence on the question of whether micciche told king that he was affiliated with ifg,or gave her other indicia of his affiliation with ifg both parties objected.on september,the district court refused to hold an evidentiary hearing or trial and compelled arbitration,holding that a customer direct dealings with an associated person of a n nasd member are sufficient to compel a n nasd member into arbitration and that king claim has a sufficient nexus to ifg business activities so as to entitle king to arbitration in conformance with the nasd code of arbitration procedure.the arbitration panel held a hearing and found in favor of king.
ifg appealed to this court the district court september,order compelling arbitration.
ii.jurisdiction 
ifg appeal is timely,this court has appellate jurisdiction,and the federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction.see also household bank jfs group,cir a federal district court has jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action if,as here,a plaintiff complaint alleges facts demonstrating the defendant could file a coercive action arising under federal law.
iii.standard of review 
this court reviews de novo questions of law,such as a district court interpretation of an agreement to arbitrate and whether it binds the parties to arbitrate,but accepts the district court findings of fact that are not clearly erroneous.first options of chicago,kaplan,d.
iv.analysis 
the federal arbitration act,preliminarily,only applies if the parties agreed to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration.a rbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.this axiom recognizes the fact that arbitrators derive their authority to resolve disputes only because the parties have agreed in advance to submit such grievances to arbitration,communications workers of,d citations and quotation marks omitted.although there is no direct written agreement to arbitrate between ifg and king,the code serves as a sufficient written agreement to arbitrate,binding its members to arbitrate a variety of claims with claimants.see kidder,peabody zinsmeyer trusts,cir.
to determine whether ifg written agreement to arbitrate governs its dispute with king,the court must interpret the code as it would a contract under the applicable state law,perry thomas,d,giving effect as it does when interpreting any contract to the parties intent expressed by the ordinary meaning of the language they used.beans chohonis,so d,interfirst fed.sav.bank burke,so d.but,unlike other contracts,any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.

customer disputes 
king dispute with ifg is one between a customer and a member.rule c only applies to disputes between or among members or associated persons and public customers,or others and rule a only applies to disputes between a customer and a member associated person.preliminarily,whether king is an ifg customer,as defined by the code,is a legal question of contract interpretation for the court,see aetna cas.sur.warren,div.of ashland oil,so d,and,under the circumstance at bar,the court does not require an evidentiary hearing because the underlying factual circumstances are undisputed the parties agree that king was a customer of micciche and that micciche was a person associated with ifg.the instant matter is distinguishable from bensadoun,cir,where t
