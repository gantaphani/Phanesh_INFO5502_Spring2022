this case invites us to fit a complex set of corporate pegs into a series of unfamiliar holes drilled by international conventions and federal statutes.but the pegs are square,the holes are round,and the fit is inexact.given the facts of this case,the obvious bar to arbitrability is the abecedarian tenet that a party can not be forced to arbitrate if it has not agreed to do so.the defendants advance several theories designed to circumvent this tenet.after answering a question of first impression in this circuit as to what legal standard controls in cases brought under chapter of the federal arbitration act faa,we examine these theories.in the end,we discern no sufficient legal basis for compelling arbitration here.consequently,we uphold the order entered below.
background 
we divide our discussion of the relevant background into three segments.except as otherwise indicated,the facts are not disputed.
a.the cast of characters.
intergen is an energy company based in the netherlands.intergen finances and develops electric power generation facilities throughout the world.during the summer and fall of,intergen launched the rocksavage power project,located in the united kingdom.in its preliminary workup,intergen entertained competitive bids for turbines.after consulting with its technical services advisor and corporate cousin bechtel power corporation,intergen settled on gas turbines manufactured by alstom power.one persuasive attribute of the successful bid,intergen alleges,was the manufacturer pledge to vet the technology at a special testing facility in birr,switzerland.shortly after choosing the gas turbines for the rocksavage plant,intergen decided to go forward with another electronic power generation,also located in the opted to use the same turbines there.
both the rocksavage and coryton developments were encased in individual cayman island corporations,namely,rocksavage power company rpc and coryton energy company cec.both corporations were beneficially owned by another cayman islands corporation,international generating company a wholly owned subsidiary of intergen in exchange for developing the projects,making key design decisions such as the selection of the turbines,and infusing capital,intergen received an equity stake in each project.
bechtel power also has numerous corporate relatives.the patriarch is bechtel group,and bechtel power,bechtel limited,and bechtel enterprises energy one of intergen parent companies are all part of the family.the specific nature of the ties among the bechtel entities need not concern us.what does matter is that bechtel power had an ongoing relationship as intergen technical services advisor during construction and development of the rocksavage and coryton projects.another bechtel into a separate contract with rpc to act as the engineering,procurement,and construction epc contractor.pursuant to that contract,bechtel limited negotiated and signed an agreement to purchase turbines and related equipment from an indirectly owned subsidiary of alstom power,namely,alstom power generation apg.
on june,some five months after bechtel limited and apg executed the rocksavage purchase order rpc and apg entered into a services agreement through which apg would maintain the turbines,and a support agreement in which apg promised to deliver certain technology upgrades and risk protection.cec and apg entered into a similar support agreement on the same date that bechtel limited and apg signed the coryton purchase order june.each of these five two purchase orders,the services agreement,and the two support liquidated damages provisions and specified that english law would govern disputes arising thereunder.each also contained clauses providing for mandatory arbitration.
the arbitration clauses in the two purchase orders are identical in terms,each clause applies to a ny and all controversies,disputes or claims between buyer and seller arising out of or in any way relating to this agreement,and requires that any dispute or difference arising out of or in connection with this agreement,including any question regarding its existence,validity or termination,shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the london court of international arbitration.the purchase orders define buyer as the bechtel entity shown in the purchase order agreement form seller as the party who has been awarded the agreement and agreement as meaning the purchase order itself.the services and support agreements contain similarly worded arbitration provisions.
b.the underlying dispute.
in,problems relating to the turbines started to surface.intergen alleges that manufacturing and design defects in the turbines caused and continue to cause extensive outages that have prevented the rocksavage facility from operating at full capacity.intergen further alleges that the turbines commissioned for the coryton facility which is not yet in commercial operation are similarly defective.
over time,this dissatisfaction led to litigation.on july,intergen brought suit in a massachusetts state court.it named as defendants alstom power,apg formerly known as abb power generation,alstom power uk holdings an alstom subsidiary that owns apg,and eric grina,a massachusetts resident who allegedly acted as alstom power agent for many of the relevant negotiations 
the complaint alleged in substance that intergen relied on alstom power misrepresentations when choosing turbines for the rocksavage and coryton projects that this selection was contingent upon the manufacturer assurances that the turbines would be adequately tested before their installation on site that the manufacturer made other,related representations to intergen that the alstom interests neither intended to the turbines at birr nor to fulfill their other representations that intergen invested substantial amounts of capital in the two projects in reliance on the manufacturer knowingly false representations that the turbines failed miserably and that intergen suffered economic losses as a result.the complaint channeled these allegations into six causes of action intentional deceit,negligent deceit,unfair trade practices,promissory estoppel,tortious interference with advantageous relations,and quantum meruit.the complaint neither sought to recover for breach of contract nor to enforce any contractual right.
travel of the case.
on october,the defendants removed the action to the federal district court.they posited that the arbitration provisions in the purchase orders and the services and support agreements bound intergen and that these provisions fell within the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards the new york convention,june.because chapter of the faa implements the new york convention,the defendants were able to predicate removal of the action to the federal court on allowing removal of any action or proceeding pending in a state court that relates to an arbitration agreement or award falling under the convention.on october,the defendants moved to compel arbitration,see id,and to stay proceedings pending completion of the anticipated arbitration.intergen opposed these motions,noting that it had neither signed any of the underlying contracts nor agreed to arbitrate the claims asserted in its complaint.for essentially the same reasons,it asked that the case be returned to the state court.
on december,the district court addressed the pending motions at a status conference.remarking the sparseness of the record,the court adjudged all the pending motions premature and denied them without prejudice.it simultaneously ordered the parties to conduct discovery limited to the questions of arbitrability and personal jurisdiction.the parties complied,and a contentious period of pretrial discovery ensued.
on july,intergen filed an amended complaint as of right.see.a.the amended complaint discarded the quantum meruit claim.more significantly,it revised the roster of parties in such a way that no signatory to any agreement that contained an arbitration clause remained as a party intergen was the sole plaintiff and alstom power,alstom switzerland limited,and grina were the sole defendants.for ease in reference,we denominate the three remaining defendants,collectively,as alstom.
in short order,intergen renewed its motion to remand the case to the state court and alstom renewed its motion to force arbitration.on october,the district court,ruling ore sponte,denied intergen motion to remand.the following week,the court issued a rescript in which it denied alstom motion.the court rested its ruling on the premise that,under the constitution,it lacked authority to compel proceedings in london.intergen grina,wl,at,unpublished.the court reasoned that because the motion contemplated an arbitration to be held abroad,the court ha d available to it no means of enforcement,and,thus,was without authority to proceed.id.at.
a party has the right to appeal immediately from an order denying a motion to compel arbitration.see a c.availing itself of this option,alstom filed a timely interlocutory appeal.in addressing that appeal,we first memorialize the applicable standard of review then explain why we depart from the district court reasoning and,finally,examine afresh the applicability of the various arbitration clauses.
ii.standard of review 
the baseline rule is that abstract questions as to whether particular disputes do or do not come within the four corners of an expressly limited arbitration provision are legal in nature.paul revere variable annuity ins.kirschhofer,cir.because this case raises questions of that genre,we review the district court refusal to compel arbitration de novo.id.at.we are not wedded to the lower court rationale,but,rather,may affirm its order on any independent ground made manifest by the record.see,houlton citizens coalition town of houlton,cir freeman package mach,cir.
iii.the district court analysis 
an evaluation of the district court analysis requires a general understanding of the new york convention.the convention is an international agreement designed to encourage the recognition and enforcement of commercial arbitration agreements in international contracts and to unify the standards by which agreements to arbitrate are observed and arbitral awards are enforced.scherk,d.the united states acceded to this treaty on september.to implement it,congress enacted chapter of the faa.
the arbitration clauses at issue here come within the convention ambit.see generally dimercurio sphere drake,cir ledee ceramiche ragno,cir.a district court duty to enforce arbitration clauses that so qualify can not seriously be questioned.see directing that the new york convention shall be enforced in united states courts.article ii of the convention requires contracting states to recognize an agreement in writing under which the parties undertake to submit to arbitration all or any differences which have arisen or which may arise between them.at,at.to give force to this requirement,the convention stipulates that a court of a contracting state shall,at the request of one of the parties,refer the parties to arbitration,unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void,inoperative or incapable of being performed.at,at.
given this regime,it clearly appears that enforcing arbitration clauses under the new york convention is an obligation,not a matter committed to district court discretion.see ledee,at,podar,cir mccreary tire rubber ceat,cir.to facilitate the performance of this obligatory task,the faa confers an armamentarium of powers.this arsenal includes the express authority to direct that arbitration be held in accordance with the agreement at any place therein provided for,whether that place is within or without the united states.
federal district courts have taken this grant of authority at face value and regularly have compelled arbitrations at venues beyond the ordering court jurisdiction.see,hart enters.int l,anhui provincial imp.exp,ordering parties to arbitrate in beijing filanto chilewich int l,ordering parties to arbitrate in moscow.these decisions square with the explicit mandate of section.
despite the clarity of the statutory imperative,the court below feared that it lacked the muscle to enforce an order that the parties arbitrate in london.grina,at.it concluded that if an order to arbitrate was unenforceable,it must be outside the faa scope.id.we think that this analysis both misconstrues the statute and misconceives the law.
chapter of the faa makes it crystal clear that the statute contemplates foreign arbitrations.see.the district court contrary ruling rests on its perceived inability to send court officers to london to enforce a command.grina,at.while this is a valid concern in the sense that a federal court may not exercise its injunctive powers beyond the reach of its jurisdiction,see.bureau of corr.marshals,d united states,d,it overlooks alternative means of enforcement.where,as here,a federal court has personal jurisdiction over the parties,the limitations on its ability to enforce an injunction in a foreign forum are not an obstacle to its issuance of an order compelling arbitration.the court has other means at hand for enforcing such an order.it may,for example,enter a default or an order of dismissal depending upon which party refuses to arbitrate,or adjudge a recalcitrant party in contempt.see,laprade kidder peabody,affirming contempt finding and imposition of sanctions for vexatious and dilatory tactics with respect to compelled arbitration morris morgan stanley,cir affirming order of dismissal for refusal to arbitrate ames standard oil,similar.
we therefore hold that so long as the parties are bound to arbitrate and the district court has personal jurisdiction over them,the court is under an unflagging,nondiscretionary duty to grant a timely motion to compel arbitration and thereby enforce the new york convention as provided in chapter of the faa,even though the agreement in question requires arbitration in a distant forum.since the arbitration clauses at issue here fall within the scope of the new york convention,the district court erred in refusing to order arbitration on the ground that it lacked authority to enforce an injunction abroad.
iv.arbitrability 
our rejection of the district court rationale does not end the matter.courts sometimes reach a correct result for an incorrect reason,and we sometimes affirm a district court judgment even though we disavow its reasoning.intergen says that this is such a case.
a party who attempts to compel arbitration must show that a valid agreement to arbitrate exists,that the movant is entitled to invoke the arbitration clause,that the other party is bound by that clause,and that the claim asserted comes within the clause scope.the third of these four elements is dispositive here as we shall explain,intergen is not bound by the arbitration clauses contained in any of the several contracts described above.
general principles.
we begin with first principles arbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.at t,communications workers of,d quoting united steelworkers warrior gulf navig,d.we have interpreted this precept to mean that a party seeking to substitute an arbitral forum for a judicial forum must show,at a bare minimum,that the protagonists have agreed to arbitrate some claims.mccarthy azure,cir emphasis in original.the upshot is that courts should be extremely cautious about forcing arbitration in situations in which the identity of the parties who have agreed to arbitrate is unclear.id.at accord chemrite pty,cir.
this point looms large in any reasoned analysis of the issues on appeal.the signatories to the purchase orders are apg and bechtel limited,neither of which is a party to this litigation.the signatories to the various services and support agreements,apg,rpc,cec likewise are strangers to these proceedings.in short,no party to this case,plaintiff or defendant,is a signatory to any of the five agreements.thus,if alstom is to invoke any of the designated arbitration clauses against intergen,it somehow must go beyond the four corners of the agreements themselves and show both that it is entitled to the agreements benefits and that intergen is obliged to shoulder their burdens.because we conclude that intergen is not required to arbitrate,see text infra,we do not have occasion to inquire further into whether alstom,itself a nonsignatory,has the right to demand arbitration.
alstom presents a cornucopia of theories to support the notion that nonsignatories can be bound by an arbitration provision in a contract executed solely by others.because we must evaluate these theories through the prism of the appropriate legal standard,we first ask what law governs.
as between state law and federal common law,we conclude that uniform federal standards are appropriate.this is a federal question case,and we therefore look to federal choice of law principles.see texas,radcliff materials,d.if the federal statute in question demands national uniformity,federal common law provides the determinative rules of decision.of locomotive eng rs springfield terminal ry,cir citing united states kimbell foods,d.the federal statute in question here is chapter of the faa which adopts and implements the new york convention.a central goal of the new york the driving force behind congress enactment of chapter to set out uniform rules governing the recognition and enforcement of international arbitration awards.see scherk,at.applying varying state standards in cases falling within the convention ambit would be in tension with the elemental purpose of chapter.we hold,therefore,that federal common law provides the benchmark against which the cogency of alstom theories must be measured see cogeneration.smith cogeneration int l,cir,cert.denied,d.we turn to this task mindful that federal common law incorporates general principles of contract and agency law.see,am.arbit.ass n,cir mccarthy,at see also.
judicial estoppel.
alstom first theory invokes the doctrine of judicial estoppel.it asserts that the factual allegations in intergen original complaint,taken in the aggregate,amount to an admission that intergen was not merely a passive investor in the rocksavage and coryton projects,but,rather,the principal architect of those architect whose responsibilities included acting as the chief negotiator for the acquisition of the gas turbines.although intergen largely retracted these averments in amending its complaint,alstom asseverates that intergen should be judicially estopped from disclaiming its initial admissions.see appellants br.at maintaining that fairness should prevent intergen from avoiding arbitration by manipulating its pleadings.
as a general matter,the doctrine of judicial estoppel prevents a litigant from pressing a claim that is inconsistent with a position taken by that litigant either in a prior legal proceeding or in an earlier phase of the same legal proceeding.see pegram herdrich,d see also james moore et,moore federal practice,at ed.the doctrine is designed to ensure that parties proceed in a fair and aboveboard manner,without making improper use of the court system.new hampshire maine,d.consistent with that root purpose,the doctrine is flexible and not subject to mechanical rules for determining its applicability.id.at.courts are prone to invoke it when a litigant is playing fast and loose with the courts,and not otherwise.patriot cinemas,cinema,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
leaving to one side the question of whether alstom has accurately characterized intergen original and amended complaints,this case is a poor candidate for judicial estoppel.it is not a situation in which a party has adopted one position,secured a favorable decision,and then taken a contradictory position in search of legal advantage.to the contrary,intergen plausibly attributes its revised pleadings to information gleaned during pretrial discovery.we would not want to institute a rule that unduly inhibits a plaintiff from appropriately adjusting its complaint either to correct errors or to accommodate facts learned during pretrial discovery.
perhaps more important,intergen amended its complaint prior to the issuance of any substantive ruling addressed to the original complaint.thus,intergen gained absolutely no advantage from its original pleading.
that is not to say that statements made in a superseded complaint are null and void for all purposes.under certain circumstances,such statements may be party admissions,usable as such despite subsequent amendment of the complaint.see,wiseman reposa,cir raulie united states,cir.that does not mean,however,that a plaintiff is strictly bound by its initial complaint.an amended complaint supersedes the original complaint,and facts that are neither repeated nor otherwise incorporated into the amended complaint no longer bind the pleader.see kelley crosfield catalysts,cir describing such omitted facts as functus officio see also moore federal practice,supra,at.absent some sign of unfair none exists mere retraction of statements made in an original complaint does not justify the invocation of judicial estoppel.
equitable estoppel.
in a related vein,alstom strives to convince us that the doctrine of equitable estoppel should operate to prevent intergen from declining to arbitrate.we are not persuaded.
pertinently,the doctrine of equitable estoppel precludes a party from enjoying rights and benefits under a contract while at the same time avoiding its burdens and obligations.see,hughes masonry greater clark county sch,cir see generally med.air tech.marwan,cir dictum collecting cases.on this basis,a party may be estopped from asserting that the lack of his signature on a written contract precludes enforcement of the contract arbitration clause when he has consistently maintained that other provisions of the same contract should be enforced to benefit him.int l paper schwabedissen maschinen anlagen gmbh,cir.
in an effort to fit the case at hand within the contours of this model,alstom asserts that intergen claims depend upon rights that derive from the purchase orders and other agreements that its claims for damages are,in effect,an attempt to enforce contractual remedies and that,therefore,intergen should be estopped from contesting the applicability of the various arbitration clauses.in constructing this argument,alstom focuses specifically on intergen allegation,made only in the original complaint,that it is the successor to all rights of predecessor entities related to the actions and omissions alleged in the pleading.in alstom view,this allegation signals intergen intention to assert the contractual rights of rpc and cec.
we reject these importunings.while alstom accurately quotes the original complaint,that document has very limited significance.see supra part iv b.moreover,intergen claims for damages offer no footing for the assertion of equitable estoppel.the claimed damages are not contract damages per se the amended complaint instead paints a consistent picture portraying intergen as an investor that relied upon certain assurances and sustained losses of its own funds when those assurances came to naught.
at any rate,there is a more jagged rent in the fabric of alstom argument.although federal courts generally have been willing to estop a signatory from avoiding arbitration with a nonsignatory when the issues the nonsignatory is seeking to resolve in arbitration are intertwined with the agreement that the estopped party has signed,at emphasis in original,they have been hesitant to estop a nonsignatory seeking to avoid arbitration.in the latter situation,estoppel has been limited to cases that involve who,during the life of the contract,have embraced the contract despite their status but then,during litigation,attempt to repudiate the arbitration clause in the contract.dupont de nemours rhone poulenc fiber resin intermediates,cir accord am.bureau of shipping tencara shipyard,cir holding a nonsignatory bound by a contract under which it received the direct benefits of lower insurance rates and the ability to sail under the french flag.the record in this case simply does not support a claim that intergen embraced the contracts and sought to derive direct benefits from them during their currency.hence,there is no cognizable basis for equitable estoppel.
