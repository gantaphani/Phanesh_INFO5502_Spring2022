the state property fund of ukraine spf appeals from a judgment in favor of tmr energy limited tmr,a cyprian corporation,in an action tmr brought to confirm an arbitration award it obtained against the spf in sweden.the spf claims the district court should have dismissed the case either for want of personal jurisdiction because the spf did not have minimum contacts with the united states or because the district of columbia is a forum non conveniens.on the merits,the spf contends the district court should have refused to confirm the arbitration award because the arbitrators determination of liability exceeded the scope of the arbitration agreement and violated public policy.we reject these arguments and affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
in,the year the soviet union dissolved and ukraine proclaimed its independence,lisichansk oil refining works lor,a enterprise,entered into a joint venture with a swiss company to upgrade an oil refinery located in the eastern region of ukraine.the swiss company then transferred to tmr its interest in the joint venture,which was known as lisoil.
in,tmr entered into two contracts with that gave tmr and lor each a stake in lisoil and another in which tmr agreed to finance and support the upgrading of several units at lor refinery in exchange for lor promise to provide feedstock crude or partially processed oil product to the upgraded units for refining.lisoil would own some of the refined oil produced by the upgraded units,and tmr was to be paid out of the proceeds from the sale of that oil.later in,as part of ukraine program of privatization,lor was transformed into a joint stock company known as linos.the spf,which had been created in to implement ukraine privatization plan,retained a share in linos on behalf of the state of ukraine.
for several years linos continued to meet lor obligations to lisoil,but by linos was experiencing financial difficulties and stopped providing lisoil with its share of refined oil as a result,lisoil could no longer repay tmr.tmr repeatedly asked linos to provide lisoil the refined oil to which it was entitled under the contract,but linos refused.
in tmr and the spf entered into a contract in which,after declaring that the spf had succeeded to lor interest in lisoil,they each agreed not to undertake any actions that may damage the interests of lisoil,not to abet such actions by a third party and not to be inactive in the event of such actions.shortly after the contract was signed,tmr asked the spf to fulfill its obligation by causing linos to turn over to lisoil the refined oil that lor had promised in the contract.the spf refused to exert any influence over linos or to provide lisoil the refined oil itself.
tmr continued to demand the spf either compensate tmr for its breach of the contract or find some other solution to the impasse,but the spf did not respond finally,on may,tmr sent the spf a letter stating that,if the dispute was not resolved by june,then tmr would initiate arbitration as provided in the contract.on july tmr did initiate an arbitration proceeding in sweden against the spf,linos,and the state of ukraine.
the case against the spf went to a hearing and in may the arbitrators held the spf had breached both the contract as lor,and the contract,to which it was a signatory in its own right.the arbitrators awarded tmr million in damages,plus interest and costs.in january tmr filed a petition for confirmation of the award in the united states district court for the district of columbia.
ii.analysis 
the spf argues first that the district court did not have personal jurisdiction over it,and in any event should have dismissed the case under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.on the merits,the spf renews its substantive challenges to the arbitrators determination of liability.
personal jurisdiction 
under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,a foreign state is presumptively immune from the jurisdiction of the united states courts,saudi arabia nelson,d that presumption is overcome only if the plaintiff shows that one of the exceptions to immunity provided in applies.see.the fsia confers upon district courts subject matter jurisdiction as to any claim for relief in personam with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity,a,and personal jurisdiction follows where proper service has been made under.id.b see also practical concepts,republic of bolivia,under the fsia,subject matter jurisdiction plus service of process equals personal jurisdiction.
the spf does not dispute that this case comes within a b,the exception to immunity for any action brought to confirm an arbitration award that is or may be governed by a treaty or other international agreement in force for the united states calling for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards.see the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,june,better known as the new york convention creighton government of the state of qatar,the new york convention is exactly the sort of treaty congress intended to include in the arbitration exception.nor does the spf argue it was not properly served with process.that resolves the matter of personal jurisdiction insofar as the fsia is concerned,but the spf attempts to trump the statute on the ground that the due process clause of the fifth amendment to the constitution of the united states no person shall be deprived of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law requires a nexus between it and the forum,here the district of columbia,where the arbitration award is to be enforced.see international shoe washington.due process requires person not present within forum have certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.the spf argues it lacks the requisite minimum contacts because it has had no contact at all with,and has no property in,the united states,let alone the district of columbia.
this court rejected a similar argument in price socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya.there we held a foreign state is not a person as that term is used in the due process clause.see id.at.we noted first that,in common usage,the term person does not include the sovereign,and went on to observe that it would make no sense to treat foreign sovereigns more favorably than states of the union,which are decidedly not persons within the meaning of the due process clause.id.citing south carolina katzenbach,d.that is not to say a foreign state is utterly without recourse but only that,u nlike private entities,foreign nations being the juridical equals of the government that seeks to assert jurisdiction over them,have available a panoply of mechanisms in the international arena through which to seek vindication or redress if they believe they have been wrongly haled into court in the united states.id.at.in short,it is not to the due process clause but to international law and to the comity among nations,as codified in part by the fsia,that a foreign state must look for protection in the american legal system.id.at.
our holding in price applies only to an actual foreign government we expressly reserved the question whether other entities that fall within the fsia definition of foreign state could yet be considered persons under the due process clause.at.accordingly,the spf argues the rationale of price does not extend to a mere agency or instrumentality of a foreign state which is how the spf portrays an agency or instrumentality,unlike a foreign state,is not the juridical equal of the united states.
for its part tmr argues that,pursuant to the standard we applied in transaero,la fuerza aerea boliviana,the spf should not be treated as a legal personality separate from the state of ukraine.in transaero we held that for the purpose of determining the proper method of service under the fsia,an entity that is an integral part of a foreign state political structure is to be treated as the foreign state itself,whereas an entity the structure and core function of which are commercial is to be treated as an agency or instrumentality of the state.id.at.in this regard tmr argues the spf performs classic government functions,such as implement ing national policy,issu ing regulations binding on state agencies of executive power,and participat ing in the development and conclusion of international agreements on property and use of property.the spf,in contrast,emphasizes that it operates in the field of commerce and the dispute underlying this litigation arose out of a commercial transaction,and contends that its status is roughly equivalent to that of a corporation,which is presumptively considered separate and distinct from the sovereign.see,transamerica leasing,la republica de venezuela.
regardless whether the spf performs predominantly governmental functions and would therefore be treated as the foreign state itself under the core functions test of transaero,or should be treated as a enterprise because this case arose from a commercial context,we think a different analysis is indicated where the issue is not service of process under the fsia but whether an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state is entitled to the protection of the due process clause.in transaero,we were concerned with the meaning of the statutory terms foreign state and agency or instrumentality here we must decide whether the spf is a person within the meaning of the due process clause of the fifth amendment.to that end we must determine whether the spf has a constitutional status different from that of the state of ukraine,a question with respect to which the supreme court decision in first national city bank banco para el comercio exterior de cuba bancec,d,guides our way.
bancec involved an attempt by a bank in the united states to set off the value of its assets seized by the cuban government against a letter of credit it had issued to bancec,a bank established and owned by the government of cuba but with full juridical capacity of its own.id.at.bancec claimed that,under the fsia,its separate juridical status shielded it from liability for the actions of the cuban government.id.the supreme court held the fsia was not intended to affect the substantive law determining the liability of a foreign state or instrumentality,and looked instead to principles of international law and federal common law to determine whether bancec could be held liable for the acts of the cuban government.id.at.at the outset of that inquiry the court observed that government instrumentalities established as juridical entities distinct and independent from their sovereign should normally be treated as such,id.at,but it then determined that presumption would be overcome where the foreign state so extensively controlled the instrumentality that a relationship of principal and agent is created,id.at,or in the case before it adher ing blindly to the corporate form would cause injustice.id.at.
in islamic republic of iran,we held the presumption of independent status detailed in bancec also applies to the question of subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia that is,a foreign state is amenable to suit based upon an exception in the fsia and the acts of its instrumentality only if the sovereign exerts sufficient control over the instrumentality to create a relationship of principal to agent.id.at.we believe the same analysis must govern whether the spf is a person within the meaning of the due process clause if the state of ukraine exerted sufficient control over the spf to make it an agent of the state,then there is no reason to extend to the spf a constitutional right that is denied to the sovereign itself.
the record in this case shows the state of ukraine had plenary control over the spf.the first provision of the regulations approved in the resolution of the supreme rada parliament of ukraine creating the spf states,the spf is a body of the state which implements national policies in the area of privatization.the second provision states,in the course of its activities,the spf shall be subordinated and accountable to the supreme rada the activities of the spf shall be governed by the constitution and legislative acts of ukraine,the cabinet of ministers of ukraine and these regulations.further,the spf chairman is appointed and discharged by the president of ukraine subject to the consent of the supreme rada,and the members of its board must be approved by the presidium of the supreme rada.finally,the spf expenses are paid from the budget of the state of ukraine.from these structural features it is apparent that the spf is an agent of the state,barely distinguishable from an executive department of the government,and should not be treated as an independent juridical entity.therefore,the its principal,the state of not a person for purposes of the due process clause and can not invoke the minimum contacts test to avoid the personal jurisdiction of the district court.
the spf next argues minimum contacts with the forum are a jurisdictional prerequisite under customary international law if not under the due process clause.we shall assume as much,but solely for the sake of the argument,which fails nonetheless.customary international law comes into play only where there is no treaty,and no controlling executive or legislative act or judicial decision.the paquete habana.see goldsmith posner,the limits of international law political branches have the final say about whether and how customary international law applies in the united states and whether or not the united states will comply with it.never does customary international law prevail over a contrary federal statute.see,comm.of citizens living in nicar.reagan,united states yousef,cir.
in this case,the controlling federal statute is b personal jurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist as to every claim for relief over which the district courts have jurisdiction under subsection a where service has been made under section of this title.that provision clearly expresses the decision of the congress to confer upon the federal courts personal jurisdiction over a properly served foreign hence its with the exceptions to foreign sovereign immunity in the fsia.we therefore reject the spf attempt to condition the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states upon the minimum contacts purportedly required under customary international law we hold the district court properly asserted personal jurisdiction over the spf based solely upon the requirements of the fsia.
forum non conveniens 
the spf argues that,even if the district court had personal jurisdiction,upon considering the public interest and the interests of the litigants,it should have dismissed this enforcement action under the doctrine of forum non conveniens,and remitted the plaintiff to a more appropriate forum.see am.dredging miller,d.we may reverse a forum non conveniens determination of the district court only for a clear abuse of discretion.piper aircraft reyno,d.
according to the spf,the district court clearly did abuse its discretion because it failed to consider the relevant public and private interest factors favoring dismissal.see am.dredging,at.listing some factors.the district court need not weigh any factors favoring dismissal,however,if no other forum to which the plaintiff may repair can grant the relief it may obtain in the forum it chose.see cent.bank of jordan,see also piper aircraft,at.
as the defendant,the spf has the burden of showing there is another forum adequate to the plaintiff case.see,at.pointing out that tmr has already filed actions against it in the courts of sweden and of ukraine,the spf contends those courts are adequate to enforce the arbitration award.as tmr notes in response,however,only a court of the united states or of one of them may attach the commercial property of a foreign nation located in the united states.see foreign state immune from attachment except as provided in,a permitting attachment of property in the united states of a foreign state used for a commercial activity in the united states upon judgment entered by court of the united states or of a state based on an order confirming an arbitral award rendered against the foreign state.
the spf next maintains the district court shou
