introduction 
plaintiffs and petitioners claudio parada and elizabeth garcia parada the paradas,fernando perez and jeanette perez the perezes,and sergio navarrete collectively,petitioners seek a writ of mandate to overturn the order compelling them to arbitrate their claims against defendants and real parties in interest monex deposit company,monex credit corporation collectively,monex,and terry parsons.we grant the petition and order the issuance of a writ of mandate.
petitioners invested substantial sums of money through monex,which deals in precious metals.when making their initial investments,petitioners signed form agreements referred to as atlas account agreements requiring any disputes with monex to be arbitrated before a panel of three arbitrators from the judicial arbitration and mediation service jams and prohibiting consolidation or joinder of claims.at that time,the paradas were school teachers,fernando perez worked as a driver for federal express,and navarrete was a school custodian.petitioners lost their entire investments with monex.they sued monex and parsons for causes of action including constructive fraud,commodities fraud,and violation of the california unfair competition law ucl bus,et.
we hold the paragraphs in the atlas account agreements requiring arbitration before a panel of three arbitrators from jams and prohibiting consolidation or joinder of claims are unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.because those unconscionable paragraphs can not be severed from the rest of the arbitration provisions,petitioners can not be compelled to arbitrate their claims against monex and parsons.
atlas account agreements 
monex is a precious metals dealer.according to monex,i t offers broadly two types of services i customers can purchase precious metals for cash delivery or ii they can buy commodities for cash storage,buy commodities on credit,or borrow commodities through atlas accounts.monex does not require investors to sign account agreements for cash transactions.for credit transactions,monex requires investors to open an atlas account and sign a monex atlas account agreement.
an atlas account agreement consists of a purchase and sale agreement and a loan,security and storage agreement.both agreements include identical arbitration provisions.the first paragraph of the arbitration provisions states the parties agree that any and all disputes,claims or controversies arising out of or relating to any transaction between them or to the breach,termination,enforcement,interpretation or validity of this agreement,including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate,shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration before jams,or its successor,in orange county,california,in accordance with the laws of the state of california for agreements made in and to be performed in california including,without limitation,the california arbitration act.
paragraph,subparagraph e of the purchase and sale agreement and paragraph of the loan,security and storage agreement state the parties agree that the arbitration shall be heard by and determined by a panel of three arbitrators.nominations shall take place within thirty days of the date that the dispute or controversy is at issue,that is,the day upon which all parties to the dispute or controversy have answered all claims and.the parties will each select an arbitrator from jams list of arbitrators in orange county,california.the selected arbitrators shall then select a third arbitrator from that list who shall act as chairperson of the panel.the chairperson shall be a retired judge of either the california superior court or any united states district court in california.we refer to these paragraphs as the arbitration panel paragraphs.
paragraph,subparagraph h of the purchase and sale agreement and paragraph of the loan,security and storage agreement state disputes and controversies between the parties to this agreement shall not be joined or consolidated with the disputes or controversies of any person not a party to this agreement.no party may attempt to assert claims on behalf of a class or group of persons.we refer to these paragraphs as the no consolidation paragraphs.
the arbitration provisions state,the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of jams comprehensive arbitration rules and procedures in effect at the time of filing the demand for arbitration.a copy of those jams rules and procedures are not attached to the atlas account agreements.the jams rules and procedures require the parties to deposit the fees and expenses for arbitration before the hearing,and provide that if a party fails to deposit his or her pro rata or share of fees and expenses,the arbitrator may preclude that party from presenting evidence of an affirmative claim at the hearing.
paragraph,subparagraph i of the purchase and sale agreement and paragraph of the loan,security and storage agreement state the parties agree that they will share equally in the arbitration costs,subject to the arbitrators discretion to allocate the costs of the arbitration,including the fees of the arbitrators and the parties reasonable attorney fees,between the parties in any proportion.
paragraph,subparagraph l of the purchase and sale agreement and paragraph,subparagraph m of the loan,security and storage agreement state i affirm that i have read and understand the foregoing and agree to submission of all disputes,claims or controversies arising out of or relating to my transactions with mdc monex or to this agreement to neutral arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.
petitioners invest through monex 
each petitioner opened an atlas account with monex in.the paradas were school teachers with a combined annual income of about in september they opened their monex atlas account on february,with an initial investment of and ultimately invested over through monex.
when the paradas opened their monex atlas account,a monex representative defendant and real party in interest parsons,presented them with the purchase and sale agreement and the loan,security and storage agreement.parsons told the paradas,they did not need to sign the atlas account agreements if they intended on purchasing the precious metals for personal delivery.boldface omitted.parsons also explained the risks involved in investing in precious metals.parsons told the paradas,they could take the atlas account agreements home and review them and then call him with any questions before opening an account.the paradas signed the atlas account agreements at that time,and their account was opened.the paradas alleged they purchased almost million in metals on credit,and lost at least in out of pocket losses from their monex atlas account.
fernando perez was a driver for federal express.he and his wife,jeanette perez,had a combined annual income of about in september.the perezes opened a monex atlas account in march with a check and ultimately invested a total of.they lost about from their monex atlas account.
fernando perez first contacted parsons about investing in precious metals through monex in february.parsons agreed to mail perez the purchase and sale agreement and the loan,security and storage agreement and told perez he did not need to sign the atlas account agreements if he intended on purchasing the precious metals for personal delivery.boldface omitted.the perezes signed the atlas account agreements on march.on march,monex received signed atlas account agreements from the perezes,and,on march,a monex representative signed those atlas account agreements.on march,parsons spoke with fernando perez,explained the risks of doing business with monex,and asked him if he agreed to be bound by the atlas account agreements.fernando perez responded affirmatively.the perezes made their first atlas account purchase on march.fernando perez signed and submitted additional sets of atlas account agreements on march and may.
navarrete opened a monex atlas account in april.at that time,he worked as a custodian at an elementary school and had an annual salary of.on february,navarrete telephoned parsons and expressed interest in purchasing precious metals.parsons explained the risks of investing in precious metals and investing through monex.parsons told navarrete that if he wished to finance purchases of precious metals store them through monex,he would have to review and sign the atlas account agreements,but he did not need to sign the atlas account agreements if he intended on purchasing the precious metals for personal delivery boldface omitted.after the telephone conversation,parsons had the atlas account agreements mailed to navarrete.
parsons spoke by telephone with navarrete on march,and further discussed investing in precious metals.parsons met in person with navarrete on april and provided him oral disclosures of various terms and risks associated with atlas account transactions.parsons offered navarrete another copy of the atlas account agreements,and navarrete indicated he had already reviewed the atlas account agreements mailed to him.parsons did not explain or discuss any of the terms of the atlas account agreements.
on april,navarrete made his first monex atlas account purchase.navarrete signed the atlas account agreements on april,and a monex representative signed them on april.
navarrete initially invested through monex.about three months after the initial investment,he followed parsons recommendation by obtaining a loan,secured by his home,for and investing the loan proceeds through monex.navarrete lost in excess of or in his monex atlas account.
proceedings in the trial court 
in the complaint,filed in june,petitioners sought damages from monex and parsons for losses arising out of their monex atlas account investments.the complaint alleged causes of action against monex and parsons for fraudulent misrepresentation,deceit,constructive fraud,commodities fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,negligent misrepresentation,negligence,and unfair competition under the ucl 
monex moved to compel arbitration based on the arbitration provisions of the atlas account agreements.petitioners opposed the motion,arguing,among other things,the requirement of a panel was substantively unconscionable because that requirement made arbitration so costly as to make it difficult or impossible to vindicate a claim.
the trial court granted the motion to compel arbitration.petitioners filed a petition for writ of mandate with this court.we issued an order to show cause,real parties in interest monex and parsons filed a return,petitioners filed a reply,and the case was orally argued before us.
discussion 
court decides the issue of unconscionability in this case.
as a threshold matter,we must decide trial court or the arbitration whether the arbitration provisions in the atlas account agreements are unconscionable.monex argues the parties agreed the arbitration panel,not the court,must decide that issue.petitioners argue unconscionability must always be decided by the court,notwithstanding the parties agreement otherwise.if the party resisting arbitration is claiming the arbitration clause is unconscionable,a court must decide this claim.discover bank superior court cal th,d.it has been held the parties can agree otherwise murphy check n go of california,th,d on the basis that b ecause the parties are the masters of their collective fate,they can agree to arbitrate almost any a dispute over whether the underlying dispute is subject to arbitration bruni didion th,d.we withhold our opinion whether we agree with our colleagues in murphy check n go of california,supra,th,d and bruni didion,supra,th,d.to permit the arbitrator to decide the issue of arbitrability,even if the contract so provides,raises issues we need not reach in this case.one such issue that particularly concerns us is whether having the arbitrator decide the issue of arbitrability presents the arbitrator with a conflict of interest.
we do not reach the question whether parties to a contract can agree to have the arbitrator decide unconscionability.an agreement to arbitrate the issue whether a dispute is subject to,the question of be clear and unmistakable.howsam dean witter reynolds,d see also first options of chicago kaplan,d courts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is clea r and unmistakabl e evidence that they did so.for reasons we will explain,the arbitration provisions at issue here did not meet that standard with respect to unconscionability.
the first paragraph of the arbitration provisions in the atlas account agreements states the parties agree that any and all disputes,claims or controversies arising out of or relating to any transaction between them or to the breach,termination,enforcement,interpretation or validity of this agreement,including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate,shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration before jams italics added.monex argues that by this provision the parties agreed the arbitration panel must decide the issue of unconscionability.we disagree.
in baker osborne development th,d baker,the court concluded an agreement to arbitrate did not clearly and unmistakably provide that issues of enforceability would be decided by the arbitrator.the arbitration provision stated any disputes concerning the interpretation or the enforceability of this arbitration agreement,including without limitation,its revocability or voidability for any cause,the scope of arbitrable issues,and any defense based upon waiver,estoppel or laches,shall be decided by the arbitrator.id.at,d.however,the agreement also contained a severability provision applicable if any provision of this arbitration agreement shall be determined by the arbitrator or by any court to be unenforceable id.at,d.the baker court concluded the arbitration agreement did not clearly and unmistakably reserve to the arbitrator the issue whether the arbitration agreement was enforceable because although one provision of the arbitration agreement stated that issues of enforceability or voidability were to be decided by the arbitrator,another provision indicated that the court might find a provision unenforceable.id.at,d.
this case is similar to baker.the atlas account agreements include a severability provision stating,i n the event that any provision of this agreement shall be determined by a trier of fact of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction,such provision shall be unenforceable in that jurisdiction and the remainder of this agreement shall remain binding upon the parties as if such provision was not contained herein.italics added.in contrast to baker,the arbitration provisions of the atlas account agreements refer to arbitration that is heard by and determined by a panel of three arbitrators.use of the term trier of fact of competent jurisdiction instead of arbitration panel or panel of three arbitrators suggests the trial court also may find a provision,including the arbitration provision,unenforceable.the arbitration provisions of the atlas account agreements,as the one in baker,did not clearly and unmistakably reserve baker,supra,th at,d to the arbitration panel the issue whether those arbitration provisions were unenforceable.
review by petition for writ of mandate is appropriate.
monex argues petitioners have failed to show unique,extraordinary,or emergency circumstances required for review by petition for writ of mandate.we conclude review by writ petition is appropriate.
orders compelling arbitration are considered interlocutory and not directly appealable.zembsch superior court th,d.thus,writ review of orders directing parties to arbitrate is available only in unusual circumstances or in exceptional situations.ibid.as the court in zembsch superior court explained,california courts have held that writ review of orders compelling arbitration is proper in at least two circumstances if the matters ordered arbitrated fall clearly outside the scope of the arbitration agreement or if the arbitration would appear to be unduly time consuming or expensive.ibid.
in this case,the high cost of arbitrating before a panel at jams and the amount of time necessary to complete arbitration justify reviewing the order compelling arbitration by writ of mandate.writ review is the appropriate way to review the challenged order and avoid having parties try a case in a forum where they do not belong,only to have to do it all over again in the appropriate forum.medeiros superior court th,fn,d.
the arbitration panel paragraphs and no consolidation paragraphs in the atlas account agreements are.standard of review 
we review de novo a trial court determination of the validity of an agreement to arbitrate when the evidence presented to the trial court was undisputed.bruni didion,supra,th at,d independent of mailbox center owners,superior court th,d.we review under the substantial evidence standard the trial court resolution of disputed facts.bruni didion,supra,th at,d.whether an arbitration provision is unconscionable is ultimately a question of law.citations.higgins superior court th,d.
monex asserts the trial court found petitioners were not under duress,the atlas account agreements were not made on a basis,and petitioners did not submit evidence establishing their inability to pay their share of arbitration costs.the trial court did not make express findings.what monex characterizes as findings were the trial court comments,some hypothetical,made during the hearing on the motion to compel arbitration.although the trial court made no express findings,we will infer the trial court made every implied finding necessary to support the order compelling arbitration,and review those implied findings for substantial evidence.see kulko superior court cal d,fn,murray superior court cal d.
general principles of unconscionability 
unconscionability is codified in civil code section,subdivision a,which states if the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract,or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause,or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.
a panel of this court,in morris redwood empire bancorp th,d morris,provided a thorough explanation of california unconscionability law 
in california,two separate approaches have developed for determining whether a contract or provision thereof is unconscionable.one,based upon the common law doctrine,was outlined by the california supreme court in graham,cal d,graham.under graham,the court first determines whether an allegedly unconscionable contract is one of adhesion.upon making this finding,the court then must determine whether a the contract term was outside of the reasonable expectations of the weaker part y,or b was unduly oppressive or unconscionable.graham,at.fn.omitted.
a separate test,based upon cases applying the uniform commercial code unconscionability provision,views unconscionability as having procedural and substantive elements.a m produce fmc d.a m produce.the procedural element requires oppression or surprise.citation.oppression occurs where a contract involves lack of negotiation and meaningful choice,surprise where the allegedly unconscionable provision is hidden within a prolix printed form.citation.the substantive element concerns whether a contractual provision reallocates risks in an objectively unreasonable or unexpected manner.jones wells fargo bank th,d under this approach,both the procedural and substantive elements must be met before a contract or term will be deemed unconscionable.both,however,need not be present to the same degree.a sliding scale is applied so that the more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d.
our supreme court in perdue crocker national bank cal d,performed its unconscionability analysis exclusively under the graham approach,but noted the two analytical approaches are not incompatible,declaring both pathways should lead to the same result.id.at,fn.many years later in armendariz,the court approved both approaches without expressing a preference for either one.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.in the recent case of little auto stiegler,cal th,d,our high court employed exclusively the approach derived from a m produce.
each of the two approaches has generated some confusion in its application.for example,the graham approach commences with a determination of whether the contract is one of adhesion,thus fostering the impression that a nonadhesion contract may never be unconscionable.in harper ultimo th,d,however,we expressly recognized that a finding of adhesion was not a prerequisite to an unconscionability determination,and held unenforceable certain exculpatory provisions incorporated into,but not attached to,a nonadhesive contract.
similarly,under the procedural and substantive test of a m produce,courts often reflexively conclude the finding of an adhesion contract alone satisfies the procedural prong,and immediately move on to the subject of substantive unconscionability.see,flores transamerica homefirst,th,d a finding of a contract of adhesion is essentially a finding of procedural unconscionability.consequently,other procedural issues,including surprise,often are ignored when balancing or weighing procedural and substantive unconscionability.undue reliance on any one procedural factor to the exclusion of others may produce analytical myopia and obscure the larger unconscionability picture.this problem was recognized in california grocers bank of america th,d california grocers,where the court criticized the a m produce approach,noting to speak in terms of procedural unconscionability is to elevate the fact of adhesiveness,which is not per se oppressive,to the same level as substantive unconscionability,thus tending to obscure the real issue.california grocers,at,d.
nonetheless,the approach provides a useful framework when properly employed,and conforms more closely to cases decided under section of the uniform commercial code,upon which california unconscionability statute is based.see perdue,supra,cal d at,fns.accordingly,we begin our analysis by considering the issue of procedural unconscionability with the following caveat in mind because procedural unconscionability must be measured in a sliding scale with substantive unconscionability,our task is not only to determine whether procedural unconscionability exists,but more importantly,to what degree it may exist.morris,supra,th at,d.
both procedural and substantive unconscionability must be present for a court to refuse to enforce a contract provision under the doctrine of unconscionability.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,armendariz.but they need not be present in the same degree.essentially a sliding scale is invoked which disregards the regularity of the procedural process of the contract formation,that creates the terms,in proportion to the greater harshness or unreasonableness of the substantive terms themselves.citations.in other words,the more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.ibid.
procedural unconscionability 
procedural unconscionability concerns the manner in which the contract was negotiated and the circumstances of the parties at that time.citation.it focuses on factors of oppression and surprise.citation.the oppression component arises from an inequality of bargaining power of the parties to the contract and an absence of real negotiation or a meaningful choice on the part of the weaker party.citation.morris,supra,th at,d.
adhesion contract 
following morris,supra,th at page,d,we commence our procedural unconscionability analysis by determining whether the atlas account agreements were contracts of adhesion.a contract of adhesion is a standardized contract,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
the atlas account agreements are printed,standardized forms drafted by monex.when the atlas account agreements were signed,petitioners were school teachers,a federal express driver,and a school janitor.monex was the party of superior bargaining strength,and gave petitioners the option of signing the atlas account agreements or rejecting them,in which case petitioner could not open a margin account.
monex argues petitioners had the opportunity to negotiate the terms of the atlas account agreements,but none did so.however,the front page of the atlas account agreements contains a proviso stating any deletions from,additions to or cutting or mutilation of any portion of this agreement will render the agreement unacceptable.that proviso shows petitioners were not given reasonable notice of the opportunity to negotiate or reject the terms of a contract,and an actual,meaningful,and reasonable choice to exercise that discretion.circuit city stores,mantor cir.
we conclude the atlas account agreements are contracts of adhesion.any implied finding made by the trial court to the contrary would not be supported by substantial evidence.
surprise and oppression 
our conclusion the atlas account agreements are adhesion contracts heralds the beginning,not the end,of our inquiry into its enforceability.morris,supra,th at,d.a procedural unconscionability analysis also includes consideration of the factors of surprise and oppression.higgins superior court,supra,th at,d.
procedural surprise focuses on whether the challenged term is hidden in a prolix printed form or is otherwise beyond the reasonable expectation of the weaker party.morris,supra,th at,d.the arbitration provisions in the atlas account agreements are not hidden,but consist of paragraphs,each with a heading in bold typeface accurately describing the substance of the paragraph.the arbitration provisions are in the same typeface and font size as the rest of the provisions.arbitration itself is a fairly common means of dispute resolution and would not be beyond the reasonable expectation of the weaker party.each petitioner was given ample time to read and study the atlas account agreements before signing them.
but the weaker party would not reasonably expect any dispute arising under the atlas account agreements to be arbitrated before a panel of three private arbitrators,the fees for whom are not expressly set forth in the agreements.while arbitration may be within the reasonable expectations of consumers,a process that builds prohibitively expensive fees into the arbitration process is not.gutierrez autowest,th,d gutierrez.the weaker party would not reasonably expect that his or her claims could not be joined with others in a single proceeding.
where the contract is one of adhesion,conspicuousness and clarity of language alone may not be enough to satisfy the requirement of awareness.where a contractual provision would defeat the strong expectation of the weaker party,it may also be necessary to call his attention to the language of the provision.wheeler joseph hospital d,citing smith westland life ins.cal d.the record here includes no evidence indicating whether monex called attention to the arbitration provisions requirement of three arbitrators.
further,as petitioners argue,the atlas account agreements state the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of jams comprehensive arbitration rules and procedures,but do not include copies of them.the atlas account agreements do not refer to or include a jams fee schedule.in harper ultimo th,d,a panel of this court found surprise because a contractual arbitration clause providing disputes would be resolved in accordance with the better business bureau arbitration rules did not include or attach those rules.the court stated a customer would receive a nasty shock on later discovering the better business bureau arbitration rules place severe limitations on liability.ibid.similarly here,a monex customer might receive a nasty shock on learning of the amount of fees charged by jams for three arbitrators and of the requirement of depositing those fees in advance.
oppression refers not only to an absence of power to negotiate the terms of a contract,but also to the absence of reasonable market alternatives.morris,supra,th at,d.in many cases of adhesion contracts,the weaker party lacks not only the opportunity to bargain but also any realistic opportunity to look elsewhere for a more favorable contract he must either adhere to the standardized agreement or forego the needed service,quoting madden kaiser foundation hospitals cal d.conversely,the oppression factor of the procedural element of unconscionability may be defeated,if the complaining party has a meaningful choice of reasonably available alternative sources of supply from which to obtain the desired goods and services free of the terms claimed to be unconscionable.morris,supra,th at,d.
monex argues,petitioners ability to invest in things other than precious metals,invest in precious metals through other vendors,invest in vehicles at monex that did not require them to sign contracts,or not to invest at all is what forecloses any possibility of oppression here.we agree petitioners had many reasonable and realistic market alternatives to opening monex atlas accounts,including the option of not investing in precious metals at all.investing in precious metals obviously is not a necessity this is not a situation such as admittance to a hospital tunkl regents of university of california cal d,or employment little auto stiegler,cal th,d,little,in which an adhesion contract might be oppressive despite the availability of alternatives.
monex is incorrect in arguing the existence of reasonable alternatives is dispositive of the issue of oppression.in nagrampa mailcoups,cir,an en banc panel of the ninth circuit court of appeals correctly stated,t he california court of appeal has rejected the notion that the availability in the marketplace of substitute employment,goods,or services alone can defeat a claim of procedural unconscionability.the availability of reasonable alternatives is but one factor along with absence of power to negotiate terms used in considering oppression.
conclusion procedural unconscionability 
in sum,there are elements of procedural unconscionability in the atlas account agreements they are contracts of adhesion petitioners were in the weaker bargaining position and could not negotiate terms the requirement of a arbitration panel and prohibition on consolidation or joinder were beyond petitioners reasonable expectations and monex did not call petitioners attention to the arbitration panel paragraphs and no consolidation paragraphs.there also are elements contrary to procedural unconscionability the arbitration provisions are not hidden in a prolix form,and petitioners had many realistic alternatives to opening the monex atlas accounts.considered as a whole,the elements both supporting and contrary to a finding of procedural unconscionability lead to our conclusion of a low to medium degree of procedural unconscionability in the atlas account agreements.
substantive unconscionability 
a provision is substantively unconscionable if it involves contract terms that are so as to shock the conscience,or that impose harsh or oppressive terms.morris,supra,th at,d.substantive unconscionability may be shown if the disputed contract provision falls outside the nondrafting party reasonable expectations.gutierrez,supra,th at,d.
petitioners argue the arbitration provisions of the atlas account agreements are substantively unconscionable because they require arbitration before a panel of three arbitrators rather than one,the arbitrators must be from jams,the jams fees would be in excess of per day for each day of arbitration,and the cost of the arbitrators is split evenly between monex and the investor.in addition,the arbitration provisions prohibit the consolidation or joinder of claims,so each investor must initiate a separate arbitration and pay the cost of three arbitrators monex argues the arbitration panel paragraphs are not substantively unconscionable because petitioners presented no evidence showing they could not afford arbitration when they signed the atlas account agreements.
as we shall explain,the arbitration panel paragraphs and no consolidation paragraphs in the atlas account agreements are substantively unconscionable to a high degree.petitioners presented evidence establishing the cost of a single day of arbitration would be at least per arbitrator,plus additional case management fees charged by jams.petitioners submitted evidence of their income,expenses,and savings showing their inability to pay those fees at the time they signed the atlas account agreements.each petitioner must arbitrate separately and fully bear the arbitration costs and fees because the no consolidation paragraphs prohibit joinder of claims.tellingly,monex offers no justification for requiring arbitration before three arbitrators rather than one the primary,if not only,purpose of the requirement in the atlas account agreements could only be to discourage claims against monex.
green tree and its progeny 
based on green tree financial.randolph,d green tree,amicus curiae cornell securities law clinic argues the arbitration provisions in the atlas account agreements are substantively unconscionable due to the prohibitive costs they impose upon petitioners.in green tree,the plaintiff,a purchaser of a mobilehome,sued her lender for violation of federal statutes,including the truth in lending act,united states code section et.tila.green tree,supra,at.the plaintiff agreement with the lender included a binding arbitration clause covering all statutory claims.id.at,fn.the agreement was silent on the issue of allocating costs of arbitration.id.at,fn.the district court granted the lender motion to compel arbitration,but the court of appeals reversed,holding the agreement posed a risk that the plaintiff ability to vindicate her statutory rights would be undone by steep arbitration costs,and therefore was unenforceable.id.at.
the united states supreme court reversed the court of appeals.green tree,supra,at.the supreme court recognized that statutory claims are arbitrable under the federal arbitration act,united states code section et.faa,unless congress expressed a contrary intent,because so long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate his or her statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum,the statute serves its functions.green tree,supra,at.because the tila did not evince an intention to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies,the court turned to the plaintiff assertion the arbitration agreement silence on costs and fees created the risk that prohibitive arbitration costs would leave her unable to vindicate her statutory rights.green tree,supra,at.the supreme court stated it may well be that the existence of large arbitration costs could preclude a litigant such as the plaintiff from effectively vindicating her federal statutory rights in the arbitral forum.but the record does not show that the plaintiff will bear such costs if she goes to arbitration.indeed,it contains hardly any information on the matter.as the court of appeals recognized,we lack information about how claimants fare under green tree arbitration clause.citation.the record reveals only the arbitration agreement silence on the subject,and that fact alone is plainly insufficient to render it unenforceable.the risk that the plaintiff will be saddled with prohibitive costs is too speculative to justify the invalidation of an arbitration agreement.id.at,fn.omitted.
the supreme court declined to invalidate the arbitration agreement based on speculation as to costs because doing so would undermine the liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements and conflict with our prior holdings that the party resisting arbitration bears the burden of proving that the claims at issue are unsuitable for arbitration.green tree,supra,at.the court concluded w e believe that where,as here,a party seeks to invalidate an arbitration agreement on the ground that arbitration would be prohibitively expensive,that party bears the burden of showing the likelihood of incurring such costs.the plaintiff did not meet that burden.how detailed the showing of prohibitive expense must be before the party seeking arbitration must come forward with contrary evidence is a matter we need not discuss id.at.
as the amicus curiae brief explains,many federal and state courts have cited green tree as creating a prohibitively expensive standard for determining whether to enforce an arbitration agreement,musnick king motor of fort lauderdale cir,the party seeking to avoid arbitration has the burden of establishing that enforcement of the agreement would preclude him from effectively vindicating his federal statutory right in the arbitral forum blair scott specialty gases cir,blair burden check into cash of kentucky,llc cir,green tree requires party resisting arbitration to show likelihood of prohibitive expenses bradford rockwell semiconductor systems,cir,bradford guadagno e trade bank d,ting v.at t d,revd.on another ground cir tillman commercial credit loans,bess directv,d,in re december nine company,roddie north american manufactured homes,crawford great american cash advance.in bradford,supra,the court concluded t he appropriate inquiry is one that evaluates whether the arbitral forum in a particular case is an adequate and accessible substitute to litigation,a analysis that focuses,among other things,upon the claimant ability to pay the arbitration fees and costs,the expected cost differential between arbitration and litigation in court,and whether that cost differential is so substantial as to deter the bringing of claims.
in blair,supra,at page,the court analyzed an arbitration agreement under green tree and decided a remand is appropriate in light of the plaintiff affidavit of her limited financial capacity,the evidence that the aaa american arbitration association would preside over the arbitration,and the aaa rules requiring the parties to bear equally the costs of the arbitrator fees.limited discovery into the rates charged by the aaa and the approximate length of similar arbitration proceedings should adequately establish the costs of arbitration,and give the plaintiff the opportunity to prove,as required under green tree,that resort to arbitration would deny her a forum to vindicate her statutory rights.the defendant should also be given the opportunity to meet its burden to prove that arbitration will not be prohibitively expensive,or as has been suggested in other cases,offer to pay all of the arbitrator fees.
california law armendariz,little,gutierrez,and boghos 
in california,treatment of green tree has taken a somewhat different trajectory.though the california and united states supreme courts agree that arbitral costs may impair the vindication of statutory rights,once again,each has adopted a different method for reaching this determination.gutierrez,supra,th at,d.
in armendariz,supra,cal th at pages,d,the california supreme court held that when an employer imposes mandatory arbitration as a condition of employment,and the arbitration agreement is silent on allocation of costs,the employer must bear all costs associated in arbitrating claims under the california fair employment and housing act feha,et.the armendariz court concluded,t his rule will ensure that employees bringing feha claims will not be deterred by costs greater than the usual costs incurred during litigation,costs that are essentially imposed on an employee by the employer.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.under armendariz,an arbitration provision,silent on costs,that is imposed as a condition of employment,is enforceable but the employer must bear all arbitration costs.id.at,d.under green tree,an arbitration agreement,silent on costs,is unenforceable under the faa if arbitration is prohibitively expensive and the party opposing arbitration meets its burden of showing the likelihood of incurring such costs.green tree,supra,at.
in little,supra,cal th,d,the california supreme court extended the requirements of armendariz to arbitration of tort claims for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.the court rejected an argument that green tree supplanted the holding of armendariz.little,supra,cal th at,d.the court explained the relationship between armendariz and green tree armendariz and green tree agree on two fundamental tenets.first,silence about costs in an arbitration agreement is not grounds for denying a motion to compel arbitration.second,arbitration costs can present significant barriers to the vindication of statutory rights.nonetheless,there may be a significant difference between the two cases.although green tree did not elaborate on the kinds of arrangements that would be unenforceable,dicta in that case,and several federal cases cited above interpreting it,suggest that federal law requires only that employers not impose prohibitively expensive arbitration costs on the employee citation,and that determination of whether such costs have been imposed are to be made on a basis.armendariz,on the other hand,categorically imposes costs unique to arbitration on employers when unwaivable rights pursuant to a mandatory employment arbitration agreement are at stake.assuming that green tree and armendariz pose solutions to the problem of arbitration costs that are in some respects different,we do not agree with amicus curiae that the faa requires states to comply with federal arbitration standards.little,supra,cal th at,d.
the little court concluded the faa did not preempt armendariz requirement because that requirement was derived from state contract law principles regarding the unwaivability of certain public rights in the context of a contract of adhesion.little,supra,cal th at,d.the little court stated furthermore,we considered and rejected in armendariz a approach to arbitration costs similar to that suggested by courts interpreting green tree based on the differential between projected arbitration and litigation fees.ibid.
in gutierrez,supra,th at page,d,the court of appeal analyzed armendariz,green tree,and little to conclude consumers may challenge a predispute arbitration clause as unconscionable if the fees required to initiate the process are unaffordable,and the agreement fails to provide the consumer an effective opportunity to seek a fee waiver.in gutierrez,supra,th at pages,d,the plaintiffs entered into an automobile lease with the defendants,which included a provision requiring disputes to be arbitrated in accordance with aaa rules.the plaintiffs were not informed of the arbitration provision or given a copy of the aaa rules.id.at,d.they sued the defendants for fraud and negligent misrepresentation,for violations of the california vehicle leasing act,et,the ucl,and the california consumers legal remedies act,et,and for false advertising bus,et.gutierrez,supra,th at,d.
one of the defendants filed a petition to compel arbitration pursuant to the lease arbitration provision.gutierrez,supra,th at,d.the trial court denied the petition on the ground the arbitration fee provision was unenforceable and could not be severed from the arbitration clause.ibid.
the court of appeal agreed the arbitration provision was both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.independently of green tree,the gutierrez court concluded w here a consumer enters into an adhesive contract that mandates arbitration,it is unconscionable to condition that process on the consumer posting fees he or she can not pay.it is that such a provision is unduly harsh and,defeats the expectations of the nondrafting party,and shocks the conscience.while arbitration may be within the reasonable expectations of consumers,a process that builds prohibitively expensive fees into the arbitration process is not.citation.to state it simply it is substantively unconscionable to require a consumer to give up the right to utilize the judicial system,while imposing arbitral forum fees that are prohibitively high.whatever preference for arbitration might exist,it is not served by an adhesive agreement that effectively blocks every forum for the redress of disputes,including arbitration itself.gutierrez,supra,th at,d,fns.omitted.
in the trial court,the plaintiffs in gutierrez presented evidence of their inability to pay,including a declaration setting forth income,expenses,and savings.gutierrez,supra,th at,d.the plaintiffs also submitted a declaration from an aaa administrator explaining the calculation of costs under aaa rules.id.at,d.the appellate court also found significant the fact there was no effective procedure for a consumer to obtain a fee waiver or reduction.ibid.
the gutierrez court then considered the effect of the arbitration provision on the plaintiffs ability to vindicate their statutory rights,and explained the different approaches taken by federal and california courts in shifting or allocating arbitration costs.comparing green tree,little,and armendariz,the court concluded a mandatory arbitration agreement encompassing unwaivable statutory rights may not impose forum fees exceeding the consumer ability to pay.gutierrez,supra,th at,d.when a plaintiff seeks to vindicate his or her statutory rights,an additional agreement will be implied that unaffordablefees are not to be imposed at the time of the award,unless there is express language to the contrary in the agreement.id.at,d.implying this additional agreement ensures that consumers will not be deterred from pursuing their statutory claims by the fear that the arbitrator will allocate unaffordable fees to them.id.at,d.the gutierrez court concluded the provision requiring the plaintiffs to pay substantial arbitration fees was unconscionable,and remanded the case for the trial court to determine whether the cost provision could be severed from the arbitration agreement.id.at,d.
in boghos certain underwriters at lloyd of london cal th,d,boghos,the california supreme court held the rule for arbitration of certain statutory claims set forth in armendariz,supra,cal th,d,and little,supra,cal th,d,did not extend to common law claims.the supreme court therefore reversed the court of appeal,which had rejected an arbitration provision on that ground,and remanded for a further determination of unconscionability.boghos,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court noted several issues to be decided on remand,including whether boghos ability to pay his share of the costs and fees is relevant to the question of unconscionability and,if so,whether he must prove he is factually unable to pay.id.at,d.
the preceding cases offer three approaches to resolving the issue of prohibitively high arbitration fees.one approach,the principle of armendariz and little,does not apply here because this case does not arise under the feha or involve claims for wrongful termination of employment in violation of public policy.another of the inapplicable because the atlas account agreements provide they are governed by california law.thus,we do not have authority to declare an arbitration provision unenforceable solely on the ground the arbitration fees are prohibitively expensive without undertaking an unconscionability analysis.we follow the approach taken in gutierrez,and noted in boghos,of considering the amount of arbitration fees and costs,and the ability of the party resisting arbitration to pay them,as factors in assessing substantive unconscionability of a predispute arbitration agreement.
monex argues gutierrez should not be extended to petitioners because they are investors,not consumers,and therefore deserve less protection from high arbitration fees.although gutierrez concerned a consumer contract,its reasoning extends to an investor contract that includes prohibitively high arbitration fees that are not within an investor reasonable expectations.gutierrez,supra,th at,d.as amicus curiae points out,cases have applied green tree to investor contracts,guadagno e trade bank,supra,d at independent of mailbox center owners,superior court,supra,th at,d applying gutierrez analysis to franchise contracts.indeed,the atlas account agreements do not use the word investors,but refer to petitioners as customer s italics added.
arbitration fees and costs 
in opposition to the motion to compel arbitration,petitioners submitted a copy of the jams rules and procedures and the fee schedules for attorney arbitrators and retired judges associated with jams.two of them charged per hour,one charged per hour,one charged per hour,one charged per hour,one charged per hour or per day,one charged per day,three charged per day,and one charged per day.the rates are essentially undisputed in addition,jams charges a nonrefundable case management fee of per party,per day,with an additional percent of professional fees for time in excess of hours.
at those rates,the least expensive jams arbitrator would charge for an day.three arbitrators at that rate would cost for an day.a arbitration would cost.each petitioner would have to pay half that amount,which would be in case management fees per a total of.since the atlas account agreements do not permit consolidation or joinder of claims,each petitioner would have to initiate a separate arbitration and pay minimum in fees for a arbitration,regardless of the amount in controversy.if the arbitrator fees were higher than per hour,or if the arbitration lasted longer than four days or hours the threshold for the jams ten percent surcharge,the fees would be higher.
the jams rules,as the aaa rules at issue in gutierrez,require each party to deposit the fees and expenses for the arbitration before the hearing.if a party fails to deposit its pro rata or share of fees and expenses before the hearing,the arbitrator may preclude that party from presenting evidence to support a claim.jams may waive the fee deposit requirement upon a showing of good cause.
the requirement of a panel,the prohibition on consolidation or joinder,and the evidence of the rates charged by jams arbitrators and judges evince a high degree of substantive unconscionability in light of the amount of recovery sought by petitioners.as explained,the cost of a panel at jams for a arbitration would be at least plus case management fees of at least.to arbitrate a claim,each party thus would have to pay at least,and would have to deposit that amount before the arbitration hearing.such arbitration costs are prohibitive for losses ranging from to.in popovich mcdonald d,the district court concluded the plaintiff had met his burden under green tree of proving the cost of arbitration would be prohibitive by submitting evidence that arbitration fees were likely to be as much as and perhaps as high as for a claim seeking million in damages 
requiring three arbitrators to resolve a dispute is not always unwarranted,and parties might have good reason to arbitrate before three arbitrators instead of one.but monex offers no justification for the requirement of three arbitrators in the atlas account agreements monex does not claim,for example,that claims arising under the atlas account agreements would be so complex as to require the joint expertise of three arbitrators,or the parties would be unable to agree on a single neutral arbitrator.monex did not present evidence of the atlas account agreements commercial setting,purpose,and effect to justify a panel from jams,subd.b,and monex cites no cases upholding a requirement of three arbitrators.
further,monex offers no explanation or justification for the prohibition on consolidation or joinder of claims.the prohibition on consolidation or joinder merely drives up the cost per party of arbitration.for all parties,including monex,joinder or consolidation of multiple claims could provide a more means of resolving multiple disputes the primary,if not only,reason for requiring arbitration of disputes before a panel of three arbitrators from jams,for prohibiting consolidation or joinder of claims,and for splitting the costs of arbitration,must be to discourage or prevent monex customers from vindicating their rights.
monex argues the atlas account agreements give the arbitrator discretion to allocate costs and the arbitrator fees.this possibility,however,provides little comfort to consumers like plaintiffs here,who can not afford to initiate the arbitration process in the first place.gutierrez,supra,th at,d.the jams rules require each party to deposit fees and costs before the arbitration hearing.although jams might waive the requirement of a deposit for good cause,the waiver is within jams discretion,and the record contains no showing of how a litigant might obtain a waiver of the deposit.to the extent the rules create a procedure to ensure fees are affordable,it is ineffective.gutierrez,supra,th at,d.
monex also argues the arbitration provisions are not substantively unconscionable because the costs of arbitration,even with arbitration fees and costs,would be less than the cost of litigating in court.the armendariz court criticized that approach,stating turning a motion to compel arbitration into a on the comparative costs and benefits of arbitration and litigation for a particular litigant would not only be burdensome on the trial court and the parties,but would likely yield speculative answers.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.we agree with gutierrez,supra,th at page,d that e ven if the calculation is made at the close of arbitration,when its costs are fixed,the costs of a litigation that will never occur is entirely speculative,particularly because no sensible prediction can be made as to whether the case would have been tried or settled.
petitioners ability to pay 
consideration of petitioners ability to pay the substantial arbitration fees and costs reinforces the conclusion the arbitration provisions in the atlas account agreements are substantively unconscionable.in opposition to the motion to compel arbitration,all petitioners submitted declarations,dated in september,stating each could not afford the cost of arbitration before a panel of three arbitrators at jams.
navarrete,who was unemployed in september,submitted a declaration showing that when he signed the atlas account agreements,he earned an annual salary of as an elementary school custodian.as of september,he received monthly unemployment benefits of,and had monthly expenses of about.he owned a home worth about subject to a mortgage of,three vehicles with a total value of,and furniture.he owned no other substantial assets.his bank account balance as of september was to.
elizabeth parada submitted a declaration showing that she and her husband are school teachers.in september,they had a combined monthly income of divided by months and had monthly expenses including mortgage payments,car loan payments,and credit card payments of.the paradas owned a home worth about subject to liabilities of.the paradas owned two automobiles with a combined value of about,had in a bank account,and owned no other substantial assets.
fernando perez submitted a declaration showing that in september,he and his wife had a combined monthly income of divided by months and combined monthly expenses of about.the perezes owned two automobiles together worth about that were subject to loans totaling.their home was foreclosed on in january.they owned a timeshare worth about subject to a loan of.
monex argues the declarations were insufficient because they reflect ability to pay only at the time of the motion to compel arbitration,not at the time petitioners entered into the atlas account agreements.generally,unconscionability is determined as of the time the contract was entered into,not in light of subsequent events.morris,supra,th at,d see also gutierrez,supra,th at,d.civil code section,subdivision a permits a court to refuse to enforce a contract i f the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made determining ability to pay at the time a party seeks to enforce a contract is contrary to statute and would make enforceability subject to change based on factors potentially outside the knowledge and control of the party seeking to enforce arbitration 
the declarations submitted by petitioners nonetheless reasonably reflect their inability to pay at the time they signed the atlas account agreements.petitioners were of limited means when they signed their declarations in september.navarrete was unemployed in september,but his declaration set fo
