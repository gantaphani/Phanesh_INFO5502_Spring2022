goldman,sachs and gs mortgage securities collectively,goldman appeal from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york cote,denying goldman motion to compel arbitration of a suit brought against it by the national credit union administration board ncua ncua brought this action as liquidating agent for southwest corporate federal credit union southwest,a failed credit union.ncua complaint alleged that goldman violated federal and state securities laws in its dealings with southwest prior to southwest failure.goldman sought arbitration of the claims,citing an arbitration clause included in a cash account agreement caa between goldman and southwest.ncua rejected goldman demand,asserting that,pursuant to its statutory powers as southwest liquidating agent under c,it was repudiating the agreement.the district court ruled that ncua had validly repudiated its agreement to arbitrate,and denied goldman motion.
on appeal,goldman argues that ncua repudiation power does not extend to arbitration clauses.in the alternative,goldman argues that the district court failed to appropriately scrutinize ncua determination that the contract was burdensome,and the repudiation was invalid because it was not done within a reasonable period following ncua appointment as liquidating agent.
we conclude that ncua successfully repudiated the cash account agreement,including the arbitration provision.we therefore affirm the district court order denying arbitration.
background 
ncua is a federal agency,which charters and regulates federal credit unions.among other duties,the agency insures the deposits of account holders in all federal credit unions through the national credit union share insurance fund share insurance fund.the share insurance fund is financed by deposits from all federally insured credit unions and backed by the full faith and credit of the government.share insurance overview,national credit union administration,last visited,see c.if an insured credit union is in a precarious financial condition,ncua has the power to place the credit union under conservatorship or into liquidation.h.
southwest was a corporate credit union,a class of credit union that provides liquidity,investment and financial services to other,credit unions.southwest served over credit unions,which in turn provided services to approximately million consumers.between and,southwest purchased from goldman three certificates for residential securities rmbs totaling million.the rmbs were rated at the time they were issued.within a few years,however,they were downgraded to below investment grade,resulting in substantial diminution in their market value.
on september,ncua placed southwest into conservatorship,and on october,into involuntary liquidation,with ncua serving as liquidating agent.as liquidating agent,ncua acquired all rights,titles,powers,and privileges of southwest,including the right to bring litigation on its behalf.
on september,ncua filed suit against goldman in the southern district of new york.the complaint alleged that goldman violated federal and state securities laws by making untrue statements and omissions of material fact in the offering documents covering the sales of the rmbs.in response,goldman sent a letter to ncua dated october,requesting that ncua submit the claims to arbitration.goldman attached the caa,which provided that it governed individually and collectively all accounts which southwest may maintain with goldman and that a ny controversy between southwest and goldman arising out of or relating to this agreement or the accounts established hereunder,shall be settled by arbitration joint app x ja at.
on october,ncua refused goldman demand for arbitration.ncua asserted that it was repudiating the caa pursuant to its statutory authority under c.section c authorizes a liquidating agent for an insured credit union to repudiate any contract if the liquidating agent determines,in its discretion,that performance of the contract would be burdensome and repudiation of the contract would promote the orderly administration of the credit union affairs.c.ncua attached a letter of its agent mike barton stating his determination that continuation of the caa would be burdensome and would hinder the orderly administration of the affairs of southwest.ja.
on november,goldman moved in the district court to compel arbitration,citing the federal arbitration act,et ncua opposed,arguing,inter alia,that it had repudiated the caa,rendering the arbitration provision unenforceable.the district court agreed and denied goldman motion.goldman brought this appeal.
discussion 
ncua power to repudiate an arbitration agreement 
goldman argues that ncua repudiation power does not extend to arbitration provisions within a repudiated contract.we disagree and conclude that ncua was empowered by statute to repudiate the agreement to arbitrate contained in the caa.
section c was enacted as part of the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of firrea,stat.congress passed firrea in the wake of the savings and loan crisis,with the purpose of stem ming the financial hemorrhaging resulting from the large number of failures in the thrift industry.resolution trust diamond,cir internal quotation marks omitted.firrea sought to put the federal deposit insurance funds on a sound financial footing,provide funds to deal expeditiously with failed depository institutions,and strengthen the enforcement powers of federal regulators of depository institutions.firrea,stat.at.
firrea addressed ncua powers and responsibilities as conservator or liquidating agent for a failed credit union.firrea,stat.at.among these,firrea granted ncua the power to repudiate contracts of the failed credit union.firrea c,stat.at codified as amended at c.section c provides 
c provisions relating to contracts entered into before appointment of conservator or liquidating agent 
authority to repudiate contracts 
in addition to any other rights a conservator or liquidating agent may have,the conservator or liquidating agent for any insured credit union may disaffirm or repudiate any contract or lease 
a to which such credit union is a party 
b the performance of which the conservator or liquidating agent,in the conservator or liquidating agent discretion,determines to be burdensome and 
c the disaffirmance or repudiation of which the conservator or liquidating agent determines,in the conservator or liquidating agent discretion,will promote the orderly administration of the credit union affairs.
timing of repudiation 
the conservator or liquidating agent appointed for any insured credit union shall determine whether or not to exercise the rights of repudiation under this subsection within a reasonable period following such appointment.
id.c emphasis added.
under these provisions,ncua,as liquidating agent,is empowered to repudiate any contract of the failed entity upon ncua determination,in its discretion,that the contract is burdensome or that repudiation will promote the orderly administration of the credit union affairs.in interpreting e a provision materially identical to c,this court has interpreted the term contract to mean a promissory agreement between two or more persons that creates,modifies,or destroys a legal relation.diamond,at alterations omitted.arbitration agreements are considered contracts.see rent a center,west,jackson,the faa reflects the fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract.thus,on its face,c appears to authorize ncua to repudiate an arbitration agreement.
goldman opposes this plain reading by three related arguments.first,goldman draws an analogy to bankruptcy law,relying on its interpretation of a precedential bankruptcy opinion.goldman notes that the repudiation power codified in firrea was modeled in part on the bankruptcy code authorization to a trustee in bankruptcy to reject executory contracts of the debtor.see a authorizing a bankruptcy trustee,subject to the court approval,to assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor,at describing the fdic materially identical repudiation power as incorporat ing rights and principles established at common law or in bankruptcy see also of ams.assocs.rtc,cir noting that the bankruptcy trustee rejection power provides a helpful analogy to repudiation under firrea.goldman contends,based on its interpretation of truck drivers local union,int l of teamsters bohack corp,cir,that an arbitration clause survives a bankruptcy trustee rejection of the overall contract.it argues the same should apply to ncua repudiation of an overall cash account agreement containing an arbitration clause.
truck drivers involved a labor dispute between a truck drivers union and an employer corporation.after the employer filed for bankruptcy,the union filed grievances against the employer via a grievance procedure established in the collective bargaining agreement.id.at.the grievance committee made an award in favor of the union,and the employer refused to comply with the award.id.at.thereafter,the employer acting as with the powers of a trustee moved the bankruptcy court for permission to reject the collective bargaining agreement.id.at.the union then petitioned in district court to compel the employer to specifically perform its collective bargaining agreement and to submit any grievances between them to grievance procedure.id.at.the employer counterclaimed,seeking to submit the dispute to arbitration if so authorized by the bankruptcy court.the district court dismissed the union petition to confirm the grievance award and remanded to the bankruptcy judge the issue of the advisability of granting the debtor leave to arbitrate.id.the union appealed.id.
the issue on appeal to our circuit was whether it had been permissible for the parties to use the grievance procedure without first obtaining authorization from the bankruptcy court.our court concluded that the bankruptcy court authorization was necessary for arbitration to proceed even under the collective bargaining agreement,and therefore the grievance award obtained by the union was unenforceable.id.at.on remand,the bankruptcy judge was to determine whether to grant the employer motion to reject the collective bargaining agreement and whether to order arbitration under its terms in any event,and on what issues.id.at.we explained in a footnote 
if the contract is rejected by the bankruptcy court,it will be deemed to have been breached as of the date of filing of the petition under ch.xi.but like any other unilateral breach of contract,it does not destroy the contract so as to absolve the parties particularly the breaching party from a contractual duty to arbitrate their disputes.hence,the provisions for arbitration could continue to support an order of the bankruptcy judge that the parties arbitrate their dispute 
id.at internal citations omitted.that is,even if the bankruptcy court approved rejection of the collective bargaining agreement,the court could still order arbitration under its terms.
while we did indeed rule that the debtor purported rejection of the cba would not necessarily,of its own force,terminate the obligation to arbitrate,we did not rule that,as a matter of law,termination of the overall agreement can not terminate the obligation to arbitrate.we did not consider the question,much less decide,whether a trustee in bankruptcy is empowered by the bankruptcy law to free himself or herself from the debtor preexisting contractual obligation to arbitrate.goldman reads more into the truck drivers opinion than is there.subsequent to truck drivers,our court treated as an open question whether a bankruptcy trustee may in some cases have the power to reject an arbitration agreement.see allegaert perot,cir.
furthermore,while the repudiation provisions of firrea were modeled in part on similar provisions of the bankruptcy code and therefore have features in common with them,there are also differences significant for our purposes between the roles of trustees in bankruptcy and ncua as liquidating agent for a failed institution.ncua is a federal agency which has insured the credit union accounts and sustained losses thereby upon the failure of the credit union.the share insurance fund operated by ncua is financed by deposits from all federally insured credit unions and guaranteed by the united states.the liquidation of a failed credit union thus implicates the finances of the broader federal credit union system,as well as the public fisc.in these respects,the interpretation of ncua powers is subject to considerations not pertinent to the powers of a bankruptcy trustee 
in short,for numerous reasons we reject goldman contention that truck drivers binds us to rule,or even gives substantial support to the proposition,that ncua statutory power to repudiate any contract does not encompass a power to repudiate an obligation to arbitrate,or that its repudiation of an overall agreement governing the relationship between the failed entity and another person or entity does not result in repudiation of an arbitration clause contained in the overall agreement.
second,goldman argues that repudiation constitutes a breach,and that at common law a party breaching a contract generally remains bound by the contract terms.repudiation of a contract did not relieve a party of the contractual obligation to arbitrate disputes under it.we think this common law rule has little bearing on whether c authorization of ncua to repudiate any contract permits it to avoid arbitration if it finds that arbitration would be burdensome or detrimental to the orderly administration of the institution affairs.common law,unlike the statute,does not confer a right of repudiation.rather,the common law recognizes repudiation as a form of breach.breaching an obligation,needless to say,does not nullify it.section c,in contrast to the common law rule,explicitly establishes ncua right to repudiate so as to avoid having to perform burdensome contractual obligations of the failed institution.whether the repudiation constitutes a breach,giving rise to liability for damages caused by the breach,is another question and is irrelevant to whether,by repudiation under c,ncua can avoid having to arbitrate.we reject goldman argument.
finally,goldman argues that the repudiation of a contract does not extend to purely procedural provisions of the contract,and that arbitration provisions are therefore not subject to repudiation.even assuming that an arbitration agreement should be considered procedural,goldman has furnished neither reason nor authority why such agreements as a class should be uniformly excluded from ncua repudiation power.
section c explicitly authorizes ncua,in its role as the liquidating agent,to repudiate any contract,with the purpose of avoiding burdensome obligations and facilitating the orderly of the failed credit union.we see no reason to interpret this grant of authority as excluding agreements to arbitrate.we conclude that c grant of authority to ncua in its role as liquidating agent to repudiate contracts includes authority to repudiate arbitration agreements,and we reject goldman arguments that ncua repudiation of the caa in this case should not be understood to encompass repudiation of the arbitration clause contained in the overall agreement.
ii.judicial review of ncua burdensome determination 
goldman argues that even if ncua was authorized to repudiate an agreement to arbitrate,the district court had an obligation under c to subject ncua burdensomeness determination to review for abuse of discretion and erred in failing to perform that review.the district court explained,a s ncua exercised its statutory discretion to deem the contract between southwest and goldman sachs burdensome,th e court will not that determination.ja.
section c is ambiguous as to whether the liquidating agent determination of burdensomeness is subject to judicial review.it provides that a liquidating agent may disaffirm or repudiate any contract 
b the performance of which the liquidating agent,in the liquidating agent discretion,determines to be burdensome and 
c the disaffirmance or repudiation of which the liquidating agent determines,in the liquidating agent discretion,will promote the orderly administration of the credit uni
