background 
in,plaintiff james giuliano iii moved from indiana to california to become executive vice president and chief financial officer of defendant inland empire personnel,and six related entities collectively,empire after giuliano left empire in,he filed the present action against empire claiming that a million to million bonus and severance payment were owed under his employment agreement.the complaint alleged causes of action for statutory wages under labor code section et based on the nonpayment of the bonus and severance payment allegedly due under the contract breach of contract for failure to pay the bonus and severance payment and declaratory relief to invalidate the employment contract arbitration clauses and requirement that he sign a waiver and release in order to receive a severance payment.the complaint also alleged a fourth cause of action for interference with contract against frontier homes,llc,and frontier homebuilders,which were dismissed from the action and are not parties to this appeal.
in this appeal,empire seeks to enforce the following arbitration clauses contained in the employment agreement that giuliano had signed and initialed upon accepting the offer of employment the employee handbook that was mentioned in the employment contract and the employee bonus plan that giuliano had signed upon accepting the offer of employment 
the employment agreement contained the following arbitration clause that was initialed by giuliano as a material part of the consideration for you becoming an employee of our company,we have each agreed that if sic any dispute or claim of any kind or amount including without limitation,wrongful termination,discrimination,harassment,title vii claims,ada and adea claims,personal injuries and contractual issues that arise in relation to your employment or its termination other than a workers compensation or unemployment claim,shall be arbitrated to a final and binding resolution,in lieu of any court or jury action.no appeal will be available to either party.such arbitration is to be conducted in san bernardino county,or any other mutually agreeable location,before a qualified member of the american arbitration association aaa,and shall be conducted in accordance with aaa then prevailing rules regarding employment disputes,including those relating to the conduct of discovery in preparation for such hearing.in addition,the employment agreement contained the following arbitration provision,which was signed by giuliano the terms and conditions contained within this letter including without limitation,the restrictions on my rights to seek a jury or court trial for those employment related issues set out in the arbitration provision of this offer letter see paragraph seven,accurately reflect those terms and conditions i agreed shall control my employment with the inland empire personnel.
the complaint alleged that the employment contract arbitration clause was invalid and unenforceable under labor code section which provides a judicial forum for statutory wage claims.empire moved to compel arbitration,contending that labor code section was preempted by section of the faa,which mandates the enforcement of arbitration agreements in contracts involving interstate commerce.in support of its motion,empire submitted the declaration of its executive vice president and chief legal officer larry day,who attested that empire engages in interstate commerce by acquiring,developing,and selling residential and commercial properties in both california and arizona,and by shipping supplies from other states to california and arizona and giuliano actively assisted empire multistate activities by negotiating loans with a bank that is headquartered outside of california.in anticipation of giuliano claim that the arbitration clause is unenforceable under armendariz,empire argued that the arbitration clause was not invalid because both parties were on equal footing,with equal rights to arbitration by a neutral arbiter in accordance with the rules of the american arbitration association or judicial arbitration and mediation services,both of which comply with the armendariz standard.
giuliano argued in opposition to the motion that because the frontier defendants who were dismissed after the motion to compel arbitration was denied were not parties to the employment agreement,the frontier defendants may not be compelled to arbitrate and,under code of civil procedure section,subdivision c,the court may refuse to enforce an arbitration agreement when,due to common issues of law or fact in a pending action with a third party,there is a possibility of conflicting rulings empire had waived its right to compel arbitration against the six related empire defendants empire land,llc,empire partners,empire commercial real estate,empire capital,llc,aviat homes,and empire global holdings,by arguing inconsistently in another lawsuit between empire and former empire executive jeff gault,that inland empire personnel,is the only one of the empire companies that can be compelled to arbitrate giuliano employment contract did not involve interstate commerce because empire does not operate in two principal offices are in california,the employment agreement was signed in california,giuliano worked in california,giuliano paid state income taxes in california,and giuliano was terminated in california and giuliano employment agreement is unconscionable because it failed to advise employees that california public policy provides them with extensive protections in wage disputes that would be taken away by an undisclosed federal statute.
giuliano did not oppose the motion on the grounds that the arbitration agreement was unconscionable or unenforceable under armendariz,or that the arbitration agreement was ambiguous as to which parties were bound by the agreement both of those grounds were nevertheless cited by the trial court in its order denying the motion.the trial court denied empire motion to compel arbitration on the grounds that the arbitration clause was vague and unintelligible as to which parties were bound by the agreement the faa did not preempt giuliano statutory wage claim because his employment contract did not involve interstate commerce and the arbitration clause was unconscionable and invalid under armendariz.after the trial court denied empire motion for reconsideration,empire appealed.code civ,subd.a order denying a motion to compel arbitration is appealable.

federal preemption 
the faa provides that a written arbitration clause in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,italics added.in cronus investments,concierge services cal th,d,the supreme court stated that t o ensure that arbitration agreements are enforced according to their terms,the faa preempts all state laws that apply of their own force to limit those agreements against the parties will or to withdraw the power to enforce them.see,perry thomas,supra,d faa preempted california statute that rendered private agreements to arbitrate wage collection claims unenforceable by requiring judicial forum for resolution of those claims southland keating,d fn.faa preempted california statute that rendered agreements to arbitrate certain franchise claims unenforceable by requiring judicial forum for resolution of those claims.although state law may be applied to regulate contracts,including arbitration clauses,if that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity,revocability,and enforceability of contracts generally,citation courts may not invalidate arbitration agreements under state law contract principles applicable only to arbitration provisions,and that therefore disfavor such contracts,or single them out for suspect status.doctor associates,casarotto,d.for example,the high court found that a montana statute that made arbitration clauses unenforceable unless the contract provided notice of the arbitration clause in underlined capital letters on the first page of the contract directly conflicted with the faa the state law conditioned the enforceability of arbitration agreements on a notice requirement not applicable to contacts generally.doctor associates,supra,at.only generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening of the faa.doctor associates,supra,at.cronus investments,concierge services,supra,at,d.
the purpose of the faa was to overrule the judiciary refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate,and to place such agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.while congress was no doubt aware that the act would encourage the expeditious resolution of disputes,its passage was motivated,first and foremost,by a congressional desire to enforce agreements into which parties had entered.volt info.sciences leland stanford,d,citations omitted.the arbitration act thus establishes a federal policy favoring arbitration,requiring that we rigorously enforce agreements to arbitrate.express,mcmahon,d.lagatree luce,forward,hamilton scripps th,d,fn.omitted.
the arbitration clause before us is governed by the faa if,as empire contends,the agreement constitutes a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce.in deciding this issue,we must broadly construe the phrase,evidencing a transaction involving commerce,because the faa embodies congress intent to provide for the enforcement of arbitration agreements within the full reach of the commerce clause.its general applicability reflects that t he preeminent concern of congress in passing the act was to enforce private agreements into which parties had entered citation.we have accordingly held that these agreements must be rigorously enforce d.citations.perry thomas,supra,at.in determining whether the employment agreement involved interstate commerce,the parties subjective intent is not the determining factor.e videncing a transaction involving commerce simply means that the transaction in fact involv e interstate commerce,even if the parties did not contemplate an interstate commerce connection.terminix companies dobson,d.
involved an arbitration clause contained in a residential pest control contract between an alabama customer and a local terminix franchise.sought to enforce the arbitration clause when it was sued by the customer and others for allegedly poor service.the alabama courts denied arbitration under a state statute that invalidated written predispute arbitration agreements.the united states supreme court reversed,finding that the alabama statute was preempted by section of the faa.the supreme court rejected the position that a transaction does not involve interstate commerce under the faa unless the contracting parties subjectively contemplated a substantial interstate commerce connection when they made their agreement.on the contrary,the supreme court held that a contract involves commerce under section of the faa simply if the transaction,in fact,involves interstate commerce.the supreme court stated that the interstate nature of the pest control contract in was undisputed because of the multistate nature of terminix and and the use of materials that came from outside alabama.id.at.
similarly,the interstate nature of giuliano employment was undisputed,notwithstanding giuliano contention to the contrary,and we therefore decide the issue as a matter of law.nyulassy lockheed martin,supra,th at,d.significantly,giuliano alleged in his complaint that empire was engaged in business throughout arizona and california.moreover,in his declaration,giuliano admitted that he had attend ed meetings,site visits and grand opening ribbon cuttings in other states.giuliano presented no evidence to the contrary and failed to dispute that he had engaged in activity that affected interstate commerce by negotiating dollar loan agreements with a bank that was headquartered in another state.
in his respondent brief,giuliano argues that his declaration created a disputed issue of fact regarding the interstate nature of his employment contract and that we must defer to the trial court resolution of that factual dispute in his favor.we disagree.at best,giuliano declaration showed only that most of his time was spent physically working in california,which,on this record,is insufficient to create a reasonable inference that his work had no connection with interstate commerce.the record was undisputed regarding the interstate nature of empire activities,giuliano business trips outside california,and giuliano negotiation of business loans from lenders.given empire undisputed interstate business activities and the broad construction we must give to the phrase evidencing a transaction involving commerce,supra,at,giuliano declaration was legally insufficient to create a factual dispute regarding empire interstate activities.the record is more than sufficient under to support a finding,as a matter of law,that giuliano employment contract involved interstate commerce the fact that the employment contract did not mention interstate commerce is irrelevant because,under,a contract involves commerce under section of the faa simply if the transaction,in fact,involves interstate commerce,regardless of the parties subjective intent when they signed the agreement.
giuliano reliance on hill,cir is misplaced.hill involved another provision in the faa that exempts from coverage any arbitration agreement contained in contracts of employment of seamen,railroad employees,or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.id.at.the issue in hill was whether the plaintiff,an account manager whose duties included delivering goods to customers in another state,was exempt from coverage under the faa as an employee engaged in interstate commerce.the eleventh circuit found the exemption was inapplicable,stating that since hill is not a transportation industry worker,he is not exempt from the mandatory arbitration provisions of the faa.ibid.in this case,there is nothing in the record to show that giuliano was a transportation industry worker who was exempt from coverage under section of the faa.accordingly,hill does not assist giuliano position.
ii.armendariz 
empire contends that the arbitration clause contained in giuliano employment agreement is not governed by the requirements set forth in armendariz,supra,cal th,d.we agree.
in boghos,supra,cal th at pages,d,the supreme court explained that armendariz applies to unwaivable claims that arise under the feha or are tied to a fundamental public policy in armendariz,we set out the conditions under which an employer can lawfully require its employees to arbitrate claims arising under the california fair employment and housing act,et feha.through the feha,we reasoned,the legislature created substantive and procedural rights not just for the benefit of individuals but also for public purposes accordingly,those statutory rights are unwaivable under civil code sections and.armendariz,at,d.to ensure that arbitration agreements would not become vehicles for the waiver of feha rights,we held that such agreements are enforceable only if they provide for neutral arbitrators,more than minimal discovery,a written award,and all of the types of relief that would otherwise be available in court and,in addition,do not require employees to pay either unreasonable costs or any arbitrators fees or expenses as a condition of access to the arbitration forum.armendariz,at,d,italics added,quoting cole burns intern.security services.we borrowed these requirements from an analogous federal decision,cole,which had in turn formulated them to ensure that arbitration agreements did not violate title vii of the civil rights act of et.in little auto stiegler,cal th,d,we extended armendariz,supra,cal th,d,and applied its requirements to arbitration of tort claims for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy,claims under tameny atlantic richfield cal d.justifying the extension,we reasoned that tameny claims,even though not statutory,are nevertheless,almost by definition unwaivable little,at,d,because they seek to enforce public policies that are carefully tethered to fundamental policies delineated in constitutional or statutory provisions citations omitted.to extend the armendariz requirements to tameny claims was also consistent with the object of those requirements,which is to ensure minimum standards of fairness in arbitration so that employees subject to mandatory arbitration agreements can vindicate their public rights in an arbitral forum.little,at,d.fns.omitted.
empire contends that armendariz does not apply to giuliano garden variety breach of contract action that involves neither feha nor tameny claims.it is well established that the right to a jury trial and judicial forum can be waived in an employment contract.as was noted in lagatree,supra,th,d,arbitration clauses are generally enforceable,a nd if a right or duty can be waived by agreement,it is not rooted in a substantial public policy,absent other factors to the contrary.id.at,d.further,the court said that in gilmer lane,d,the united states supreme court held that a predispute arbitration agreement is not invalid merely because it is imposed as a condition of employment.by directing that claims of economic coercion be decided on a basis,the court in gilmer necessarily concluded that compulsory arbitration agreements are not invalid per se.put another way,under gilmer,the mandatory nature of an arbitration agreement does not,by itself,render the agreement unenforceable.lagatree,at,d.
in this case,giuliano argues that his statutory wage claim is an unwaivable tameny claim because t he right to be paid wages earned is part of the public policy of the state of california and is not waivable.but giuliano contract claim for a million to million bonus and a severance payment is distinguishable from the statutory overtime or minimum wage claims that were at issue in the cases cited by giuliano.citing brooklyn savings bank.employee statutory right to liquidated damages for an employer violation of overtime compensation laws under the fair labor standards act may not be waived barrentine freight system,d employee right to a judicial forum for his minimum wage law violation claim under the fair labor standards act may not be waived notwithstanding the denial of his claim in arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement association of community organizations for reform now department of industrial relations th,d california minimum wage laws are not unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiff,a political advocacy group.we distinguish the above cases because they involved unwaivable statutory claims for federally mandated overtime and minimum wage payments,whereas this case involves a breach of contract claim for a multimillion dollar bonus and severance payment.
giuliano argues that empire is bound by the trial court adverse ruling under armendariz because,having argued below that the arbitration clause is not unconscionable under armendariz,empire is precluded by the doctrine of invited error from attacking that ruling.the doctrine of invited error does not apply,however,because empire did not request an erroneous ruling.under the doctrine of invited error a party can not successfully take advantage of error committed by the court at his request.thus,on appeal a litigant can not object to the admission of incompetent evidence offered by him.citation.he can not complain of error in instructions requested by him.citations.nor can he challenge a finding of the trial court made at his instance.citations.jentick pacific gas cal d.in this case,the doctrine of invited error does not apply because empire never asked the trial court to invalidate the arbitration agreement under armendariz,but argued against doing so.empire attorney argued below that as far as armendariz is concerned,i believe they are talking statutory claims involving public policy,number.so i do believe it applies to this contract.after the trial court stated,i think armendariz does apply,empire counsel said,if armendariz does apply,there is nothing in the arbitration agreements which go against any of the armendariz requirements.
armendariz does not apply to this case because it is not based on the feha or a fundamental public policy that is tied to a constitutional or statutory provision.boghos,supra,cal th at,d,parker mccaw th,d armendariz does not apply to the plaintiff claims.accordingly,we need not consider whether the arbitration clause complies with armendariz.
iii.ambiguity 
empire contends that the arbitration clause is not ambiguous and that the related entities are subject to arbitration.we agree.
determining who is bound by the arbitration clause is a legal question.solis kirkwood resort th,d in general,the meaning of contract language is a legal question,not a factual question.in this case,the employment contract identified the employer as our company affiliated empire entities collectively,the companies.giuliano obviously believed that the affiliated empire entities were parties to his employment contract or he would not have sued the companies for breach of contract.although giuliano states in his respondent brief that the declaratory relief claim asked the court to invalidate the agreement that if made at all,was made with only one of the seven empire companies,the complaint does not distinguish among the related entities but collectively refers to all of the companies as the employer.in fact,giuliano conceded in his declaration that he was employed by all of the related entities,stating that he contracted to be chief financial officer of the affiliated empire companies.as giuliano explained in his declaration,the related entities are the actual operating entities that have operations,provide goods and services and receive revenue for those goods and services,whereas inland empire personnel company,is a entity with no operations or revenue of its own.it is funded entirely by contributions from emp
