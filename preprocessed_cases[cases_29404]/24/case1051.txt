this case arose pursuant to the telecommunications act of the act,codified at,et.the district court opinion provides a good history of the telecommunications industry and a detailed description of the instant dispute which will not be repeated at length here.the relevant facts are as follows.
in,appellant communications,predecessor,american communications services,acsi,requested interconnection,service,and unbundled network elements from west,appellee qwest predecessor.when the parties were unable to negotiate all of the terms of the interconnection agreement ia,acsi petitioned the new mexico state corporation commission nmscc,appellee new mexico public regulation commission nmprc predecessor,to arbitrate the unresolved issues.
on december,nmscc issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law on the arbitration.at paragraph,nmscc stated that t he prices established in this arbitration are interim prices and will be in effect pending completion of the commission costing docket,vol.iii,at.on march,nmscc issued an order resolving a motion for clarification filed by the parties and ordered the parties to prepare and file an ia consistent with the arbitration order.acsi and west filed the ia on march,which nmscc approved on april.the ia set the call termination rate at per minute of use mou for large metropolitan areas but did not specifically state whether the rate was permanent or interim.
on march,acsi filed a complaint with nmprc,nmscc,alleging that west had failed to pay reciprocal compensation to acsi for terminated calls to internet service providers isps pursuant to the ia at the ia approved rate of per mou.west asserted that it was not obligated to pay reciprocal compensation and,in the alternative,that,if it was so obligated,any payment should be at the rate established by nmprc in its cost docket order per mou because the ia rates were interim.nmprc agreed with acsi that reciprocal compensation was required but stated that the rates in the ia were interim.since the cost docket rate was established in august,nmprc decided that the lower rate established in the cost docket order applied to minutes terminated during and after september.the final order was entered on march.
acsi,filed the current complaint in the district court on may,seeking review of nmprc final order pursuant to e and.alleged that nmprc violated the act by failing to enforce the unambiguous language of the ia which allegedly set permanent rates for call termination.further claimed that its equal protection and due process rights were violated and that its property had been taken without payment of just compensation.also asserted a claim for damages against nmprc pursuant to for deprivation of rights,privileges and immunities secured to it under the due process clause and the equal protection clause of the united states constitution,vol.i,at.
the district court agreed with nmprc and qwest,west,and affirmed nmprc final order in the underlying administrative complaint proceeding.the district court also granted partial summary judgment dismissing causes of action for deprivation of due process,equal protection,unlawful taking,and damages pursuant to.appeals to this court.
the issues on appeal are whether the district court correctly decided that nmprc was not arbitrary and capricious in exercising its continuing jurisdiction to interpret and enforce the ia between and qwest whether the district court was correct in granting summary judgment to appellees on constitutional and claims and whether the district court was correct in denying request for leave to amend its amended complaint to include a claim for impairment of contract.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment applying the same legal standards as the district court.ahrens ford motor,cir steele thiokol,cir.we review de novo whether the state commission properly interpreted and applied the act and its regulations.southwestern bell.apple,cir.once we determine that the state commission properly interpreted the act and its regulations,we apply an arbitrary and capricious standard to review the commission application of that law to the facts of the case.id.
the parties agree that they are bound by a partially negotiated,partially arbitrated ia.the crux of the dispute is whether a specific call termination rate for calls to arbitrated or negotiated.contends that the rate was negotiated while appellees argue that the rate was arbitrated.further argues that nmprc incorrectly interpreted the ia and decided that the allegedly negotiated call termination rate set forth therein was interim instead of permanent.because this query involves determinations of fact and because there is no meritorious argument that nmprc incorrectly interpreted and applied the act itself,we apply an arbitrary and capricious standard of review.see id.therefore,the specific question on appeal is whether nmprc was arbitrary and capricious in its factual findings and resultant interpretation of the ia.based on this deferential standard of review and the record on appeal,we hold that nmprc was not arbitrary and capricious in its determination that the rate set forth in the ia was interim.
section of the act expressly gives state commissions the authority to approve or reject interconnection agreements,but it does not specifically address the interpretation and enforcement of interconnection agreements after their initial approval.see a,b,e.however,t his grant to the state commissions to approve or reject and mediate or arbitrate interconnection agreements necessarily implies the authority to interpret and enforce specific provisions contained in those agreements.southwestern bell.brooks fiber communications of,cir see also bellsouth,mcimetro access transmission,cir.the act gives state commissions the power to arbitrate contested terms.accordingly,nmprc had the inherent authority to interpret and enforce the ia that it had previously approved.
we agree with the district court that t he interconnection agreement did not arise in a vacuum it was but one step in a complex and regulatory process,vol,at baca.an interconnection agreement is not an ordinary private contract.it is a document resulting from arbitration authorized and required by federal law which can not be viewed in isolation.an interconnection agreement is not to be construed as a traditional contract but as an instrument arising within the context of ongoing federal and state regulation.verizon maryland,rcn telecom,d,a n interconnection agreement is part and parcel of the federal regulatory scheme and bears no resemblance to an ordinary,private contract.it is counterintuitive to require a state commission to interpret such a document without the benefit of the circumstances giving rise to the agreement.
asserts that nmprc did not merely interpret the ia instead,it modified the ia terms.argument is basically that nmprc ignored the plain unambiguous language of the ia and improperly modified the ia to reflect its interpretation of extrinsic evidence.this attempt by to characterize nmprc ruling as a modification of the ia instead of an interpretation is mistaken.nmprc did not attempt to modify the ia.instead,nmprc construed the ia as consistent with its own arbitration order which specified the terms which were arbitrated.nmprc gave effect to all of the ia terms within the intent of all of nmprc prior orders.the prior orders are part and parcel of the ia,and the ia can not be severed from the circumstances that gave rise to it.
the ia,the arbitration order,and the other documents that were before nmprc involving the isp call termination rate are not a model of clarity.nmprc,acting in its unique area of expertise,sifted through these documents and other evidence and made a determination that the ia call termination rate for isps was arbitrated,not negotiated,and intended to be interim in effect until the cost docket rate was established.at the heart of these determinations were a string of factual findings in support of this conclusion.
nmprc first found that had brought the issue before the nmprc for arbitration which nmprc resolved by arbitration,vol.iii,at,vol,at bac
