the medical executive committee mec of the medical staff medical staff of washington township hospital hospital appeals from the judgment granting the petition of eight unnamed physicians physicians for a writ of mandate in a dispute over procedure in a medical disciplinary proceeding.the mec recommended that the physicians medical staff membership and clinical privileges at the hospital be terminated,and the physicians have each requested a hearing pursuant to the medical staff bylaws to contest the recommendation.the dispute involves the manner in which the hearings are to proceed the physicians want the hearings consolidated into one proceeding,and the mec wants separate hearings for each physician.
the peremptory writ of mandate ordered in the judgment commands the mec to submit to a consolidated hearing.the mec argues that the judgment must be reversed because the physicians have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies,or because mec has discretion to require individual hearings.we conclude that reversal is required because of the failure to exhaust administrative remedies,and need not determine whether the mec refusal to agree to consolidation was an abuse of discretion.
background 
the physicians were eight of members of a medical group that,according to the mec charges,had for years arranged to provide all necessary anesthesia services at the hospital in return for a virtually exclusive opportunity to do so.on saturday,november,the hospital learned that the physicians would be moving their practices to another hospital on the following monday,november.the mec seeks to discipline the physicians individually for this precipitous withdrawal of services that allegedly could have jeopardized patient safety and undermined public confidence in the hospital.the physicians deny the charges and contend arrangements for coverage were in place.
the mec recommended that the hospital board of directors board terminate the physicians clinical privileges and medical staff membership,and the physicians each requested a judicial review committee jrc hearing to dispute the recommendation the medical staff bylaws provide that members can challenge adverse actions such as those involved here by requesting a hearing before a jrc comprised of at least three medical staff members.articles.the mec and the member present evidence to the jrc at the hearing article,and the jrc,acting as a decision maker,determines whether the adverse action is reasonable and warranted article.c.
the mec appoints a hearing officer,functioning as a legal facilitator,to preside at the hearing.article.the hearing officer shall endeavor to assure that all participants in the hearing have a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present relevant oral and documentary evidence in a n efficient and expeditious manner,and that proper decorum is maintained.the hearing officer shall be entitled to determine the order of or procedure for presenting evidence and argument during the hearing and shall have the authority and discretion to make all rulings on questions which pertain to matters of law,procedure or the admissibility of evidence.if the hearing officer determines that either side in a hearing is not proceeding in an efficient and expeditious manner,the hearing officer may take such discretionary action as seems warranted by the circumstances.article.
the jrc decision is considered final under the bylaws unless it is appealed to the board.article of the bylaws pertaining to the time for such an appeal provides in full within fifteen days after receipt of the decision of the jrc,either the member or the mec may request an appellate review.a written request for such review shall be delivered to the chief of staff,the ceo,and the other party in the hearing.if a request for appellate review is not requested within such period,the board shall then approve,reject,or modify the recommendation.article pertaining to the grounds for such an appeal states in full a written request for an appeal shall include an identification of the grounds for appeal and a clear and concise statement of the facts in support of the appeal.the grounds for appeal from the hearing shall be a substantial with the procedures required by these bylaws or applicable law which has created demonstrable prejudice b the decision was not supported by substantial evidence based upon the hearing record.an appeal board of the board holds an appellate hearing based upon the record of the hearing before the jrc,and recommends to the board whether to affirm,modify,or reverse the jrc decision,or remand the matter to the jrc for further review and decision.article.the board then renders a final decision.articles.a.
the bylaws stipulate that members must exhaust the foregoing remedies before resorting to legal action.article.
after requesting their jrc hearings,the physicians each waived their right to an individual hearing and asked that the hearings be consolidated.the mec denied the request,and appointed eight jrc panels and eight hearing officers to hear each of the cases separately.the physicians moved in each of the eight proceedings for consolidation five of the eight hearing officers schnier,kaplan,di benedetto,phillips,lapallo denied the consolidation motions on the ground that they had no authority to issue rulings governing hearings over which they did not preside.one hearing officer singer denied the consolidation motion on the principal ground that the decision whether to consolidate was committed to the mec discretion.one hearing officer bartel found that he had no authority to arbitrarily intrude into the other pending proceedings,usurp the authority and discretion of the other hearing officers,and peremptorily order consolidation,but thought that all of the hearing officers should decide whether consolidation was advisable in principle,and then engage with the parties and counsel in a a meet and confer process to work out the appropriate subsequent processes.one hearing officer determined that she had authority under the bylaws to order consolidation and granted the motion to consolidate.
various communications between the hearing officers and parties ensued.the physicians wrote a letter to the hearing officers and the mec,stating they understood that the hearings had been consolidated before hearing officer,and that all other scheduled dates were off calendar.hearing officers schnier,kaplan,di benedetto,phillips,and singer responded that they did not acknowledge authority to rule with respect to their hearings,and said that they planned to proceed with them.wrote an email stating that i was not,by my ruling,necessarily assuming or presuming control of all proceedings,and proposing that the hearing officers and counsel have a conference call or group meeting.hearing officers bartel and lapallo thought that a group meeting would be useful only if the parties agreed to one.the mec said it believed a group meeting was unnecessary.in response to an inquiry from the physicians,bartel and lapallo confirmed that,like the other hearing officers,they did not believe ruling affected their hearings.indicated that she no longer thought a conference call was in order,and said that she,like the other hearing officers,would proceed as best as she could with whatever information she was able to garner.
the physicians then filed their code of civil procedure section petition for writ of mandate herein.the petition recitation of the jrc proceedings concluded thus,none of the eight hearings have been consolidated as it stands,the physicians therefore face eight individual hearings that are slated to continue while the court considers this writ petition.the petition sought consolidation of the jrc hearings and a stay of the hearings until the petition was decided.
the mec demurred to the petition on the ground that the physicians had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.the court overruled the demurrer and stayed the jrc proceedings pending determination of the petition.as to whether there exists an adequate legal remedy available to petitioners,the court found to make the petitioners wait until the hearing process is complete to seek review of the various consolidation determinations is illogical and it does not appear from the bylaws that the appellate procedure set forth therein is available to petitioners to seek review of the various determinations regarding consolidation.see article of the bylaws.
the order granting the petition first concluded that the mec did not have discretion to unilaterally reject the physicians request for consolidation.the court reasoned in this regard that once petitioners requested consolidation,and agreed to waive their right to individual hearings,the mec lacked the authority to reject that request unilaterally.the mec could have negotiated an agreement regarding consolidation with petitioners,but failing that,it was obligated to leave the question of consolidation to a neutral decision maker.under the bylaws,that decisionmaker should have been hearing officer bartel,the first hearing officer selected by the mec and accepted by petitioners.the mec contrary it is vested with the authority to reject consolidation allow it,as the adversary of petitioners,to make a procedural decision actually entrusted to the hearing officer,and one which could deprive petitioners of a fair hearing.such a position is not supported by the silence of the bylaws on this issue and is contrary to fundamental due process.
the order next concluded that even if the mec had discretion to decide the consolidation issue,it abused that discretion in denying consolidation because,on balance,consolidation was justified.the court thought,on the one hand,that petitioners have made clear that they will likely suffer substantial prejudice if each of them must separately defend against the charges that they acted wrongly because of their actions as a group.witnesses,who petitioners can not compel to testify,may not be available for eight separate hearings to give the same testimony and subject themselves to the same cross examination.the risk of inconsistent results for essentially the same conduct can not be ignored.and multiplying the expense of these hearings by a magnitude of eight can not be justified absent some compelling countervailing reason.on the other hand,the mec reasons for rejecting consolidation do not satisfy this court.the right to individual hearings is part of a process to protect the individual physician,not a requirement that the mec can turn to its tactical advantage in the absence of some compelling reason.none has been offered.
the court concluded further that the mec abused its discretion in failing to implement hearing officer consolidation order.the court believed that,by rejecting hearing officer bartel suggestion that he alone decide the consolidation issue,the mec had created a situation in which conflicting orders could be made on the exact same procedural issue,and thus should not be free to decide which order it will follow,and which it will ignore t o allow the mec,as an adversary,to follow only those procedural rulings it agrees with,flies in the face of fairness and due process.
the court issued a writ of mandate directing the mec to provide the physicians with a consolidated hearing before hearing officer bartel and a single jrc panel,and ordering that the other seven jrc proceedings be permanently suspended.
ii.discussion 
a.the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine applies 
it is the general and well established jurisdictional rule that a plaintiff who seeks judicial relief against an organization of which he is a member must first invoke and exhaust the remedies provided by that organization applicable to his grievance.westlake community hosp.superior court cal d,westlake see also kaiser foundation hospitals superior court th,d kaiser describing the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine.under this doctrine,a party must go through the entire proceeding to a final decision on the merits of the entire controversy before resorting to the courts for relief.bollengier doctors medical center d.bollengier.
the exhaustion doctrine applies in medical disciplinary proceedings such as those here.b efore a doctor may initiate litigation challenging the propriety of a hospital denial or withdrawal of privileges,he must exhaust the available internal remedies afforded by the hospital.westlake,supra,cal d at.in business and professions code section et,the legislature has granted to individual hospitals,acting on the recommendations of their peer review committees,the primary responsibility for monitoring the professional conduct of physicians licensed in california.kibler northern inyo county local hospital dist.cal th,d.although the decision in westlake applied to the fair procedure a hospital was required to provide under california common law citation,rather than to the statutory peer review procedure now required by business and professions code section et the exhaustion doctrine applies under the new statutory scheme as much as it did under the previous common law scheme.kaiser,supra,th at,fn,d.
the exhaustion requirement applies whether relief is sought by traditional code civ,or administrative code civ,mandamus.unnamed physician board of trustees th,d unnamed physician.where,as here,the petitioner is pursuing traditional mandamus,the exhaustion requirement speaks to whether there exists an adequate legal remedy.if an administrative remedy is available and has not yet been exhausted,an adequate remedy exists and the petitioner is not entitled to extraordinary relief.id.at,d.
b.an administrative remedy is available 
the exhaustion requirement does not apply if no administrative remedy is available.kaiser,supra,th at,d bollengier,supra,d at.the medical staff is a,autonomous body with a carefully crafted set of bylaws that incorporate traditional due process procedures including a right of appeal.here,the medical staff bylaws provide that a jrc decision is appealable to the board.the physicians therefore have a valid administrative remedy that they are required to exhaust,as we now further explain.
the trial court cited the time for appeal provision of the bylaws article in overruling the mec demurrer and finding that there was no administrative remedy available to the physicians with respect to the consolidation issue.this bylaw,as previously noted,provides for board review only after a jrc decision has been rendered.if,as its citation of this provision suggests,the court determined that no administrative remedy is available because the bylaws do not afford a right to have the consolidation issue reviewed before the jrc proceedings are concluded,then the court ruling was untenable under the rationale in bollengier and the principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies.
the doctor in bollengier requested a medical review committee hearing to contest revocation of his medical staff privileges.at a law and motion hearing before the presiding hearing officer,the doctor disputed the procedural validity of the charges against him,but the hearing officer refused to dismiss the charges.bollengier,supra,d at.before the review committee hearing began on the merits,the doctor petitioned for a writ of mandate,argu ing that he should not be required to stand trial on charges which were procedurally defective.id.at.the trial court denied the petition for failure to exhaust administrative remedies,and the appellate court affirmed.
the opinion observed that because the doctor was not contesting the validity of the medical staff bylaws as written,but rather contend ing that the bylaws were not followed bollengier,supra,d at,he was not excused from exhausting administrative remedies on the theory that the administrative procedures were the very source of the asserted injury id.at.the situation is the same in this case.the physicians are not contesting the validity of the bylaws,but rather the mec alleged failure to follow them by not acceding to one hearing officer consolidation ruling.
bollengier went on,for reasons equally applicable here,to conclude that the timing of the administrative review did not render the remedy inadequate.i t must be remembered,the court wrote,that license suspension,revocation or othe
