before us is a multifaceted challenge to the confirmation of an arbitration award.we omit many details in the interest of simplicity.in,six individuals who had been working together for many years in the real estate business created a partnership that they called jarnis.each took an equal share in the partnership,although each share was divided in turn among the active member of the partnership,members of his family,and trusts for the benefit of the family members.the partners by which we mean,unless otherwise indicated,the active members later had a falling out.four of them ganged up against the other two,the lefkovitzes,who in,joined by their family trusts,brought this suit against their four oppressors plus four companies controlled by the latter.the suit charges that the defendants,in violation of rico,the jarnis partnership agreement,and fiduciary obligations arising from the partnership,diverted to themselves partnership income in which the plaintiffs as were entitled to share.the defendants had done this,the plaintiffs alleged,by paying themselves inflated compensation for services that they had rendered or purported to have rendered to the partnership.
although jarnis was not a party to the suit,the suit might seem to be really a derivative suit on the partnership behalf,charging that the defendants looted it.when a corporation is injured by a wrongful act but the board of directors refuses to seek legal relief,a shareholder can sue the wrongdoer on behalf of the corporation.such a suit is known as a derivative suit,and is an asset of the corporation.kennedy venrock associates,cir.although most derivative suits are brought on behalf of corporations,a derivative suit can be brought on behalf of a partnership or other unincorporated firm.no party has sought to have this case litigated as a derivative suit but if individual partners sue to enforce rights belonging to a nonconsenting third party,namely the partnership,the court must dismiss the suit.see fieldturf,southwest recreational industries,paradise creations,uv sales,enzo apa son,geapag.one can not sue,other than in a representative capacity,to enforce a right that belongs to someone else.people organized for welfare employment rights thompson,cir.bring the point closer to can not maintain a rico suit for injury to their corporation.sears likens,cir fertilizer exchange national bank,cir in re sunrise securities litigation,cir.
but it is the law of the jurisdiction under which a partnership is organized that determines who has a legally enforceable right to sue to prevent or correct an improper diversion of partnership income.kamen kemper financial services,d in re abbott laboratories derivative shareholders litigation,cir.jarnis is a florida general partnership,and under florida law the partners in a general partnership owe fiduciary obligations to each other.stat.ann.see,hallock holiday isle resort marina,so d,lundstrom realty advisors,schickedanz,so d.this is the general rule,not anything peculiar to florida.see,meinhard salmon,cardozo,artra group,salomon.holding,d,mcsweeney buti,d.so the plaintiffs were not required to file this as a derivative,or any kind of representative,suit.the plaintiffs could sue,and are suing,on their own behalf rather than on behalf of the partnership.
this point is fogged up by the fact that,as we shall see,jarnis received an award from the arbitrator.this has no practical significance the award was no different from awarding of the amount of it to the defendants and entities controlled by them to which they had transferred fractions of their shares and the other third to the plaintiffs.similarly,although the corporation or other entity on whose behalf a suit is brought,being the owner of the claim sued upon,normally is an indispensable party,koster american lumbermens mutual casualty.bagdon,cir fogade enb revocable trust,cir,this observation is inapplicable to a suit such as the present one in which the partner or shareholder is allowed to sue in an individual rather than representative capacity.the next step,which however we declined to take in frank hadesman frank,cir,would be to allow a derivative suit to be brought instead as an individual suit whenever the corporation the usual entity on behalf of which a derivative suit is brought is closely held,at least where,as in this case were jarnis a corporation,all the shareholders are before the court,so that there are no merely represented shareholders.
but by virtue of the principles of partnership law,the plaintiffs in this case had and exercised an option to sue as individuals rather than on behalf of the partnership.the analogy is to a suit by a minority shareholder against the majority shareholder,claiming that the latter has violated the fiduciary duty that such a shareholder,especially in a closely held corporation,owes to minority shareholders.kennedy venrock associates,supra,at strougo bassini,cir see also united states byrum,d lawton nyman,cir hollis hill,cir but see combs pricewaterhousecoopers llp,cir.
so we can proceed to the merits of the appeal.the defendants demanded arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clause in the jarnis partnership agreement.the plaintiffs resisted on the ground that some of the entities that they had joined as defendants along with the four active members of jarnis that they were suing had not signed arbitration agreements.but the four assured the court that they controlled those entities,together with jarnis itself,because they controlled of the voting power in the partnership.they owned less than,but that was only because they had transferred some of their partnership interests to relatives and family trusts and both the relatives and the trusts were under their thumb.
the court ordered arbitration.that was in.the proceedings before the swelled when the arbitration was consolidated with two other arbitrations between the protracted,but finally ended in with an award that among other things ordered the defendants to repay jarnis more than million and ordered jarnis to reimburse the plaintiffs for million in attorneys fees.the district court confirmed the award in its entirety,and the flurry of appeals here consolidated for decision followed.
one of the appeals is by jarnis itself,from the district court refusal to allow it to intervene in the confirmation proceeding on the ground that it should have sought intervention earlier.the civil rules authorize the grant of intervention only upon timely application for it.naacp new york,d.the aim is to prevent a tardy intervenor from derailing a lawsuit within sight of the terminal and so as soon as a prospective intervenor knows or has reason to know that his interests might be adversely affected by the outcome of the litigation he must move promptly to intervene.united states south bend community school,cir see also reid illinois state board of education,cir sokaogon chippewa community babbitt,cir.jarnis argues that since it was not a party to the proceedings before the arbitrator it had no reason to intervene until the arbitrator unexpectedly ordered it to pay the plaintiffs attorneys fees.and it is certainly unusual as to be a nonparty to a litigation to be treated as jarnis was,namely as a defendant with respect to the attorneys fees.it was not until the arbitrator made the award against jarnis that it had a ground for it wanted more than the million that it was awarded,but it did not.
this discussion may seem to be leading ineluctably to the conclusion that jarnis was entitled to intervene in the district court more fundamentally,and without need to invoke rule,because someone against whom a judgment is entered is entitled to the rights of a party.motorola credit uzan,cir alemite staff,cir hand,devlin scardelletti,d in re bridgestone firestone,tires products liability litigation,cir cordoza pacific states steel,cir.and ordinarily the award of relief against a nonparty would be just the kind of ultra vires act by an arbitrator that would justify judicial intervention.a bem i,anthropologie,cir lindland wrestling ass n,cir katz feinberg,cir coady ashcraft gerel,cir.but not here.the only plausible motivation for
