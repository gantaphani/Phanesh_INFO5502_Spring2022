factual background 
during march and april,plaintiffs entered into seven separate purchase agreements with toll dublin for the purchase of condominium units in building at the villas in dublin ranch villages.according to plaintiffs complaint,during construction,toll dublin failed to take necessary precautions to keep the interior of building from becoming saturated with water allowed mold to form and fester inside of building and had actual knowledge of the wet,moldy,and unhealthful conditions,but hid and concealed these conditions from plaintiffs so that plaintiffs would close escrow on the problem homes.plaintiffs complaint also alleged that,shortly after plaintiffs closed escrow,in april and may,conditions inside building were so grave that toll dublin demanded that those plaintiffs that had actually moved in leave their new home and their belongings and relocate.similarly,as to those plaintiffs that had not even moved into building,toll dublin demanded that they not move in.since june and continuing through the date of this complaint,plaintiffs have been excluded from building while toll dublin has attempted to decontaminate building.the complaint further alleged that toll brothers and boyd also became aware of the wet and moldy conditions that existed within building in the months before the close of escrow,but failed to disclose the existence of these conditions to plaintiffs,and that plaintiffs were unaware of the existence of these conditions prior to the close of escrow.
discussion 
backgrounda.the arbitration provisions 
in their purchase agreements,plaintiffs indicated,with their initials,that they had received copies of numerous additional some,inter alia a title addendum compliance with civil codes sections,et title addendum a title master and dispute resolution declaration compliance with civil code title master declaration and a declaration of covenants,conditions and restrictions of the villas at dublin ranch villages cc rs.a copy of title,et was also included.
the title addendum,a document,provided,inter alia,in its initial two paragraphs 
title code sections et the term title refers to title,part of division of the california civil code,sections.this addendum and all of the documents attached to it exist for the purpose of implementing the requirements of title.title does a variety of things.it establishes standards for the performance of the property and allows seller to impose additional standards on itself title also requires that buyer be given a complete copy of title and certain written notifications 
attached documents attached to this addendum are the master declaration for title and dispute resolution title master declaration and the individual declaration and notices for title and dispute resolution title individual agreement these two documents and their exhibits implement the requirements of title and contain all of the items referred to in paragraph,above.
in addition to subsequent paragraphs related to such matters as an enhanced protection agreement,a fit and finish warranty,a maintenance manual,manufactured product information,and customer service information,it also provided information related to resolution of disputes,as follows 
alternative dispute resolution procedures the formal claim process described in paragraph,above,provides a process intended to resolve disputes without filing an action litigation or arbitration.if the formal claim process does not result in a resolution of a dispute,or if a dispute is not subject to the formal claim process,the dispute shall be resolved through the alternative binding dispute resolution procedures set forth in sections and of the title master declaration which provide as follows 
arbitration of disputes 
mandatory binding arbitration any dispute between any owner and builder or between the association and builder shall be resolved through the procedures established in this title master declaration 
federal arbitration act if negotiations,mediation or other dispute resolution procedures,including the formal claim process,fail to resolve the dispute,then the dispute shall be resolved by neutral,binding arbitration governed by the federal arbitration act and not by any court action except as provided for judicial review of arbitration proceedings under the federal arbitration act

waiver of jury trial by transferring title and by taking title to property,declarant parties,the association and each owner give up and waive any right to have any dispute tried before a jury.
following the arbitration of disputes provisions,the title addendum contains the following language 
statutory notice 
notice by initialing in the space below you are agreeing to have any dispute arising out of the matters included in the arbitration of disputes provision decided by neutral arbitration as provided by california law and you are giving up any rights you might possess to have the dispute litigated in a court or jury trial.by initialing in the space below you are giving up your judicial rights to discovery and appeal,unless those rights are specifically included in the arbitration of disputes provision.if you refuse to submit to arbitration after agreeing to this provision,you may be compelled to arbitrate under the authority of the california code of civil procedure.your agreement to this arbitration provision is voluntary.
we have read and understand the foregoing and agree to submit disputes arising out the matters sic included in the arbitration of disputes provision to neutral arbitration.
this language is followed by space for the buyer,seller,and affiliated general contractor initials,all of which were initialed in each title addendum.
near the conclusion of the title addendum,under the heading.buyer acknowledgement of review,the plaintiffs each initialed their copy in acknowledgement that a complete copy of this addendum and all documents attached to this addendum were provided to buyer for review on date received inserted.the reason for the delay between that date and the date of this addendum was to permit buyer to thoroughly review this addendum and all documents attached to this addendum.by signing this addendum,buyer agrees that it has been provided adequate opportunity to read and review this addendum and all documents attached to this addendum and that buyer agrees to abide by all of the terms of this addendum and all documents attached to this addendum.on the last page of the title addendum,toll dublin,toll brothers,and each plaintiff signed and dated the document.
the title master declaration,a document,which includes the arbitration of disputes provisions quoted in the title addendum,defines the term dispute as follows 
dispute the term dispute shall mean any claim,issue or controversy that arises from or is related in any way to i the project,ii the relationship between owner and builder,or iii the relationship between the association and builder,whether contractual,statutory or in tort.the term dispute includes,but is not limited to claims,issues or controversies that arise from or are related to the purchase,sale,condition,design,construction or materials used in construction of any portion of the project,the agreement between declarant and an owner to purchase a condominium or any related agreement,an enhanced protection agreement,a fit finish warranty,disclosures,or issues.disputes specifically include those relating to or arising out of any of the following

only toll dublin and toll brothers signed this document,which was recorded on january,more than two years before any plaintiff closed escrow on a home.
the cc rs,a document not including exhibits,which was recorded on may,also contains an arbitration provision,as follows 
disputes involving declarant any disputes,claims,issues or controversies between any owner and declarant or between the association and declarant regarding any matters that arise from or are in any way related to the project,the relationship between owner and declarant or the relationship between the association and declarant,whether contractual or tort,including,but not limited to,the purchase,sale,condition,design,construction or materials used in construction of any portion of the project,the agreement between declarant and owner to purchase a condominium or any related agreement,any claimed title violation as defined in the title master declaration or a deficiency as that term is defined in section of the california civil code shall be resolved in accordance with the claims processes and dispute resolution procedures established in the applicable title master declaration.
a copy of title,the statutory scheme contained in civil code section et,which is concerned with construction defect claims,was also provided to plaintiffs and contains a provision that expressly excludes fraud claims t his title does not apply to any action by a claimant to enforce a contract or express contractual provision,or any action for fraud,personal injury,or violation of statute,subd.a see also,this part does not cover,inter alia,claims.
b.the trial court ruling 
the trial court denied defendants motion to compel,concluding that the arbitration agreement was applicable only to claims brought pursuant to title.the court first noted that the title addendum states in its first paragraph that t his addendum and all of the documents attached to it exist for the purpose of implementing the requirements of title.the court found that t his language can not be interpreted in any way other than that,unless specifically exempted by specific language in the title addendum,the purpose of the title addendum is for the sole purpose of implementing each of the requirements of civil code.an analysis of the statutory scheme supports the conclusion that the claims at issue in this case are not subject to arbitration.the court then observed that title concerns itself exclusively with actions relating to construction defects in new construction projects and that causes of action for,inter alia,fraud were explicitly excluded from title statutory scheme.see.
the court then stated that the contractual language of the title addendum also supported its conclusion that the claims at issue were not subject to arbitration since,u nlike the specific reference found in paragraph of the title addendum where it states that seller has elected not to be subject to the provisions of chapter of title civil code,there is no language in the title addendum stating that the breadth of disputes covered by the arbitration agreement found in paragraph of the title addendum is different or contrary to the rather specific language found in civil code or.
the court then stated that the language in paragraph of the title addendum regarding a dispute that is not subject to the formal claims process was,at best,ambiguous insofar as that language refers to a construction defect dispute or if it is intended to include fraud claims notwithstanding their specific exclusion by civil code.compounding the ambiguity,the title master declaration defines,at paragraph,dispute in broad and general language and then explains it specifically includes claims relating to or arising out of any of the following and then lists four different types of claims,each of which relates directly to a construction defect type of dispute the title master declaration,in five,pages describes the formal claims process in exhaustive detail yet it never describes any act or process that could apply to any type of dispute other than one relating directly to a construction defect dispute.fn.omitted.
the court concluded it is unreasonable to interpret the general language of either the title addendum or the title master declaration as contradicting or superseding the specific language found in civil code which operates to exclude the type of fraud action filed herein from the remedies and procedures required by title.it directly follows that the arbitration provisions contained in the title addendum and in the title master declaration do not apply to the claims alleged by plaintiffs in their complaint.
ii.standard of review 
on appeal from the denial of a motion to compel arbitration,we review the arbitration agreement de novo to determine whether it is legally enforceable,applying general principles of california contract law.citations.citation.baker osborne development th,d baker.unconscionability is a question of law subject to de novo review,although factual issues may bear on that determination.citation.ibid accord,murphy check n go of california,th,d.
iii.breadth of the arbitration provisions 
we agree with the trial court conclusion,based on both the title statutory scheme and the contractual language of the agreement between the parties,that the dispute resolution provisions in the title addendum and the title master declaration apply only to title claims.first,the title addendum states that t his addendum and all of the documents attached to it exist for the purpose of implementing the requirements of title,which is expressly limited to actions involving construction defects in new construction projects.
second,although read in isolation,the provision in the title addendum regarding disputes not subject to the formal claims process and the broad definition of dispute in the title master declaration could possibly be read to apply to disputes other than title actions,in the context of the entire arbitration agreement,these general provisions can not reasonably be interpreted to apply to claims.see,employers reinsurance superior court th,d on review,w e consider the contract as a whole and interpret the language in context,ra
