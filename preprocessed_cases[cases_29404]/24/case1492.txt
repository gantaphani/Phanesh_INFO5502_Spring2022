the issues in this appeal involve the interplay of three arcane and technical areas of law the california disclosure obligations in contractual arbitration the california statute governing the vacating of arbitration awards and the limited preemptive effect of the federal arbitration act on state arbitration law.
responding to legislative mandate,the california judicial council promulgated the california ethics standards for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitration.west ann,vol,pt,appendix to cal.rules of court,division vi.the standards require arbitrators to make comprehensive disclosures of potential grounds for disqualification.on a showing that the arbitrator failed timely to disclose a ground for disqualification of which he or she was aware,the california code of civil procedure requires the vacating of any award rendered by the arbitrator.code civ,subd.a a a a.
by contrast,the federal arbitration act employs a different standard it permits the vacating of an arbitration award only on a showing of evident partiality by the arbitrator.a.when the issue is the arbitrator failure to disclose,the ninth circuit interprets evident partiality to mean that the undisclosed facts must create a reasonable impression of partiality.schmitz zilveti cir,see also commonwealth coatings continental cas,d.
in this case,appellants michael ovitz,artists production group,llc,and five other business entities we shall refer to all appellants collectively as the apg parties prevailed in an arbitration proceeding against respondent cathy schulman the trial court,however,vacated the arbitration award under section a a,finding that the arbitrator failed to comply with his disclosure obligation under standard b of the california standards.the apg parties appeal from this ruling,as well as from the trial court denial of their motion for reconsideration.they raise three alternative contentions the arbitrator complied with his disclosure obligation under standard b assuming he did not,schulman forfeited the right to vacate the arbitration award,and in any event the trial court should have reconsidered the forfeiture argument and assuming schulman did not forfeit the right to vacate the arbitration award,the federal arbitration act et faa preempts the california statute a a governing the vacating of an arbitration award for an arbitrator failure to disclose.
to resolve these issues,we examine the relevant disclosure requirements of the california standards past and present,and conclude that the arbitrator did not comply with his disclosure obligations.we further conclude that schulman did not forfeit the right to vacate the arbitration award,and that the trial court properly denied reconsideration of the apg parties forfeiture claim.finally,after reviewing the language of the relevant sections of the faa,the congressional purpose of that legislation,and the parties arbitration agreement,we hold that the faa does not preempt section a a.
factual and procedural background 
in june,respondent schulman entered an employment agreement with one of the apg parties,a joint venture called the venture.formed to produce to feature films over three years,the joint venture hired schulman as president.the employment agreement contained an arbitration clause,which required arbitration before the american arbitration association the aaa of a ny controversy,claim or dispute arising out of or in any way relating to this agreement or schulman employment by the joint venture.in february,simmering disputes between schulman and others involved in the venture led to schulman departure.schulman claimed that she was terminated without cause the joint venture claimed that she resigned.a subsequent settlement agreement between schulman and the apg parties failed to resolve all disputes.
in september,relying on the arbitration clause in schulman employment contract with the venture,the apg parties served a demand for arbitration on schulman,and filed a demand with the aaa.among other things,the demand sought arbitration of claims relating to the parties rights and duties under schulman employment agreement,and sought affirmative relief for the apg parties.schulman disputed whether the aaa had jurisdiction over her claims against the apg parties.in october,she filed a civil lawsuit in los angeles superior court alleging these claims cathy schulman michael ovitz,et al,case no.the apg parties then moved to compel arbitration.in december,the trial court granted the motion in part,compelling arbitration of schulman claims against the venture,but not her claims against the other apg parties.
the apg parties appealed the trial court ruling,but also moved forward with the arbitration.in a letter dated january,approved by schulman attorney,counsel for the apg parties informed the aaa that they and schulman had agreed upon the appointment of retired justice campbell lucas the arbitrator as their arbitrator.the letter stated that the designation of the arbitrator is also subject to all of the disclosure requirements imposed on him by the american arbitration association and the california code of civil procedure.
on january,the aaa faxed to counsel for schulman and the apg parties a cover letter stating in part in accordance with the california arbitration law section,the fully executed arbitrator disclosure form is enclosed for your review.the cover letter noted that the response date was january,and that a bsent our receipt of a proper notice of disqualification within the time specified,the appointment of the proposed arbitrator will be confirmed.accompanying the letter was a form,completed by the arbitrator,entitled arbitrator disclosure worksheet.in the body of our opinion,we will discuss the relevant contents of this form.
by the date specified in the aaa cover letter,neither schulman nor the apg parties filed a notice of disqualification,and the aaa confirmed the arbitrator appointment.in april the precise date is unclear from the record,the apg parties and schulman entered an agreement to submit all of their claims against each other to arbitration in the pending arbitration proceeding.the claims to be arbitrated included not simply the claims alleged in schulman complaint and in the apg parties arbitration demand,but all claims of any type.in relevant part,the agreement stated such arbitration shall be final and binding,and judicial review shall be limited as provided by california code of civil procedure or other applicable law.the arbitrator shall apply,as applicable,federal or california substantive law and law of remedies.the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the aaa national rules for the resolution of employment disputes in effect at the time the arbitration was initiated.
the arbitration proceeding began on september.on days through february,the arbitrator took evidence and heard argument.witnesses testified in person,seventeen by declaration.the parties introduced several hundred exhibits.on february,following closing arguments,the arbitrator orally ruled in favor of the apg parties on certain of their claims,and awarded them approximately million in damages.he found against schulman on all of her claims.on may,the arbitrator ruled that the apg parties were entitled to in attorney fees and costs.the arbitrator directed the apg parties to draft a written award reflecting his findings.
on may,after the apg parties had circulated a proposed draft of the award,the aaa faxed a letter to the attorneys for the apg parties and schulman directing their attention to an enclosed disclosure from the arbitrator.the disclosure was in the form of a letter dated may,from the arbitrator to the aaa,regarding the schulman arbitration,and a second arbitration entitled california national bank kathleen farnham and farnham security.the arbitrator wrote pursuant to my telephone conversation with two aaa representatives this afternoon concerning the above cases,i am writing to you to clarify the disclosures made.in the apg cathy schulman case,i made a complete disclosure.in the california national bank case,i made a complete disclosure.in the apg case,the claimant apg parties is represented by the greenwald,pauly firm,attorneys andrew pauly and jeffrey lewis appearing.in the california national bank case,the claimant is represented by the greenwald,pauly firm the same firm representing the apg parties in the schulman arbitration,but with,attorney joshua wayser appearing.since i had made a complete disclosure in the california national bank case,including the fact that i was already in arbitration with the greenwald,pauly firm in the apg cathy schulman case,i believed that the aaa case manager in the california national bank case would send my disclosure to the case manager in the apg cathy schulman case to see if there were any objections to my accepting the california national bank case.i received no objections in either case.i was appointed arbitrator in the california national bank case and conducted a preliminary hearing on march.on may,the california national bank case manager informed the parties that the case had been suspended since the deposits had not been paid pursuant to aaa rules.in the event there is any problem,i would be willing to recuse myself from the california national bank case without payment of any fee to me.
the disclosure letter states that the arbitrator was appointed and conducted a preliminary hearing in the california national bank case on march.because it is highly unlikely that the arbitrator was appointed the same date he conducted the first hearing,the precise date of the appointment is not clear from the disclosure letter.the only other evidence on the subject that appears in the record is contained in declarations submitted by the apg parties in support of their motion for reconsideration.these declarations suggest that the arbitrator and the attorneys for the law firm representing the apg parties had discussions in the california national bank case as early as january or february.we will summarize these declarations in our discussion of the trial court denial of reconsideration,below.
the cover letter from the aaa that accompanied the disclosure directed the parties in the schulman arbitration to lodge any objections to the arbitrator continued service within days.if any objection were raised,the aaa would decide the issue in accordance with aaa rules.on june and,schulman counsel sent letters to the aaa requesting the arbitrator disqualification.schulman contended,as here relevant,that the arbitrator violated the california standards and sections and,because he failed to disclose that he would entertain offers of employment from the law firm representing the apg parties,and failed to disclose his employment by that firm in the california national bank arbitration.on june,the aaa denied schulman disqualification request,and reaffirmed the arbitrator appointment.the aaa also denied a request for reconsideration.
on july,after schulman had submitted her objections to the initial draft award and the apg parties had submitted a revision,the aaa served the parties with the arbitrator final written award.consistent with his oral rulings,the arbitrator awarded the apg parties approximately million in damages and in attorney fees and costs,and found against schulman on all of her claims against the apg parties.
the apg parties filed a petition to confirm the arbitration award in superior court.schulman filed a response and a to vacate the award as she had in her disqualification requests filed with the aaa,schulman contended that the arbitrator had violated his disclosure obligations.after full briefing and argument,the trial court issued a thoughtful,detailed written ruling in which it denied the apg parties petition to confirm the award,and granted schulman to vacate the award.the apg parties moved for reconsideration.the court denied reconsideration,and alternatively ruled that even if reconsideration were granted,the court would affirm its prior ruling vacating the arbitration award.
discussion 
i.the arbitrator failed to comply timely with the relevant disclosure obligations of california standards and 
the apg parties contend that the arbitrator disclosure worksheet sent by the aaa on january,fully complied with the arbitrator disclosure obligations under the california standards.the argument,however,rests on a flawed understanding of the relevant standards,and an unlikely interpretation of the disclosure worksheet.as we explain,the worksheet did not contain the disclosure required by standard b of the california standards.further,without that disclosure,the arbitrator acceptance of employment in the california national bank case violated a separate provision of the standards standard c.also,the arbitrator failure to disclose that employment within calendar days violated two additional provisions standards c and d a i.we begin by summarizing the relevant provisions of the governing statutes and california that are,to say the least,intricate.
a.the requirements of the california standards 
seeking to provide minimum ethical standards and remedies for the arbitrator failure to comply with existing disclosure requirements jevne superior court cal th,d,internal quotation marks omitted,in the california legislature enacted revisions to the statutory duties of disclosure imposed on arbitrators in contractual arbitration.see azteca construction,adr consulting,th,d azteca.as part of this revamping,the legislature directed the california judicial council to adopt ethical standards for all neutral arbitrators effective july,subd.a.further,the legislature amended section,subdivision a to provide that i n any arbitration pursuant to an arbitration agreement,when a person is to serve as a neutral arbitrator,the proposed neutral arbitrator shall disclose all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be able to be impartial.among the statutory list of required disclosures in section is a ny matters required to be disclosed by the ethics standards for neutral arbitrators adopted by the judicial council pursuant to this chapter,subd.a.section,subdivision b provides the statutory time period and method for the arbitrator initial disclosure the proposed neutral arbitrator shall disclose all matters required to be disclosed pursuant to this section to all parties in writing within calendar days of service of notice of the proposed nomination or appointment.see also standard c.
the judicial council responded to the legislature mandate by adopting the california standards effective july,later revised effective january.the standards establish the minimum standards of conduct for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitration,and are intended to guide the conduct of arbitrators,to inform and protect participants in arbitration,and to promote public confidence in the arbitration process.standard a.they contain detailed disclosure requirements see standards,which supplement and expand the statutory listing of required disclosures contained in section,subdivision a,subd.a standard a see also west ann,vol.pt.appendix vi to rules of court,comment to standard.
one concern the standards address is the bias,or appearance of bias,that may flow from one side in an arbitration being a source or potential source of additional employment,and thus additional income,for the arbitrator.rept.to judicial counsel from general counsel michael bergeisen dated,re ethics standards for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitration amend cal.rules of court,division vi of the appendix,bergeisen rept.the standards initially dealt with this subject in former standard.the january revisions amended former standard and renumbered it standard.
standard prohibits the arbitrator from entertaining or accepting an offer of employment as a lawyer,an expert witness,or a consultant from a party or lawyer in the pending arbitration.standard a.however,it permits the arbitrator to entertain offers from the parties or their lawyers to serve in other capacities,if the arbitrator discloses that intent.further,it grants the parties the right to disqualify the arbitrator based on such a disclosure.thus,standard b provides in addition to the disclosures required by standards and,within ten calendar days of service of notice of the proposed nomination or appointment,a proposed arbitrator must disclose to all parties in writing if,while that arbitration is pending,he or she will entertain offers of employment or new professional relationships in any capacity other than as a lawyer,expert witness,or consultant from a party or a lawyer for a party,including offers to serve as a dispute resolution neutral in another case.a party may disqualify the arbitrator based on this disclosure by serving notice of disqualification in the manner and within the time specified in code of civil procedure section b.further,under subdivision c of standard,the arbitrator failure to make the disclosure required by standard b precludes the arbitrator from entertaining or accepting any offer of employment from the parties or their lawyers from the time of appointment until the conclusion of the arbitration.
the disclosure language of standard b reflects a modification of its predecessor,former standard b.the former standard required the arbitrator to disclose whether or not he or she will entertain offers of employment from the parties or their lawyers.cal.rules of court west,division vi,italics added.current standard b requires disclosure only if the arbitrator will entertain such offers.the judicial council staff proposed the change to clarify that arbitrators must make a disclosure only if they will entertain offers of employment while the arbitration is pending and that no disclosure would be required if the arbitrator would not entertain such offers.bergeisen,supra,at see also id.at.
the primary disclosure provision of the california standards is standard,which contains disclosure requirements applicable in all cases.as here relevant,it requires the arbitrator to disclose whether t he arbitrator is serving a s a neutral arbitrator in another prior or pending noncollective bargaining case involving a party to the current arbitration or a lawyer for a party.standard d a i,italics added.as with all the topics covered by standard,this duty of disclosure is a continuing one.standard f see standard a.further,i f an arbitrator subsequently becomes aware of a matter that must be disclosed under either subdivision d or e of standard,the arbitrator must disclose that matter to the parties in writing within calendar days after the arbitrator becomes aware of the matter.standard c.
the continuing duty to disclose service in another pending case involving the parties or their lawyers standard d a i is obviated if the arbitrator has made the disclosure of his intent to entertain such offers as required by standard b.thus,standard b provides if an arbitrator has disclosed to the parties in an arbitration that he or she will entertain offers of employment or of professional relationships from a party or lawyer for a party while the arbitration is pending as required by subdivision b of standard,the arbitrator is not required to disclose to the parties in that arbitration any such offer from a party or lawyer for a party that he or she subsequently receives or accepts while that arbitration is pending.
as pertinent to this case,the obligations imposed by these provisions may be summarized as follows if,while the current arbitration is pending,the arbitrator intends to entertain other offers of employment from the parties or their lawyers,the arbitrator must disclose that intention in writing within calendar days of service of notice of the arbitrator proposed nomination or appointment standard b assuming this disclosure is made and the arbitrator is not disqualified by a party,the arbitrator may accept such offers without the need for any further disclosure standard b assuming,however,that the arbitrator does not disclose an intent to entertain additional offers from the parties or their lawyers,the arbitrator can not accept any such offer until the current arbitration is concluded standard c and if,despite this prohibition,the arbitrator accepts such an offer,the arbitrator must disclose that fact to the parties in the current arbitration in writing standard d a i within calendar days standard c.
b.the contents of the arbitrator disclosure worksheet 
as we have noted,on january,the aaa provided the parties to the schulman arbitration with a copy of an arbitrator disclosure worksheet filled out by the arbitrator.intended to serve as the disclosure statement required by section,subdivision b,the wording of the form was directed to the arbitrator,not the parties.it began california code of civil procedure which incorporates ccp and the ethics standards for neutral arbitrators adopted by the california judicial council and ccp requires certain disclosures by a person nominated or appointed as an arbitrator.while the association makes this worksheet available to neutrals appointed to cases administered by the association,the ultimate obligation for compliance lies with the neutral.accordingly,please review the relevant statutory provisions and the enclosed material before completing this worksheet.
in a section entitled disclosures common to all arbitrators,the worksheet asked the arbitrator to check a box for yes or no in response to questions related to various disclosures required by the standards.in completing the form sent to the apg parties and schulman,the arbitrator checked yes in response to only one question are you serving or,within the preceding five years,have you served as a neutral arbitrator in another arbitration involving a party to the current arbitration or a lawyer for a party in a section entitled general provisions applicable to disclosure obligations,the worksheet gave instructions on certain disclosure obligations.one paragraph stated offers of employment or professional relationship.you are not required to disclose an offer of employment or professional relationship from a party or lawyer in the arbitration or a lawyer or law firm that is currently associated in the private practice of law with a lawyer in the arbitration if you have informed the parties about the offer and have sought their consent as required by subdivision d of standard of the ethics standards for neutral arbitrators.boldface in original.the reference to former standard d was outdated.the revised standards including standard b had taken effect on january,days before the aaa served the worksheet on the parties in the schulman arbitration.
the final portion of the worksheet stated please explain any yes answer to any above question make any additional disclosures you believe are appropriate.explaining his sole yes response,the arbitrator wrote that his records showed he had served as a neutral in two arbitrations involving the law firm representing the apg parties,and one involving the law firm representing schulman.he attached printouts with further details of the specific arbitrations.
c.the arbitrator disclosure worksheet did not comply with standard b 
missing from the arbitrator disclosure worksheet,summarized above,was any disclosure under standard b that is,a declaration if,while that arbitration is pending,the arbitrator will entertain offers of employment or new professional relationships from a party or a lawyer for a party.the document did contain the following instruction to the arbitrator you are not required to disclose an offer of employment or professional relationship from a party or lawyer in the arbitration or a lawyer or law firm that is currently associated in the private practice of law with a lawyer in the arbitration if you have informed the parties about the offer and have sought their consent as required by subdivision d of standard of the ethics standards for neutral arbitrators.
the apg parties argue that the mere inclusion of this sentence adequately disclosed the arbitrator intent to accept future offers of employment from the parties or their lawyers while the schulman arbitration was pending.as best we understand the logic,it is this the sentence told the arbitrator that he did not have to disclose offers from the parties or their lawyers if he complied with the consent procedure of former standard d former standard d applied only to consumer arbitrations as defined in the california standards schulman arbitration was not a consumer arbitration therefore,by negative implication,schulman should have understood that the arbitrator would entertain offers of employment while her arbitration was pending.
this logic is less a disclosure than a riddle.it relies on leaps of intuition rather than a commonsense understanding of the language used.as a means to communicate a simple arbitrator intent to accept offers of employment from the parties or their lawyers while schulman arbitration was collapses under its own weight.
moreover,the california standards are to be construed and applied to further the ir purpose and intent and in conformance with all applicable law.standard c.the purpose and intent of the standards is to guide the conduct of arbitrators,to inform and protect participants in arbitration,and to promote public confidence in the arbitration process.standard a see also id.at b.the judicial counsel staff recommended the elimination of former standard d on the rationale that the deletion will diminish protections for consumers somewhat,but staff believes that consumers ability under standard b to disqualify any arbitrator who has a policy of taking new employment from a party or attorney while the arbitration is pending carries sufficient protection.bergeisen,supra,at.these objectives contemplate a disclosure under standard b that reasonably conveys the arbitrator intent to entertain offers of employment from the parties or their lawyers.they do not contemplate the opaque,circuitous disclosure described by the apg parties.see international alliance of theatrical stage employees,laughon th,d party to arbitration was entitled to the functional equivalent of the disclosure mandated by statute,an explicit,formal proffer of the disqualifying information and an opportunity to object international alliance.
d.the arbitrator did not comply with standards c,c,and d a i 
having failed to comply with standard b,the arbitrator was precluded from serving as an arbitrator in any other matter involving the parties or any lawyer for the parties until the schulman arbitration was completed.standard c.however,apparently unaware of this prohibition,the arbitrator accepted appointment in the california national bank case.the precise date of the arbitrator appointment in the california national bank case is not clear.the disclosure letter dated may,states that the arbitrator was appointed in the california national bank case and conducted a preliminary hearing on march.it is likely the arbitrator entertained the offer to serve in the california national bank case and was appointed earlier than march,though the appellate record gives us no firm date.regardless,when appointed the arbitrator knew that attorneys from the same law firm represented both california national bank in its arbitration,and the apg parties in the schulman arbitration.further,as of his appointment in the california national bank case,the schulman arbitration was still pending.the first hearing in the california national bank case was held march.by that date,the arbitrator had finished the evidentiary proceedings in the schulman case and announced his oral rulings on the parties causes of action.but he had not yet ruled on the apg parties request for attorney fees or served his final arbitration award.
besides being prohibited by standard c,the arbitrator service in the california national bank arbitration was a matter covered by the disclosure requirement of standard d a i service a s a neutral arbitrator in another pending noncollective bargaining case for a lawyer for a party to the current arbitration.under standard c,the arbitrator was required to make that disclosure,in writing,within calendar days of his appointment in the california national bank case.however,the arbitrator did not make any written disclosure until may,when the aaa faxed to the parties a copy of the arbitrator disclosure letter dated may,nearly three months after the date of the first hearing in the california national bank case.by the date of the disclosure,the arbitrator had orally ruled the apg parties were entitled to attorney fees,and had directed the apg parties to draft a proposed arbitration award.
ii.section requires the vacating of the arbitration award 
under california law,an arbitrator failure to comply timely with his or her disclosure obligations risks a severe consequence the vacating of any arbitration award rendered by the arbitrator.section a a provides in relevant part that on a properly served and filed petition or response seeking to vacate an arbitration award see,the court shall vacate the award if the court determines any of the following an arbitrator making the award a failed to disclose within the time required for disclosure a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was then aware.italics added.on its face,the statute leaves no room for discretion.if a statutory ground for vacating the award exists,the trial court must vacate the award.see azteca,supra,th at,d international alliance,supra,th at,d.
in the instant case,the arbitrator failed in his initial disclosure statement to disclose timely a ground for disqualification under standard b,a disclosure if he would entertain other offers of employment from the parties or their lawyers.he then violated standard c by accepting appointment in the california national bank case,knowing of the involvement of the law firm representing the apg parties in the schulman arbitration.he also violated standards d a i and c by failing to disclose his service in that case within calendar days of his appointment.the apg parties do not dispute that at the time of the initial disclosure,the arbitrator in fact intended to entertain offers from the parties or their lawyers.thus,they concede that the arbitrator was then aware a a of this ground for disqualification.indeed,we can not conceive of a situation in which an arbitrator would not be aware of his own intent to entertain such offers although,from a practical standpoint,the failure to make such a disclosure would be insignificant absent the entertaining or acceptance of an offer.hence,within the time required for disclosure,the arbitrator failed to disclose two grounds of which he was aware that would otherwise justify intent to entertain offers of employment from the parties attorneys standard b,and his subsequent acceptance of such employment standards d a i and c.these failures require that the arbitration award be vacated.a a.
iii.schulman did not forfeit the right to vacate the arbitration award 
the apg parties contend that schulman did not timely seek to disqualify the arbitrator on the basis of his initial disclosure,and therefore forfeited her right to vacate the award based on any disclosure violation.the plain meaning of section,which provides the statutory time frame for seeking disqualification of an arbitrator,defeats this contention.
as here relevant,in cases,within calendar days of service of notice of the proposed nomination or appointment,the arbitrator must make a written disclosure of all matters listed in standards d and e of which he or she is then aware,as well as the disclosure required by standard b if he or she intends to accept other employment from the parties or their lawyers.standard c,subd.b.under section,subdivision a,if the proposed neutral arbitrator fails to make this initial written disclosure,a party may have him or her disqualified by serving a notice of disqualification within calendar days after the proposed nominee or appointee fails to comply with section.see also standard a.similarly,if the proposed neutral arbitrator complies with the initial disclosure obligation,section,subdivision b provides that he or she shall be disqualified on the basis of the disclosure statement after any party entitled to receive the disclosure serves a notice of disqualification within calendar days after service of the disclosure statement.see also standard a.
section,subdivision c contains a limited provision under which a party is deemed to have waived the right to disqualify the arbitrator if the party fails to act within the time period provided in section,subdivisions a or b.thus,section,subdivision c provides in part the right of a party to disqualify a proposed neutral arbitrator pursuant to this section shall be waived if the party fails to serve the notice pursuant to the times set forth in this section referring to the period of subds.a and b,unless the proposed nominee or appointee makes a material omission or material misrepresentation in his or her disclosure.italics added.
in the instant case,the arbitrator initial disclosure statement contained a material omission it failed to disclose under standard b that he intended to entertain other offers of employment from the parties or their attorneys.even if not initially material,it certainly became material when,in violation of standard c,the arbitrator accepted appointment in the california national bank case,and failed timely to disclose it under standards d a i and c.thus,although schulman did not challenge the arbitrator within calendar days after the arbitrator initial disclosure,she did not waive her right to challenge him.the waiver rule of section,subdivision c manifestly applies only when the proposed arbitrator has made the requisite disclosure.international alliance,supra,th at,d.
iv.the trial court properly denied reconsideration 
the apg parties contend that the trial court erred in denying their motion for reconsideration of the order vacating the arbitration award.in making the motion in the trial court,the apg parties cited a decision by the ninth circuit,and argued that new facts existed.the recent decision was fidelity federal bank,durga ma cir fidelity.a s a matter of first impression for the ninth circuit,fidelity held that a party with constructive knowledge of potential partiality of an arbitrator waives its right to challenge an arbitration award based on evident partiality if it fails to object to the arbitrator appointment or his failure to make disclosures until after an award is issued.id.at.
the apg parties purported new facts were contained in declarations filed by andrew pauly,one of the attorney who represented the apg parties in the schulman arbitration,and james ellis and bryce johnson,who were attorneys for the apg parties.according to these declarations,on a date in late january or early february,before the arbitrator announced his oral rulings,the declarants and one of schulman attorneys,edward kubec,were present during a break in the proceedings when the arbitrator made a telephone call to the aaa case administrator for the california national bank case.the arbitrator left a message asking the case administrator to set up a conference call involving the arbitrator and the attorneys in the california national bank case,including joshua wayser of pauly law firm.after the call,kubec made a comment indicating knowledge that pauly firm was involved in the california national bank case.james ellis recalled the comment to be what is this,are you guys trying to buy up all of his time 
in moving for reconsideration,the apg parties argued,in substance,that california law conflicts with federal law as reflected in the ninth circuit fidelity decision that federal law preempts california law and that under the constructive knowledge standard of fidelity,schulman had waived her right to seek an order vacating the award.
schulman opposed the motion for reconsideration on procedural and substantive grounds.the opposition included a declaration from kubec in which he denied knowledge of any telephone call the arbitrator may have made concerning the california national bank arbitration.he stated that he only learned of the arbitrator involvement in that arbitration upon receipt of the letter from the aaa dated may,which enclosed the arbitrator disclosure letter.
the trial court denied reconsideration,finding that the apg parties failed to present new law or new facts.in the alternative,the trial court reaffirmed its prior ruling vacating the arbitration award.both rulings are sound.to obtain reconsideration under section,subdivision a,a party must show new or different facts,circumstances,or law,and must present a satisfactory explanation for failing to provide the new evidence or law earlier.baldwin home savings of america th,d.the standard of review of the trial court ruling is abuse of discretion.glade glade th,d.
the apg parties failed to meet their burden to justify reconsideration.the fidelity decision was not new law.the ninth circuit relied on earlier decisions from other circuits that invoked the waiver principle under circumstances in which a complaining party either knew or should have known of the facts indicating partiality of an arbitrator but failed to raise an objection prior to the arbitration decision.fidelity,supra,at,citing as examples jci communications,int l of workers,local cir,and kiernan piper jaffray,cir.thus,the apg parties could have relied on these decisions to raise the issue earlier.decisions by the ninth circuit have no greater persuasive force on california courts than those of other circuits.forsyth jones th,d forsyth.also,the apg parties kubec alleged overhearing of the arbitrator telephone call,and kubec purported comment concerning pauly firm buying the arbitrator not new.the apg parties certainly knew of it at the time the arbitration award was vacated.
thus,the apg parties failed to satisfy the requirements of section,subdivision a,and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying reconsideration.in the alternative,the trial court reaffirmed its vacating of the arbitration award.in part,the trial court decline d to credit the recent recollection of the purportedly new evidence presented by the apg parties.this credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence the declaration of attorney kubec,and will not be on appeal.griffith san diego for women cal d,griffith enyart city of los angeles th,fn,d.therefore,even if the apg parties evidentiary showing might have supported application of the fidelity waiver rule an issue we do not reach,the trial court rejection of the evidence precludes an appellate finding of waiver 
v.the federal arbitration act does not preempt section a a 
the apg parties contend that even if the arbitrator failed in his disclosure obligations,the failure does not require the vacating of the arbitration award.the reason the faa preempts california law governing the vacating of an arbitration award.we conclude,however,that a review of the relevant statutory language,the congressional purpose of the faa,and the parties arbitration agreement demonstrates that the faa does not preempt section a a.
in,congress passed the faa to overrule the judiciary longstanding refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate and to place such agreements upon the same footing as other contracts,where it belongs.cronus investments,concierge services cal th,d,cronus.the faa applies to arbitrations held under arbitration clauses in written contracts evidencing a transaction involving commerce.in the instant case,the parties agree that the faa applies to the schulman arbitration.
section a of the faa provides in relevant part in any of the following cases the united states court in and for the district wherein the award was made may make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,or either of them.italics added.the apg parties contend that section a of the faa preempts application of section a a in two ways.first,according to the apg parties,the evident partiality standard of section a of the faa permits the vacating of an arbitration award for inadequate disclosure only if the undisclosed facts create a reasonable impression of partiality.schmitz zilveti,supra,at see also commonwealth coatings continental cas,supra,at.the apg parties assert that this standard preempts section a a,which mandates the vacating of an arbitration award for any violation of california disclosure obligations,regardless of whether the undisclosed facts create a reasonable impression of partiality.second,when a party has constructive knowledge of a ground for disqualification but remains silent,the apg parties argue that the waiver rule of fidelity federal bank,supra,at page,preempts section a a.
we quickly dispose of the second purported area of ninth circuit holding in fidelity.it is not clear whether the fidelity waiver rule has its roots in section a of the faa,or whether it is a judicially created procedural principle independent of the statute.of course,if the rule is judicially created without a basis in the statute,it likely can not be a predicate for federal preemption through the faa.see siegel prudential ins.th,d siegel.moreover,as the fidelity opinion notes,s everal federal courts hold that a party failure to object to the real or evident partiality of an arbitrator before an award is issued does not waive the challenge unless the party had real,actual knowledge of the conflict.fidelity,supra,at,italics added.thus,even if the fidelity rule of waiver based on constructive knowledge derives from section a of the faa,the rule is not a universally accepted principle.as we have noted,decisions of the ninth circuit are no more persuasive in california than decisions of other circuits.forsyth,supra,th at,d.more importantly,in the instant case,the only evidence that would arguably support application of fidelity was presented in the declarations filed in support of the apg parties motion for reconsideration.the trial court,however,declined to credit those declarations,and we will not set that determination aside.griffith,supra,cal d at.thus,deciding whether fidelity preempts california law is of no consequence to this appeal.see palermo stockton theatres,cal d,young three for one oil royalties cal d.finally,even if the fidelity waiver rule is a proper predicate for preemption deriving from section a of the faa,and even if it were material to this appeal,it could have no greater preemptive effect than section a itself.for all these reasons,we decline to discuss fidelity further.we will rest our decision on consideration of the preemptive effect of section a alone.
a.the relevant statutory language of the faa applies to federal district courts 
our discussion of the first ground of preemption asserted by the apg by the evident partiality standard of section a of the some preliminary qualification.there is considerable debate among the federal circuits concerning the proper test of evident partiality under section a.montez prudential securities,cir,see generally,comment,what an arbitrator should investigate and disclose proposing a new test for evident partiality under the federal arbitration act case res,and cases therein cited.the united states supreme court has considered the subject only once,in commonwealth coatings continental cas,supra,d,a decision open to interpretation.see anr coal,cogentrix of north carolina,cir,fn.olson merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.understanding the uncertainty,we will assume that the ninth circuit reasonable impression of partiality test is the correct definition.see britz,food dairy th,d.that assumption in place,the answer to whether section a of the faa preempts california law lies in the relevant statutory language of the faa,the purpose of that legislation,and the parties arbitration agreement.
in cases to which it applies,the faa has a limited preemptive effect on state law.hedges carrigan th,d.the faa contains no express provision,nor does it reflect a congressional intent to occupy the entire field of arbitration.citation.but even when congress has not completely displaced state regulation in an area,state law may nonetheless be to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal is,to the extent that it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.citation.cronus,supra,cal th at,d,quoting volt info.sciences leland stanford,d volt.
one guide to congressional intent is the plain meaning of the federal statutory language.rosenthal great western fin.securities cal th,d,rosenthal.the language of the relevant sections of the and suggest that they apply only in federal court proceedings.section a states the statutory grounds under the faa for vacating an arbitration award upon application of a party.it expressly refers to orders to vacate made by the united states court in and for the district wherein the award was made.similarly,subdivision b of section,which governs the vacating of an award issued under united states code section,provides that t he united states district court for the district wherein the award was made may vacate the award section of the faa provides the procedure for presenting a motion to vacate.in relevant part,it refers to service of the motion on a resident of the district within which the award was made,and service on a nonresident by the marshal of any district within which the adverse party may be found.this language strongly suggests that sections and apply only to federal district courts,not state trial courts.siegel,supra,th at,d statutory language of sections and weighs materially against application to a forum other than the united states district court of the district in which the award was made see cronus,supra,cal th at,d,phrases court of the united states in section,and united states district court in section,indicate that those sections apply only in federal court.thus,the wording of the relevant sections of the faa evidences a congressional intent not to preempt state law.
section.a a is not inconsistent with the purpose of the faa 
as the california supreme court has recognized,absent an express preemption provision,federal statutory language does not resolve the question of preemption.rosenthal,supra,cal th at,d.courts must also consider the broader objectives of the federal legislation.
both the california and united states supreme courts have held that congress intended the faa to ensure that arbitration agreements are enforced according to their own terms,thereby encouraging the use of private arbitration as a means of resolving disputes.the california supreme court recently summarized the decisions discussing the faa purpose.section of the faa is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary.the effect of the section is to create a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability,applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the act.citation.thus,the faa establishes that,as a matter of federal law,any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver,delay,or a like defense to arbitrability.citation.the policy of enforceability established by section of the faa is binding on state courts as well as federal courts.citation.however,the faa purpose is not to provide special status for arbitration agreements,but only to make arbitration agreements as enforceable as other contracts,but not more so.citation.in accord with this purpose,the high court has stated that state contract rules generally govern the construction of arbitration agreements.citations.t he federal policy is simply to ensure the enforceability,according to their terms,of private agreements to arbitrate.citation.cronus,supra,cal th at,d,see siegel,supra,th at,d reviewing united states supreme court precedent and legislative history.further,n othing in the legislative reports and debates concerning the faa evidences a congressional intention that postaward and state court litigation rules be preempted so long as the basic policy upholding the enforceability of arbitration agreements remained in full force and effect.siegel,supra,th at,d.
by its terms,section a a does not undermine the enforceability of arbitration agreements.it neither limits the rights of contracting parties to submit disputes to arbitration,nor discourages persons from using arbitration.section a a merely requires the vacating of an award if the arbitrator failed timely to disclose a groun
