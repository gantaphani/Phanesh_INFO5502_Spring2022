appellants also appeal the district court refusal to impose rule sanctions against the stillwells for seeking attorney fees and litigation costs.the stillwells cross appeal the district court denial of their motion for attorney fees and costs.we affirm.
in february,the stillwells purchased a homeowners policy issued by american reliable.the policy contained an arbitration clause that provided,in part,as follows 
any and all disputes,controversies or claims of any kind and nature between you and us arising out of or in any way related to the validity,interpretation,performance or breach of any provisions of this policy,and upon which a settlement has not been reached by you and us,shall be resolved exclusively,by arbitration in accordance with the federal arbitration act et seq.
shortly thereafter,the stillwells mobile home sustained damage in a wind storm.after an initial dispute about whether the loss was covered by the american reliable policy,the parties settled the stillwells claim for property loss.
in february,the stillwells filed an action in state court against american reliable and campbell insurance for various claims relating to the policy,alleging that american reliable and campbell insurance handled their claim under the policy in bad faith and violated certain west virginia statutory provisions regarding the handling of insurance claims american reliable and campbell filed an answer that included a number of affirmative defenses however,the answer did not invoke the arbitration clause.in april,the stillwells amended the complaint to add american bankers as a defendant and to convert the lawsuit into a class action for the first time,in answering the amended complaint,appellants invoked the arbitration clause.
on may,after the state court proceedings had been in progress for months,appellants filed a joint motion in state court to compel arbitration and stay judicial proceedings,pursuant to the federal arbitration act faa.see west supp.on june,the west virginia state court denied appellants motion to compel arbitration and stay judicial proceedings,concluding that the policy was a contract of adhesion and that appellants proffered no evidence that the parties to this contract knowingly bargained for an arbitration clause.
on may,while appellants motion to compel arbitration was pending in state court,appellants filed,but did not serve,this action in federal court seeking to compel arbitration of the stillwells state law same issue that appellants had raised and ultimately lost in state court.appellants completed service of the federal complaint only after the state court denied their motion to compel arbitration three weeks later.moreover,almost immediately after the state court issued its decision,appellants filed a motion in district court to compel arbitration of the stillwells state law claims.appellants argued that the state court issued an erroneous ruling which failed to follow federal law under the faa and which denied the motion to compel arbitration and urged the district court to rectify the situation by enforc ing federal law under the faa and enter ing an order compelling the parties dispute to arbitration.american reliable,d at.in response,the stillwells filed a motion to dismiss the federal action on numerous grounds,including the doctrine,the younger abstention doctrine,and principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel.
while awaiting a decision from the district court,appellants attempted to obtain review of the state trial court denial of arbitration in the west virginia appellate courts.first,appellants moved unsuccessfully in the state trial court for an order certifying the arbitration question for interlocutory appeal to the west virginia supreme court of appeals.next,appellants petitioned the west virginia supreme court for a writ of prohibition against the enforcement of the trial court order denying arbitration,which the supreme court refused to grant.then,appellants filed a petition seeking permission to appeal the state trial court rejection of arbitration to the west virginia supreme court,which was also denied.ultimately,appellants unsuccessfully sought review of the denial of the petition for appeal in the united states supreme court.see american reliable ins.stillwell,d.
the district court concluded that appellants federal lawsuit was the functional equivalent of an appeal from the june,state court decision denying demonstrated,the district court reasoned,by appellants failure to actively pursue their complaint and petition to compel arbitration until after the state court ruling.american reliable,d at.based on that conclusion,the district court held that it was precluded by the doctrine from considering an identical motion to compel arbitration and dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
alternatively,the court found that appellants,having litigate d the state court case for a period of months before they even mentioned that they wished to enforce the arbitration provision in the contract,waived the right to invoke the arbitration clause.id.at additionally,the district court determined that even if the and waiver doctrines did not apply,federal court abstention was appropriate under the colorado river doctrine of abstention because the federal action was not filed until more than months after the state court case was filed,the defendants are challenging the validity of the arbitration clause,which implicates state law,the state court forum is adequate to protect the federal plaintiffs rights,and the state court has already ruled on the issue before this court.id.at.
on appeal,appellants challenge each of the bases identified by the district court in support of its order of dismissal.because we agree that the district court properly applied the doctrine,we do not reach appellants additional arguments.
under the doctrine,a party losing in state court is barred from seeking what in substance would be appellate review of the state judgment in a united states district court.johnson de grandy,d.we regard the doctrine as jurisdictional.see friedman,dunlap,cir because the doctrine is jurisdictional,we are obliged to address it before proceeding further in our analysis.plyler moore,cir under the doctrine,lower federal courts do not have jurisdiction to review decisions.jordahl democratic party of,cir noting that the doctrine is a jurisdictional matter that a court is empowered to raise sua sponte.the notion that is jurisdictional rests on two basic propositions of federal jurisdiction.brown root,breckenridge,cir.one is that congress vested the authority to review state court judgments in the united states supreme court alone under a.id.at.the other is that congress has empowered the federal district courts to exercise only original jurisdiction.id.at.the doctrine,therefore,preserves a fundamental tenet in our system of federalism that,with the exception of habeas cases,appellate review of state court decisions occurs first within the state appellate system and then in the united states supreme court.see plyler,at.a litigant may not circumvent these jurisdictional mandates by instituting a federal action which,although not styled as an appeal,amounts to nothing more than an attempt to seek review of the state court decision by a lower federal court.id.at see jordahl democratic party of,cir
