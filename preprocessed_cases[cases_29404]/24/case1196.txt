under the mandatory fee arbitration act mfaa,bus,et when there is a fee dispute between an attorney and a client,the client may choose to submit the matter to arbitration by a local bar association.if the client elects such arbitration,the attorney must agree to arbitrate.the arbitration will be binding,however,only if the attorney and client so agree in writing after the dispute has arisen.otherwise,either party may request a trial de novo within days after the arbitration has concluded.
we consider in this case the relationship between arbitration under the mfaa,which authorizes a trial de novo,and a predispute contractual arbitration agreement entered into by an attorney and client pursuant to the california arbitration act caa,code civ,et.in aguilar lerner cal th,d,aguilar,as explained at greater length below,we determined that a client who had not chosen mfaa arbitration could not oppose a motion to compel contractual arbitration under the caa by invoking the mfaa right to a trial de novo,because in not choosing mfaa arbitration,the client had waived any rights he or she may have had under the mfaa.we left undecided the issue of whether a client who does choose mfaa arbitration may request a trial de novo after that arbitration has concluded,when to do so would defeat the attorney motion to compel contractual arbitration under the caa.
although the majority of the court declined to reach this question in aguilar,justice chin,joined by justices baxter and brown,addressed the issue in a concurring opinion.justice chin concluded,for reasons discussed below,that the mfaa right to a trial de novo was not intended to override a contractual obligation to arbitrate disputes pursuant to the caa.he,therefore,would have disapproved of a court of appeal case that held to the contrary,alternative systems,carey th,d alternative systems.
the court of appeal in the present case declined to follow justice chin concurring opinion and held that the mfaa right to a trial de novo after statutory arbitration defeats any contractual obligation to arbitrate fee disputes.we granted review to resolve this issue.
we conclude that the court of appeal is incorrect.although the language of the statute is not entirely free from ambiguity,construing the statute in light of the presumption against implied repeal leads to the conclusion that the mfaa does not limit the ability of attorneys and clients to enter into binding contractual arbitration.we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal.
factual and procedural history 
the essential facts,as quoted from the court of appeal opinion,are not in dispute.in a february agreement,richard schatz retained the law firm of allen matkins leck gamble mallory allen matkins to represent him in a dispute with another doctor concerning the assignment of income from a partnership.the agreement stated it would also apply to any additional matters we handle on your behalf or at your direction.the agreement contained an arbitration section,which provided if you do not agree to arbitrate disputes with us,simply line out this section.arbitration is not a precondition to us representing you.by signing this letter without deleting this section,you agree that,in the event of any dispute arising out of or relating to this agreement,our relationship,or the services performed including but not limited to disputes regarding attorneys fees or costs,such dispute shall be resolved by submission to binding arbitration in san diego county,california,before a retired judge or justice schatz signed the agreement without lining out the arbitration section.
in february,without entering into another agreement,schatz retained allen matkins to represent him in an easement dispute with a different party or parties affecting the rear access road to his rancho santa fe home.schatz paid allen matkins in fees and costs incurred in the matter allen matkins proceeded to trial,and in an april letter to schatz,it demanded an additional in outstanding fees and costs so arbitration will not be necessary.
schatz did not respond,and allen matkins apparently did nothing for some time.in a january letter to him,allen matkins invoked the arbitration clause of the agreement in the previous partnership dispute matter.in a written response,schatz asserted his fee dispute concerned undisclosed conflicts of interest in the easement matter.schatz claimed the agreement arbitration provision did not apply because it did not refer to the easement litigation and its reference to additional matters was not highlighted or otherwise emphasized.alternatively,schatz claimed the arbitration provision was illegal under alternative systems,supra,th,d.schatz advised he wished to exercise his statutory rights to nonbinding fee arbitration,and,if he so elects,trial de novo before a jury.
allen matkins advised schatz it believed the arbitration provision applied,but it agreed to nonbinding arbitration under the mfaa through the san diego county bar association bar association.allen matkins provided schatz with an application for the arbitration along with rules and instructions on the procedure.allen matkins requested that schatz notify it within days if he elected nonbinding arbitration.
at schatz insistence,allen matkins then provided him with a statutory notice of client right to arbitration.the notice provides a client has days from the date of its receipt to apply for arbitration.
the matter was arbitrated in april through the bar association,and the following month the arbitrators ruled in favor of allen matkins.schatz then filed a complaint seeking a trial de novo,declaratory relief and refund of attorney fees.in response,allen matkins petitioned to compel binding arbitration under the preexisting agreement.in his opposition,schatz argued that the mfaa,as construed by the alternative systems court,invalidate d the binding arbitration provision,and in reply,allen matkins argued that in aguilar the supreme court impliedly abrogated the holding in alternative systems,and binding contractual arbitration would satisfy the mfaa de novo trial requirement.the court agreed with schatz and denied the petition to compel arbitration.
the court of appeal,for reasons discussed below,agreed with the trial court,and we granted allen matkins petition for review.
discussion 
overview of the mfaa and caa 
in aguilar,we contrasted the mfaa and caa arbitration schemes.the caa represents a comprehensive statutory scheme regulating private arbitration in this state.et through this detailed statutory scheme,the legislature has expressed a strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution.citation.the statutes set forth procedures for the enforcement of agreements to arbitrate code civ,establish rules for the conduct of arbitration proceedings except as the parties otherwise agree,describe the circumstances in which arbitrators awards may be judicially vacated,corrected,confirmed,and enforced,and specify where,when,and how court proceedings relating to arbitration matters shall occur.citation.
by contrast,the mfaa constitutes a separate and distinct arbitration scheme.the mfaa was first proposed by the board of governors of the state bar of california in when,finding that disputes concerning legal fees were the most serious problem between members of the bar and the public,the board sought to create a mechanism for arbitrating disputes over legal fees and costs.recognizing the disparity in bargaining power in attorney fee matters which favors the attorney in dealings with infrequent consumers of legal services hargarten ardisson,fine tuning california mandatory attorney fee arbitration statute,that many clients could not afford hiring additional counsel to litigate fee disputes in the civil courts ibid,and that previous schemes that called for voluntary arbitration were ineffective id.at,the legislature enacted the mfaa.the original legislation provided in pertinent part the board of governors of the state bar of california shall,by rule,establish,maintain,and administer a system and procedure for the arbitration of disputes concerning fees charged for professional services by members of the state bar or by members of the bar of other jurisdictions.stats,ch.this mandate has been expanded to include mediation,but is otherwise unchanged today,subd.a.
in contrast to the caa,which is governed by the code of civil procedure,the mfaa has its own rules and limitations,as set forth in the business and professions code.as one appellate court has described it,the mfaa is a closed system and the binding arbitration agreed to is the arbitration conducted by a local bar association under the mfaa,not some other private alternative dispute resolution provided by another forum.alternative systems,supra,th at pp.d.the primary limitation of the mfaa is that it applies only to disputes concerning legal fees,costs,or both,subd.a and is specifically inapplicable to c laims for affirmative relief against the attorney for damages or otherwise based upon alleged malpractice or professional misconduct,subd.b.by contrast,virtually any civil dispute,including claims of legal malpractice,can be the subject of arbitration under the caa.citations.
the nature of the obligation to arbitrate under the mfaa differs from that under standard arbitration in two important ways.first,the obligation to arbitrate under the mfaa is based on a statutory directive and not the parties agreement.thus,a client may invoke the mfaa and proceed to arbitration despite the absence of any prior agreement to do so.by contrast,standard arbitration requires that both parties to a dispute agree to arbitrate.citation.
second,section,subdivision c provides a rbitration under this article shall be voluntary for a client and shall be mandatory for an attorney if commenced by a client.in other words,whereas a client can not be forced under the mfaa to arbitrate a dispute concerning legal fees,at the client election an unwilling attorney can be forced to do so.
the finality of an arbitration award under the mfaa also generally differs from an award rendered pursuant to standard arbitration under the caa.although parties choosing to resolve their dispute in standard arbitration pursuant to the caa typically expect that the arbitrator decision will be final citations,an award rendered pursuant to an arbitration under the mfaa is nonbinding,and either party may seek a trial de novo,subd.a.the mfaa,however,also provides that the parties may agree in writing that the arbitrator award will be binding.ibid.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.
the mfaa does not explicitly refer to caa arbitration and the relationship between the two arbitration schemes is not immediately apparent.however,section,subdivision a states the rules adopted by the board of governors shall provide that an attorney shall forward a written notice to the client prior to or at the time of service of summons or claim in an action against the client,or prior to or at the commencement of any other proceeding against the client under a contract between attorney and client which provides for an alternative to arbitration under this article,for recovery of fees,costs,or both.the term any other proceeding under a contract between attorney and client,which was added by a amendment stats,ch,can be fairly inferred to include contractual arbitration under the caa.see aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,conc.opn.of chin.
section,subdivision b further provides in pertinent part if an attorney,or the attorney assignee,commences an action in any court or any other proceeding and the client is entitled to maintain arbitration under this article,the client may stay the action or other proceeding by serving and filing a request for arbitration in accordance with the rules established by the board of governors pursuant to subdivision a of section.subdivision c provides in part upon filing and service of the request for arbitration,the action or other proceeding shall be automatically stayed until the award of the arbitrators is issued or the arbitration is otherwise terminated.the stay may be vacated in whole or in part,after a hearing duly noticed by any party or the court,if and to the extent the court finds that the matter is not appropriate for arbitration under the provisions of this article.the action or other proceeding may thereafter proceed subject to the provisions of section.
section in turn provides in subdivision a that t he parties may agree in writing to be bound by the award of arbitrators appointed pursuant to this article at any time after the dispute over fees,costs,or both,has arisen.in the absence of such an agreement,either party shall be entitled to a trial after arbitration if sought within days,pursuant to subdivisions b and c,with one exception not relevant here.subdivision b provides in pertinent part if there is an action pending,the trial after arbitration shall be initiated by filing a rejection of arbitration award and request for trial after arbitration in that action within days after mailing of notice of the award.subdivision c provides if no action is pending,the trial after arbitration shall be initiated by the commencement of an action in the court having jurisdiction over the amount of money in controversy within days after mailing of notice of the award.after the filing of such an action,the action shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of part commencing with section of the code of civil procedure,concerning civil actions generally.
alternative systems,aguilar,and the court of appeal opinion 
two cases are critical to understanding the court of appeal holding in the present case.in alternative systems,supra,th,d,a fee dispute arose related to a contract calling for binding arbitration governed by the american arbitration association aaa.the attorney invoked the binding arbitration clause,but the client demanded arbitration under the mfaa,and after the arbitration,timely rejected the arbitration award and requested a trial.it then sought unsuccessfully to stay the aaa arbitration and made a special appearance at that arbitration to challenge the arbitrator jurisdiction.the arbitrator rendered an award in favor of the attorney,and the client moved to vacate the award on the grounds that contractual arbitration was preempted by the mfaa with its right to trial de novo.the trial court denied the motion.
the court of appeal reversed.the court noted that t he legislature amended the mfa a in,effective january.client protections have been strengthened so that the provisions for notice,dismissal and stays now likewise apply to any other proceeding initiated by an attorney to resolve a fee dispute.under the current scheme,an attorney must also give mandatory notice when he or she commences any other proceeding against the client under a contract between attorney and client which provides for an alternative to arbitration under this article,subd.a,as amended by stats,ch.failure to give notice is a ground to dismiss other proceedings as well.and now the client can also invoke a stay of any other proceeding for fees commenced by the attorney.ibid.alternative systems,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
the court observed that t he main public policy informing the mfa a is to alleviate the disparity in bargaining power in attorney fee matters which favors the attorney by providing an effective,inexpensive remedy to a client which does not necessitate the hiring of a second attorney.citation.the process favors the client in that unless the client agrees in writing to arbitrate all fee disputes under the mfa a only the client can elect mandatory arbitration of a fee dispute the attorney must submit the matter to arbitration if the client makes that election.citation.alternative systems,supra,th at,d.the court also noted that a formal advisory opinion of the standing committee on professional responsibility and conduct of the state bar had concluded that a binding arbitration agreement between client and attorney contravenes the letter and spirit of the mfa a,essentially because the statute is a scheme in which the commitment to be bound by arbitration would appear to follow only after the client has been made aware of the right to judicial review after an mfaa arbitration,quoting cal.compendium on responsibility,pt.iia,state bar formal opn.the court went on to note that the amendments to the mfa a resolve this point by requiring that written waiver of the right to trial de novo must occur after the dispute arises,subd.a.alternative systems,at,d.
the court also rejected the attorney argument that an aaa arbitration proceeding would suffice as the trial after arbitration within the meaning of section this is a farfetched notion and of course the statute does not so provide.indeed,section makes it clear that the trial is commenced by a court action and proceeds in accordance with provisions generally pertaining to civil actions,subd.c.alternative systems,supra,th at,fn,d.
in aguilar,supra,cal th,d,a dispute arose between an attorney and client,with the latter suing the former for malpractice.in filing such an action,the client waived his right to arbitrate the fee dispute under the mfaa,subd.d.the attorney moved to compel binding arbitration pursuant to the caa and added a claim for unpaid attorneys fees and costs.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.the client contended that under the mfaa,arbitration was optional for the client and could not be compelled,and that therefore the motion to compel should not be granted.like the lower courts,we concluded that the client may not defeat a motion to compel,because in waiving his right to an mfaa arbitration,he waived all rights that a client may have under the mfaa scheme.id.at,d.the court expressly declined to decide whether the client could have defeated the motion to compel arbitration at the conclusion of the mfaa arbitration if the client had not waived his mfaa arbitration rights.id.at,fn,d.
justice chin,in a concurring opinion joined by justices baxter and brown,addressed that precise issue.justice chin drew a very different lesson from the amendments discussed above than had the alternative systems court.he quoted section,subdivision a,as amended in,which requires an attorney to inform the client of the client right to arbitration under the mfaa prior to or at the time of service of summons or claim in an action against the client,or prior to or at the commencement of any other proceeding against the client under a contract between attorney and client which provides for an alternative to arbitration under this article aguilar,supra,cal th,d,conc.opn.of chin.justice chin then stated the italicized language acknowledges that the parties may agree to some proceeding to resolve the controversy other than a judicial action,such as binding arbitration under the caa.the same section goes on to provide that if an attorney commences an action in any court or any other proceeding,the client may stay the action or other proceeding by requesting arbitration under the mfaa,which must be done prior to the filing of an answer in the action or equivalent response in the other proceeding,subd.b,italics added.if the client does request nonbinding arbitration,the action or other proceeding shall be automatically stayed until the award of the arbitrators is issued or the arbitration is otherwise terminated,subd.c,italics added.this means that if the client requests nonbinding arbitration under the mfaa,the judicial action or other proceeding is stayed,but only until the nonbinding arbitration is finished.the other proceeding is merely stayed pending the nonbinding arbitration,not dismissed permanently.ibid.
justice chin acknowledged that i n some respects,the mfaa statutory language is not entirely clear.section,subdivision c,also states that a court may vacate the stay if it finds the matter not appropriate for nonbinding arbitration under the mfaa,and that t he action or other proceeding may thereafter proceed subject to the provisions of section.section,in turn,provides that the parties to the nonbinding arbitration may agree to be bound by the arbitrators award,but,as it reads today,only after the controversy has arisen.it also states that if there is no such agreement,either party shall be entitled to a trial after arbitration if sought within days,subd.a,italics added.the statute goes on to provide how the trial after arbitration shall be initiated both when an action is already pending and when no action is pending,subds.b c.in the latter situation,the trial after arbitration shall be initiated by the commencement of an action in the court having jurisdiction over the amount of money in controversy,subd.c,italics added.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,conc.opn.of chin,
yet justice chin rejected the inference the alternative systems court drew from this language that the client right to trial de novo trumps contractual obligations under binding arbitration.although this reading of section is plausible if the section is viewed in isolation,the section does not exist in isolation but is part of the mfaa,which includes section.it is a cardinal rule of statutory construction,that every statute should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect.citation.the references to a trial and court action in section do not negate section.in context,and in order to give effect to section,section must be construed as merely providing the procedure to follow if the nonbinding arbitration is followed by a judicial action,not as prohibiting the parties from agreeing to some other proceeding.the latter interpretation would make meaningless section acknowledgment that the parties may agree to some form of dispute resolution other than judicial action,and its repeated references to some proceeding other than a court action.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,conc.opn.of chin.
justice chin also rejected alternative systems because of what he viewed as the illogical consequences of the decision.we are holding today that a client who does not request nonbinding arbitration has waived the mfaa protections,and the binding arbitration agreement is enforceable.if alternative systems were to remain valid,that would mean that a client who agreed to binding arbitration could evade that agreement simply by requesting nonbinding arbitration.the lesson future clients who had agreed to binding arbitration would learn from this case is that if they want to evade their agreement,they must demand nonbinding arbitration whether or not they otherwise want it.future clients who wish to sue in court despite an arbitration agreement will be forced to go to nonbinding arbitration before they could do so.this situation would be unfortunate for two reasons.first,it would permit a client to evade an arbitration agreement by a simple procedural device,contrary to the letter and intent of the caa.second,it would require,as a prerequisite to evading the arbitration agreement,that the client pursue nonbinding arbitration.this would result in many sham nonbinding arbitrations that neither party wanted or intended to accept.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,conc.opn.of chin.
justice chin concluded we can not reasonably conclude that the legislature created a system whereby clients who agree to binding arbitration may evade that agreement,but only if they go through the charade of demanding and obtaining a nonbinding arbitration that they may not want,and would violate our policy of giving effect where possible to arbitration agreements.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,conc.opn.of chin,j.
the court of appeal in the present case disagreed with the analysis in justice chin concurring opinion.noting justice chin observation that the statutory language was ambiguous,the court looked to the legislative history.after citing various items of legislative history showing that the original legislation was consumer oriented,the court stated given the legislature intent,we resolve any tension between sections and in favor of upholding client protections under the mfaa.under justice chin analysis,section right to trial de novo is rendered meaningless for clients who signed retainer agreements with binding arbitration clauses before any fee dispute arose.since the legislature sought to rectify disparities in bargaining power between clients and attorneys that favor attorneys,and to foster clients trust in the legal sy
