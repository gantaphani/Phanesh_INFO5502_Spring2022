this appeal presents the primary question whether,in a case in which a party seeks to vacate an arbitration award,the amount in controversy for diversity jurisdiction under a is measured by the amount of the award or by the amount in dispute in the underlying litigation between the parties.the arbitration award which theis research,theis moved to vacate was for zero dollars.contemporaneously with that motion,theis filed a complaint that sought damages from brown bain b b in excess of million.the claims theis alleged in this complaint substantially mirrored the claims it had asserted in the arbitration proceeding,which claims the arbitrator had rejected.

facts and proceedings 
b b was theis attorney in patent litigation that turned out badly.theis demanded arbitration of claims against b b for legal malpractice,breach of fiduciary duty,fraud and breach of contract.the ensuing arbitration resulted in a zero dollar award to each party.in commenting on the litigation that spawned the arbitration,the arbitrator stated 
viewed as a whole,the litigation that is the subject of this arbitration was an almost unmitigated disaster both for theis and for b b.the hopes of theis and its investors were dashed years of work by theis and others went unrequited b b got no return on millions of dollars of invested time,and had to chalk up a major loss on its results chart.
dissatisfied with the arbitrator decision,theis filed in the united states district court a complaint for breach of professional and fiduciary duty,legal malpractice,and fraud application and notice of motion to vacate arbitration award.theis also demanded a jury trial.the claims theis set forth in its complaint sought compensatory damages of million,plus exemplary and punitive damages.
after court proceedings which are not relevant to the issues before us,b b filed a motion to confirm the arbitrator award.theis responded with a renewed motion to vacate the award and a motion for partial summary judgment.the district court denied theis motion to vacate and its motion for partial summary judgment.the court granted b b motion to confirm the award.thereafter,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of b b,which judgment rejected all of the claims theis asserted in its complaint.this appeal followed.
on december,we filed a memorandum disposition affirming the district court summary judgment in favor of b b.at the time our memorandum disposition was filed,there did not appear to be any reason to question the existence of the district court subject matter jurisdiction the parties were diverse,and neither party suggested,nor did it occur to us,that the amount in controversy might not meet the monetary threshold requirement of a.
the question of subject matter jurisdiction was called to our attention by luong circuit city stores,cir luong i,an opinion now withdrawn,which was filed after we had filed our memorandum disposition.in the luong i opinion,a panel of this court,with one member of the panel dissenting,held that the amount in controversy on a petition to vacate an arbitration award should be measured by the amount of the award rather than the amount of the claim in the underlying dispute.id.at.applying this measure,luong i determined that because no monetary damages had been awarded by the arbitrator,the amount in controversy requirement for diversity jurisdiction had not been met.id.in view of what appeared to be similarities between luong i and this case,we recalled our mandate and awaited finality of the luong i decision.
the luong i panel subsequently withdrew its opinion and replaced it with a new opinion,in which the panel unanimously held that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction predicated upon the existence of a federal question under.luong circuit city stores,cir luong ii.in the luong ii opinion,the panel did not address the question whether the amount in controversy in a proceeding to vacate an arbitration award should be determined by the amount of the award or by the amount at issue in the underlying dispute.this case presents that question.to resolve it,we ordered supplemental briefing limited to the issue whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction.we now conclude that the district court had diversity jurisdiction pursuant to.our previously filed memorandum disposition is withdrawn,and we file this opinion affirming the district court summary judgment in favor of b
