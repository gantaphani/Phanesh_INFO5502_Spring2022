cifaldi contacted daniel ruper,konen supervisor at russel metals.ruper participated in the negotiations as a union steward,but has since taken a supervisory position with russel metals.cifaldi informed ruper about konen allegations,and said that he would provide ruper with a copy of the petition.
on november,konen was called into a meeting with ruper,plant manager charlie brown,and union steward tom moe.at the meeting,konen admitted that he authored the bribery allegation.he also asserted that the separate page of allegations was not part of the petition,to which brown responded,well,that does matter.konen then acknowledged that he had no proof of the alleged misconduct,and that it was wrong for him to hand in the page of allegations.brown suspended konen pending further investigation.
the next day,konen called cifaldi to inform him that he had been suspended.cifaldi advised konen to file a grievance over the suspension.he also asked konen to come to the union hall for a meeting with union and company representatives about the bribery allegations.
at the meeting,cifaldi and seb busalacchi represented local,and brown and ruper represented the company.the union requested company representatives to be present because the allegations in konen notes implicated both the union and the company in wrongdoing.seb asked the company representatives if they were aware of information that would substantiate the bribery allegations they responded that they were not aware of any such information.seb also asked konen whether he had any evidence to substantiate his allegations.konen responded by apologizing,admitting that he had no evidence to support his allegations,and that he never should have written them konen also asserted that the page of allegations was not part of the petition.but he also acknowledged that he made a mistake,wanted to see the whole thing go away,and would go to the workplace to apologize to everyone.
after concluding its investigation,russel metals decided to terminate konen.that decision was made by plant manager brown and corporate industrial relations manager bob rohrer.rohrer,who had the final authority to terminate konen,stated that he fired konen because he believed that konen allegations directly maligned russel metals and the way it deals with unions.rohrer concluded that konen conduct constituted dishonesty under the terms of the cba,and that konen was subject to immediate discharge.
russel metals informed konen of its decision in a november,letter signed by plant manager brown,which stated in part 
your employment is being terminated for dishonesty.you have admitted to personally preparing and disseminating in our workplace an employee petition that contains false,misleading,factually untrue and serious allegations of improper and unlawful actions being taken by representatives of the company and union during the collective agreement negotiations that occurred in.
before konen received the letter,cifaldi had called him to notify him of his termination and to advise konen to file a grievance.according to konen,cifaldi indicated that he was angry at him,but he told konen that his personal feelings toward him did not matter and that it was still cifaldi job to represent him.konen filed a grievance on november,and a grievance meeting was scheduled for november.
prior to the grievance meeting,konen met with cifaldi and a union steward.cifaldi asked konen how he could attack the termination decision.konen offered no suggestions,but reiterated that the page of notes was not part of the petition.konen apologized again about the matter,and told cifaldi that he was willing to do whatever was necessary to put the incident behind him.
brown and ruper represented russel metals at the november grievance meeting.brown again asked konen if he authored the document containing the bribery allegations konen affirmed that he did write the allegations.then brown reaffirmed that konen was terminated because the document he authored was dishonest and slanderous.cifaldi asked konen if he had a defense for his actions.konen did not give an answer.instead,he apologized and said that he should not have written the statements.
later that day,cifaldi sent konen a letter informing him that the union decided to deny his grievance.konen attorney wrote to the union,requesting local to submit konen grievance to arbitration.local counsel responded by letter dated december,that the union decided not to arbitrate konen grievance,and that the grievance procedure was at an end.no one has brought internal union charges against konen for the incidents that led to his discharge.
