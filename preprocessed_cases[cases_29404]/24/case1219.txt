prudential argued that all of betancourt claims related to employment and therefore were subject to arbitration pursuant to the agreement.prudential also asserted that betancourt paga claim was not exempt from arbitration because it was not really a paga action.prudential asserted betancourt action,in substance,was a standard wage and hour case,and therefore was subject to arbitration.prudential further noted that betancourt was seeking remedies that did not fall within a paga cause of action,such as business expenses,unpaid wages,interest,attorney fees,and costs prudential argued betancourt was attempting to evade arbitration by labeling his wage and hour claims as a paga case.
opposition 
betancourt opposed the motion to compel arbitration.first,betancourt asserted there was insufficient evidence of a valid agreement to arbitrate.prudential submitted the declaration of a custodian of records,which betancourt argued was woefully inadequate.second,betancourt contended his complaint only set forth a paga claim,and the prayer for relief section of the complaint was not determinative of the type of claim raised.third,betancourt asserted the waiver of betancourt right to bring a representative case was unenforceable because it would violate the state of california substantive right to have its laws enforced.
fourth,betancourt argued the agreement was unconscionable because a betancourt had no opportunity to negotiate the agreement b betancourt was not given a copy of the agreement,instead the agreement was explained to him c the agreement could be interpreted as causing betancourt to waive his right to bring a paga case a right that can not be waived d the agreement could cause betancourt to bear unreasonable costs and e the agreement is illusory and lacks mutuality.
on august,the trial court held a hearing on prudential motion.at the beginning of the hearing,the trial court explained that a paga claim is not subject to an agreement to arbitrate.iskanian,supra,cal th.the trial court further explained that,to the extent betancourt requested remedies are inconsistent with a paga case,the proper procedure would be for prudential to file a motion to strike.the trial court stated its tentative ruling was to deny prudential motion pursuant to iskanian.
prudential said betancourt claims should be subject to arbitration,and therefore it did not understand how it could bring a motion to strike.the trial court explained that prudential would be requesting a bifurcated trial on some of the labor code violations.the trial court said,my suggestion is do all your discovery,and then file a motion to strike once you established exactly what labor code violations he alleging.the court stated that prudential would need to separate the paga and claims.the trial court concluded,a motion to compel arbitration is not the proper vehicle.the trial court denied prudential motion without prejudice to prudential filing a motion to strike.
discussion

because the trial court denial of prudential motion was based upon a decision of law,we apply the de novo standard of review carlson home team pest defense,th.
t o bring a motion to compel arbitration,a party must plead and prove the parties written agreement to arbitrate a controversy a request or demand by one party to the other party or parties for arbitration of such controversy pursuant to and under the terms of their written arbitration agreement and the refusal of the other party or parties to arbitrate such controversy pursuant to and under the terms of their written arbitration agreement.sky sports,superior court th,italics omitted.a party who has not signed an arbitration agreement can not be compelled to arbitrate.additionally,a party who has not signed an arbitration agreement can not be compelled to arbitrate merely because the complaint defined the injured group as including employees who had signed arbitration agreements.ibid.
the paga was designed to address two problems.the first problem was that alleged labor code violations often went unenforced because they were punishable as criminal misdemeanors,and prosecutors rarely investigated or prosecuted the alleged violations.the second problem was that when civil penalties could be assessed,there were few government resources to pursue enforcement of the penalties.iskanian,supra,cal th at.
in response to these problems,the legislature enacted the labor code private attorneys general act of paga,which authorizes aggrieved employees,acting as private attorneys general,to recover civil penalties for labor code violations.iskanian,supra,cal th at.in a lawsuit brought under the paga,the employee plaintiff represents the same legal right and interest as state labor law enforcement agencies namely,recovery of civil penalties that otherwise would have been assessed and collected by the labor workforce development agency.id.at.the civil penalties recovered on behalf of the state under the paga are distinct from the statutory damages to which employees may be entitled in their individual capacities.id.at.a paga representative action is therefore a type of qui tam action.id.at.
