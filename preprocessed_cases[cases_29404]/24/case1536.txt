this case requires us to resolve a conflict between the rules of the american arbitration association aaa and the provisions of the california arbitration act the act code civ,et pertaining to the disqualification of a proposed neutral arbitrator based on disclosures that might affect his or her impartiality.
the parties here agreed to private arbitration in accordance with the aaa then entitled construction industry dispute resolution rules and procedures hereafter aaa rules.those rules included a provision which stated that where one party objects to the continued service of an arbitrator,the aaa shall decide whether the arbitrator should be disqualified,and that its determination of the issue shall be conclusive.
on the other hand,the act permits either party uncomfortable with the disclosures of any proposed arbitrator to disqualify him or her within days after receiving the disclosure statement,subd.b.if the arbitrator fails to disqualify himself or herself upon timely demand,there is a drastic of the award,subd.a b.
in this case,plaintiff azteca construction,azteca demanded disqualification of the proposed arbitrator within days after receiving his disclosure statement.acting pursuant to its internal rules,the aaa determined that there was no good cause for disqualification,affirmed the appointment of the arbitrator,and the arbitration proceeded to its conclusion.
azteca filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award for noncompliance with relevant provisions of the act.the trial court ruled that azteca had waived these provisions by agreeing to aaa arbitration,and more specifically the rule giving the aaa conclusive authority over challenges to the arbitrator neutrality.
the trial court erred.the provisions for arbitrator disqualification established by the california legislature may not be waived or superseded by a private contract.the arbitrator refusal to disqualify himself following azteca timely demand rendered the award subject to vacatur.we shall reverse with directions.
procedural and factual background 
this case involves a dispute between azteca and defendant adr consulting,adr consulting arising out of a written contract whereby adr consulting agreed to provide consulting services to azteca.the contract contained a clause that provided that any dispute arising out of the agreement shall be resolved through the american arbitration association using the aaa rules at the time of the events in question,former rule b of those rules rule b provided that u pon objection of a party to the continued service of a neutral arbitrator,the aaa shall determine whether the arbitrator should be disqualified and shall inform the parties of its decision,which shall be conclusive.
in october,adr consulting served a demand on azteca for arbitration in accordance with the aaa rules.because the parties were unable to agree on a neutral arbitrator from the aaa list,the aaa proposed that attorney paul taylor arbitrate the dispute.in compliance with section taylor submitted a disclosure statement,which was distributed to both sides on november.
taylor disclosure statement revealed that he had,within the past five years,served as a neutral arbitrator on matters in which george gore adr consulting counsel had represented one or more parties.specifically,taylor recalled only that these matters have included administrative hearings on behalf of the university of california.taylor also disclosed that he had a prior relationship with gore in that in approximately and for about a year,the same construction company employed both him and gore.finally,a conflicts check run by the law firm to which taylor was of counsel reported a case in which azteca was listed as a potential adverse party to one of its clients taylor stated that he had no personal recollection of any knowledge of this matter,nor had he made inquiry of the attorney at his firm responsible for handling it.ibid.
on november,azteca,through its,wrote to the aaa formally objecting to taylor proposed appointment and requesting his removal as arbitrator,based on his disclosed relationship with gore.after conducting an investigation,the aaa determined that taylor should not be disqualified,and notified the parties on november,that it had reaffirmed taylor appointment as arbitrator.
an arbitration hearing was conducted and on march,taylor rendered an interim award,ordering azteca to pay adr consulting,plus the costs of the arbitration.
counsel for azteca then wrote to taylor,requesting that he forthwith disqualify himself as arbitrator,reminding him that azteca had served notice of his disqualification on november.responding to the letter,the aaa reasserted its authority under its rule b to adjudicate any objection to taylor continued service.taylor issued a final award on april.
azteca filed a petition to vacate the award,claiming that taylor was required to disqualify himself upon timely receipt of azteca objection under section,subdivisions b and d,and the ethics standards for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitration,adopted by the judicial council.pt.west,ann.rules supp,div.vi,former stds.a now std.a b now std.b,hereafter ethics standards.
the trial court denied the petition.although it found that azteca submitted a timely demand for disqualification prior to the arbitration,the court ruled that azteca had waived the right to disqualify taylor under the act by agreeing to arbitration in conformance with the aaa rules.the court indicated that were it to consider the matter of the aaa refusal to disqualify taylor de novo,it would conclude that there was nothing in taylor disclosure statement that required disqualification.
discussion 
recent revisions to the act and the present case 
in,the legislature significantly revised the disclosure requirements and procedures for disqualifying arbitrators pursuant to private or contractual arbitration,as amended by stats,ch.section,subdivision a,was amended to require an appointed arbitrator disclosure of any fact that might reasonably lead a person to doubt his or her ability to be impartial the judicial council was directed to adopt ethical standards for all neutral arbitrators effective july,and the ethics standards,which now appear in division vi of the appendix to the california rules of court,were made applicable to proposed arbitrators,subd.a.section was also added,clarifying the procedure for disqualification of proposed arbitrators.stats,ch.
under the act,proposed neutrals have days from the date of service of their proposed nomination or appointment to make the disclosures required by law,subd.b.the parties then have days to file a notice of disqualification either for failure to comply with disclosure duties,subd.a,or if full disclosure was made,based on the facts actually disclosed,subd.b.
until azteca demanded taylor removal,the arbitrator selection process here conformed in all aspects to the act.by letter of november,the aaa selected taylor as the proposed arbitrator and attached his disclosure statement,in ostensible compliance with section 
taylor statement listed several disclosures reflecting on his neutrality,including a prior working relationship with gore,the fact that azteca was a potential adverse party to a client of a law firm with which taylor was associated,and the fact that taylor had previously arbitrated cases in which gore represented one or more parties.
section,subdivision b,provides that a proposed arbitrator who complies with his or her disclosure obligations under section,shall be disqualified on the basis of the disclosure statement if either party serves a notice of disqualification within days.italics added.this subdivision confers on both parties the unqualified right to remove a proposed arbitrator based on any disclosure required by law which could affect his or her neutrality.see also ethics standards,former std.a now std.a.there is no good faith or good cause requirement for the exercise of this right,nor is there a limit on the number of proposed neutrals who may be disqualified in this manner.knight et,cal.practice guide alternative dispute resolution the rutter group,knight.as long as the objection is based on a required disclosure,a party right to remove the proposed neutral by giving timely notice is absolute.
azteca november,letter demanding taylor removal was based on one of his disclosures and was served within days as required by statute.moreover,the trial court made the unchallenged finding that the letter was a timely demand for disqualification.thus,if the provisions of the act had been followed,taylor disqualification should have been automatic.
however,taylor did not disqualify himself,nor did the aaa require his removal.instead,the aaa proceeded to apply its own rule b,which gave it the sole right to rule on any objection to the continued service of an arbitrator.overruling azteca demand for removal,the aaa reaffirmed taylor as arbitrator and the arbitration proceeded to its conclusion.the trial court upheld this procedure because w hatever rights azteca had to challenge the arbitrator under california law,it agreed to waive or alter those rights by agreeing to abide by the aaa rules.
the correctness of the trial court ruling is a legal issue involving statutory construction and the ascertainment of legislative intent,which we review de novo.spielholz superior court th,d.
ii.did azteca waive its right to challenge the arbitrator under the act 
in recent times,there has been a rapid expansion of private or contractual arbitration as a mechanism for dispute resolution.aguilar lerner cal th,d.although t he scope of arbitration is a matter of agreement between the parties citation,and t he powers of an arbitrator are limited and circumscribed by the agreement or stipulation of submission moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,moncharsh,the process has historically been subject to extensive legislative supervision.id.at,d.
the act represents a comprehensive statutory scheme regulating private arbitration in this state.et moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.section and following provisions that set forth procedures for the enforcement of agreements to arbitrate,establish rules for the conduct of arbitration proceedings except as the parties otherwise agree,describe the circumstances in which arbitrators awards may be judicially vacated,corrected,confirmed,and enforced,and specify where,when,and how court proceedings relating to arbitration matters shall occur code civ.vandenberg superior court cal th,d.
over the years,the legislature has revised and refined the standards for judicial oversight of arbitration awards.the law has evolved from its common law origins and moved towards a more clearly delineated scheme rooted in statute.moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.
as the california supreme court noted in moncharsh,the legislature has severely restricted judicial interference in the merits of an arbitrator decision.moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.arbitrators are not bound by rules of law,but may base their decisions on broad principles of justice and equity.id.at,d.with narrow exceptions,the courts are not permitted to review the validity of an arbitrator reasoning or the sufficiency of the evidence to support the award.id.at,d,crowell downey community hospital foundation th,d crowell.
precisely because arbitrators wield such mighty and largely unchecked power,the legislature has taken an increasingly more active role in protecting the fairness of the process.moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.in,section was added,enumerating required disclosures for proposed arbitrators.stats,ch.while awards have traditionally been subject to vacatur if procured by fraud,corruption or misconduct of the arbitrator or if the arbitrator exceeded his or her powers,subd.a,in,the legislature added as a ground for annulment of an award that the arbitrator was subject to disqualification upon grounds specified in section but failed upon receipt of timely demand to disqualify himself or herself as required by that provision.crowell,supra,th at,d,quoting former,subd.f,as amended by stats,ch,italics added.
the legislation arose out of a perceived lack of rigorous ethical standards in the private arbitration industry by the governor and the judicial council,the bill sought to provide basic measures of consumer protection with respect to private arbitration,such as minimum ethical standards and remedies for the arbitrator failure to comply with existing disclosure requirements.bill analysis,supra.recent developments thus evince an unmistakable legislative intent to oversee and enforce ethical standards for private arbitrators.
adr consulting acknowledges that taylor was subject to the disclosure provisions of the act,but contends that when it comes to the mechanism for disqualification,the trial court properly ruled that rule b,took precedence over the statutory scheme,based on freedom of contract principles.adr consulting argues that the trial court properly gave effect to the parties voluntary contractual limitation on their statutory disqualification rights,citing the basic maxim in civil code section,that a party is free to waive a statutory provision intended for his benefit.
the full text of civil code section provides anyone may waive the advantage of a law intended solely for his benefit.but a law established for a public reason can not be contravened by a private agreement.italics added.as our state supreme court pointed out,a literal construction of this statute would be unreasonable,for it is difficult to conceive of a statutory right enacted solely for the benefit of private individuals that does not also have an incidental public benefit.bickel city of piedmont cal th,fn,d.therefore,a party may waive a statutory right where its public benefit is merely incidental to its primary purpose,but a waiver is unenforceable where it would seriously compromise any public purpose that the statute was intended to serve.deberard properties,lim cal th,d,quoting bickel,at,d.stated another way,civil code section prohibits a waiver of statutory rights where the public benefit of the statute is one of its primary purposes.deberard,at,d.
courts have applied this principle,either expressly or by implication,to annul or restrict contractual arbitration provisions that run afoul of statutory rights that benefit the public.for example,in armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,armendariz,the california supreme court held that an arbitration agreement could not be used as a vehicle to waive statutory rights created by the california fair employment and housing act feha.armendariz,at,d.thus,while it was not unlawful per se for the parties to agree to arbitrate feha claims,the rules of that arbitration must be judicially scrutinized to ensure that the employee is effectively able to vindicate his or her statutory rights in the arbitral forum.id.at,d.relying on civil code section,as well as civil code section id.at,d,the high court invalidated or limited certain provisions of an agreement to arbitrate feha claims.id.at,d.
in crowell,supra,th,d,the court voided a provision in an arbitration agreement that purported to expand judicial review of the arbitrator findings of fact and conclusions of law beyond that provided by the act.the court found that the clause was inconsistent with the statutory scheme designed to ensure finality of the arbitrator decision.id.at,d.
and in alternative systems,carey th,d,a case with a fact pattern closest to that here,the court was confronted with an fee agreement,which provided that all fee disputes were to be arbitrated by the aaa in accordance with its rules and procedures.id.at,d.the aaa method of dispute resolution conflicted with the client rights under the mandatory fee arbitration mfa statutes bus,et citing civil code section,carey held that mfa,which was enacted for the public benefit,preempted the aaa arbitration clause in the contract.carey,at,d.
it is our view that rule b must yield to the disqualification scheme set forth in sections and,for a number of reasons.first,there is no doubt that these statutes were enacted primarily for a public purpose.as we have seen,the legislature has gone out of its way,particularly in recent years,to regulate in the area of arbitrator neutrality by revising the procedures relating to the disqualification o
