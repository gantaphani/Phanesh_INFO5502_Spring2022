when plaintiff tony martinez,was hired as a salesperson for defendant master protection corporation,doing business as firemaster,he signed an arbitration agreement providing that all claims related to his employment,including claims for statutory violations,torts and discrimination,would be subject to arbitration.martinez,whom the trial court ordered into arbitration,contends the arbitration agreement is unconscionable and unenforceable.martinez also contends the court erred in appointing an arbitrator after the arbitral forum chosen by the parties refused to conduct the arbitration.
we conclude the arbitration agreement is procedurally and substantively unconscionable,permeated with illegality,and unenforceable.we further conclude the trial court lacked authority to appoint an arbitrator after the chosen arbitral forum refused to conduct the arbitration.
factual and procedural background 
firemaster hired martinez in summer.martinez was terminated by firemaster in april.in february,martinez sued firemaster for alleged labor code violations,national origin discrimination in violation of the fair employment and housing act feha,government code section violations,and wrongful termination.
firemaster moved to compel arbitration based on a july,agreement martinez was required to sign as a condition of his employment martinez opposed the motion,arguing the arbitration agreement was unconscionable and unenforceable.the trial court disagreed,granted the motion,and stayed the litigation pending completion of the arbitration.
as dictated by the terms of the arbitration agreement,martinez submitted his claims to the american arbitration association aaa.aaa,however,twice determined the arbitration agreement did not satisfy the requirements of its rules and due process protocols for disputes,and refused to conduct an arbitration.aaa specified two reasons for its refusal to arbitrate firemaster failed timely to notify aaa of its intent to use the association services to resolve employment disputes,and had not filed a copy of its alternative dispute resolution plan for such disputes with aaa and aaa policy was against conducting arbitrations on employment plans such as firemaster,which gave parties less time to assert claims than would otherwise be available by statute 
after aaa refused to conduct the arbitration,martinez filed a motion to lift the stay of court proceedings and revive the litigation.the trial court denied the motion and appointed a new arbitrator.code civ.
an arbitration was conducted by a retired superior court judge.the arbitrator issued a award,which found martinez had failed to demonstrate his termination was racially motivated or the result of unlawful retaliation for his complaints about unpaid commissions.
martinez objected to the award on the ground it failed to satisfy the arbitration agreement requirement that the arbitrator render an award and opinion in the form typically rendered in labor arbitrations.the arbitrator then contacted firemaster counsel and directed him to prepare the award.firemaster attorney did so,and the arbitrator signed the proposed award,as prepared by counsel and without considering martinez objections to firemaster draft award.
martinez petitioned to vacate the arbitration award.the court denied the petition,confirmed the award and entered judgment.this appeal followed.
discussion 
martinez contends the judgment must be reversed because the arbitration agreement is unconscionable and unenforceable the trial court lacked authority to appoint another arbitrator after aaa refused to conduct the arbitration and the court erred in denying his motion to vacate the arbitration award.our agreement with the first two contentions obviates the need to address the third.
firemaster arbitration agreement is procedurally and substantively unconscionable,permeated with illegality,and unenforceable.
martinez insists the arbitration agreement is unenforceable because it contains illegal clauses,is permeated with an unlawful purpose,and its unconscionable provisions can not be severed or restricted to cure the illegality.
unconscionability analysis begins with an inquiry into whether the contract is one of adhesion.citation.the term contract of adhesion signifies a standardized contract,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.citation.if the contract is adhesive,the court must then determine whether other factors are present which,under established legal or to render it unenforceable.citation.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,armendariz.
both procedural and substantive unconscionability are required to invalidate an arbitration clause.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,stirlen supercuts,th,d stirlen.procedural unconscionability focuses largely on oppression and the manner in which the agreement was negotiated.kinney united healthcare services,th,d kinney.substantive unconscionability,on the other hand,focuses on the terms of the agreement and the presence of overly harsh or results.id.at,d.the two aspects need not be present to the same degree.t he more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
firemaster arbitration agreement,presented on a take it or leave it basis,is procedurally unconscionable.
the procedural aspect of the unconscionability analysis focuses on the manner in which the agreement was negotiated kinney,supra,th at,d,and,typically,on the oppressiveness of the stronger party conduct.mercuro superior court th,d,fn.omitted mercuro harper ultimo th,d.oppression arises from an inequality of bargaining power which results in no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice.citation.a m produce fmc d.
it is undisputed martinez was required to execute the arbitration agreement as a prerequisite of his employment by firemaster.the letter confirming firemaster offer of employment states that martinez signing and acceptance of the arbitration agreement was a specific condition of employment.no evidence indicates martinez had any opportunity to negotiate or refuse to sign the arbitration agreement.indeed,when he informed firemaster human resources representative he would prefer not to sign the agreement,martinez was told he could not work at firemaster if he did not sign the document.an arbitration agreement that is an essential part of a take it or leave it employment condition,without more,is procedurally unconscionable.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,stirlen,supra,th at,d.the arbitration agreement meets that definition and is clearly adhesive and procedurally unconscionable.
b.the arbitration agreement is also substantively unconscionable.
martinez makes four arguments directed to the substantive is,the basic the arbitration agreement.the agreement is unfairly because it requires arbitration of all claims of interest to an individual employee,but exempts from arbitration those claims of primary interest to the employer.in addition,the agreement provision,significantly shortened statute of limitations,and restrictions on discovery,combine to deprive martinez of any real opportunity to vindicate his rights.we address each of the contentions in turn.
i the arbitration agreement lacks mutuality.
an arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable if it requires the employee but not the employer to arbitrate claims.armendariz,supra,cal th at d.mcmanus cibc world markets th,d.firemaster arbitration agreement does precisely that.
the arbitration agreement requires firemaster and martinez to arbitrate claims for wages,compensation and some benefit claims it also compelsboth parties to arbitrate state and federal statutory claims,contract and tort claims,and claims of discrimination.the agreement does not encompass claims by martinez for workers compensation or unemployment benefits.the agreement also specifically exempts from its terms any claims by firemaster for injunctive other equitable relief for unfair competition the use unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or confidential information.as to the latter category of claims,not the right to pursue its judicial remedies.
firemaster assertion that the agreement and the exclusions are mutual lacks merit.this provision of the arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable.it requires employees to arbitrate the claims they are most likely to assert against firemaster,while simultaneously permitting firemaster to litigate in court the claims it is most likely to assert against its employees.claims for unpaid wages,wrongful termination,employment discrimination and the like invariably are brought by employees,while claims involving trade secrets,misuse or disclosure of confidential information,and unfair competition typically are asserted only by employers.recently,division seven of this district deemed substantively unconscionable an arbitration agreement virtually identical to this one.mercuro,supra,th at,d.we agree.i n the context of an arbitration agreement imposed by the employer on the employee,such a term is unconscionable.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.this is particularly true where,as here,the employer has not even advanced any business justification for the lack of mutuality 
ii the arbitration agreement unacceptably imposes costs on an employee which he would not be required to bear in a judicial forum.
the arbitration agreement requires parties to split the cost of the arbitration and to post fees in advance of the hearing,which martinez argues poses a systematic disadvantage to him and discourages employees from asserting valid claims.
w hen an employer imposes mandatory arbitration as a condition of employment,the arbitration agreement or arbitration process can not generally require the employee to bear any type of expense that the employee would not be required to bear if he or she were free to bring the action in court.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,emphasis deleted.firemaster concedes the provision is problematic,but insists it is a because it has agreed to modify the agreement and bear the cost of arbitration.firemaster purported modification fails to cure this significant defect.
first,the modification is supported only by a passing reference in firemaster memorandum of points and authorities in support of its petition to compel arbitration.firemaster attempt to modify the fee provision by way of an unverified statement by its counsel is ineffective.the arbitration agreement is a fully integrated contract which,by its terms requires that i t can only be modified by a writing signed by the parties which specifically states an intent to modify this agreement.firemaster counsel unilateral presentation fails to comply with this requirement or cure the defect caused by imposing arbitration fees on martinez.mercuro,supra,th at,d stirlen,supra,th at,d employer can not unilaterally modify arbitration agreement which,by its terms,was modifiable only by an agreement in writing signed by the parties.ferguson countrywide credit industries cir,same.
second,the costs provision in the arbitration agreement is inconsistent with armendariz,which found the risk that a claimant may bear substantial costs of arbitration,not just the actual imposition of those costs,may discourage an employee from exercising the constitutional right of due process.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.the critical juncture for determining whether a contract is unconscionable is the moment when it is entered into by both whether it is unconscionable in light of subsequent events.citation.american software,ali th,d.
firemaster expression of willingness to amend the arbitration agreement to conform to law is ineffective.w hether an employer is willing,now that the employment relationship has ended to change a provision of an arbitration agreement so it conforms to law does not change the fact that the arbitration agreement as written is unconscionable and contrary to public policy.such a willingness can be seen,at most,as an offer to modify the contract an offer that was never accepted.no existing rule of contract law permits a party to resuscitate a legally defective contract merely by offering to change it.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,quoting stirlen,supra,th at,d see also municipal resource consultants th,d employer belated willingness to bear all costs of arbitration proceeding does not alter the fact that the arbitration provision is substantively unconscionable.the mere inclusion of the costs provision in the arbitration agreement produces an unacceptable chilling effect,notwithstanding firemaster belated willingness to excise that portion of the agreement.
iii the arbitration agreement provision of a statute of limitations unlawfully restricts an employee ability to vindicate his civil and statutory rights.
the arbitration agreement requires the assertion of all statutory and common law claims covered by the agreement within six months of the date when the claim arises.if the party asserting the claim fails to do so,the claim shall be void and deemed waived even if there is a federal or state statute of limitations which would have given more time to pursue the claim.martinez correctly contends that the provision imposing a vastly shortened statute of limitations constitutes an unlawful attempt by firemaster to restrict its employees statutory rights.
the statutes upon which martinez claims are premised provide significantly longer periods of time than six months within which to assert a claim of violation.specifically,martinez claim of national origin discrimination arises out of the feha.that statute provides that martinez administrative charge must be filed within one year from the date of the discriminatory act,and that he must file any civil action within one year of the date on which the administrative agency issues a right to sue letter,subd.d,subd.b.a n arbitration agreement can not be made to serve as a vehicle for the waiver of statutory rights created by the feha.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.similarly,the labor code,which provides the bases for martinez causes of action for unpaid wages and penalties,affords an employee three or four years to assert the claims sued upon here.aubry goldhor d,fn.statute of limitations applies to claims of violation of labor code sequeira insectaries,th,d,statute of limitations for violations of labor code.if there was any doubt,after armendariz,it is clear that parties agreeing to arbitrate statutory claims must be deemed to consent to abide by the substantive and remedial provisions of the statute otherwise,a party would not be able to fully vindicate his or her statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,citation.the shortened limitations period provided by firemaster arbitration agreement is unconscionable and insufficient to protect its employees right to vindicate their statutory rights 
iv the discovery restrictions are severe but not necessarily unlawful.
finally,martinez asserts that firemaster arbitration agreement which,absent a demonstration of substantial need,restricts discovery to a single deposition and a document request,improperly and unfairly deprives him of the ability to prepare and prove his case.while agreeing with martinez argument in principle,we are unable to conclude such a limitation necessarily prevents martinez from vindicating his rights.
in armendariz,the supreme court acknowledged that adequate discovery is indispensable for the vindication of feha claims.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.employees are at least entitled to discovery sufficient to adequately arbitrate their statutory claim,including access to essential documents and witnesses id.at,d.on the other hand,discovery limitations are an integral part of the arbitration process.id.at,and fn,d,accord brock kaiser foundation hospitals th,d.adequate discovery is not synonymous with unfettered discovery.mercuro,supra,th at,d mcmanus cibc world markets,supra,th at,d.we recognize that,in many employment disputes,restricting a plaintiff to a single deposition and document request could place him at a serious disadvantage if testimony from numerous witnes
