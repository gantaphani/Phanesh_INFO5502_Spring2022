the distinction between an agency exercise of management rights and its obligation to engage in impact and implementation bargaining is the crux of this controversy,which has its genesis in customs revised policy governing the assignment of customs inspectors to tours of duty and overtime work known as the national inspection assignment policy naip.customs and the nteu,which represents a nationwide unit of customs service employees,including customs inspectors,have negotiated a series of national level collective bargaining agreements nlas.the most recent nla and the one the parties were abiding by when this dispute arose expired in.
in,the congress passed the customs officers pay reform act copra,which overhauled the overtime system applicable to customs inspectors.see,a,stat.codified at.to implement copra,that same year customs and the nteu formed a joint committee,whose work culminated,two years later,with the niap.see.the niap was developed independently of the nla.
at the time the niap was formulated,customs,along with all other federal agencies,was required under executive order to negotiate over the permissive subjects of bargaining set forth in section b of the fslmrs.see.section identifies the subjects as the numbers,types,and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision,work project,or tour of duty,or on the technology,methods,and means of performing work.b.in,however,president george bush revoked executive order by issuing executive order.see.
following executive order,customs advised the nteu that it no longer intended to negotiate over permissive subjects of bargaining as previously required by article,section,of the nla.in that section of the nla,customs agreed,i n the interest of partnership,to bargain with the union over the numbers,types and grades of employees or positions assigned to any customs service organizational subdivision,work project or tour of duty,and the technology,methods and means of performing work within the service.customs further advised the nteu that it no longer considered itself bound by provisions of the nla and the to permissive subjects of bargaining.customs transmitted to the nteu a draft of a revised niap that it planned to implement on september.
a correspondence battle ensued during august and september of,only the salient aspects of which we recount now.on august,the nteu invoked its right to bargain over the impact and implementation of the revised niap and served notice of its intent to renegotiate the expired nla.customs responded on august by repeating its planned implementation of the revised niap on september.the following day,the nteu iterated its intent to open the entire term agreement,highlighting various provisions which,it claimed,bore a direct connection to the niap and to its section rights.on august,customs informed the nteu that it was prepared to work out ground rules to govern renegotiation of the expired nla but that,as to the proposed revised niap,article of the expired nla establishes standard for the negotiation of interim topics such as the revised niap.the nteu replied the next day,stating that actual negotiations could not begin on any topic until the parties have reached agreement on ground rules.on august,customs again declared that the ground rules set forth in article of the expired nla governed negotiations over the revised niap.
on august,customs and the nteu met to discuss ground rules but to no avail.they exchanged correspondence the following day customs stated it did not agree to merge,as the nteu had proposed,negotiations over the revised niap with those regarding the expired nla,while the nteu said it continues to believe that concerns associated with the niap should be addressed as part of the overall negotiations on the expired nla.in its letter,the nteu also proposed that the existing niap be,subject to a few specified revisions.customs responded that it did not intend to delay the implementation of the revised niap until the parties renegotiated the nla.on september,customs had the last word in this exchange it notified the nteu that any delay in implementing the revised niap is unacceptable and,consequently,it decline d to accept the nteu suggestion that it forego revision and implementation of the niap in order to address it during renegotiation of the national agreement.
believing the parties had reached an impasse over its proposal to negotiate the niap and nla simultaneously,the union sought assistance from the federal mediation and conciliation service the day it received custom last letter customs proceeded to implement the revised niap on october,insisting in a letter to the nteu that day that,in light of new requirements imposed after the catastrophic attacks by foreign terrorists against our nation citizens on september,immediate implementation was critical to ensure the necessary functioning of customs.the union responded with a letter of its own and also filed a grievance with the authority alleging that,by implementing the revised niap,customs violated section a and of the fslmrs.following submission of the union grievance to arbitration,an arbitrator concluded that the parties should bargain over revisions to the niap and,consequently,remanded the matter for the parties to negotiate the impact and implementation of the revised niap.both parties filed exceptions to the arbitrator award with the to the award itself,the nteu to the arbitrator choice of remedy.
the authority granted customs exceptions and set the award aside.see customs order,flra at.at the outset of its analysis,the authority observed that,because customs had proposed a specific change in unit employees conditions of employment pursuant to the exercise of its management rights under of the statute while the parties were contemplating negotiation of a new term agreement,the case presented an issue of first impression.id.at.resolution of the case,it said,turned on customs legal ability,if any,to refuse to bargain over the nteu proposed ground rule requiring customs to combine its proposed impact and implementation bargaining obligation with the negotiation of a term agreement.id.two possible answers,the authority observed,carried two different consequences for customs.see id.on the one hand,if customs could refuse to bargain over the nteu proposed ground rule,it explained,the union refusal to engage further in impact and implementation bargaining would permit customs to unilaterally implement its proposed change to conditions of employment.id.if,on the other hand,customs was required to bargain over the proposed ground rule,customs would commit an unfair labor practice by its unilateral implementation of the revised niap.id.
the authority chose the first answer,finding that the union proposed ground rule constitutes a permissive subject of bargaining and,consequently,that the agency was under no obligation to bargain on that subject as a precondition to impact and implementation of the revised niap.id.in articulating the basis of its,that an agency can not be compelled to bargain over combining impact and implementation and term bargaining and it has the right to insist that such bargaining proceed on separate tracks the authority delineated two principles.id.first,it noted that w here an agency action constitutes the exercise of a management right under sections a and b of the fslmrs,its obligation is limited to bargaining over the procedures governing the exercise of the right,under b of the statute,or appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of the right,under b.id.second,relying on our decision in flra united states dep t of justice,the authority observed that,because an agency exercising a management right need not bargain over matters beyond the scope of impact and implementation bargaining,its duty to bargain over ground rules must be consistent with the parties obligation to bargain in a particular case.id.at.
after finding that the nteu right to bargain was limited to the impact and implementation of the proposed changes in the revised niap,id.at see also id.at,because implementation of the revised niap involved the exercise of a statutory management right,the authority then considered whether the nteu proposed ground rule addresse d only procedures or appropriate arrangements relating to the change in conditions of employment proposed by the revised niap.id.at.clearly,it does not,the authority concluded,because b ased on the record,there is no question but that bargaining over a new term agreement would extend beyond the narrow scope of issues related to the procedures and appropriate arrangements governing implementation of the revised niap.id.while it acknowledged that the nteu identified provisions of the nla that related to the niap that it wished to discuss in term negotiations,the authority found that it also demanded to bargain over other,unrelated provisions of the nla as well.id.therefore,the authority concluded,because the union proposed,as a condition precedent to bargaining over the impact and implementation of the revised niap,that customs agree to bargain that matter as a part of bargaining over a new term agreement,the union ground rule exceeded the scope of impact and implementation bargaining and customs had no obligation to bargain over it.id.
the authority additionally explained that,because the proposed ground rule sought in effect a waiver of customs right to bargain only over those procedures and arrangements related to the revised niap,it constituted a permissive subject of bargaining.id.at.consequently,in the authority view,customs had the right not only to refuse to bargain to impasse over the matter,but also to implement the revised niap without completing bargaining.id.therefore,the authority concluded,customs did not violate the fslmrs by implementing the revised niap on october.see id.
the authority further reasoned that a contrary,one requiring agencies to bargain over a ground rule conditioning impact and implementation bargaining on the negotiation of a term agreement,would,to its mind,frustrate the compromise reached by congress in enacting.id.emphasis in original.such a rule would not,the authority explained,give full effect to the place of management rights in the statutory scheme because it would tie the exercise of a right to objectives that have nothing to do with the purposes for which the right was being exercised.id.indeed,the authority observed,it would be exceedingly anomalous if a union could achieve through ground rules bargaining an expansion of negotiations that it could not accomplish through bargaining over procedures and appropriate arrangements.id.at.
because customs implementation of the revised niap,in the face of a proposal over which it was not obligated to bargain,was,therefore,not a violation of the statute,the authority concluded that the arbitrator erred as a matter of law in deciding otherwise and set his award aside id.the nteu then timely filed a petition for review pursuant to a.
we begin with the standards by which we review the authority order.first,there is the familiar administrative procedure act standard,see c incorporating w hen acting within its authority and consistent with the congressional mandate,the authority decision may only be set aside if it is found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.ass of civilian technicians flra,quoting a bureau of alcohol,tobacco firearms flra,d see also afge local,flra.in addition there is the classic methodology governing the authority interpretation of the statute if the congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,the court give s effect to its unambiguously expressed intent,but if the statute is silent or ambiguous the court defers to the authority interpretation so long as it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron usa natural res.def.council,d see also dep t of the air force flra.these standards are deferential ones,for,as the supreme court has reminded us,the this the expert on federal labor relations.because the authority function is to develop specialized expertise in its field of labor relations and to use that expertise to give content to the principles and goals set forth in the act,it is entitled to considerable deference when it exercises its special function of applying the general provisions of the act to the complexities of federal labor relations.fed of fed.employees dep t of the interior,d quoting bureau of alcohol,tobacco firearms,at.in turn quoting nlrb erie resistor,d.the application of these deferential standards of review is fatal to nteu two arguments,each of which we take turn.
the nteu opening attack is on the authority conclusion that customs exercised its statutory management rights in proposing revisions to the niap.according to the nteu,the authority erroneous premise falls apart once it is recognized that the proposed revisions altered negotiated procedures and appropriate arrangements,a topic outside customs statutory management rights and therefore within customs duty to bargain.petitioner br.at.that is,in the nteu words w hen customs proposed to replace the negotiated procedures and appropriate arrangements of the niap with new procedures and appropriate arrangements it was proposing a change in conditions of employment over which it had a substantive obligation to bargain.petitioner br.at.
