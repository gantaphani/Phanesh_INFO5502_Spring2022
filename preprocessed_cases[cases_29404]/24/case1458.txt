we reconsider this appeal on remand from the california supreme court after its decision in bouton usaa casualty ins.cal th,d,bouton.lloyd bouton appeals an order denying his petition to compel arbitration of his claim against usaa casualty insurance company usaa for underinsured motorist benefits under the automobile insurance policy usaa issued to his sister.apparently alternatively,bouton also appeals an order granting usaa motion to strike his subsequently filed amended complaint that alleged causes of action for declaratory relief and breach of that insurance policy.in his initial appellant brief,bouton contended the trial court erred by denying his petition to compel arbitration because the dispute whether he is an insured under usaa policy is required to be arbitrated pursuant to insurance code section,subdivision f as interpreted by van tassel superior court cal d,and the undisputed facts show he is an insured under usaa policy entitled to arbitration of his claim.bouton also contended the trial court erred in granting usaa motion to strike his amended complaint without leave to amend because the court had jurisdiction over the parties and controversy and had a duty to decide all matters before it if the court does not decide all of those matters,res judicata will bar those causes of action he may allege in a new or second complaint his amended complaint was properly filed as an amended pleading and any defect was trivial and even were his pleadings defective,the court should have granted him leave to amend.
in our initial opinion in this case,we concluded section,subdivision f,as interpreted by van tassel,required arbitration of the dispute whether bouton is an insured under usaa policy despite exclusionary policy language arguably to the contrary.however,after granting usaa petition for review,the california supreme court overruled its decision in van tassel and concluded a court,not an arbitrator,must decide whether bouton is an insured under that policy.bouton,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,bouton reversed our judgment and remanded the case to this court for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.id.at,d.

factual and procedural background 
on november,in san diego county superior court case no,bouton filed a petition to compel arbitration petition of his claim against usaa for underinsured motorist benefits under the automobile insurance policy policy usaa issued to his sister,samela bouton.the petition alleged that on may,he was injured in an automobile accident involving an automobile owned and operated by kevin daniels.on or about may,bouton settled his claims against daniels and his insurer mercury insurance for his policy limit of.on may,bouton demanded that usaa submit to arbitration of his claim under the policy,which included a provision for uninsured or underinsured motorist benefits.the petition further alleged,and bouton supporting declaration stated,that at the time of the accident,may,bouton was a permanent resident of the household,and a blood relative,of his sister,samela bouton.bouton submitted a copy of the policy in support of the petition.
the policy provides uninsured or underinsured motorist um benefits for covered person s.that part of the policy defines a covered person as.you,the named insured or any family member the policy defines family member as a person related to you,the named insured by blood,marriage,or adoption who is a resident of your household the policy provides for arbitration of certain disputes relating to um benefits 
if usaa and a covered person disagree as to.whether a covered person is legally entitled to recover bodily injury or property damage damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle or an underinsured motor vehicle or.the amount of bodily injury damages that the covered person is legally entitled to collect from that owner then,that disagreement shall be arbitrated,provided both parties so agree.this arbitration shall be limited to the two aforementioned factual issues and shall not address any other issues,including but not limited to,coverage questions.any arbitration finding that goes beyond the two aforementioned factual issues shall be voidable by usaa or a covered person 
on december,usaa filed its opposition to the petition,stating it had denied coverage for bouton um claim and arguing that the question whether bouton was an insured under the policy was a coverage question not required to be arbitrated under either the policy or section,subdivision f.on december,the trial court san diego county superior court judge joel pressman issued its order denying the petition,citing freeman state farm mut.auto.ins.cal d,freeman and stating 
here,the wording of the policy between usaa and bouton sister is no broader than that found in insurance code,subdivision f.accordingly,arbitration is warranted between usaa and an insured only as to the issues of whether the insured is legally entitled to recover damages,and if so entitled,the amount thereof.citation.insurance code,subd.f.however,at this juncture,bouton has failed to establish that he is an insured,and therefore entitled to the protections of the code section.contrary to his assertions,bouton may not,under the terms of the arbitration clause in the p olicy or under insurance code,subdivision f,arbitrate the issue of whether or not he is an insured.accordingly,the instant petition can not be granted as doing so would compel usaa to arbitrate issues broader than those contained in either the agreement or insurance code,subdivision f.
on january,also in san diego county superior court case no,bouton filed an amended complaint,alleging causes of action for declaratory relief,breach of contract,and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the amended complaint allegations recited the may,accident and usaa denial of bouton claim for um benefits.on february,usaa filed a motion to strike bouton amended complaint,arguing the amended complaint was procedurally improper because he had not filed an original complaint and the trial court jurisdiction in the instant case,san diego county superior court case no.was limited to granting or denying the petition.
on march,bouton opposed usaa motion to strike his amended complaint,arguing the instant case was a pending action giving the trial court jurisdiction over the parties and their dispute,and res judicata would bar his causes of action were he required to file a new or second complaint.bouton also suggested the trial court reconsider its december,order denying the petition,citing for the first time van tassel and arguing that,based on van tassel interpretation of section,subdivision f,the factual question of whether he is an insured under the policy is required to be arbitrated.
on april,the trial court san diego county superior court judge richard cline issued an order granting usaa motion to strike bouton amended complaint without leave to amend.in so doing,the court did not address bouton suggestion it reconsider its december,order considering van tassel.bouton timely filed a notice of appeal challenging both orders.
in our original opinion in this matter bouton usaa casualty ins,d,revd.cal th,d,we followed van tassel and concluded the issue whether bouton is an insured or covered person under the policy is required to be arbitrated pursuant to section,subdivision f.accordingly,we reversed the trial court order denying the petition to compel arbitration and remanded with directions that the court vacate that order and issue a new order granting the petition to compel arbitration.after granting usaa petition for review,the california supreme court overruled its decision in van tassel and concluded a court,not an arbitrator,must decide whether bouton is an insured under that policy.bouton,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,bouton reversed our judgment and remanded the case to this court for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.id.at,d.
on september,bouton filed a supplemental opening brief in response to bouton.on september,usaa filed a supplemental respondent brief.

california supreme court decision in bouton 
in bouton,supra,cal th,d,the california supreme court concluded determining whether a claimant is insured under an uninsured motorist provision is not a question of the underinsured tortfeasor liability or damages owed to the insured,and is therefore not subject to arbitration under section,subdivision f.id.at,d.overruling its holding in van tassel to the contrary,bouton applied its decision in freeman state farm mut.auto.ins.cal d,freeman to conclude a court,not an arbitrator,must determine whether bouton is insured under his sister policy.bouton,at,d.bouton explained 
whether bouton is a covered person under the insurance policy is not a question regarding the underinsured tortfeasor liability to the insured,or the amount of damages.questions of is,whether the claimant is insured and therefore entitled to take advantage of the protection provided by the policy at be resolved before an arbitrator reaches the two arbitrable questions pursuant to section,subdivision f.here,the policy acknowledges as much,providing that arbitration shall not address any other issues,including but not limited to,coverage questions.coverage questions fall outside of the two issues necessarily arbitrable under section,subdivision f,and must therefore be decided by a court,not an arbitrator,if the parties have not agreed to arbitrate more than the statute requires.bouton,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
accordingly,bouton reversed our judgment and remanded the matter to this court for further proceedings consistent with its decision.id.at,d.
did the trial court decide whether bouton is an insured 
bouton contends the trial court,in denying the petition,made a factual determination that he is not an insured under the policy.bouton argues that because the evidence in support of the petition was undisputed and shows he is an insured,the trial court erred and should be directed to issue a new order finding he is an insured.
the petition alleged that an actual controversy existed between usaa and bouton regarding whether the policy provided um coverage for his injuries and damages and that arbitration is the proper way to determine whether bouton is entitled to damages,and if so,the amount of those damages.the petition alleged,and bouton supporting declaration stated,that at the time of the accident,may,bouton was a permanent resident of the household,and a blood relative,of his sister,samela bouton the named insured under the policy.the petition requested the trial court order usaa and bouton to arbitrate the controversy.
in opposing the petition,usaa argued the petition sought arbitration of three issues whether bouton is an insured under the policy if he is an insured,whether bouton is legally entitled to recover damages from a um and if so,the amount of his damages.usaa then argued that because the question whether bouton is an insured,a covered person under the policy is expressly excluded from the scope of the policy arbitration provision,the trial court should deny the petition.usaa did not submit any declarations or other evidence in opposition to the petition.
in reply to usaa opposition,bouton argued it was usaa duty to file an action for declaratory relief if it questioned whether he is an insured under the policy and,because it did not do so,it could not dispute that he is an insured.bouton stated bouton has not requested the court make a finding of insurance coverage in this matter.if coverage is an issue for usaa,it has since failed to act.the issue of whether bouton is afforded coverage under the p olicy is not before this court since usaa refused to file a declaratory relief action when requested by bouton to decide coverage,it essentially extended coverage and made no objection to coverage.he further stated usaa has failed to show any evidence to this court in the form of a declaration,or other evidence,that the matter should not go forward to arbitration.however,to the contrary,bouton has signed a declaration under penalty of perjury that he is entitled to the benefits under the p olicy.therefore,the court must find for bouton and order the parties to arbitration.bouton argued usaa merely claims there is a coverage issue and incorrectly assumes that this court should deny the motion just because usaa claims there is a dispute apparently regarding whether he is an insured.accordingly,bouton requested that the trial court grant the petition.
on december,the trial court issued its written order denying the petition.citing freeman,the court concluded the question whether bouton is an insured under the policy is not subject to arbitration under the policy arbitration provision,which provides for arbitration only of the two issues required under section,subdivision f.accordingly,the court concluded the petition can not be granted as doing so would compel usaa to arbitrate issues broader than those contained in either the policy arbitration agreement or,subdivision f.the court also stated a t this juncture,bouton has failed to establish that he is an insured,and therefore entitled to the protections of section,subdivision f.the court rejected bouton argument that usaa was required to seek declaratory relief that he is not an insured under the policy,explaining after all,he is the one seeking to enforce the arbitration clause.it follows that he carries the burden of establishing that he is entitled to its protections.
we conclude the trial court in denying the petition did not decide the question whether bouton is an insured under the policy.rather,it apparently adopted usaa argument that the petition should be denied because the question whether bouton is an insured is not subject to arbitration under either the policy arbitration provision or section,subdivision f,as interpreted by freeman.based solely on that reasoning,the court denied the petition.the record does not support a reasonable inference that the court considered the evidence submitted by bouton on the question whether he is an insured under the policy or that it made a finding,based on that evidence,that bouton is or is not an insured under the policy.rather,apparently presuming bouton could only make that showing by means of an action for declaratory relief,the trial court merely observed a t this juncture,bouton has failed to establish that he is an insured,and therefore entitled to the protections of section,subdivision f.therefore,the record shows the trial court did not consider the evidence and decide whether bouton is,in fact,an insured under the policy.when the record shows a trial court does not undertake the factual inquiry necessary to determine a question,we may not infer on appeal that factual finding.wagner construction pacific mechanical cal th,d.
should the trial court decide whether bouton is an insured in the petition proceedings 
bouton apparently contends that if,as we have concluded,the trial court did not decide the question whether he is an insured under the policy,the court should make that determination in the proceedings on the petition.he argues that he should not be required to file a separate action for declaratory relief to obtain a determination on the preliminary question of whether he is an insured under the policy with standing to enforce the policy um arbitration provisions.usaa argues that the question whether bouton is an insured under the policy can not be decided in the proceedings on the petition and can only be decided in a separate action for declaratory relief.
because neither party cites,and we have not found,any reported case that expressly addresses this issue,it appears to be a question of first impression whether a factual question that is preliminary or predicate to contractual or statutory arbitration,including whether bouton is an insured under the policy with standing to enforce its arbitration provision,can be decided by a trial court in the proceedings on a petition to compel arbitration or whether that question can only be decided in a separate action for declaratory relief.furthermore,although in bouton the california supreme court held that a trial court must decide the question whether bouton is an insured under the policy,bouton did not expressly address the question whether that determination can be made by a trial court in proceedings on a petition to compel arbitration or must make that determination only in a separate action for declaratory relief.bouton,supra,cal th at,d.
absent any reported case on that issue,we reviewed analogous cases involving trial court determinations on other factual questions that are preliminary or predicate to contractual arbitration.for example,in circumstances generally involving contractual arbitration provisions,when a petitioner files a petition to compel arbitration of that arbitration provision,a trial court must make preliminary factual determinations whether there is an arbitration agreement and the petitioner is a party to that agreement or can otherwise enforce that agreement.code civ.code of civil procedure section authorizes petitions to compel arbitration,providing in part on petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy,the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists italics added.therefore,in considering a code of civil procedure section petition to compel arbitration,a trial court must make the preliminary determinations whether there is an agreement to arbitrate and whether the petitioner is a party to that agreement or can otherwise enforce the agreement.city of hope bryan cave,th,d i n addition to determining whether an arbitration agreement exists,the court needs to determine who has standing to demand arbitration.
as a general matter,only signatories to an arbitration agreement may enforce it.citation.rowe exline th,d.however,there are exceptions to that general rule for nonsignatory persons who are agents or alter egos of a signatory party or intended third party beneficiaries of an arbitration agreement.see,rowe,at,d nonsignatory petitioners could enforce arbitration agreement as alter egos of corporate signatory party dryer los angeles rams cal d,nonsignatory persons alleged to be agents of signatory party may enforce arbitration agreement valley casework,comfort construction,th,d valley casework i n many cases,nonparties to arbitration agreements are allowed to enforce those agreements where there is sufficient identity of parties.harris superior court d.a nonsignatory beneficiary of an arbitration clause is entitled to require arbitration.smith microskills san diego th,d nonsignatory petitioner was neither an agent nor an intended third party beneficiary and therefore could not enforce arbitration agreement flores evergreen at san diego,llc th,d nonsignatory respondent wife was not bound by arbitration agreement because her signatory husband was not her agent.
in particular,one court stated a person who can show he is a third party beneficiary of an arbitration agreement may be entitled to enforce that agreement.citation.valley casework,supra,th at,d see also,a contract,made expressly for the benefit of a third person,may be enforced by him.accordingly,in a case where persons did not prove to the trial court they were intended beneficiaries under the arbitration agreement,there was no error in denying their petitions for arbitration.citation.city of hope bryan cave,supra,th at,d.
a petition to compel arbitration is in essence a suit in equity to compel specific performance of a contract.citation.rosenthal great western fin.securities cal th,d.in a petition to compel arbitration where the person asserting the demand is claiming as a third party beneficiary,a minimal requirement for pleading would appear to be an allegation of a controversy between the parties,facts demonstrating the existence of an arbitrable controversy,the existence of the written agreement,and an allegation that the other party has refused to arbitrate.city of hope bryan cave,supra,th at,d.the preliminary determination of standing to arbitrate as a party to the arbitration agreement is a question for the trial court.valley casework,supra,th at,d american builder d.unimart superior court d.it is settled that the question of whether a nonsignatory to an arbitration agreement may enforce the arbitration provisions is one that must be decided by the court on the basis of the facts found prior to any arbitration going forward.citations.valley casework,at,d.
based on our consideration of the above cases in the context of code of civil procedure section petitions to compel arbitration,we conclude the instant case is analogous to those cases in which the trial court makes the preliminary determination whether the petitioner is a party to,or can otherwise enforce,an arbitration agreement.for example,in deciding a petition to compel arbitration,a trial court may decide,based on the evidence before it,that the petitioner is a third party beneficiary to an existing arbitration agreement and therefore may enforce that agreement.that preliminary finding by a trial court on the petitioner standing to compel arbitration of a controversy is one properly made in the proceedings on a petition to compel arbitration.
the issue in this case is not significantly different,if not the same.pursuant to bouton,a trial court must decide w
