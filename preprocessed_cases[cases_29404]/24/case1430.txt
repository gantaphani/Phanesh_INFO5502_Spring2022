anita marcario appeals from a judgment on the pleadings entered in favor of her employer,the county of orange the trial court concluded the resolution of an earlier labor grievance,pursued through a binding arbitration in accordance with the terms of a memorandum of understanding mou between the county and marcario union,precluded marcario claim for damages based upon retaliation in violation of the labor code,and her remaining two claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations.marcario argues the court erred,because the arbitration of her labor grievance could not be given binding effect with regard to statutory claims unless the mou clearly specified that it would be and any statutes of limitations were tolled during the time she participated in the internal grievance procedure.
we agree with marcario on both counts.a significant number of california appellate courts have already held that the arbitration of a labor grievance,conducted pursuant to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement,can not have binding effect as against the employee claims for violation of statute,unless the agreement states explicitly that it will.the mou in this case said no such thing.the county argument to the contrary is based upon cases which are distinguishable.rather than addressing the effect of a labor arbitration such as the one which occurred in this case,the county cases consider the binding effect of findings made at an administrative civil service hearing,after which the employee would have a right to petition the court for a writ of mandate.those cases are inapposite.
as for the tolling issue,marcario correctly points out that equitable tolling should be applied whenever a plaintiff pursues one of several available remedies in good faith and defendant is not prejudiced.because this case was resolved on a motion for judgment on the pleadings,there was simply no evidence from which the court might have properly drawn the conclusion that marcario was not entitled to such tolling.
the judgment is reversed,and the case remanded for further proceedings.
according to her first amended complaint marcario was hired by the county in,and was promoted to the position of secretary i fairly quickly after her employment commenced.she received excellent performance reviews.
then,in,marcario obtained a grant from the county housing and community redevelopment department hcd to use in rehabilitating her home.the hcd,although administered by the county,is funded through block grants from the federal department of housing and urban development.
unfortunately,marcario encountered significant problems with the contractors selected by hcd,and the work performed was not in compliance with code requirements.marcario complained,and discovered that hers was not an isolated example of substandard work.instead,it appeared that contractors chosen by the county to work on hcd projects had a pattern of performing substandard work,to maximize their own profits,and that the inspectors sent by the hcd were both unqualified to properly assess the quality of the work,and primarily concerned with simply getting the homeowner to sign off on the job.marcario complaints and investigation generated substantial publicity.
in,marcario filed a qui tam action in the united states district court,against the county and several contractors,based upon the alleged misuse of federal funds.the action was settled in november of,and marcario thereafter submitted ancillary claims which were resolved in.
as a result of marcario complaints,and the negative publicity they generated,the county retaliated against her in connection with her employment.marcario was turned down for several placements within the secretary i level,despite her excellent performance reviews.in october of,she was transferred to the children and family division of the county social services agency.she was put to work as an information processing technician ipt which does not require all of the skills of a secretary i,but was compensated at the same rate of pay.marcario initially retained the classification of a secretary 
however,in june of,marcario was notified that her job had been reclassified and she was thereafter an ipt.she also learned pursuant to a salary adjustment scheduled to take place the next day,the ipt position would be compensated at a rate percent lower than secretary had the change in her classification taken place on or after the effective date of the salary adjustment,marcario would have been entitled to salary protection pursuant to the mou.
since her job reclassification and salary reduction,marcario has been repeatedly denied the opportunity to transfer to a new position as secretary i,even though potential supervisors to whom she could have been assigned requested her.
in july of,marcario filed a grievance under the mou between her union and the county,challenging her reassignment and demotion.the mou makes no specific reference to grievances being pursued in connection with statutory violations,providing instead that a grievance may be filed if a management interpretation or application of the provisions of this mou adversely affects an employee wages,hours or conditions of employment.the grievance procedure outlined in the mou culminates in an arbitration to be held before a arbitrator,with the parties splitting the cost.although the mou says nothing specific about the arbitration of claims involving violations of statutory rights,it does include the general statement that t he decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties.
the arbitration proceeding was not recorded,and the arbitrator issued a ruling denying marcario grievance in november of.neither party petitioned the court to vacate or correct the arbitrator decision.
marcario filed her complaint against the county in june of,alleging causes of action for workplace retaliation in violation of labor code section,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and violation of civil rights under section.
after marcario filed her first amended complaint,the county moved for judgment on the pleadings,arguing the adverse result of the prior arbitration proceeding precluded marcario effort to litigate her labor code claim in this case and marcario remaining causes of action,for intentional infliction of emotional distress,and civil rights violation,were barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
the court agreed with the county,and granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings.the court subsequently issued a judgment reflecting its conclusions the first cause of action is barred by the doctrine s of res judicata collateral estoppel in that the issue of workplace retaliation was previously the subject of a final and binding arbitration award prepared by arbitrator judy gust on or about november,that the second cause of action is barred by code of civil procedure.that the third cause of action based upon section is also barred by the provisions of code of civil procedure.
before we address whether the arbitration conducted in connection with marcario mou grievance affected her right to assert the statutory claims herein,we must make clear that our analysis concerns only that arbitration,and not what the county describes as a separate binding arbitration afforded to marcario in connection with the settlement of her federal qui tam action.according to the county,that arbitration was the mechanism used for resolving the ancillary claims described by marcario in her first amended complaint.the county asserts those ancillary claims included marcario assertion that she had been retaliated against in connection with her employment,and that the claim had been rejected by the arbitrator.thus,the county insists marcario has unsuccessfully pressed her claim of workplace retaliation in two different binding arbitrations.
there are two problems with this claim.first,the purported arbitration was not included within the allegations of marcario first amended complaint,and the stipulation of facts provided to the court in conjunction with the county motion for judgment on the pleadings makes no reference to it.although the trial court granted the county request to take judicial notice of the order confirming the award which included a copy of the award,the document is not included in our record,and the county has made no request that we take judicial notice of it.consequently,we have no way of considering it.
second,and more significant in the long run,what our record does reflect is that the trial court was unpersuaded by the county suggestion the outcome of the ancillary arbitration was significant in this case.the court noted that to the extent the arbitrator in that case considered any claim of workplace retaliation against marcario,such a claim would apparently have been confined to the period of time which ended days after the date on which the parties had entered into the federal settlement time limitation for asserting the ancillary claims.as such,it could not have encompassed the events at issue reassignment and ultimate demotion from a secretary i to an ipt classification we will consequently disregard the alleged separate arbitration.
that brings us to what is before us.marcario argues the court erred in concluding the mou grievance arbitration precluded her first cause of action alleging violation of the labor code.although marcario concedes the arbitrator decision was adverse to concluded there was insufficient evidence her reassignment and reclassification was asserts such a decision can not have preclusive effect as against a claim for statutory violation unless the mou expressly provides that it does.
marcario relies upon several cases,including taylor lockheed martin th,d,and camargo california portland cement th,d.in taylor,the court looked to a line of united states supreme court cases which held that findings made during a labor arbitration are not binding in an employee lawsuit asserting federal statutory causes of action designed to protect workers a discrimination claim under title vii of the civil rights act in alexander,d alexander,a minimum wage violation under the fair labor standards act in barrentine freight system,d barrentine,and a civil rights claim under section in mcdonald west branch,d mcdonald.in these three cases,the court gave several reasons for limiting the preclusive effect of a labor arbitration under a cba collective bargaining agreement.it noted that congress had given the federal courts plenary power over each of the statutory claims at issue and there was no indication in any of the statutes that a prior arbitration divested the courts of the jurisdiction to hear the claim it characterized a union arbitrator expertise as the law of the shop,not the law of the land and explained that because the arbitrator power derives solely from the cba,he or she has the duty to follow the cba rather than federal law in case of a conflict between the two the court also observed that the union interests will not always be aligned with the individual employee in wright universal maritime service,d wright,the supreme court reaffirmed the line of cases while acknowledging there was some tension between the rule denying preclusive effect to labor arbitrations and language in a more recent decision that upheld an individual employee agreement to arbitrate a statutory employment discrimination claim.wright,at,citing gilmer lane,d.although the court did not decide whether a union can ever waive the statutory employment discrimination claims of its members through a cba provision,it held that a mandatory arbitration provision in a cba can not be enforceable when there is no clear and unmistakable waiver of the right to file suit.wright,at.taylor lockheed martin,supra,th at,d.while the taylor court noted that those federal cases were not binding in california,it nonetheless considered them persuasive authority for the proposition that a collective bargaining between a union and an could not be used as a means to impliedly dispense with important statutory rights afforded to individual workers under california law.
in camargo california portland cement,supra,th,d,the court likewise rejected the assertion that the binding arbitration conducted pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement in that case should have preclusive effect in a later superior court action alleging violations of state statutes.following an extensive analysis of both federal and state authorities,the camargo court explained its reasoning if an arbitration award of a feha claim under a cba can ever be given collateral estoppel effect at least two conditions must be satisfied,and neither is satisfied on the record presented in this appeal.first,we believe that if the feha claims of a union member are to be finally resolved by arbitration with the concomitant loss of a jury of one peers,the agreement to do so in a cba must be clear and unmistakable.wright,supra,at.vasquez superior court th,d.that is not the case here.the arbitration clause of the cba in our case does not provide for the arbitration of statutory feha claims.rather,the cba provides for arbitration of any dispute,difference,or grievance as sic the meaning and application of and compliance with the provisions of this agreement italics added,and its antidiscrimination clause does not explicitly incorporate statutory requirements second,the procedures of the arbitration must allow for the full litigation and fair adjudication of the feha claim.the present record,which arises on demurrer,sheds little light on the fairness of the procedures of the subject arbitration,on the extent of discovery that was allowed the parties,or on whether the arbitrator had any special competence in the adjudication of feha claims.these matters are all relevant to a determination whether the arbitration award should be given collateral estoppel effect.alexander,supra,at,fn.vandenberg,supra,cal th at d.we therefore conclude that,on the record presented,the rule of the united states supreme court in alexander,supra,d should control and defendants have not shown that the arbitration award is entitled to collateral estoppel effect.camargo california portland cement,supra,th,d.
several other california cases have applied the same rule in concluding an employee could not be compelled even to participate in an arbitration proceeding mandated by a collective bargaining agreement,if the claims at issue are based upon state statutes.vasquez superior court,supra,th,d torrez consolidated freightways th,d deschene pinole point steel th,d.in vasquez,a writ proceeding,the appellate court ordered the trial court to vacate its order compelling arbitration of an employee claims.the court concluded that even assuming a union had the power to waive its member rights to pursue statutory claims in the court expressly declined to decide that a waiver could be effected only by the most explicit language,without any resort to inference.the provision in that case,stating only that all grievances must be pursued in accordance with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement,and would terminate in mandatory,binding arbitration,was not sufficiently explicit.as the court explained neither disability discrimination,the feha,nor the ada is mentioned in the cba.thus,we can not conclude that the union clearly and unmistakably waived vasquez right to a judicial forum for his statutory disability discrimination claim the national origin discrimination claim is also not arbitrable.the cba includes language which states that the parties make a contractual commitment not to discriminate against any employee on account of national origin under applicable federal and state law but these statutes are not even mentioned.there is of course the general language making all contractual disputes subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure.wright,however,emphasized that with respect to statutory discrimination claims,there is no presumption of arbitrability and the waiver of a judicial forum must be clear and unmistakable.vasquez superior court,supra,th,d.
to counter these authorities,the county relies upon risam county of los angeles th,d,and williams housing authority of los angeles th,d.according to the county,these cases establish that the findings of an administr
