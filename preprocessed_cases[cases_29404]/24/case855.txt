move,move appeals the district court order dismissing its action and denying its motion to vacate an arbitration award pursuant to the federal arbitration act faa,et.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a and.we hold that move motion was not untimely because the faa is subject to equitable tolling.we also hold that move right to a fundamentally fair hearing was prejudiced by the fraudulent misrepresentations of the arbitration panel chairperson,resulting in proceedings led by an arbitrator who should have been disqualified from the dispute under the rules and regulations of the financial industry regulatory authority finra.accordingly,we reverse the district court judgment in part and remand the case for entry of judgment in favor of move.
background 
move maintained an investment account with citigroup global markets,citigroup.in connection with its investments,move entered into a client agreement with citigroup stating,in relevant part,that all claims or controversies shall be determined by arbitration before,and only before,any organization or exchange of which citigroup is a member.
on september,move commenced arbitration proceedings before a finra panel,alleging that citigroup mismanaged million of move funds by investing in speculative auction rate securities.before initiating the proceedings,finra required move and citigroup to sign a uniform submission agreement,which stated that the dispute was submitted to arbitration in accordance with the constitution,rules,regulations,code of arbitration procedure of finra.finra code of arbitration procedure for customer disputes,found in finra rules,includes rule c,which required move claims to be arbitrated by a panel of three arbitrators.
pursuant to rule,finra provided the parties with a list of thirty proposed arbitrators and their employment histories,including ten proposed arbitrators from finra chairperson roster.because the dispute involved a complex securities issue,it was important to move that the person selected as chairperson be an experienced attorney.move ranked james frank first who,according to the finra arbitrator disclosure report adr,received a law degree from southwestern university in and was licensed to practice law in california,new york,and florida.pursuant to finra rules and regulations,arbitrators must affirm that their adr is accurate and up to date.finra also informs arbitrators that a failure to disclose material information in the arbitrator profile may result in permanent disqualification.
frank subsequently served as the chairperson of the panel along with arthur berggren,a licensed attorney,and daniel brush,a certified public accountant and certified financial planner.on december,after conducting six conferences and twenty hearing sessions,the finra panel issued a unanimous award denying move claims.
over four years later,on march,move learned from an article in the amlaw litigation daily that frank had lied about being a licensed attorney.it is now undisputed that frank,who is james hamilton hardy frank,was impersonating retired california attorney james hamilton frank.finra later confirmed that frank lied about his qualifications in his adr and subsequently removed him from all cases and from its roster.
move filed a complaint on june,and a motion to vacate the arbitration award on june.move argued that vacatur was warranted under a and of the faa because of frank misrepresentations.although provides that notice of a motion to vacate an arbitration award must be served within three months after the award is delivered,move argued the deadline should be equitably tolled.citigroup moved to dismiss,arguing that equitable tolling is unavailable under the faa and that,even if it were,move failed to demonstrate tolling was justified.citigroup further argued that,even if the limitations period were tolled,vacatur was unjustified on the merits.
the district court denied move motion to vacate and granted citigroup motion to dismiss.noting that equitable tolling under the faa presented an unsettled question of law in this circuit,the court ruled that equitable tolling is available,but that move failed to demonstrate an adequate ground for vacatur under the faa.specifically,the court explained that frank misbehavior did not prejudice move rights to a fundamentally fair hearing as required by a and the panel did not exceed its powers in violation of a because frank deceit,if cognizable at all under that section,did not violate move contractual rights under its client agreement with citigroup.move timely appealed.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court denial of a motion to vacate an arbitration award.see,united states park place,cir.we also review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b.see,state inv.council ernst young llp,cir.
the faa requires that notice of a motion to vacate an arbitration award must be served within three months after the award is filed or delivered.because move motion to vacate was filed over four years after the three month statutory window closed,we must first determine whether the doctrine of equitable tolling applies to the faa,such that the motion is not.we hold that it does.we also hold that move right to a fundamentally fair hearing under a was prejudiced by the arbitral misconduct of the panel chairperson,frank.the district court therefore erred in denying move motion to vacate the award.
equitable tolling 
although this court has not yet decided whether equitable tolling applies to the faa,the district court held that it does.we agree.
the closest we have come to deciding this issue was in lafarge conseils et etudes,kaiser cement gypsum,cir.there,we were presented with the narrow question of whether kaiser could revive an unsuccessful motion to vacate an arbitration award by way of a rule b motion with a claim of newly discovered evidence.id.at.in affirming the denial of kaiser motion,we observed that the notice requirement of section would be meaningless if a party to the arbitration proceeding could bring an independent action asserting such claims outside of the statutory time period provided in section.id.emphasis added internal citations,brackets,and quotation marks omitted.however,equitable tolling was neither raised nor specifically addressed in that case.accordingly,lafarge does not govern the outcome of the case now before us.
furthermore,as the district court noted,the case law from other circuits is conflicting and most circuits including this circuit have declined to definitively rule on whether equitable tolling applies to the faa.see garrett merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.petitioner asks that we permit his late petition under the doctrine of equitable tolling.because we find that the district court correctly dismissed the petition on a jurisdictional basis,we need not reach this issue.see also fradella petricca,cir.taylor nelson,cir.piccolo dain,kalman quail,cir.declining to decide if equitable tolling applies to the faa pfannenstiel merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.stating that equitable tolling suspends the running of a statute,unless congress provides to the contrary,but finding equitable tolling inapplicable under the facts of the case but see cigna
