demoted from his position as the head football coach at contra costa community college college in march and ultimately terminated from the college at the conclusion of the school year,jose ortega filed two separate suits against the contra costa community college district district under the california fair employment and housing act feha,et challenging,respectively,the demotion and the termination.the trial court dismissed each complaint,concluding ortega failed to exhaust the administrative remedies provided in the collective bargaining agreement cba entered into between united faculty,the union representing ortega,and the district.we conclude the trial court erred.because the district internal grievance procedures were created by a cba and culminated in an arbitration,neither administrative nor judicial exhaustion applies to bar ortega claims.
background 
ortega was hired in the fall of by the district as an assistant football coach at the college.he served as the interim head football coach from august to january,and was hired as the head football coach and as a physical education teacher in january.on march,ortega was removed from his position as head football coach.ortega was notified on february,he would be terminated from his employment at the end of the school year,and was terminated in june.
claims regarding ortega removal from coaching position 
after his demotion from his position as head football coach,ortega filed a statement of grievance on april,alleging a violation of the cba in the grievance ortega claimed that,by refusing to assign him as the head football coach,the district improperly rejected the assignment made by the physical education department in violation of several provisions in the cba regarding scheduling faculty members.college president helen carr sent ortega a memo denying his grievance on april,citing a failure to follow proper procedure and a failure to comply with grievance timelines.ortega responded to the denial,and his claims were again rejected on procedural grounds on may.on june,ortega requested a level iii panel.the union and the district each suggested a panel member however,the process proceeded no further.
ortega filed a complaint with the california department of fair employment and housing dfeh and received a notice on april.on august,ortega filed a complaint in the contra costa superior court against the college the demotion action.the district was later substituted in as defendant.ortega filed his first amended complaint on october,alleging he was hispanic,and his supervisors and coworkers,who were or white,treated him differently,held him to different standards,and disciplined him more harshly.his complaint included three causes of action race discrimination in violation of government code section,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and negligent supervision.ortega prayer for relief included reinstatement to his position as head football coach,compensatory damages,general damages,punitive damages,and a permanent injunction enjoining the district from engaging in the unlawful practices alleged.in his complaint,ortega alleged that he had exhausted all of his administrative remedies 
the district filed an answer to ortega complaint on november,asserting affirmative defenses,including that the complaint is barred because plaintiff has failed to exhaust any applicable administrative remedies.
on november,the district filed a motion to dismiss based on ortega failure to exhaust the applicable grievance process,which the court granted.the order dismissing the operative complaint was filed and judgment was entered for the district on january.
claims regarding ortega termination 
when his employment contract was not renewed,ortega filed a second statement of grievance on june,alleging he was improperly terminated.this grievance was denied for failure to properly request a hearing and for failure to allege any specific violations of the cba.it appears that no further action was taken pursuant to the cba grievance procedure.
ortega received a second notice from the dfeh on june.he filed a complaint related to his termination against the district on december,the termination action this complaint included five causes of action race discrimination in violation of government code section,intentional infliction of emotional distress,negligent supervision,retaliation in violation of government code section,and wrongful termination in violation of public policy.ortega alleged he exhausted all of the administrative remedies required by the feha.ortega prayer for relief included a request for reinstatement to his position of head football coach,compensatory damages,general damages,punitive damages,and a permanent injunction enjoining the district from engaging in the alleged unlawful practices.
on march,the district filed a motion to strike each cause of action set forth in ortega complaint on the ground that the complaint was filed to evade the trial court order dismissing the demotion action.the district also filed a demurrer to ortega complaint,arguing,in part,that the complaint should be dismissed because ortega had not exhausted his administrative remedies ortega opposed the demurrer and motion to strike,arguing that he had mistakenly submitted the cba grievance following his termination,and as a probationary employee his grievance was not subject to or governed by the cba he argued he was not required to exhaust any administrative remedies or grievance process 
on april,the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.the court order stated,ortega invoked the grievance process in order to challenge his termination.ortega has not alleged that he has exhausted his administrative remedies.this court is without jurisdiction to hear this case.the court found the motion to strike was moot.on may,the court entered judgment dismissing the complaint in favor of the district.
ortega has appealed from the judgments entered against him in both of his actions against the district.the appeals were consolidated for the purposes of oral argument and decision.
discussion 
in his lawsuits,ortega filed both common law and feha claims alleging discrimination by the district.the trial court granted judgment for the district because ortega had failed to prove he had exhausted an available administrative remedy created by the cba in the demotion action and failed to allege such exhaustion in the termination action.ortega challenges these rulings on appeal.
standard of review 
the trial court decision to grant the district motion to dismiss ortega demotion action because of the failure to exhaust raises legal issues and is subject to de novo review.evans city of san jose th,d.in ortega termination action,the district demurred,again relying on ortega failure to exhaust his administrative remedies.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.we review this order de novo,exercising our independent judgment as to whether,as a matter of law,the complaint states a cause of action on any available legal theory.see lazar hertz th,d.in doing so,we assume the truth of all material factual allegations together with those matters subject to judicial notice.blank kirwan cal d.if the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,as here,we must decide whether there is a reasonable possibility the plaintiff could cure the defect with an amendment.citation.if we find that an amendment could cure the defect,we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion and we reverse if not,no abuse of discretion has occurred.citation.the plaintiff has the burden of proving that an amendment would cure the defect.citation.schifando city of los angeles cal th,d,schifando.
ii.ortega feha claims are not barred by administrative or judicial exhaustion 
the district relies on schifando,supra,cal th,d,johnson city of loma linda cal th,d,johnson and page los angeles county probation th,d page to argue ortega feha claims in his separate actions were barred by his failure to exhaust his internal administrative remedies.discussion of the application of the exhaustion doctrine to feha claims properly begins with an analysis of johnson.
in johnson,the city of loma linda terminated johnson from his position as an assistant city manager because of budgetary problems and,that same day,he filed a grievance with the city.after his grievance was rejected by the personnel board and the city council upheld that decision,johnson filed a discrimination claim with the dfeh.johnson was granted a letter and filed an action in superior court.the trial court granted summary judgment for the city of loma linda on the basis that johnson had failed to exhaust his judicial remedies.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court affirmed,holding that if a public employee utilizes internal administrative procedures to pursue discrimination claims and receives an adverse finding,the employee must challenge that finding by means of a mandate action in superior court or the findings are binding in later civil actions filed under the feha.johnson,at,d.
johnson examined the distinction between the exhaustion of judicial and administrative remedies.the requirement of exhaustion of judicial remedies is to be distinguished from the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies.citation.exhaustion of administrative remedies is a jurisdictional prerequisite to resort to the courts.citation.exhaustion of judicial remedies,on the other hand,is necessary to avoid giving binding effect to the administrative agency decision,because that decision has achieved finality due to the aggrieved party failure to pursue the exclusive judicial remedy for reviewing administrative action.citation.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.
in schifando,the supreme court held that a public employee who claims to have suffered discrimination need not exhaust an available internal administrative remedy with his employer prior to suing on an feha claim.schifando,cal th at,d.schifando filed a complaint against the city of los angeles alleging employment discrimination based on physical disability under the feha.schifando,at,d.the court of appeal affirmed the sustaining of the city demurrer on the basis that schifando was required to exhaust both the feha and the city charter remedies provided to city of los angeles employees before filing his lawsuit in superior court.schifando,at,d.the supreme court reversed.id.at,d.the court explained that t he feha was meant to supplement,not supplant or be supplanted by existing antidiscrimination remedies,in order to give employees the maximum opportunity to vindicate their civil rights against discrimination.schifando,at,d,italics omitted,quoting state personnel bd.fair employment housing com.cal d.the court discussed the differences between the feha administrative system and the city charter procedures available to the city employee,and reasoned that some plaintiffs would prefer the summary procedures provided by the city charter,while others would prefer to bypass these procedures to vindicate their civil rights through litigation.schifando,at,d.the court concluded the better rule was one that allows aggrieved public employees to seek redress in the forum that is most appropriate to their situation.id.at,d.
schifando distinguished johnson as a case that held if city employees have availed themselves of the administrative remedies a local statute affords,and have received an adverse finding,that finding is binding on subsequent discrimination claims under the feha unless set aside through a timely mandamus petition.citation.schifando,supra,cal th at,d.johnson did not require the employee to exhaust his remedies before the city personnel board in order to assert an feha fact,the court made it clear that the issue was not before it.citation.schifando,d.
finally,in page,the court of appeal determined that having chosen the administrative process and pursued it through an evidentiary hearing,an employee had the burden to exhaust administrative and judicial remedies before filing an feha claim.page,supra,th at,d.page was injured while working for a county probation department.id.at,d.when she was able to return to work,the department did not offer her the same or a similar position,and she filed a grievance before the civil service commission.id.at,d.hearings were held and the hearing officer issued a written statement of decision finding that the department had not violated the americans with disabilities act of.page,at,d.page and the department objected to the recommended findings but,before the civil service commission had notified the parties of its final decision,page filed a complaint with the dfeh and subsequently initiated a lawsuit for violations of the feha.page,at,d.the department successfully demurred on the grounds that page had failed to exhaust her administrative remedy and had failed to challenge the hearing officer findings by a petition for writ of administrative mandamus.id.at,d.the court of appeal affirmed,stating that page chose the civil service commission process and proceeded through three days of hearings,resulting in a comprehensive decision by the hearing officer.page was not then free to ignore and abandon the administrative process and proceed to an feha action for damages.page had to await a final civil service c ommission decision and,if it was adverse,then file a petition for writ of mandate in the trial court only if she had done so and prevailed in the writ proceedings,thus vacating the civil service c ommission decision,could she have then filed a lawsuit,since the civil service c ommission decision has issue and claim preclusive effect.page,at,d.the court concluded,though a public employee may choose to bypass the administrative process,if she pursues it through evidentiary hearings to a proposed decision,then she has the burden to exhaust administrative and judicial remedies notwithstanding the risk that an feha claim may no longer be viable.page,at,d.
thus,under schifando,a public employee may choose to ignore statutory civil service remedies for employment discrimination and proceed directly to the courts to obtain relief under the feha.however,under johnson,if the public employee elects to utilize the civil service remedies provided and receives an adverse finding,that finding binds the trial court in any subsequent feha action,unless the finding is overturned in a mandate proceeding.finally,as page explains,if the public employee has had an evidentiary hearing during the civil service proceedings,the employee may not opt out of those proceedings before a final decision is reached in order to file an feha claim in court.instead the employee must exhaust the administrative remedies provided,until a final decision is obtained,and,if the decision is adverse,exhaust the judicial remedy by pursuing mandate relief.
the district argues that ortega chose to initiate the internal grievance procedure provided in the cba following each adverse employment action,and the doctrines of administrative and judicial exhaustion bar his lawsuits.but the district ignores the critical difference between the decisions it relies upon,where the employees administrative remedies were provided by statute,and ortega cases,where his internal remedies were provided in a cba.
in alexander,d alexander,the united states supreme court considered the preclusive effect of an arbitration decision on a subsequent discrimination claim under title vii of the civil rights act of et,when the arbitration procedure was mandated by a cba.the high court held that an adverse decision by the arbitrator does not bar a subsequent claim under title vii by an employee,who pursued the grievance to final arbitration under the nondiscrimination clause of a cba.alexander,at.in camargo california portland cement th,d camargo,the court adopted the conclusion in alexander and applied it to the feha,determining that a arbitration has no preclusive effect on feha claims.the holding in alexander stemmed,in part,from the high court concern that the union often exercises control over the presentation of grievances under a cba,and the union interests may not always coincide with an individual employee interest in the pursuit of his or her discrimination claim.alexander,at fn.accord,barrentine freight s
