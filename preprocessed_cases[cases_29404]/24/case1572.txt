we reverse.although plaintiffs filed suit for damages and sought a preliminary injunction,substantial evidence does not support a finding of waiver of arbitration as there is no evidence defendants were prejudiced by plaintiffs inconsistent actions and delay in seeking arbitration.the appropriate prejudgment remedy to recover possession of personal property is a writ of possession under the claim and delivery law,not an injunction.since we find merit in plaintiffs appeal,we award no sanctions.
