what happens when the parties to a contract put a broad arbitration clause in one document,but include no such clause in a second document providing security for the promises made in the first document at least under the circumstances of this case,we hold that the parties must submit the question of arbitrability to the arbitrator first,before addressing any claims that may not be subject to the arbitration clause.
background 
rachel cain sherman and larry sherman used a number of trade names and record labels,including trax records,to create and market house music.in they negotiated an agreement with casablanca trax,for production and distribution of recordings.on december,the parties signed three separate documents detailing the terms of the agreement.
the joint venture agreement jva assigned to the shermans responsibility for finding new artists and producing their recordings while casablanca bore responsibility for marketing the recordings.casablanca promised,in the jva,to advance the shermans each month for expenses.casablanca would recover the advances from sales of recordings released by the joint venture.the jva also included the following provisions 
casablanca shall advise trax and keep trax up to date with respect to revenues generated by the joint venture on a monthly basis.a formal accounting shall be forwarded to trax on a basis setting out those revenues generated by the joint venture during the prec e ding period and the deductions of all allowable recoupments,costs,fees and expenses.
any dispute arising ou t of or pursuant to this agreement shall not be taken to litigation,but shall be settled in the following sequence,although steps may be passed by mutual consent 
a negotiation 
b mediation arbitration 
c binding arbitration.
in a separate document casablanca promised to loan the shermans,with scheduled monthly repayments deducted from the advanced each month under the jva.the loan agreement further provided 
to the extent that any monies have been advanced by the lender to the debtor prior to the effective date of this agreement,it is hereby acknowledged by the parties hereto that all such prior advances shall comprise amounts advanced as part of the advance under the loan and that such prior advances were made to the debtor on and subject to the terms and conditions contained in this agreement.
the loan agreement did not include an arbitration clause.
in the third document the shermans gave casablanca a security interest in their assets,including their recording equipment and the recordings made thereon.the security agreement secured all duties and obligations of the debtor to the lender.if the shermans defaulted on their secured debts,the security agreement gave casablanca the right to take possession of all or any part of the collateral with power to sell,lease or dispose of all or any part of the collateral.the security agreement did not include an arbitration clause.
casablanca advanced to the shermans the sums promised.in march the parties signed a modification of the jva.the modification specified sales targets and granted casablanca the right,if sales did not meet the targets,to recoup all of the monetary advances it made to the shermans.the modification did not affect the arbitration clause or casablanca duty to account for sales.
on may,casablanca sued the shermans,along with the many recording companies the shermans operated,seeking replevin of the collateral listed in the security agreement.in a second count casablanca sought to recover for breach of both the jva and the loan agreement.when the court awarded casablanca judgment on the replevin count,casablanca seized most of defendants assets described in the security agreement.
in their answer to the second count defendants admitted that casablanca had loaned them under the loan agreement and advanced them under the jva.because casablanca deducted loan repayments from the advances,according to the complaint defendants owed a balance of less than on the loan covered by the loan agreement.casablanca claimed 
plaintiffs advanced over in cash and expenses for the benefit of defendants the advances.defendants are obligated to repay the advances pursuant to the joint venture agreement.
the amounts due under the loan agreement and the advances are collectively referred to as the indebtedness.
the indebtedness is secured by a security interest in certain assets and equipment of the defendants the collateral and evidenced by that certain general security agreement.
defendants admitted the allegations of those three paragraphs.
defendants posed three affirmative defenses to the breach of contract claim,including charges that casablanca breached the jva by failing to account for sales and by failing to seek arbitration.the court struck the affirmative defenses,but it permitted defendants to file a motion for alternative dispute resolution.defendants filed such a motion in december.
defendants also sought leave to file a counterclaim that reiterated its affirmative defenses.casablanca then moved for summary judgment on its claim for breach of contract.it offered in support the affidavit of its president,who swore to the allegations in the complaint,including the allegation that casablanca performed all its obligations under the loan agreement,joint venture agreement,and security agreement.defendants verified their answer in which they charged casablanca with failing to send defendants the semiannual accounting reports the jva required.
in april the trial court granted casablanca summary judgment on the breach of contract claim and denied the motion for arbitration.the court agreed with casablanca contention that the arbitration clause in the jva did not apply to a dispute over the repayment of advances made pursuant to the jva 
while the joint venture agreement deals generally with how the parties are to cooperate and further their common interest under the venture,the loan agreement and security agreement govern the lending relationship created when defendants borrowed money and took substantial advances from casablanca.t hese instruments unmistakably evidence the intent to treat the lending relationship differently and more formally than the other aspects of the venture relationship.
the court also held that defendants did not invoke the arbitration provision and made no demand for arbitration.
defendants moved to vacate the judgment.in june,several weeks before the hearing on the motion to vacate,casablanca began the process of selling,pursuant to the security agreement,the assets it seized under the replevin count.casablanca claimed that it circulated a notice of public sale setting a sale date of june.defendants responded with affidavits stating that they did not receive statutorily requisite notice.the court denied defendants motion to stay the sale.on june casablanca sold itself all of the assets it had seized.two days later the trial court denied defendants motion to vacate the judgment on the breach of contract claim.defendants now appeal.
defendants claim that the court committed reversible error when it denied the motion for arbitration.on appeal we need to determine whether the record sufficiently supports the trial court decision denying arbitration.bass smg,d.insofar as the trial court decided the issue as a matter of contract interpretation,we review the ruling de novo.bass,d at,in re marriage of turrell,d.
defendants formally moved for arbitration in december,less than seven months after casablanca filed this lawsuit.we find on this record no indication that defendants ever acted in a manner inconsistent with the assertion of their right to arbitrate.see liberty chevrolet,rainey,d.the record contradicts the trial court finding that defendants failed to invoke the arbitration clause.defendants did not waive the right to arbitrate.
casablanca argues that the trial court correctly interpreted the contracts.the jva requires arbitration of a ny dispute arising ou t of or pursuant to the agreement.the parties adopted the language of t he broadest arbitration clauses.donaldson,lufkin jenrette futures,barr.our supreme court noted that in some cases,even in c
