jesus reyes filed a class complaint alleging wage and hour violations against liberman broadcasting,lbi.lbi appeals from the trial court order denying its motion to compel arbitration.we reverse.
background 
reyes worked as a security officer for lbi from april,until september.reyes executed lbi mutual agreement to arbitrate claims arbitration agreement on april,prior to commencing his employment with lbi.
the arbitration agreement is expressly governed by the federal arbitration act faa et.the arbitration agreement provides that lbi and reyes agree to submit to final and binding arbitration all claims,disputes and controversies arising out of,relating to or in any way associated with reyes employment or its termination.specific claims identified in the arbitration agreement include wage claims,unfair competition claims,and claims for violation of federal,state,local,or other governmental law.ibid.the arbitration agreement does not contain an express class arbitration waiver.however,the arbitration agreement does provide that each party to the arbitration may represent,or may be represented by a licensed attorney.the arbitration agreement provides for discovery sufficient to adequately arbitrate the parties claims,but authorizes the arbitrator to impose appropriate limits on discovery.reyes signed an acknowledgment of his receipt of the arbitration agreement stating that he could read the arbitration agreement in both english and spanish.
on may,reyes filed a complaint on behalf of a class asserting seven causes of action arising out of alleged wage and hour violations,citing among other statutes labor code section on july,reyes filed a first amended complaint fac adding a representative claim pursuant to the private attorneys general act paga,et.lbi answered the fac on august,asserting affirmative defenses.lbi did not assert the existence of an arbitration agreement as an affirmative defense.
that same day,reyes propounded discovery on lbi.on september,lbi took the first session of reyes deposition.on october,lbi responded to the discovery requests by raising objections to each request.the parties then engaged in lengthy meet and confer efforts whereby lbi agreed to produce some discovery and statistically representative samples of certain requested information.the parties also scheduled a mediation for july.
on october,the trial court held a case management conference.on december,the trial court held a second status conference.on march,the trial court entered a stipulation between the parties to extend the deadline for class certification.some time before may,lbi substituted new counsel.
on june,lbi informed reyes that it intended to move to compel arbitration and had reserved a july,hearing date.lbi filed the underlying motion to compel arbitration on july.on july,the trial court denied the motion on the ground that lbi had waived its right to arbitration by its failure to properly and timely assert it.lbi timely appealed from this order.
discussion 
lbi did not waive its right to compel arbitration.
the denial of a motion to compel arbitration is appealable under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.
public policy strongly favors arbitration and requires close judicial scrutiny of waiver claims.agnes medical center.pacificare of california cal th.although a court may deny a petition to compel arbitration on the ground of waiver citation,waivers are not to be lightly inferred and the party seeking to establish a waiver bears a heavy burden of proof.ibid.a ny doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver,delay,or a like defense to arbitrability.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury const,d.
the determination of waiver is generally a question of fact,and the trial court finding,if supported by sufficient evidence,is binding on the appellate court.agnes,supra,cal th at.however,when the facts are undisputed and only one inference may reasonably be drawn,the issue is one of law and the reviewing court is not bound by the trial court ruling.citation.ibid.the facts in this case are undisputed,and we therefore engage in de novo review.
a written agreement to arbitrate an existing or future dispute can be waived if not properly asserted.code civ,subd.a.to determine whether a party has waived its right to arbitration,we consider whether the party actions are inconsistent with the right to arbitrate whether the litigation machinery has been substantially invoked and the parties were well into preparation of a lawsuit before the party notified the opposing party of an intent to arbitrate whether a party either requested arbitration enforcement close to the trial date or delayed for a long period before seeking a stay whether a defendant seeking arbitration filed a counterclaim without asking for a stay of the proceedings whether important intervening steps,taking advantage of judicial discovery procedures not available in arbitration had taken place and whether the delay affected,misled,or prejudiced the opposing party.agnes,supra,cal th at.we address each factor in turn.
lbi actions were not inconsistent with the right to arbitrate.
the arbitration agreement does not authorize class arbitration.
a party may not be compelled under the faa to submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to do so.stolt nielsen animalfeeds int l,d stolt nielsen kinecta alternative financial solutions,superior court th,kinecta but see jock sterling jewelers cir.as the arbitration agreement explicitly covers the type of claims that are the subject of reyes lawsuit and provides only for bilateral arbitration,there is no contractual basis for concluding the parties agreed to submit to class arbitration.therefore,we conclude that the arbitration agreement does not authorize class arbitration.
in stolt nielsen,the parties stipulated that the arbitration clause was silent with respect to class arbitration they conceded that they had reached no agreement regarding class arbitration and submitted the question of whether the arbitration clause provided for class arbitration to an arbitration panel.stolt nielsen,supra.at.the arbitrators found that class arbitration was permitted.id.at.the court held that the arbitrators decision conflicted with the faa because the parties never agreed to submit their dispute to class arbitration.id.at.the court reasoned that the differences between bilateral and arbitration are too great for arbitrators to presume,consistent with their limited powers under the faa,that the parties mere silence on the issue of arbitration constitutes consent to resolve their disputes in class proceedings.ibid.therefore,the court concluded that because there was no agreement to engage in class arbitration,the arbitration panel exceeded its authority in determining that the clause provided for class arbitration.ibid.
in kinecta,the plaintiff signed an arbitration agreement providing for the arbitration of all disputes with the arising out of the employment context.kinecta,supra,th at.the arbitration agreement made no reference to any parties other than plaintiff and defendant,and did not include an express waiver of class arbitration.id.at,fn.when defendant moved to compel arbitration and to dismiss plaintiff class claims,the trial court granted the motion to compel arbitration of plaintiff individual claims but denied defendant motion to dismiss class claims.id.at.division three of this appellate district reversed the trial court denial of defendant motion to dismiss class claims.id.at.the court reasoned that the arbitration provision was limited to the arbitration of disputes between plaintiff and defendant because the plain language of the provision identified only plaintiff and defendant as parties to the agreement.id.at.additionally,the court noted that the plaintiff failed to provide any evidence showing that the parties agreed to arbitrate disputes of classes of other employees.id.at.therefore,the court held t he parties did not agree to authorize class arbitration in their arbitration agreement.ibid.
like the arbitration provision in kinecta,the arbitration agreement in the instant case makes no reference to any parties other than plaintiff and defendant.it provides only for the final and binding arbitration of all claims,disputes and controversies arising out of reyes employment or its termination.the plain language of the arbitration agreement further states that each party may only represent or may be represented by a licensed attorney.there is no mention of class action claims in the arbitration agreement.as in kinecta,class actions are not listed among the expressly excluded claims.furthermore,reyes has not presented any evidence showing any intent by the parties to provide for class arbitration in the arbitration agreement.therefore,we hold that because the plain language of the arbitration agreement provides only for the bilateral arbitration of reyes claims,the arbitration agreement does not authorize class arbitration.the arbitration agreement,like the arbitration provision in kinecta,bars class arbitration because the parties did not agree to class arbitration.
california case law potentially barred enforcement of the arbitration agreement.
in,the california supreme court held that while not all class action waivers are necessarily unconscionable,when the waiver is found in a consumer contract of adhesion where disputes between the parties will predictably involve small amounts of damages,and when it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money,then the waiver is in practice an exculpatory contract clause.discover bank superior court cal th,discover bank.the court held that such waivers were unconscionable.ibid.the court applied the framework in armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,armendariz,finding both a procedural and substantive element of unconscionability.discover bank,at.the court found procedural unconscionability where the contract was amended in the form of a bill stuffer.id.at.it found substantive unconscionability where the class action waiver in effect acted as an exculpatory clause.id.at.
in,the california supreme court extended discover bank to the employment context,holding when it is alleged that an employer has systematically denied proper overtime pay to a class of employees and a class action is requested notwithstanding an arbitration agreement that contains a class arbitration waiver,the trial court must consider four factors the modest size of the potential recovery,the potential for retaliation against members of the class,the fact that absent members of the class may be ill informed about their rights,and other real world obstacles to the vindication of class members rights to overtime pay through individual arbitration in deciding whether to enforce the class arbitration waiver.gentry superior court cal th,gentry.however,unlike in discover bank,the court did not apply the armendariz unconscionability framework.instead,the court reasoned that as the statutory right to receive overtime pay embodied in labor code section is unwaivable,and as a class arbitration waiver could lead to a de facto waiver of these rights,such waivers would interfere with employees ability to vindicate unwaivable rights and to enforce the overtime laws and thus were unenforceable.gentry,at.
reyes correctly notes that discover bank and gentry dealt with express class arbitration waivers,not arbitration agreements silent as to class arbitration.however,in light of stolt nielsen,supra.and kinecta,supra,th,arbitration agreements silent on the issue of class arbitration nevertheless have the same effect of precluding class arbitration so long as there is no evidence that the parties agreed to class arbitration.in other words,an arbitration agreement silent on the issue of class arbitration may have the same effect as an express class waiver.we believe that discover bank and gentry would have applied in such a situation because both kinds of arbitration contracts would be,under the discover bank reasoning,exculpatory contracts.
as the arbitration agreement is silent on the issue of class arbitration,applying the stolt nielsen rationale,it impliedly bars class arbitration as did the express class arbitration waiver at issue in gentry.the arbitration agreement therefore has the same effect as one potentially barred under the gentry test.
there is a difference of opinion whether at t mobility concepcion impliedly overruled gentry.
at the end of april,the united states supreme court explicitly overruled discover bank in at t mobility concepcion,d concepcion,holding that the discover bank rule was preempted by the faa.concepcion,at.the court first held that a court may not rely on the uniqueness of an agreement to arbitrate as a basis for a holding that enforcement would be unconscionable.id.at.instead,such a state law rule that conflicts with the arbitration of a claim is preempted by the faa.ibid.the court reasoned that the discover bank rule interfered with arbitration by allowing any party to a consumer contract to demand class arbitration ex post.concepcion,at.the court held that as class arbitration sacrifices the principal advantage of arbitration its informality and makes the process slower,more costly,and more likely to generate procedural morass than final judgment,requires procedural formality,and greatly increases risks to defendants,the discover bank rule interfered with arbitration.concepcion,at.the discover bank rule was thus preempted by the faa.concepcion,at.
in overruling the discover bank rule,the court first found that the requirement that damages be predictably small,was toothless and malleable.concepcion,supra.at.the court rejected the concern that class proceedings are necessary to prosecute claims that might otherwise slip through the legal system,stating that,states can not require a procedure that is inconsistent with the faa,even if it is desirable for unrelated reasons.id.at.like discover bank,gentry requires that the trial court consider the modest size of the potential individual recovery.gentry,supra,cal th at.
the court also determined that even with differential bargaining power between parties,arbitration agreements must be enforced as written.concepcion,supra,fn.this implicates the gentry court concern regarding the fact that absent members of the class may be ill informed about their rights.gentry,supra,cal th at.information asymmetry is a hallmark of differences in bargaining power.while o ppression arises from an inequality of bargaining power,s urprise involves the extent to which the supposedly terms of the bargain are hidden.a m produce fmc d.it is not hard to see how informational asymmetry leads to unequal bargaining power an individual unaware of her rights is unlikely to vigorously bargain over those rights.an unsophisticated party may unknowingly concede her rights without asking for concessions,whereas a knowledgeable party may leverage her rights into a superior bargaining position.
division two of this district recently held that concepcion invalidated the gentry test.iskanian cls transportation los angeles,llc th iskanian.in iskanian,plaintiff signed an arbitration agreement which required all disputes arising out of his employment to be arbitrated and included an express class waiver.id.at.after plaintiff filed a class action complaint against defendant,defendant moved to compel arbitration.ibid.the trial court granted the motion,but that motion was withdrawn after gentry was decided and the appellate court issued a writ of mandate.iskanian,at.the parties litigated the case for several years until the united states supreme court decided concepcion,whereupon defendant renewed its motion to compel arbitration and to dismiss the class claims.iskanian,at.the court held that the concepcion decision conclusively invalidates the gentry test.iskanian,at.the court reasoned that since concepcion thoroughly rejected the concept that class arbitration procedures should be imposed on a party who never agreed to them,and since gentry imposed class arbitration on the parties if plaintiff could meet the test,gentry was inconsistent with the faa.iskanian,at.the court additionally rejected the argument that plaintiff brought a class action to vindicate statutory rights,reasoning simply that t he sound policy reasons identified in gentry for invalidating certain class waivers are insufficient to trump the effect of the faa,as expressed in concepcion.iskanian,at.
several federal district courts in california have also held that concepcion,in overruling discover bank,overruled gentry.in lewis ubs financial services,d,the court held that a class action waiver contained in an arbitration clause in a promissory note securing an employee forgivable loan was enforceable under california law.id.at.in so holding,the court rejected plaintiff argument that gentry remains viable because it addresses arbitration agreements contained in employment contracts,while concepcion pertains to consumer contracts.lewis,at.the court reasoned that concepcion can not be read so narrowly.lewis,at.rather,because gentry advances a rule of enforceability that applies specifically to arbitration provisions,as opposed to a general rule of contract interpretation concepcion effectively overrules gentry.lewis,at.see also sanders swift transportation company of arizona,llc,d,morse servicemaster global holdings.july,no.c.lexis,fn.murphy directv,cv.lexis,valle lowe hiw.aug.lexis.
there is contrary california authority.justice mosk,writing for division five of this appellate district,implicitly reaffirmed the reasoning in gentry by applying it in reversing a trial court ruling invalidating a class action waiver for lack of evidence.brown ralphs grocery th,brown.the plaintiff filed a complaint asserting as a class action labor code and business and profession code violations.id.at.the plaintiff had signed an arbitration agreement that waived class action claims.id.at.the defendants immediately moved to compel arbitration.the trial court determined that the arbitration provision was unconscionable.id.at.the court of appeal reversed,holding that gentry requires a factual showing under its test and,because plaintiff failed to make such a showing,the trial court erred in invalidating the class action waiver.brown,at.justice kriegler concurred and dissented,adding that w ith the reasoning of discover bank having been rejected as being in conflict with the faa,the same fate may be in store for gentry.nonetheless gentry remains the binding law of this state.brown,at kriegler,concurring.the forth appellate district has declined to disregard gentry without specific guidance from our high court,citing brown.truly nolen of america superior court,th.lexis.
in kinecta,the court acknowledged a question exists about whether gentry survived the overruling of discover bank in concepcion,but it is not one we need to decide.kinecta,supra,th at.the court agreed with brown,supra,th since it has not been expressly abrogated or overruled,gentry appears to remain the binding law in california.kinecta,at.nevertheless,it was the plaintiff burden to provide evidence of the four gentry factors,and the record showed that the plaintiff provided no such evidence.therefore,even if gentry remained good law,there were no grounds to declare the arbitration agreement unenforceable.kinecta,at.the first appellate district reached a similar result,concluding we need not decide here whether concepcion abrogates the rule in gentry,because the plaintiff submitted no evidence as to any of the factors discussed in gentry.nelsen legacy partners residential,th,nelsen.
like the plaintiffs in kinecta and nelsen,reyes did not carry his burden to make a factual showing that the gentry factors made the arbitration agreement unenforceable.in opposition to lbi motion to compel,reyes submitted his own declaration and that of his attorney,neither of which contains any evidence relevant to the gentry test.we therefore need not,and do not,decide whether gentry remains good law after concepcion,supra.
lbi did not waive its right to arbitration by not moving to compel arbitration prior to concepcion.
a party does not act inconsistently with a right to arbitrate when it does not seek to enforce an arbitration agreement unenforceable under existing law.see fisher becker paribas cir,fisher letizia prudential bache securities,cir.before concepcion,lbi reasonably concluded that it could not enforce the arbitration agreement.
in fisher,supra,defendant moved to compel arbitration over three years after the filing of the suit,did not raise arbitration as an affirmative defense,filed pretrial motions,and engaged in extensive discovery.id.at.defendant moved to compel only after the supreme court rejected the intertwining doctrine,which denied arbitration where it was impractical if not impossible to separate out nonarbitrable from arbitrable contract claims.id.at.the court reasoned that the defendant properly perceived that it was futile to file a motion to compel arbitration until the supreme court rejected the intertwining doctrine.id.at.the court thus held that defendants did not act inconsistently with a known existing right to compel arbitration.id.at.
several district courts have concluded that class defendants did not act inconsistently with the right to arbitrate when they did not move to compel arbitration as provided for in their arbitration agreements until after concepcion,supra.
in quevedo macy,d,plaintiff filed a class action suit against defendant for failure to timely pay all wages owed upon termination.id.at plaintiff signed an arbitration agreement that included an express class waiver.id.at.defendant litigated the case without asserting arbitration,and the court ruled on class certification issues.defendant moved to compel arbitration about a month following concepcion.quevedo,at.the court held that defendants did not act inconsistently with the right to arbitrate even though defendant litigated the case for over two years before asserting its right to arbitration.id.at.the court reasoned in light of gentry,defendant reasonably concluded that it could not enforce the class action waiver in its arbitration agreement.quevedo,at.only after the supreme court held in concepcion that the discover bank,supra,cal th rule was preempted by the faa did it become clear that defendant had the right to enforce its arbitration agreement as written.quevedo,at.because defendant moved to compel arbitration just less than a month after the supreme court issued concepcion,the court concluded that defendant earlier failure to seek to enforce its agreement did not reflect an intent to forego the right to seek arbitration.ibid.
in in re cal.title ins.antitrust litig.june.lexis,plaintiffs signed an arbitration agreement silent on the issue of class action arbitration.id.at.each plaintiff had purchased title insurance from one of the defendants.ibid.plaintiffs filed a class suit,alleging that defendants manipulated and fixed the cost and price of title insurance.ibid.defendants moved to compel arbitration only after the supreme court issued concepcion.in re cal.title,at.the court rejected plaintiffs argument that defendants had waived arbitration,holding that it would indeed have been futile for defendants to have moved to compel arbitration prior to the decision in concepcion.in re cal.title,at.the court reasoned that concepcion applied to the arbitration agreements at issue even though they were silent as to waivers because a party may not be compelled under the faa to submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to do so.in re cal.title,at,quoting stolt nielsen,supra.at.
similarly,if lbi had moved to compel arbitration prior to concepcion,lbi faced the substantial risk that it could have been forced,under gentry,to arbitrate reyes claims in class arbitration.that risk diminished substantially when concepcion changed the legal landscape,and lbi promptly informed reyes of its intent to arbitrate one month after the decision and filed its motion to compel a month later.lbi did not act inconsistently with a right to arbitrate by not moving to compel until after concepcion.
our conclusion is not inconsistent with roberts el cajon motors,th roberts,in which the court affirmed a trial court finding that the defendant forfeited arbitration,concluding that substantial evidence supported the finding.id.at.plaintiff purchased a vehicle from el cajon,entering into a retail installment sale contract including an arbitration provision and a class arbitration waiver.id.at.after plaintiff filed a class action complaint,defendant answered with a general denial and asserted affirmative defenses,none of which asserted the existence of an arbitration provision.id.at.plaintiff served written discovery on defendant and defendant served plaintiff with written discovery.ibid.defendant also contacted putative class members with settlement offers.id.at.defendant filed a motion to compel arbitration in january,over a year before concepcion,supra.was issued.id.at,fn.
the court held that defendant waived arbitration when it waited five months to invoke arbitration.roberts,supra,th at.the court reasoned that as defendant waited months after plaintiff propounded written discovery to notify plaintiff of its intent to arbitrate,and as defendant knew this discovery would be useless in individual arbitration,defendant acted inconsistently with the intent to arbitrate.ibid.the court further held that defendant prejudiced plaintiff by identifying,contacting,and offering to settle with putative class members,thus reducing the size of the putative class.thus,as the defendant acted inconsistently with the right to arbitrate and its acts prejudiced plaintiff,the court upheld the trial court finding that defendant waived its right to arbitrate.id.at.
unlike the defendant in roberts,lbi moved for arbitration after the supreme court issued concepcion,supra.this is a critical distinction.in rejecting defendant futility argument,the roberts court noted concepcion was not decided until april,more than a year after el cajon moved to compel arbitration,apparently on the assumption that concepcion would have been decided favorably.id.at,fn,italics added.here,however,lbi promptly moved to compel arbitration when the law arguably allowed the arbitration agreement to be enforced on its terms,and did not act inconsistently with the right to arbitrate.
reyes cites another unpublished federal district court case,borrero travelers indem,civ s.lexis,and two state appellate cases,walnut producers of california diamond foods,th walnut producers and arguelles romero superior court th arguelles romero.reyes argues that these cases establish that moving to compel arbitration before concepcion,supra.would only have faced an uncertain outcome,and so lbi acted inconsistently with the right to arbitrate by failing to move to compel prior to concepcion.we reject this argument.
walnut producers and arguelles romero are not applicable,as both applied the discover bank,supra,cal th rule to commercial contracts.only borrero travelers indem,supra.lexis applied the gentry test to an employment arbitration agreement,holding that the express class action waiver was not unconscionable,as plaintiff had not presented evidence on any of the four gentry factors.borrero,at.
what reyes argument misses is that the futility doctrine does not require entirely clear,uncontradicted authority barring the enforcement of an arbitration agreement.in fisher,supra,the ninth circuit had indicated its approval of the intertwining doctrine in de lancie birr,wilson cir in june,prior to the filing of the action in august.fisher,at.additionally,a number of federal courts had adopted the intertwining doctrine,including two district courts in the ninth circuit,and had used it as a basis to refuse to compel arbitration.ibid.however,it was not until in byrd dean witter reynolds,cir,that the ninth circuit held that the intertwining doctrine was applicable in its jurisdiction.fisher,at.in other words,the court held that the defendant properly perceived it was futile to move to compel arbitration even when the intertwining doctrine had not yet been expressly held to be applicable in the circuit.ibid.
lbi reasonably perceived that it likely would have been futile to seek to compel arbitration in light of gentry,supra,cal th and california authority applying gentry to invalidate class arbitration waivers.see,franco athens disposal,th,sanchez western pizza enterprises,th.just as the defendant in fisher,supra,was entitled to rely on the ninth circuit comment in de lancie and the trend of federal authority to suggest futility in asserting arbitration,lbi was entitled to rely on multiple california decisions invalidating class arbitration waivers to suggest futility.fisher,at.
even if we were to accept reyes contention that lbi would only have faced an uncertain outcome had it moved to compel arbitration prior to concepcion,supra,we would still conclude that lbi actions were not inconsistent with the right to arbitration.the fisher defendant faced an uncertain outcome had it moved to compel arbitration as well.when the action was filed,the ninth circuit had not yet expressly adopted the intertwining doctrine,and several federal courts had rejected the intertwining doctrine.fisher,supra,at,fn.
a.the litigation machinery has not been substantially invoked.
the second agnes,supra,cal th factor examines whether the litigation machinery has been substantially invoked and the parties were well into preparation of a lawsuit before the party notified the opposing party of an intent to arbitrate.id.at.this factor appears to be a high hurdle.see law offices of dixon howell valley th.
the litigation machinery has not been substantially invoked in the instant case.the parties have engaged in very limited discovery reyes has propounded one set of discovery requests on lbi and lbi has taken reyes deposition for one day.the parties have spent months in extensive meet and confer efforts.no discovery has actually been exchanged,prompting reyes to move to compel responses to discovery.the parties have made only limited use of the judicial process.
the parties in the instant case have invoked the court litigation machinery even less than the parties in quevedo,where the court entertained a motion to dismiss by defendants and a motion for class certification by plaintiff,and some discovery had occurred.quevedo,supra,d at.the quevedo court found that this failed to qualify as substantially invoking the district court litigation machinery,and even if it did,defendant had not used it beyond the minimum required to defend against the suit.ibid.unlike the defendants in quevedo,lbi has not filed a motion to dismiss,and reyes has not filed a motion for class certification.while some discovery has occurred,lbi has not substantially invoked the litigation machinery.
lbi has not delayed for a long period before seeking a stay.
although lbi waited months before asserting the existence of the arbitration agreement,lbi informed reyes that it intended to move to compel arbitration just one month after the supreme court issued concepcion,supra,and filed its motion to compel a month later.as lbi could not enforce the arbitration agreement as written prior to concepcion,the delay does not support a finding of waiver.this is especially true because lbi informed reyes that it would seek to compel arbitration almost as soon as concepcion was decided.we further address this below in analyzing the prejudice factor.
lbi did not file a counterclaim without seeking a stay.
lbi did not file a counterclaim without seeking a stay of the proceedings.this factor does not apply.
no important intervening steps have taken place to justify a finding of waiver.
the fifth agnes,supra,cal th factor looks at whether important intervening steps have taken place,such as taking advantage of judicial discovery procedures not available in arbitration.id.at.we address this below in considering whether the delay in moving to compel prejudiced reyes.
reyes has not shown prejudice from lbi delay in moving to compel arbitration.
courts typically will not find prejudice where the party opposing arbitration shows only that it incurred court costs and legal expenses.agnes,supra,cal th at.instead,courts have found prejudice only where the petitioning party conduct has substantially undermined the important public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution or substantially impaired the other side ability to take advantage of the benefits and efficiencies of arbitration.id.at.therefore,prejudice has been found,for example,where the petitioning party used the judicial discovery processes to gain information about the other side case that could not have been gained in arbitration citation where a party unduly delayed and waited until the eve of trial to seek arbitration citation or where the lengthy nature of the delays associated with the petitioning party attempts to litigate resulted in lost evidence citation.ibid.in this case,any prejudice to reyes did not substantially undermine the public policy in favor of arbitration.
delay alone,at least in the class arbitration context,does not constitute prejudice.while courts have found waiver in cases where the party delayed moving for arbitration for less time than lbi,these cases have additional reasons for finding prejudice.in sobremonte superior court th,defendant delayed months before moving to compel arbitration but also filed demurrers and engaged in expansive discovery.in davis continental airlines,th,defendant delayed six months before moving to compel arbitration but also used court discovery procedures not available in arbitration to obtain pages of documents from plaintiff,and took plaintiff deposition.
lbi did not exhibit any other conduct demonstrating prejudice to reyes.although lbi took reyes deposition,this same deposition could have been taken in arbitration because the arbitration agreement entitles the parties to discovery sufficient to adequately arbitrate their claims.in roman superior court th,roman,defendant filed a demurrer,served objections to discovery requests,and filed a motion to compel plaintiff deposition.the roman court did not find waiver,noting,in particular,that no substantive discovery responses had been served by either side and the discovery requests defendant served were authorized under aaa rules.ibid.this is similar to the situation here lbi responded to reyes discovery requests by raising objections to each and every discovery request and took reyes deposition.and unlike the defendant in roman,lbi did not file a demurrer.further,there is no evidence that lbi used the judicial discovery process to gain information which it would not otherwise be able to obtain.lbi use of the judicial discovery process is akin to the defendant in quevedo,supra,d,who participated in the litigation and allowed discovery to take place only because it reasonably believed that it had no meaningful alternative given that its arbitration agreement was not enforceable as written.quevedo,at.
hoover american income life ins.th hoover is distinguishable.there,the court found waiver where the defendant did not introduce the question of arbitration for almost a full year,and did not file a motion to compel for almost months.id.at.unlike lbi,the defendant in hoover actively litigated the case by twice trying to remove the case to federal court,availing itself of discovery mechanisms like depositions not available in arbitration,and soliciting putative class members in an effort to reduce the size of the class.id.at.
the trial court relied on guess,superior court th guess in reaching its finding of waiver.in guess,the court found waiver where the defendant moved to compel arbitration just three months after the filing of the claim.id.at.however,the defendant also fully participated in the discovery process,and sent two sets of lawyers to the depositions and took full advantage of every opportunity to the deponents.id.at.the court found prejudice because plaintiff revealed at least some of its theories and tactics to defendant.id.at,fn.in contrast,lbi did not take full advantage of the discovery process.lbi deposed only the named plaintiff for one day and responded to each and every discovery request reyes propounded.further,in guess,the defendant offered no explanation for its decision to wait months to demand arbitration.id.at.here,lbi did not assert arbitration because if it had,it could have been forced into class arbitration.
the record also shows that lbi did not wait until the eve of trial before moving to compel arbitration.prior to lbi motion to compel arbitration filed july,there had been only a series of joint status conferences and other procedural hearings.reyes motion for class certification was set to be heard october.far from waiting until the eve of trial to move for arbitration,lbi promptly moved to compel arbitration as soon as concepcion,supra.established the likelihood that it had a right to enforce the arbitration agreement as written.finally,there is no indication that lbi delay has resulted in lost evidence.
however,as reyes rightly notes,at least one court has suggested that delay alone may constitute prejudice.in burton cruise th the court held that an egregious delay may result in prejudice.id.at.the court in burton explicitly rejected the rule in groom health net th,which found no waiver simply from the time and expense of opposing the petitioning party demurrers and drafting amended pleadings.burton,at.instead,the court reasoned that a petitioning party conduct in stretching out the litigation process itself may cause prejudice by depriving the other party of the advantages of arbitration as an expedient,efficient and method to resolve disputes.ibid.
the delay in this case was not egregious.if lbi had invoked arbitration prior to concepcion,supra,it could have been forced under gentry,supra,cal th into class arbitration.class arbitration sacrifices the principal advantage of arbitration its informality and makes the process slower,more costly,and more likely to generate procedural morass than final judgment,requires procedural formality,and greatly increases risks to defendants.concepcion,at.even if delay alone may constitute prejudice in the individual arbitration context,that is not necessarily true in the class arbitration context,as class arbitration does not convey the same advantages as individual arbitration.here,reyes was not prejudiced by the month delay alone because for months,lbi could not invoke arbitration without being forced into class arbitration.lbi informed reyes that it intended to move to compel individual arbitration just one month after the court issued concepcion,and then filed the motion a month later.just as the delay in iskanian,supra,th and the delay in quevedo,supra,d did not prejudice the party opposing arbitration,the brief delay here did not prejudice reyes.
further,the trial court erred in finding prejudice where privacy notices were mailed to putative class members through a neutral third party and where reyes had begun interviewing putative class members.it is not enough to establish prejudice where the party opposing arbitration shows only that it incurred court costs and legal expenses.agnes,supra,cal th at.moreover,reyes can not even show that he incurred any court costs and legal expenses in mailing out the privacy notices,as according to the parties december,joint stipulation,lbi agreed to pay for the privacy notices.while reyes had been interviewing putative class members,we consider this part of the court costs and legal expenses that,without more,are insufficient to constitute prejudice.ibid.
more problematic,perhaps,is that lbi agreed to private mediation scheduled for july,on a basis,through a jams mediator selected by lbi.while reyes argues that the agreement to class mediation is incompatible with arbitration because any settlement would require court approval,he has not cited any authority supporting a finding of prejudice where the parties agreed to nonbinding mediation.mediation is defined as a method of dispute resolution involving a neutral third party who tries to help the disputing parties reach a mutually agreeable solution.black law dict.ed.mediation is not a
