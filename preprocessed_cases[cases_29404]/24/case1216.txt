we granted review to decide whether a person may sue for the malicious prosecution of an action that the parties resolved through contractual arbitration.because a contractual arbitration proceeding does not result in a favorable termination of a prior action,a necessary element of malicious prosecution,we conclude a person may not do so.
i.the facts and procedural history 
in,tremco incorporated tremco sued a former employee,walter brennan,after he went to work for one of tremco competitors.the complaint alleged breach of contract,conversion,misappropriation of trade secrets,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,fraud,and unfair competition.brennan obtained summary adjudication of some of the causes of action.thereafter,in,the parties agreed to arbitrate tremco remaining claims.the trial court orally summarized the agreement with regard to this particular matter,the parties have stipulated to a d judicate the matter by binding arbitration.that,of course,means a waiver of any trial de novo,also any right of appeal.a subsequent written agreement provided it is stipulated and agreed by the parties and their attorneys that trial by judge or jury is waived and the entire case will be submitted to keith wisot for final and binding decision from which there is no trial de novo or appeal.ultimately,the arbitrator ruled in brennan favor on the remaining claims.the court confirmed the arbitration award and entered judgment in brennan favor.
brennan then filed this action against tremco and its attorneys for maliciously prosecuting the original action.he alleged that the original action had terminated completely in his favor.the attorneys settled the case and are no longer parties to this action.tremco demurred.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend based upon the fact that the underlying action was terminated by private arbitration and a malicious prosecution action can not as a matter of law be based upon private arbitration.sagonowsky v.more th d.brennan appealed,and the court of appeal reversed.we granted tremco petition for review.
ii.discussion 
i n order to establish a cause of action for malicious prosecution of either a criminal or civil proceeding,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the prior action was commenced by or at the direction of the defendant and was pursued to a legal termination in his,plaintiff,favor citations was brought without probable cause citations and was initiated with malice citations.sheldon appel albert oliker cal d.we must decide whether the result of the arbitration proceeding was a favorable termination of a prior action that can give rise to an action for malicious prosecution.
courts have decided that various proceedings may or may not give rise to a future malicious prosecution action,largely depending on their nature,hardy vial cal d,malicious prosecution action may be based on administrative proceeding camarena sequoia ins.d.malicious prosecution action may be based on declaratory relief action stanley superior court d.malicious prosecution may be based on judicial arbitration proceeding pace hillcrest motor d.malicious prosecution may not be based on action in small claims court.we now decide the question regarding contractual arbitration.
in sustaining the demurrer to the malicious prosecution action,the trial court cited sagonowsky more,supra,th,d sagonowsky.in sagonowsky,the parties resolved a real estate dispute by contractual arbitration without judicial action.one party to the arbitration then sued the other party attorney for maliciously prosecuting that arbitration.the court of appeal affirmed dismissal of the action.it held that a private,contractual arbitration is not a prior action of the sort which will support a malicious prosecution claim.id.at,d.sagonowsky is not precisely on point.there,the underlying action began and ended in arbitration here,it began in court and only ended in arbitration.but,as we explain,we conclude the sagonowsky court was correct,and its rule also applies here.whether the underlying action started in court or in arbitration,if it ends in contractual arbitration,that termination will not support a malicious prosecution action.
two converging legal trends support this conclusion the trend against creating or expanding derivative tort remedies,including malicious prosecution and the trend in favor of allowing the parties voluntarily to choose binding,private arbitration to end the entire dispute.
seeking to avoid an unending roundelay of litigation silberg anderson cal d,we have cautioned against creating or expanding derivative tort remedies,at least when the underlying litigation provided adequate remedies.in the past,we have favored remedying misconduct by sanctions imposed within the underlying lawsuit rather than by creating new derivative torts.medical center superior court cal th,d,see also temple community hospital superior court cal th,d,id at,d,dis.opn.of kennard,rubin green cal th,d.for these reasons,we have said that the tort of malicious prosecution should not be expanded.crowley katleman cal th,d.t he most promising remedy for excessive litigation does not lie in an expansion of malicious prosecution liability i n our view the better means of addressing the problem of unjustified litigation is through the adoption of measures facilitating the speedy resolution of the initial lawsuit and authorizing the imposition of sanctions for frivolous or delaying conduct within that first action itself,rather than through an expansion of the opportunities for initiating one or more additional rounds of malicious prosecution litigation after the first action has been concluded.sheldon appel albert oliker,supra,cal d at.
a parallel development has been the increasing awareness that parties to litigation should be permitted to choose private arbitration as a means of resolving their dispute once and for all.p rivate arbitration is a process in which parties voluntarily trade the safeguards and formalities of court litigation for an expeditious,sometimes roughshod means of resolving their dispute.vandenberg superior court cal th,d,see also id.at,d,conc.dis.opn.of brown,t he legislature enacted the arbitration statutes in order to provide a viable alternative to the courts.when,as here,the parties choose private nonjudicial arbitration,they typically expect their dispute will be resolved without necessity for any contact with the courts.advanced micro devices,intel cal th,d.this expectation of finality strongly informs the parties choice of an arbitral forum over a judicial one.the arbitrator decision should be the end,not the beginning,of the dispute.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.
the growing antipathy for litigation spawning litigation,together with the recognition that the parties who voluntarily choose arbitration generally expect and desire that the arbitration will end their dispute,convinces us that private arbitration should not be the basis for future malicious prosecution actions.the arbitration agreement may allow for the imposition of sanctions for bringing a frivolous action.david abergel th,d noting that the actual agreement determines the arbitrator powers.the arbitrator here did not impose sanctions,and the parties dispute whether the actual agreement of this case permitted him to do so.we need not decide that question,for the important point is that the parties at least could have provided for the imposition of sanctions when agreeing to use arbitration as a means of finally ending the dispute.
brennan relies substantially on stanley superior court,supra,d,which permitted a malicious prosecution action based on judicial arbitration.we agree with the sagonowsky court that judicial arbitration and private contractual arbitration are sufficiently different that the result here should be different.nor are we persuaded that the rule which permits judicial arbitrations to be the basis for a malicious prosecution claim requires the same result in a contractual arbitration.stanley superior court,supra,d at.judicial arbitration is fundamentally unlike private contractual arbitration t he outcome of a judicial arbitration proceeding is not a final resolution of the dispute to which the parties have agreed to bind themselves any party can request trial de novo.code civ.the judicial arbitration procedure has been likened to a minitrial that is in effect a continuation of the settlement negotiation process which results in a neutral view from an authoritative figure of the merits of the claim and thus gives impetus to settlement.stanley superior court,supra,d.the crucial difference between the two types of arbitration is that a judicial arbitration does not arise from an agreement to arbitrate entered into by the parties,but is mandated by the legislature as to certain civil cases filed in court.
thus,like a voluntary dismissal,a judicial arbitration award in favor of defendant reflects a decision on the lack of merit of a claim which was brought originally to court.permitting such terminations to support a claim of malicious prosecution furthers the public purpose underlying the cause of to discourage abuse of the judicial system by the bringing of maliciously motivated but baseless claims.see crowley katleman,supra,cal th at d.that purpose would not be directly served by permitting malicious prosecution based on a private,contractual arbitration.indeed,the likely impact on the courts of allowing such claims would be both to increase litigation and to undermine the finality of dispute resolution to which the parties agreed.sagonowsky,supra,th at,d.
for these purposes,contractual arbitration is closer to small claims litigation than judicial arbitration.after considering its purpose and nature,one court held that the small claims process may not support a malicious prosecution action.pace hillcrest motor,supra,d at.the court noted that the small claims process is designed to function quickly and informally.id.at.to permit an action for malicious prosecution to be grounded on a small claims proceeding would frustrate the intent of the legislature in adopting an expeditious and informal means of resolving small disputes,and would inject into a simple and accessible proceeding elements of time,expense,and complexity which the small claims process was established to avoid ibid.similarly,to permit an action for malicious prosecution to follow contractual arbitration would defeat the purpose of that arbitration.as we have noted,contractual arbitration is a relatively quick and inexpensive,but necessarily somewhat roughshod,procedure that the parties may voluntarily choose to resolve their dispute and avoid further recourse to the courts.vandenberg superior court,supra,cal th at,d.the parties accept the bad with the good.but such arbitration is not the sort of proceeding on which a malicious prosecution action should be based.
moreover,the nature of private arbitration does not always allow for a ready determination of whether or why the prior action actually terminated in the malicious prosecution plaintiff favor.except for statutory claims see armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,an arbitrator need not explain the basis of an award.the arbitrator decision is also generally nonreviewable.moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at,d.all of these circumstances convince us that an action terminated in contractual arbitration,like a small claims action,should not give rise to a malicious prosecution action.
brennan finds support in the recent decision of rogers peinado th,d rogers.that case,like sagonowsky,supra,th,d,commenced with contractual arbitration.during the arbitration,one party filed a counterclaim against the original claimant.after the arbitration ended,the original claimant sued the other party and that party attorneys for maliciously prosecuting the counterclaim.the rogers court found that the plaintiff could not sue the party to the arbitration.however,expressly disagreeing with sagonowsky,the court also concluded that the plaintiff could sue the attorneys for maliciously prosecuting the counterclaim because they were not parties to the arbitration agreement.rogers,supra,th at,d.we disagree.as we have explained,it is the nature of the termination that matters,not exactly how it came about or who agreed to it.a termination by contractual arbitration is simply not the sort of favorable termination needed to support a malicious prosecution action.we disapprove rogers peinado,supra,th,d,to the extent it is inconsistent with this opinion.
brennan also argues that our decision in moore conliffe cal th,d,supports his position.there,we held that the litigation privilege of civil code section,subdivision b,applies to private contractual arbitration,which we described as for purposes of the privilege.see cal th at,d.however,we reasoned that contractual arbitration should not lead to additional litigation in the courts.we stated that private contractual arbitration is designed to serve a function analogous typically to eliminate the need to resort court system id.at,d,italics added.we found the privilege necessary to protect the integrity and finality of dispute resolution from an unending roundelay of litigation,and reiterated that finality of decision is a principal impetus for the parties to choose arbitration.id.at,d.this reasoning supports our conclusion that contractual arbitration should not give rise to a malicious prosecution action.
the court of appeal in this case concluded that it is the intent of the parties that controls the issue of whether,in agreeing to submit a matter to private arbitration,the parties intended to preclude a successful defendant from pursuing a claim for malicious prosecution.to resolve this question,the court held,the trier of fact will be required to hear evidence concerning the parties intent when they stipulated to private arbitration in open court and later in writing.this procedure would be impractical.because the arbitration agreement was silent,we may assume the parties reached no agreement.when no agreement exists,the parties may well have had quite different intents.it requires little imagination to suspect that in a case like this,the malicious prosecution plaintiff might claim an intent to allow a malicious prosecution action,and the defendant might claim an intent to preclude such an action.both sides may be credible regarding what each intended.moreover,even if the court could discern a mutual intent,the need for a hearing would add yet another round to the spiral of litigation.instead of ending the dispute,the arbitration would force another hearing on whether it precluded a malicious prosecution action.arbitration should not itself create new arenas for litigation.
finally,noting that sagonowsky,supra,th,d,was decided after his arbitration,brennan argues that any ruling against his position should be prospective only and not apply to him.we disagree.the general rule that judicial decisions are given retroactive effect is basic in our legal tradition.newman emerson radio cal d.courts sometimes make an exception to this general rule when the decision changed a settled rule on which the parties had relied.droeger friedman,sloan ross cal d.but in this case,we are merely deciding a legal question,not changing a previously settled rule.as discussed above,stanley superior court,supra,d,does not control this case.we have not overruled any decision predating the arbitration,much less a prior decision of this court.droeger friedman,sloan ross,supra,cal d at.we have certainly not disapproved of a and widespread practice expressly approved by a body of lower court authorities.id.at.no reason appears not to apply today decision to this case.
iii.conclusion 
we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal and remand the matter for that court to decide any remaining issues consistent with our opinion.
in,tremco incorporated brought an action in the superior court against walter brennan,a former employee who went to work for one of its competitors,for breach of contract,for the torts of conversion,misappropriation of trade secrets,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,fraud,and unfair competition,and,later,for declaratory action entitled tremco brennan.for the claims other than that for declaratory relief,tremco sought both compensatory and punitive damages in an unspecified amount.tremco was represented by counsel brennan was represented as well.
in,tremco dismissed its claim for fraud without prejudice.
later in,the superior court ordered tremco and brennan to judicial arbitration.the arbitrator resolved all of the then remaining claims in brennan favor.he then made an arbitration award accordingly.tremco demanded a trial de novo.
in,the superior court summarily adjudicated tremco claims for conversion and misappropriation of trade secrets in brennan favor.
in,tremco and brennan entered into an arbitration agreement.as recited,in pertinent part,by the superior court on the record and in open court with regard to this particular matter,the parties have stipulated to a d judicate the matter by binding arbitration.that,of course,means a waiver of any trial de novo,also any right of appeal.as subsequently reduced,in its entirety,to written form by tremco and brennan themselves it is stipulated and agreed by the parties and their attorneys that trial by judge or jury is waived and the entire case will be submitted to a specified retired superior court judge for final and binding decision from which there is no trial de novo or appeal.in the course of the arbitration,which was generally conducted as though in superior court,tremco and brennan contended solely about the last of tremco remaining claims,for breach of contract,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,unfair competition,and declaratory relief.in findings of fact and conclusions of law,the arbitrator determined that the evidence that tremco offered to present would be legally insufficient to support a judgment.he therefore resolved the claims in brennan favor.he then made an arbitration award accordingly.the superior court confirmed the arbitration award and rendered judgment for brennan.
in,brennan brought the present action in the superior court against tremco and its former attorneys for the tort of malicious prosecution with respect to tremco brennan.tremco former attorneys soon paid brennan in settlement,and were dismissed.
in,relying on the case of sagonowsky v.more th,d,tremco demurred on the ground that tremco brennan incorporated arbitration as its terminating mechanism.relying itself on sagonowsky,the superior court sustained tremco demurrer without leave to amend.it rendered judgment for tremco.
brennan appealed.the court of appeal reversed the superior court judgment by a judgment of its own.
tremco petitioned for review.we granted its application.
the majority now proceed to reverse the court of appeal judgment.i would affirm.
the tort of malicious prosecution is committed whenever a prior action is brought with malice and without probable cause by the plaintiff,and is subsequently terminated in favor of the defendant.crowley katleman cal th,d,sheldon appel albert oliker cal d,bertero national general cal d.
the availability of an action for malicious prosecution is justified by the harm that the underlying misconduct inflicts.see crowley katleman,supra,cal th at,d,bertero national general,supra,cal d at.
malicious prosecution harms the individual who is the defendant in the prior action.crowley katleman,supra,cal th at,d,bertero national general,supra,cal d at.it compel s him to defend against a fabricated claim.bertero national general,supra,cal d at.it thereby forces him to incur the cost of defen se,including attorney fees.id.at.it subjects him to the panoply of psychological pressures most defendants suffer,resulting in mental or emotional distress.id.at.but it also subjects him to the additional stress of attempting to resist a suit commenced out of spite or ill will,often magnified by slanderous allegations in the pleadings,resulting in injury to his reputation or impairment of his social and business standing in the community.ibid.
in addition,malicious prosecution harms the court that entertains the prior action.crowley katleman,supra,cal th at,d,bertero national general,supra,cal d at.it hampers the efficient administration of justice.bertero national general,supra,cal d at,accord,crowley katleman,supra,cal th at,d.it clog s already crowded dockets bertero national general,supra,cal d at.it also allows individuals to engage in the unscrupulous use of the courts as instruments with which to maliciously injure their fellow men.ibid.
a plaintiff can survive a defendant demurrer in an action for malicious prosecution if he pleads that a prior action was brought by the defendant,then a plaintiff,with malice and without probable cause,and was subsequently terminated in favor of the plaintiff,then a defendant.see crowley katleman,supra,cal th at,d,bertero national general,supra,cal d at.
in my view,brennan should have survived tremco demurrer in the present action for malicious prosecution with respect to tremco brennan.he effectively alleged that tremco brennan was brought by tremco with malice and without probable cause,and was subsequently terminated in his favor.in the absence of arbitration,the point would be beyond dispute.in its presence,it is hardly otherwise.the arbitration was incorporated in tremco brennan as its terminating mechanism.certainly,the arbitration did not preclude harm to brennan himself arising from tremco almost four years,he incurred the cost of defense,undoubtedly experienced mental and emotional distress,and likely suffered injury to his reputation and standing in the community,facing as he did claims including conversion,misappropriation of trade secrets,and fraud.just as certainly,the arbitration did not preclude harm to society generally arising from tremco the same period,the superior court was hampered in the efficient administration of justice,both through the clogging of its already notoriously crowded dockets and also through the misuse of its resources by tremco.
in arriving at my conclusion,i do not ignore the arbitration agreement in tremco brennan.what tremco and brennan agreed to arbitrate was referred to by the superior court as this particular matter,and by the parties themselves as the entire case.which judge from what tremco and brennan in fact last of tremco remaining claims,and those claims alone.whatever else may be said of the arbitration agreement,it can hardly be read to encompass any claim by brennan against tremco for the malicious prosecution of tremco brennan.no such claim had yet arisen inasmuch as tremco brennan,in advance of the superior court judgment therein,had not yet become a prior action.this is not to say that the scope of the arbitration agreement could not possibly embrace any such future that it did not actually do so.
consistent with my conclusion is stanley superior court d.
in stanley,the court held that an action for malicious prosecution may be based on a prior action incorporating judicial arbitration as its terminating mechanism.generally,an action for malicious prosecution may be based on any prior action,including,as there,one in municipal court.there is no exception for a prior action incorporating judicial arbitration as its terminating mechanism.in view of the harms to individual and society that justify the availability of a malicious prosecution action,it should matter greatly that the prior action was brought by the then plaintiff with malice and without probable cause,and was subsequently terminated in favor of the then defendant.but i t should matter little how the prior action was terminated in favor of the then defendant,whether by a judgment after judicial arbitration award,as opposed,for example,to a judgment after trial.stanley superior court,supra,d at.the fact of termination is indeed crucial.the particular type of termination is not.id.at,italics omitted.if the harms in question eventuate,they eventuate.the means of termination has no effect on their existence.
stanley supports my conclusion that an action for malicious prosecution may be based on a prior action in superior court,like tremco brennan,incorporating arbitration as its terminating mechanism.in view of the harms to individual and society that justify the availability of a mal
