opinion of the court 
the issue on appeal is whether an employer has satisfied an arbitrator award when it pays the employee back wages and simultaneously terminates the employee a second time for conduct independent of the first termination this is a novel issue for this court.
the district court held that the employee must be reinstated pursuant to the initial arbitral award but that the employer was free to terminate the employee a second time.the employee appeals through his union.the employer cross appeals.we hold that,given the circumstances of this case,the employer payment of back pay acted as an effective reinstatement and the employer was free to terminate the employee a second time based on independent grounds,pending a second arbitration.
the material facts of this case are not in dispute.on october,the employer,excel corporation,suspended jose diaz and sandra diaz pending an investigation into the charge that they had attempted to steal meat from excel by use of a stolen receipt on november,excel discharged both jose and sandra for attempting to steal excel company meat on the night of october.app.at.when informed of his termination,jose allegedly reacted violently by attacking an excel security guard,breaking two of his ribs.
the employees union,united food and commercial workers,local the union,grieved the terminations by letter dated november.shawn mott,excel human resources manager,responded to the grievance on november,as follows 
jose and sandra were terminated for their 
attempted unauthorized removal of excel meat on the night of october.our security guard,bill rotwa sic,identified jose and sandra as the two individuals who attempted to use a stolen receipt to claim meat that was not theirs.
as well,jose and sandra behavior on november when meeting with me to discuss this matter were sic unacceptable with jose hitting a security guard in my office resulting in two cracked ribs.
the parties selected an arbitrator to hear the dispute.at the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding,the arbitrator issued his award on may.the arbitrator ruled 
the grievance filed on behalf of jose diaz and sandra diaz is sustained.based upon the testimony and evidence presented in this case,it is found that the company did not establish just cause to support termination of the grievants for attempting to steal excel company meat on the night of october.consequently,the grievants shall be reinstated to their positions with full seniority and benefits and they shall be made whole for lost wages.
as to excel contention about the employees conduct,the arbitrator stated 
the record contains several versions of the grievants conduct in the human resources office immediately following the notification that they were terminated.in this regard,the company maintains that the profane,abusive,threatening and violent outbursts of the grievants constitute independent grounds for termination.however,be that as it may,the grievants conduct is not considered herein as a basis for determining whether the company had just cause to terminate jose and sandra diaz for attempting to steal excel company meat on the night of october.
instead,the arbitrator confined his award to the issue of whether the company had just cause to terminate jose and sandra diaz for attempting to steal excel company meat on the night of october.app.at.the arbitrator expressly stated that he did not consider the allegation that jose had attacked an excel security guard.
because the arbitrator found that the company did not establish just cause for terminating jose and sandra for attempted theft,excel,by letter dated june,reinstated sandra with back pay.by separate letter also dated june,excel informed jose that,inasmuch as the arbitrator had refused to consider his conduct on november,it was terminating his employment effective that date.that letter read,in relevant part,
as you know,the arbitrator found that the company lacked just cause to terminate your employment for attempting to steal excel company meat on the night of october.however,in reaching that decision,the a rbitrator did not consider your conduct following your termination on november.accordingly,please be advised that the company has decided to terminate your employment effective november,based upon your abusive and violent conduct following your termination,including but not limited to,striking dennis peifer,the director of security at excel hazleton plant.you will receive back pay from the time that you were suspended pending investigation of the attempted theft through the effective date of your termination,november.

in response,the union filed this suit under section of the labor management relations act,to enforce the may,award.thereafter,it also filed a second grievance challenging the november,termination.
we have plenary review of the district court order.see beck reliance steel prods,cir.
the union principal argument on appeal,which subsumes its other arguments,is that the district court erred in permitting excel to terminate jose a second time for his alleged abusive and violent conduct which the arbitrator declined to consider.there is some basis for the union implicit contention that the district court opinion is contradictory.the district court stated that excel had not complied with the arbitrator initial decision and thus the court ordered that the arbitration award be enforced in the manner consistent with its memorandum.however,the court also preserved excel right,after first reinstating jose,to discharge him again,retroactive to november.
the district court stated,if appropriate,it will remain for the arbitrator to determine if the employee may have waived his rights whether excel may have waived its rights to terminate for the aggressiveness of jose,and whether it was appropriate to terminate him again and make it retroactive to november,plausible result excel may have the right to terminate jose as of november,if the termination is made after reinstatement and under the same procedures as the first termination for theft.app.at.
the union argument is based on the district court statement that excel violated the arbitral award by failing to reinstate jose.the award stated,the grievants shall be reinstated to their positions with full seniority and benefits and they shall be made whole for lost wages.app.at.it is uncontested that after receipt of the award,excel reinstated sandra according to the terms of the award.it is also uncontested that excel awarded jose back pay from october,the date of his suspension to november,the date of excel second termination of jose for his conduct.finally,it is uncontested that excel never put jose back in the job from which he was terminated on november.the union thus argues that excel has sought to evade the arbitral award by failing to reinstate jose and terminating him a second time for allegedly attacking the security guard.the union complains that as a result of the district court opinion,the arbitrator who will be selected to hear and decide the propriety of jose second termination would have the authority not only to uphold that second termination,but to make that termination retroactive to november.it is the union position that the effect of such a ruling would be to nullify the arbitral award of may,with its provision for reinstatement.
this court has not had occasion to discuss the situation presented by these facts,but other courts of appeals,in particular the seventh,have faced somewhat similar facts.in one of those cases,chrysler motors int l union,allied indus.workers of am,cir,chrysler discharged a male employee for sexually assaulting a female.the union filed a grievance protesting the discharge.chrysler presented evidence of four other incidents of sexual harassment,but the arbitrator declined to consider them.id.the arbitrator found in the union favor,holding that the penalty against the employee was too severe in light of similar cases.id.at.chrysler sent the employee a letter which essentially reinstated him for one day with pay and simultaneously dismissed him again.id.at.there were some intervening court
