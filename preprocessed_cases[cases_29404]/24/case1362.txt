we conclude that the answer is no.looking to the plain language of title of the code of civil procedure,a lis pendens may only be filed when an action in a court of law is pending.because no such action was pending at the time respondents filed the two lis pendens,they improperly recorded the notices of pendency of action.respondents concomitant arguments are unconvincing.accordingly,we reverse the order of the trial court respondents motion should have been denied.
factual and procedural background 
the building 
appellant is the owner of a building located at west sixth street in downtown los angeles the building.appellant purchased the building from sixth spring,llc,pursuant to a purchase agreement and subject to an existing lease for a portion of the basement and first floor the bar space to mercury.the purchase agreement and lease granted certain rights to arnold greenspan,as trustee of the andrew meieran family trust greenspan,including easements over existing means of egress and certain access to the bar space.
as part of the purchase agreement,appellant agreed to transfer title to the bar space to greenspan when appellant completed its condominium conversion of the building.
the purchase agreement also contains an arbitration clause.
the first arbitration and the first lis pendens 
according to greenspan,after sale of the building closed,appellant engaged in conduct that denied him the easements and rights of possession under the purchase agreement and lease.thus,on august,he served a demand for arbitration on appellant and its manager,barry shy shy,alleging b reaches of a real estate agreement including failure to perform required improvements,failure to provide use of space as set forth in the agreement,destruction of property,and failure to pay reimbursements for loss of space involving real property located at street,los angeles,ca.greenspan sought to enforce various easements,to add a claim by sixth spring,llc to rescind the purchase agreement,and monetary damages.
while the arbitration was pending,on or about january,respondents recorded a lis pendens against the building.the lis pendens provides that an arbitration proceeding was commenced on december,in judicial arbitration and mediation services jams and that t his arbitration proceeding is now pending before jams.the lis pendens also indicates that the arbitration proceeding alleges a real property claim affecting the building.
on november,the arbitrator issued a final award in favor of greenspan,finding that he had met his burden of persuasion in this breach of contract dispute.greenspan was awarded money damages in the amount of for property damage or loss,plus lost profits in the amount of,plus lost business value in the amount of.greenspan also was awarded attorney fees in the amount of and a permanent injunction restricting appellant entry into the bar space.
thereafter,on january,the trial court richard fruin corrected and confirmed the arbitration award,and then entered judgment.specifically,the trial court excise d the damage award for lost profits and lost business value monetary damages were reduced to for property damage,for attorney fees and costs,and a permanent injunction as set forth in the final arbitration award.
this judgment is the subject of a pending appeal and.greenspan manhattan loft,llc.
the second arbitration and the second lis pendens 
on january,greenspan and others initiated a second arbitration against appellant and shy.the demand explains that greenspan pursued a claim for lost profits and lost business value as a result of appellant and shy breach of the purchase contract and related agreements the matter was submitted to arbitration before jams at the conclusion of the arbitration,the arbitrator issued an award in greenspan favor for property damage or loss,plus lost profits and lost business value.
in response to the petition to confirm the arbitration award,appellant and shy contended that greenspan had no standing to pursue a claim for lost profits and lost business value the los angeles superior court,judge fruin presiding,accepted this argument and ruled in appellant and shy favor by correcting the award to eliminate the sums awarded by the arbitrator for lost profits and lost business value and entering judgment for property damage only.greenspan disputes that result and will appeal that judgment.however,if the judgment is affirmed on the basis that an entity other than greenspan holds the right to claim lost profits and lost business value,then greenspan entitlement to pursue a claim for lost profits against appellant and shy will have been conclusively determined as against appellant and shy.this demand seeks to preserve,against any defense of the statute of limitations or laches,whatever right greenspan may ultimately be determined to have to assert those claims against appellant and shy.the second arbitration demand also seeks rescission of the purchase agreement.
on january,respondents recorded a second lis pendens against the building.this lis pendens indicates that an arbitration proceeding was commenced on january,in the american arbitration association and that t his arbitration proceeding is now pending before that tribunal.it also provides that this arbitration proceeding alleges a real property claim affecting the building.
appellant complaint 
on february,appellant filed its complaint in this action against respondents.according to the complaint,respondents wrongfully recorded the two lis pendens because e ach of the claims refers to an arbitration proceeding rather than to a civil action.an arbitration proceeding is not an action within the meaning of code of civil procedure sections,and.neither the code of civil procedure,nor any other statute authorizes the filing of a lis pendens without reference to a pending action.moreover,the filing of the claims is expressly outside the scope of the litigation privilege as set forth in civil code section b.additionally,neither the first claim nor the second claim involves a claim against the property within the meaning of code of civil procedure section.
appellant asserts that it asked respondents to remove the lis pendens,but they refused to do so.
appellant avers that it has suffered very substantial damages as a result of the claims.the property is a building that has been converted into condominiums.the condominiums are nearly ready for sale to the public.but for the fact that respondents recorded the claims,appellant would have begun offering the condominium units for sale during,with the intention of closing the sales as soon as the property obtained the appropriate certificate of occupancy.because of the claims,however,it was and is impossible to enter into any such contracts.the delay caused by the claims has caused appellant very substantial damages.moreover,s ince the first claim was filed,the market for residential real estate has substantially declined,as has the value of such real estate.appellant is informed and believes,and on the basis of such information and belief alleges,that its damages already exceed.those damages will continue to grow each day the claims remain against the property.
respondents successful motion and appellant appeal 
in response,the attorney respondents filed a special motion to strike as a slapp suit the first cause of action for slander of title.first,they argued that appellant slander of title claim arose from the protected activity of recording notices of lis pendens.second,they asserted that appellant could not establish a probability of prevailing because the recordation of the lis pendens was absolutely privileged,and no damages could have resulted from the recordation of the notices of lis pendens.
on or about april,the client respondents filed a notice of joinder in the attorney respondents motion.
appellant opposed the motion.it set forth the following arguments the recording of the two lis pendens did not constitute protected activity the recording of the lis pendens was not absolutely privileged because respondents did not file an action in court,and a lis pendens may not be filed in connection with a pending arbitration the lis pendens were improper because they did not assert real property claims and appellant did suffer substantial damages.
after entertaining oral argument,the trial court granted respondents motion.
appellant timely appeal ensued.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review the trial court rulings on a slapp motion independently under a de novo standard of review.citation.kajima engineering construction,city of los angeles th,d.
ii.the statute 
section,subdivision b provides a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.the statute posits a process for determining whether an action is a slapp.navellier sletten cal th,d.first,the defendant bringing the special motion to strike must make a prima facie showing that the statute applies to the claims that are the subject of the motion.wilcox superior court,supra,th at,d.once a moving defendant has met its burden,the motion will be granted and the claims stricken unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established a probability of prevailing on the claim.dupont merck pharmaceutical superior court th,d.
iii.the trial court improperly granted respondents motion 
slander of title arises from protected activity 
we first consider whether appellant slander of title cause of action arises from protected activity.
as is relevant here,section,subdivision e defines an act in furtherance of a person right of petition to include any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law,subd.e.the filing of a notice of lis pendens falls squarely within this definition.see,salma capon th,d jarrow formulas,lamarche cal th,fn,d.
appellant urges us to conclude that the filings of the two lis pendens here did not arise out of protected activity because they did not bear some relationship to the pending arbitration.we disagree.the arbitration proceedings involved claims that affected title to and rights of possession of the building.the first demand for arbitration describes the nature of the dispute as b reaches of a real estate agreement including failure to perform required improvements,failure to provide use of space as set forth in the agreement,destruction of property,and failure to pay reimbursements for loss of space involving real property.and,as greenspan explains in his arbitration brief,appellant allegedly caused great property damage and loss to the leased space in the building,including appellant alleged denial of certain easement rights.likewise,the second demand for arbitration involves real property claims,which appellant concedes by only challenging the first demand for arbitration.because respondents sought to enforce and protect their rights in the building via the lis pendens,certainly the lis pendens bore a relationship to the arbitration proceedings.
paul friedman th,d is readily distinguishable.in that case,the lawsuit alleged that the defendant conducted a harassing investigation that extended far beyond the scope of the issues subject to arbitration.id.at,d.fairly read,the complaint alleged that the plaintiff was injured by acts of the defendant that had no connection to the issues under review in the arbitration.ibid.in contrast,as set forth above,the lis pendens notices here had a direct connection to the arbitration proceedings.
probability of prevailing 
because appellant slander of title cause of action is subject to the statute,the burden shifted to it to show,through competent,admissible evidence,a probability of success on the merits of its claim in order to defeat respondents motion.evans unkow th,d.accordingly,appellant was required to establish each of the following four elements a publication,which is without privilege or justification,which is false,and which causes direct and immediate pecuniary loss.howard schaniel d.
respondents were not permitted to record the lis pendens 
a.an action does not include arbitration 
we first consider whether respondents were authorized to file the lis pendens.according to appellant,because no action was filed in a court,respondents were not permitted to file the lis pendens.see,the formula superior court th,d.respondents,on the other hand,argue that an arbitration proceeding is the functional equivalent to court proceedings thus,the filing of the lis pendens was proper.see,moore conliffe cal th,d.
the question is one of statutory construction.the starting point is with the language of the statute,affording the words their ordinary and usual meaning and viewing them in their statutory context.citation.we read related provisions together as part of an overall statutory scheme,so as to harmonize them and give them all effect if possible.citations.the central language is in section an action that asserts a real property claim.should this phrase be construed to include arbitrations the formula superior court,supra,th at,d.
section defines an action as follows an action is an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice by which one party prosecutes another for the declaration,enforcement,or protection of a right,the redress or prevention of a wrong,or the punishment of a public offense.title of the code of civil procedure,which governs recording notice of certain actions,repeatedly uses the word action.see,this title applies to an action pending in any united states district court in the same manner that it applies to an action pending in the courts of this state a party to an action who asserts a real property claim may record a notice of pendency of action in which that real property claim is alleged.there is no reference to arbitration proceedings.this plain language compels the conclusion that a lis pendens may only be recorded when an action is pending in state or federal court.see,kirkeby superior court cal th,d,we can not ignore the plain language of the statute miller starr,cal.real estate ed,a lis pendens may be recorded in an appropriate action in the state court,or it can be recorded under state law when the action is pending in a federal court greenwald asimow,cal.practice guide real property transactions the rutter group.
our decision is consistent with verbiage from other statutes within title of the code of civil procedure.for example,section provides,in relevant part immediately following recordation of the lis pendens in the office of the recorder of each county in which all or part of the real pr
