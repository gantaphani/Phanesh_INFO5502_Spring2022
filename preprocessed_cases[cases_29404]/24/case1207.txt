documents prepared for purposes of mediation are generally inadmissible in civil proceedings,subd.b.however,a signed settlement agreement reached through mediation is exempt from this general rule if it provides that it is enforceable or binding or words to that effect,subd.b section b.this case turns on whether the document at issue satisfies the requirements of section b.
the parties concluded a mediation session by signing a handwritten memorandum captioned settlement terms.the final provision stated any and all disputes subject to jams arbitration rules.the trial court found this term sheet inadmissible,and denied a motion to compel arbitration.the court of appeal reversed,holding that the memorandum was admissible because the arbitration provision constituted words to the effect that the settlement terms were enforceable or binding under section b.
the court of appeal gave section b an unduly expansive reading.the aim of the provision is to allow parties in mediation to draft enforceable agreements without requiring the use of a formulaic phrase.however,the writing must make clear that it reflects an agreement and is not simply a memorandum of terms for inclusion in a future agreement.the writing need not be in finished form to be admissible under section b,but it must be signed by the parties and include a direct statement to the effect that it is enforceable or binding.for reasons we explain below,the arbitration clause in the memorandum before us fails to satisfy this standard.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff thomas fair sued karl bakhtiari,maryanne fair,and various business entities we refer to the businesses as the stonesfair defendants.bakhtiari was plaintiff former business partner and fair his former wife.plaintiff alleged that they had wrongfully excluded him from real estate syndications,denied him compensation,misappropriated profits,and engaged in other financial misconduct.plaintiff also accused bakhtiari of physically assaulting him on more than one occasion.
bakhtiari,fair,and the stonesfair defendants answered separately,and the parties mediated their disputes over the course of two days.at the end of the second day,plaintiff counsel drafted a handwritten memorandum recording settlement terms,as set forth below the memorandum was dated march,and signed by the mediator and the parties.
the parties filed case management reports informing the court that the case had settled in mediation.on april,counsel for the stonesfair defendants circulated a formalized settlement and release agreement,confirming the parties intent to settle all their disputes as of and effective march.a few days before the case management conference,counsel for the stonesfair defendants learned from plaintiff counsel that plaintiff believed the parties agreement for the transfer of his assets did not apply to certain business interests.the attorneys also discussed unresolved tax issues.counsel for all parties appeared at the case management conference,where bakhtiari attorney requested a continuance.he told the court we reached a settlement agreement.we are now in the process of exchanging settlement agreements.and there are some complicated taxation matters involved.the trial court granted the continuance.
the parties were unable to finalize their settlement.on june,one of the attorneys for the stonesfair defendants substituted as counsel for all defendants,and filed a case management document informing the court that the parties were ultimately unable to reach agreement as to the scope and subject matter of the proposed settlement terms.he suggested the case should be resolved through the regular court process.
on june,plaintiff attorney wrote to defendants counsel,demanding arbitration under paragraph of the settlement memorandum.see fn,ante,d.defendants counsel rejected the demand,contending the parties had not entered an enforceable agreement.he claimed the settlement memorandum was inadmissible under section,subdivision b,which protects the confidentiality of writings prepared for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation.
plaintiff moved to compel arbitration,contending the parties had agreed to be bound when they signed the march memorandum,and thus any disputes over the meaning or extent of their agreement were subject to arbitration.plaintiff noted that counsel for all defendants had told the court the case had settled.defendants opposed the motion.they objected to the admission of the settlement memorandum and parts of opposing counsel declarations reciting mediation discussions.in reply,plaintiff contended the march memorandum was admissible on various grounds,including that the presence of an arbitration provision made the parties agreement enforceable as contemplated by section b.
the trial court excluded the memorandum and the portions of the declaration by plaintiff counsel describing the settlement reached in mediation.the court found that the requirements of section were not met,and concluded t here is insufficient demonstration of an arbitration agreement given the inadmissibility of the term sheet.accordingly,the court denied the motion to compel arbitration.
the court of appeal reversed,deciding that the provision a ny and all disputes subject to jams arbitration rules could only mean the parties intended the settlement terms document to be enforceable or binding.therefore,the court held that the memorandum included words to that effect and was admissible under section b.the court also determined that the memorandum reflected a valid arbitration agreement.we granted defendants petition for review.
ii.discussion 
we have repeatedly noted that the mediation confidentiality provisions of the evidence code were enacted to encourage mediation by permitting the parties to frankly exchange views,without fear that disclosures might be used against them in later proceedings.rojas superior court cal th,d,foxgate homeowners bramalea california,cal th,d.toward that end,the statutory scheme unqualifiedly bars disclosure of communications made during mediation absent an express statutory exception.foxgate homeowners,at,d,fn.omitted see rojas,at,d.in foxgate and rojas we disapproved judicially crafted exception s to the mediation confidentiality statutes.foxgate homeowners,at,d,rojas,at,d,quoting foxgate.in this case we construe the exception expressly provided in section b for written settlement agreements.
section b was added in,as one of many statutory mediation reforms recommended by the california law revision commission commission.stats,ch,see recommendation on mediation confidentiality cal.law revision com.the commission recommendation includes an introductory letter to the governor stating that its revisions were intended to eliminate ambiguities.in particular,the commission recommends clarifying the application of mediation confidentiality to settlements reached through mediation.clarification is critical to aid disputants in crafting agreements they can enforce.recommendation on mediation confidentiality,supra,cal.law revision com,at see also.in its recommendation,the commission observed these recommended reforms on achieving an effective settlement are the most crucial element of the commission recommendation.they should enhance the effectiveness of mediation in promoting durable settlements.id.at.the commission official comments are deemed to express the legislature intent.rojas superior court,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
the commission noted that a predecessor statute,former section,fails to highlight a critical requirement concerning written settlement agreements reached through mediation.under section a,unless it is offered to prove fraud,duress,or illegality,a written settlement agreement is admissible only if it so provides.fn.omitted.parties overlooking this requirement may inadvertently enter into a written settlement agreement that is unenforceable because it is inadmissible.recommendation on mediation confidentiality,supra,cal.law revision com,at.
the commission proposed to remedy this problem by addressing the admissibility of settlement agreements in a separate section.this will draw attention to the requirements and decrease the likelihood that the parties will inadvertently enter into an unenforceable agreement.recommendation on mediation confidentiality,supra,cal.law revision com,at.accordingly,mediation confidentiality and the disclosure of settlement agreements are now treated in separate provisions.section states the general rule that writings prepared for,in the course of,or pursuant to mediation are inadmissible,e xcept as otherwise provided in this chapter.section states the exceptions applicable to written settlement agreements,including the requirement at issue here the agreement provides that it is enforceable or binding or words to that effect.b.the commission explained t he proposed section on settlements would explicitly make an executed written settlement agreement admissible if it provides that it is enforceable or binding or words to that effect.because parties intending to be bound are likely to use words to that effect,rather than stating that their agreement is admissible,the commission regards this as an important addition.recommendation on mediation confidentiality,supra,cal.law revision com,at see also cal.law revision com,pt.west ann.supp.foll.
the court of appeal correctly reasoned that the words to that effect clause reflects a legislative concern not with the precise words of a settlement agreement,but with terms unambiguously signifying the parties intent to be bound.the court erred,however,by concluding that the inclusion of an arbitration clause in the parties list of settlement terms satisfied section b,on the ground that the clause could only reflect an intent that the document would be enforceable or binding.although the legislature did not provide the courts with a bright line when it permitted the admission of signed agreements including words to that effect,we conclude a narrower interpretation of this clause is required.we are guided by the ordinary meaning of the statutory language,its context,and the legislative purposes it was meant to serve.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,d,see also rojas superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
the phrase words to that effect in section b refers to language that conveys a general meaning or import,in this instance the meanings of enforceable or binding.american heritage dict.ed.under section b,the use of such language will exempt a written settlement agreement from the general rule that documents prepared during mediation are inadmissible in future proceedings.the legislature goal was to allow parties to express their intent to be bound in words they were likely to use,rather than requiring a legalistic formulation.the legislature also meant to clarify the rules governing admissibility and reduce the likelihood that parties would overlook those rules.to meet these objectives,we must balance the requirements of flexibility and clarity,without eroding the confidentiality that is essential to effective mediation.foxgate homeowners bramalea california,supra,cal th at,d,see rojas superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
in order to preserve the confidentiality required to protect the mediation process and provide clear drafting guidelines,we hold that to satisfy the words to that effect provision of section b,a writing must directly express the parties agreement to be bound by the document they sign.plaintiff would have us infer the parties intent from the mention of arbitration in the settlement terms memorandum.arbitration is a method of enforcement subject to negotiation,like other settlement terms.a tentative working document may include an arbitration provision,without reflecting an actual agreement to be bound.if such a typical settlement provision were to trigger admissibility,parties might inadvertently give up the protection of mediation confidentiality during their negotiations over the terms of settlement.disputes over those terms would then erupt in litigation,escaping the process of resolution through mediation.durable settlements are more likely to result if the statute is applied to require language directly reflecting the parties awareness that they are executing an enforceable or binding agreement.
plaintiff claims that in this case,permitting defendants to use the shield of mediation confidentiality to thwart the agreement reflected in the memorandum of settlement terms would undermine the entire purpose of mediation,which is to settle disputes.he points out that after signing the memorandum,defendants told the trial court the case had settled and circulated a formal agreement declaring the settlement terms effective as of the date of the memorandum.plaintiff contends this conduct proves that an enforceable settlement was intended,and that defendants subsequent repudiation of the settlement was merely an instance of settlors remorse.according to plaintiff,defendants refused to cooperate with his attempts to bring the parties back before the mediator to discuss the disputes that developed.defendants,on the other hand,insist they always viewed the memorandum as a nonbinding document similar to a letter of intent regarding a proposed business relationship.
plaintiff characterization of defendants postmediation conduct is one reasonable interpretation of the facts in this case.however,we do not believe the legislature contemplated that in order to rule on the admissibility of a settlement agreement under section b,the court would examine extrinsic evidence to resolve competing claims over the parties intent.as explained above,the statute is designed to produce documents that clearly reflect the parties agreement that the settlement terms are enforceable or binding.
plaintiff seeks support from business and professions code section,which governs alternative dispute resolution programs administered by the dispute resolution advisory council drac of the california department of consumer affairs.there,the legislature specified that a settlement agreement reached with the assistance of such a program is unenforceable and inadmissible unless the consent of the parties or the agreement includes a provision that clearly states the intention of the parties that the agreement or any resulting award shall be so enforceable or admissible as evidence.bus,subd.a.plaintiff reasons that the omission in section b of a demand for a provision that clearly states the intention of the parties means the legislature contemplated a less specific requirement for settlements reached in mediation proceedings.
we disagree.the clearly states provision of business and professions code section is not such a critical statutory phrase that its omission from section b can be deemed to reflect a different legislative intent.compare,in re young cal th,d.the terms of section b,particularly when viewed in light of the purposes for which they were framed,are generally consistent with those of business and professions code section.the legislature is not required to employ identical terminology in separate statutes serving similar policy objectives.it would be anomalous to impose stricter requirements on settlements fostered by drac programs than on those reached in mediation proceedings.we construe related statutes so as to harmonize their requirements and avoid anomaly.coachella valley mosquito vector control dist.california public employment relations bd.cal th,d.
plaintiff also contends that an arbitration clause is severable from the contract in which it appears,and enforceable as a matter of law.he asserts that the strong public policy favoring arbitration supports the enforceability of the arbitration clause in the settlement memorandum signed by the parties.see,agnes medical center pacificare of california cal th,d.however,a settlement agreement drafted during mediation must be admissible before a court can reach the issue of enforceability.under our interpretation of section b,the parties are free to draft and discuss enforcement terms such as arbitration clauses without worrying that those provisions will destroy the confidentiality that protects mediation discussions.a different rule could hinder the policy favoring arbitration by discouraging parties from including arbitration clauses in draft agreements.
plaintiff argues alternatively that the settlement memorandum before us must be viewed as a whole and construed by the standard rules of contract interpretation to determine whether it is enforceable for purposes of section b.however,this interpretation would render the statutory exception superfluous and permit the admission of any signed,written agreement meeting the requirements for an enforceable contract.that approach has been taken in other jurisdictions see fn,ante,d,but our legislature has imposed a different rule.section b requires the parties to affirmatively provide that their agreement is enforceable or binding.
thus,to satisfy section b,a settlement agreement must include a statement that it is enforceable or binding,or a declaration in other terms with the same meaning.the statute leaves room for various formulations.however,arbitration clauses,forum selection clauses,choice of law provisions,terms contemplating remedies for breach,and similar commonly employed enforcement provisions typically negotiated in settlement discussions do not qualify an agreement for admission under section b see,aragaki et,a litigator guide to effective use of adr in california.
disposition 
the judgment of the court of appeal is reversed.the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.
under subdivision b of evidence code section section b,documents prepared during mediation are not admissible in evidence.there is an exception to this rule under subdivision b of evidence code section section b,which applies to a written settlement agreement when it is signed by parties and provides that it is enforceable or binding or words to that effect.
here,the parties signed a document during mediation that contained settlement terms,including a provision for arbitration of a ny and all disputes.i agree with the majority that the mediation document is inadmissible under section b,and that it is not within the settlement agreement exception under section b.unlike the majority,however,i do not reach that conclusion by holding that an arbitration clause can never constitute words to the effect that a settlement agreement is enforceable or binding.rather,i conclude that substantial evidence supports the trial court implied finding that the mediation document at issue here was not a written settlement agreement.
thomas fair plaintiff sued maryanne fair his former wife,karl bakhtiari,and three corporations,alleging that they had wrongfully excluded him from real estate syndication businesses and engaged in various other misconduct.on march,during the second day of mediation,plaintiff counsel wrote a document entitled settlement terms,containing nine provisions.see,ante,d at,fn,at,fn.the document stated that plaintiff would receive a c ash payment of million days and that the payment would be treated as purchase of all plaintiff stock interests as capital gain to plaintiff.the document final provision stated any and all disputes subject to jams arbitration rules.the parties signed the mediation document.
on april,defendants attorneys submitted case management conference questionnaires to the court in which they stated,in identical language,that the case has settled but also that a formal settlement agreement is being circulated for approval.at a hearing on april,defendants counsel told the court that the parties had reached a settlement agreement but also that they were now in the process of exchanging settlement agreements.at the same hearing,plaintiff counsel assured the court that the case is going to settle.italics added.
despite these assurances,a dispute arose concerning the mediation document provision that the cash payment to plaintiff would be treated as purchase of all plaintiff stock interests as capital gain to plaintiff.plaintiff attorney asked one of defendants attorneys whether defendants would be interested in also purchasing plaintiff interests in certain limited partnerships related to the corporate defendants.defendants took the position that those interests,alleged to be worth as much as,were already included.plaintiff adamantly insisted they were not included.
on june,defendant bakhtiari attorney submitted a case management conference questionnaire to the court stating that a though the case management questionnaire submitted on april,by defendant bakhtiari former attorney indicated that the dispute had settled after mediation,it in fact,has not and that t he parties were ultimately unable to reach agreement as to the scope and subject matter of the proposed settlement terms.
on june,plaintiff brought a motion to compel arbitration under the mediation document.defendants opposed the motion on the ground that there was no admissible evidence of an agreement to arbitrate.defendants argued that the parties had not intended that the mediation document,which defendants referred to as a term sheet,would be binding and that they never came to a meeting of the minds on key provisions.thus,according to defendants,the mediation document was inadmissible under section b and not within the settlement agreement exception under section b.the parties submitted declarations and other documentary evidence in support of their respective positions.the trial court denied the motion to compel arbitration,stating there is insufficient demonstration of an arbitration agreement given the inadmissibility of the term sheet.
the controlling legal principles were stated by the court of appeal in weddington productions,flick th,d weddington,as follows a settlement agreement is a contract,and the legal principles which apply to contracts generally apply to settlement contracts.citation.an essential element of any contract is consent.citations.the consent must be mutual.citations.consent is not mutual,unless the parties all agree upon the same thing in the same sense.citations.the existence of mutual consent is determined by objective rather than subjective criteria,the test being what the outward manifestations of consent would lead a reasonable person to believe.citation.outward manifestations thus govern the finding of mutual consent required for contract formation.citation.the parties outward manifestations must show that the parties all agreed upon the same thing in the same sense.if there is no evidence establishing a manifestation of assent to the same thing by both parties,then there is no mutual consent to contract and no contract formation.weddington,supra,th at,d accord,bustamante intuit,th,d.where the existence of a contract is at issue and the evidence is conflicting or admits of more than one inference,it is for the trier of fact to determine whether the contract actually existed.bustamante intuit,supra,at,d.
this case is similar to weddington.there,mediation resulted in a memorandum stating that a ll parties agree to settle and dismiss on the following terms and then providing for a cash payment,the transfer of certain property,and a licensing agreement.weddington,supra,th at,d.the mediation memorandum also contained a provision for its enforcement under code of civil procedure section,which provides for the entry of judgment under the terms of a stipulated settlement.weddington,supra,at,d.the court of appeal observed the reference to enforceability pursuant to section suggests that the parties subjectively thought they had formed a settlement contract.nevertheless,subsequent events illustrate quite vividly that they had never agreed on the same terms for a licensing agreement.id.at,d.
when disputes surfaced about the meaning of the licensing provision,the parties in weddington returned to the mediator,who attempted to impose terms to which one party never agreed.weddington,supra,th at,d.the court of appeal concluded that the parties had never agreed upon the material terms needed for an enforceable license agreement and that the mediator lacked authority to impose material terms to which the parties had never agreed.id.at,d see also terry conlan th,d like weddington,the parties left significant ambiguities in material terms that demonstrated there was no meeting of the minds.
