the sole issue on appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion in refusing to grant the appellants franchisors motion for an evidentiary hearing,a motion they presented for the first time after the district court announced its intention to enforce a settlement agreement between franchisors and the appellees franchisees.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
background 
franchisees sued franchisors on federal and state claims with respect to a bath junkie,bath junkie franchise.the parties informed the court that they had reached a settlement agreement the day before the trial was scheduled to begin.tom morris negotiated on behalf of franchisors,and david morris negotiated on behalf of franchisees.others involved in the negotiations on franchisors behalf included attorney jenni cook,bath junkie corporate counsel steven kay,and bath junkie president judy zimmer.
on february,the parties made a record of the settlement in front of the district court.david morris recited what he characterized as the salient provisions of the agreement,which included the total payment by franchisors to franchisees of,a payment schedule,interest on any delinquent payments and reductions for any early payments,the entry of a consent judgment reflecting the payment terms,execution of a settlement agreement containing mutual releases,and the dismissal of franchisors counterclaims.tom morris stated,on the record,i agree with it all.it sounds exactly like what we agreed to.neither party suggested that the settlement agreement included any additional terms.the parties agreed to file a proposed consent judgment by february.
david morris and tom morris failed to finalize a written settlement agreement after exchanging several drafts,and they failed to file a proposed consent judgment.after this point,david morris was no longer involved in the case,and neither party maintained contact with him.
on june,the district court ordered the parties to show cause why the lawsuit should not be dismissed with prejudice.franchisees filed a motion to enforce the settlement based on the proceedings before the district court on february and requested oral argument.franchisors filed a response to plaintiff motion to enforce settlement response.franchisors did not request either oral argument or an evidentiary hearing,but they did attach affidavits from tom morris,cook,kay and zimmer.these affidavits attested to the substance of the negotiations that occurred before the february hearing,which they aver also included agreements about confidentiality,and,none of which were included in the salient terms identified to the district court.all four affidavits also claimed that the parties had agreed to structure the settlement as a franchise sale and repurchase and that this franchise sale language was necessary to avoid franchisors obligation under c to report a judgment against it in its uniform franchise offering circular.under the franchise sale language,franchisors claimed that the parties had agreed that franchisors would grant franchisees four franchises,agree to sell those franchises on franchisees behalf and then pay franchisees in accordance with the payment schedule.the affidavits also alluded to the exchange of drafts of the settlement agreement after the february hearing,but franchisors did not provide any of the exchanged draft agreements to the district court.relying on these affidavits,franchisors claimed that the parties had earlier reached an agreement that contained terms in addition to those detailed on the record before the district court.because franchisees wanted to enforce the settlement agreement as represented to the court on february,which differed from the agreement franchisors believed they had reached during negotiations,franchisors argued that there must not have been a meeting of the minds as to the settlement and that the franchisees motion,therefore,should be denied.franchisors asked the district court to reschedule the matter for trial.
on july,the district court issued a written order announcing its intent to enforce the settlement agreement and ordering the parties to advise the court whether the judgment should be filed under seal.on july,franchisors,for the first time,requested an evidentiary hearing on franchisees motion to enforce the settlement.franchisors also advanced a new argument in their request for an evidentiary hearing.in addition to asking the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether there was a meeting of the minds,they also requested the court to determine the terms of the settlement agreement,if it concluded there was a meeting of the minds.on august,the district court entered judgment under seal enforcing the settlement agreement as it was detailed by the parties during the february proceedings.franchisors appealed the district court refusal to hold an evidentiary hearing.
franchisors submitted their opening brief to this court on december.after their initial brief had been filed,franchisors located david morris,and cook met him in dallas,texas,on december.franchisees submitted their brief on january.on february,cook completed an affidavit in which she claimed that during her meeting with david morris,he acknowledged that he never thought that the franchise sale language would be a big deal and that additional terms were to be included in the written settlement agreement.franchisors submitted this affidavit and copies of four draft settlement agreements,alleged to have been exchanged by the parties,to this court in a supplemental appendix on february and relied upon them for arguments made in their reply brief.franchisees moved to strike the supplemental appendix and franchisors reply brief.
in addition to this appeal,franchisors appeal the district court order denying their motion to stay execution of the judgment and granting franchisees motion to allow the judgment to be registered and enforced in other united states district courts notwithstanding the pending appeal.we have consolidated the two appeals.finally,franchisors filed a motion with this court to stay execution of the judgment.
ii.discussion 
motion to strike 
after both parties had filed their initial briefs,franchisors submitted a supplemental appendix containing four draft settlement agreements and cook affidavit concerning her meeting with david morris,none of which were part of the record before the district court.franchisees move to strike the appendix and franchisors reply brief that relied upon the supplemental appendix.an appellate court can properly consider only the record and facts before the district court and thus only those papers and exhibits filed in the district court can constitute the record on appeal.huelsman civic ctr,cir see fed.a.because the drafts of the settlement agreement and the second cook affidavit were presented for the first time at the appellate stage,they are not part of the record for our review.see huelsman,at.w e can not consider it as evidence id.because we can not consider this evidence,we grant franchisees motion to strike the supplemental appendix and the reply brief to the extent that its arguments rely on evidence that had not been presented to the district court.
evidentiary hearing 
we now examine the record before the district court,and we review its decision not to hold an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion.see stewart,cir.district courts are given considerable discretion in deciding whether to hold an evidentiary hearing.id.at see chaganti,nowotny,cir when deciding whether to hold a hearing,a court may also consider the need to conserve judicial resources and the unseemliness of holding,in effect,a internal quotation omitted.when a motion is based on facts not appearing of record.provides that a district court may hear the matter on affidavits presented by the respective parties,or may direct that the matter be heard wholly or partly on oral testimony or deposition.stewart,at.
franchisors did not request an evidentiary hearing until after the district court had considered the arguments and the affidavits in franchisors response and issued an order stating its intent to enforce t
