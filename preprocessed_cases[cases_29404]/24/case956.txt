julie collins and robert ryan appellants appeal the district court denial of their motion to vacate an arbitration award.appellants contend their motion should have been granted because the arbitrators manifestly disregarded the law when deciding not to apply offensive collateral estoppel because judicial review of an arbitration award under the federal arbitration act faa is more limited than judicial review of a district court judgment.we hold the arbitrators did not manifestly disregard the law because no well defined,explicit,and clearly applicable law existed to be disregarded.carter health net of,cir.accordingly,we affirm.
continental homes holding corporation continental was a homebuilding and mortgage business headquartered in arizona.in,horton,horton,a homebuilding company with operations in several states,expressed an interest in merging with continental.although continental initially rebuffed horton merger proposals,horton and continental negotiated and entered into a merger agreement in.
to make itself a more attractive merger partner,continental entered into employment contracts with key employees designed to induce them to stay on with the merged company for at least that period of time sufficient to accomplish the merger and the related combination of operations.among those continental employees who entered into such employment contracts were appellants and thomas hickcox hickcox the employment contracts provided for severance packages if appellants or hickcox were terminated without cause or resigned for good reason,such as a significant reduction in responsibility.
during merger negotiations,an issue arose concerning whether continental employees would be able to accelerate vesting of their unvested continental stock options prior to or as part of the merger.both appellants and hickcox contend horton overcame this issue by verbally promising to give shares of horton stock to be divided by the group of continental managers holding unvested continental stock options,including appellants and hickcox.
the merger between continental and horton became effective in april.shortly after the merger,horton terminated hickcox without cause and appellants resigned pursuant to the for good reason provisions in their employment contracts.horton failed to honor the severance packages called for under both appellants and hickcox employment contracts.appellants and hickcox also contend horton failed to honor its promise to give continental managers holding unvested continental stock options shares of horton stock.
on february,hickcox alone filed a diversity action against horton in district court,alleging state law claims for breach of contract,failure to pay wages,promissory estoppel,and fraud.the same day,appellants jointly filed a separate and distinct diversity action against horton in the same district court,also alleging breach of contract,failure to pay wages,promissory estoppel,and fraud.appellants and hickcox made nearly identical breach of contract and fraud claims related to horton share promise.
on may,pursuant to a mandatory arbitration clause in hickcox employment contract,horton moved to dismiss hickcox case and compel arbitration.at the time,our precedent held that the faa did not apply to employment contracts and,therefore,compulsory arbitration clauses in employment contracts were unenforceable see craft campbell soup,cir.the district court,therefore,denied horton motion to compel arbitration in hickcox case.
after discovery and unsuccessful summary judgment motions,horton moved to consolidate appellants and hickcox cases for trial on the basis that both cases involved horton alleged share promise.the district court denied the motion because the difference between appellants and hickcox employment contract claims,resignation for good cause versus termination without cause,outweighed the benefit of consolidation.hickcox and appellants trials were set for march,and may,respectively.on march,a jury found horton liable for breaching the severance package provisions of hickcox employment contract and fraud as to the making of the share promise.the jury awarded hickcox in compensatory damages on the breach of contract claim,in damages on the fraud claim,and in punitive damages,which the district court ordered remitted to in punitive damages.
prior to the start of appellants trial,the district court granted a motion by horton to compel arbitration of appellants case because the supreme court had reversed our precedent and held that arbitration clauses in employment contracts are enforceable under the faa.see circuit city stores,at.
appellants claims were arbitrated before a panel of three arbitrators.appellants moved for summary judgment as to their share claims,contending that offensive collateral estoppel based on the judgment in hickcox case barred horton from relitigating their share claims.the arbitration panel denied appellants motion for summary judgment 
although the argument for collateral estoppel to at least some issues might be compelling if this were an appealable proceeding in a court of law,the arbitrators conclude that collateral estoppel should not be applied in this binding arbitration.the reason is that an appeal is pending in the hickcox matter,an appeal that we gather will not be resolved until well beyond the projected end of the current proceedings.we recognize that the pendency possibility of reversal appeal would not necessarily deprive a judgment of preclusive effect in a collateral proceeding in a court of law.there,the availability of an appeal of the second proceeding would permit the estoppel to be undone and the second judgment to be set aside if the prior judgment were ultimately reversed.practicality and fairness suggest a different conclusion in this binding arbitration,however,in which the estoppel,if now ordered,can not later be undone if the hickcox judgment is later reversed.such,in any event,is our understanding,and on the basis of that understanding we deny the motion of plaintiffs that collateral estoppel be attributed in this matter to issues resolved against horton in the hickcox case.
thereafter,the arbitrators found for appellants on their breach of employment contract claims.the arbitrators,however,found for horton on appellants claims arising from horton alleged share promise.
pursuant to appellants filed in district court an application to vacate that portion of the arbitration award holding appellants had not established,either on grounds of breach of contract,promissory estoppel,or fraud,that horton made an enforceable promise to give shares of horton stock to continental managers holding unvested continental stock options.appellants application to vacate the arbitration award contended that the arbitrators displayed a manifest disregard for the law when deciding not to apply offensive collateral estoppel to bar horton from relitigating whether horton made an enforceable share promise.
the district court denied appellants application to vacate the arbitration award,holding that the arbitrators erred by not giving preclusive effect to hickcox judgment but that this error did not rise to the level of a manifest disregard for the law.
we review de novo the district court denial of appellants motion to vacate the arbitration award.see woods saturn distrib,cir.our review,however,is necessarily limited broad judicial review of arbitration decisions could well jeopardize the very benefits of arbitration,speed and informality,rendering informal arbitration merely a prelude to a more cumbersome and judicial review process.kyocera trade,cir en banc.
under,a district court may vacate an arbitration award only 
where the award was procured by corruption,fraud or undue means where there was evident partiality or corruption on the part of the arbitrators where the arbitrators were guilty of misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced or where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.
although does not sanction judicial review of the merits of arbitration awards,we have adopted a narrow manifest disregard of the law exception under which a procedurally proper arbitration award may be vacated.this standard was first articulated in dicta in wilko swan.t he interpretations of the law by the arbitrators in contrast to manifest disregard,are not subject,in the federal courts,to judicial review for error in interpretation.emphasis added.the manifest disregard exception requires something beyond and different from a mere error in the law or failure on the part of the arbitrators to understand and apply the law.san martine compania de navegacion,saguenay terminals,cir.accordingly,we may not reverse an arbitration award even in the face of an erroneous interpretation of the law.see edwards mccollough,cir.rather,to demonstrate manifest disregard,the moving party must show that the arbitrator underst oo d and correctly state d the law,but proceed ed to disregard the same.san martine compania de navegacion,at.
in short,federal courts of appeals have repeatedly held,manifest disregard of the law means something more than just an error in the law or a failure on the part of the arbitrators to understand or apply the law.it must be clear from the record that the arbitrators recognized the applicable law and then ignored it.as such,mere allegations of error are insufficient.carter,at internal citations,quotation marks,and alterations omitted.moreover,to rise to the level of manifest disregard t he governing law alleged to have been ignored by the arbitrators must be well defined,explicit,and clearly applicable.id.emphasis added.
we have not specifically addressed whether arbitrators are bound by prior federal court decisions under the doctrines of collateral estoppel res judicata.collins horton,d.other circuits,however,have held that where the prerequisites for collateral estoppel are satisfied arbitrators must give preclusive effect to prior federal judgments.see,aircraft braking.local,cir miller runyon,cir john morrell local union,cir.we agree arbitrators are not free to ignore the preclusive effect of prior judgments under the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel,although they generally are entitled to determine in the first instance whether to give the prior judicial determination preclusive effect.aircraft braking,at see also miller brewing fort worth distrib,cir reasoning that parties should be barred from seeking relief from an arbitration panel if res judicata principles would bar relief in federal court because an arbitration award involves the entry of judgment by a court.
these circuits,however,have not addressed the question presented here,whether arbitrators possess the same broad discretion possessed by district courts to determine when to apply offensive collateral estoppel.as noted above,o ffensive collateral estoppel is a version of the doctrine of collateral estoppel that arises when a plaintiff seeks to estop a defendant from relitigating an issue which the defendant previously litigated and lost against another plaintiff.appling,at citing parklane hosiery,at.the supreme court has explained why district courts possess broad discretion in the application of offensive collateral estoppel 
collateral estoppel,like the related doctrine of res judicata,has the dual purpose of protecting litigants from the burden of relitigating an identical issue with the same party or his privy and of promoting judicial economy by preventing needless litigation.until relatively recently,however,the scope of collateral estoppel was limited by the doctrine of mutuality of parties.under this mutuality doctrine,neither party could use a prior judgment as an estoppel against the other unless both parties were bound by the judgment.based on the premise that it is somehow unfair to allow a party to use a prior judgment when he himself would not be so bound,the mutuality requirement provided a party who had litigated and lost in a previous action an opportunity to relitigate identical issues with new parties.
by failing to recognize the obvious difference in position between a party who has never litigated an issue and one who has fully litigated and lost,the mutuality requirement was criticized almost from its inception.recognizing the validity of this criticism,the court in laboratories,university of illinois foundation,d,abandoned the mutuality requirement,at least in cases where a patentee seeks to relitigate the validity of a patent after a federal court in a previous lawsuit has already declared it invalid.
the case involved defensive use of collateral plaintiff was estopped from asserting a claim that the plaintiff had previously litigated and lost against another defendant.the present case,by contrast,involves offensive use of collateral plaintiff is seeking to estop a defendant from relitigating the issues which the defendant previously litigated and lost against another plaintiff.in both the offensive and defensive use situations,the party against whom estoppel is asserted has litigated and lost in an earlier action.nevertheless,several reasons have been advanced why the two situations should be treated differently.
first,offensive use of collateral estoppel does not promote judicial economy in the same manner as defensive use does.defensive use of collateral estoppel precludes a plaintiff from relitigating identical issues by merely switching adversaries.thus defensive collateral estoppel gives a plaintiff a strong incentive to join all potential defendants in the first action if possible.offensive use of collateral estoppel,on the other hand,creates precisely the opposite incentive.since a plaintiff will be able to rely on a previous judgment against a defendant but will not be bound by that judgment if the defendant wins,the plaintiff has every incentive to adopt a wait and see attitude,in the hope that the first action by another plaintiff will result in a favorable judgment.thus offensive use of collateral estoppel will likely increase rather than decrease the total amount of litigation,since potential plaintiffs will have everything to gain and nothing to lose by not intervening in the first action.
a second argument against offensive use of collateral estoppel is that it may be unfair to a defendant.if a defendant in the first action is sued for small or nominal damages,he may have little incentive to defend vigorously,particularly if future suits are not foreseeable.allowing offensive collateral estoppel may also be unfair to a defendant if the judgment relied upon as a basis for the estoppel is itself inconsistent with one or more previous judgments in favor of the defendant.still another situation where it might be unfair to apply offensive estoppel is where the second action affords the defendant procedural opportunities unavailable in the first action that could readily cause a different result.
we have concluded that the preferable approach for dealing with these problems in the federal courts is not to preclude the use of offensive collateral estoppel,but to grant trial courts broad discretion to determine when it should be applied.

accordingly,even when the traditional prerequisites for collateral estoppel are satisfied trial courts have broad discretion to decide whether to apply offensive collateral estoppel.id.indeed,where the application of offensive collateral estoppel would be unfair to a defendant,a trial judge should not allow the use of collateral estoppel.id.emphasis added see also eureka fed.sav.loan ass am.cas,cir i t is inappropriate to apply collateral estoppel when its effect would be unfair.
