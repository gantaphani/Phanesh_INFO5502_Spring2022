the district court ruled that an arbitration clause incorporated in the parties reinsurance agreement was not broad and that ace claim for rescission of the agreement based on fraudulent inducement was therefore not included within the scope of arbitration.we disagree,holding that under hartford accident indemnity swiss reinsurance america,cir,the clause at issue here,requiring arbitration a s a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder,of any dispute that shall arise between the parties hereto with reference to the interpretation of this agreement or their rights with respect to any transaction involved,is a broad one that encompasses the parties disputes regarding fraudulent inducement and contract termination.we reaffirm that this court decision in in re kinoshita,cir,concluding that the use of the phrase arising under results in a narrow arbitration clause,has been limited to its precise facts.we therefore vacate the district court order denying arbitration and remand for an order compelling arbitration.
background 
in december,ace,an insurance company registered under the laws of bermuda,executed an initial agreement to reinsure a block of health insurance policies that cul,a texas stock life insurance company,had acquired from commonwealth national life insurance company commonwealth.on or about march,ace and cul formalized the terms of this agreement by entering into a retrocession agreement the agreement,dated october,pursuant to which ace undertook to reinsure a portion of the commonwealth block of policies.the agreement contains an arbitration clause that states,in pertinent part 
as a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder,if any dispute shall arise between the parties hereto with reference to the interpretation of this agreement or their rights with respect to any transaction involved,whether such dispute arises before or after termination of this agreement,such dispute,upon the written request of either party,shall be submitted to three arbitrators,one to be chosen by each party,and the third by the two arbitrators so chosen.
in addition to the agreement,cul and ace signed a stop loss reinsurance agreement,also dated october,under which cul ceded to ace of the net liability of cul under the covered policies in excess of cul annual retention,namely,three million dollars.the stop loss agreement contains an arbitration clause virtually identical to the one in the agreement.
after the agreement was executed,the commonwealth block began to produce losses,and the parties entered into negotiations for a possible restructuring of their arrangement.on december,cul president signed a document entitled proposal to enter into restructured reinsurance arrangements the proposal.this document proposed to amend and restructure the outstanding reinsurance agreements between cul and ace.the proposal also stated that the parties would mutually agree to terminate the retrocession agreement,effective january,and that the stop loss reinsurance agreement would be amended,effective as of the same date.the proposal further provided that cul and ace would enter into a new reinsurance agreement,likewise effective january,covering a new block of insurance policies.at no point did the proposal mention arbitration,but it did state that,with certain exceptions,t he terms of the new reinsurance agreement shall be substantially similar to the terms of the current retrocession agreement.the parties dispute,among other matters,whether the proposal is a binding agreement or merely an agreement to agree.
ii.proceedings below 
on march,ace commenced this action seeking a declaration that the proposal is a binding contract that terminates the agreement.at approximately the same time,cul served ace with a demand for arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provision of the agreement.ace filed an amended complaint on june,alleging,among other things,that while cul and ace were negotiating the agreement,cul had sued commonwealth for millions of dollars on the ground that the reserves for the commonwealth block were inadequate,and that cul had performed other acts that rendered fraudulent cul inducement of ace to enter into the agreement.specifically,ace argued that cul failure to disclose these facts to ace constituted a basis for rescission of the agreement on grounds of fraudulent concealment and material nondisclosure.
in its november,order,the district court found that w hile the arbitration clause in this case is not narrow,it is also not a broad clause applicable to all claims under the agreement.ace capital,wl,at.the court reasoned that the arbitration clause 
provides for the arbitration of only two types of disputes those involving interpretation of the agreement and those involving the parties rights with respect to any transaction under the agreement.because the language of the clause focuses on the interpretation of the agreement and the parties rights with respect to any transaction,a panoply of other potential disputes are excluded from coverage.
addressing ace claim for rescission of the agreement based on fraudulent inducement,the district court stated that the second circuit has clarified that more limited arbitration clauses do not encompass disputes over fraudulent inducement of the underlying contract and are to be resolved by the courts.id.at.in support of this statement,the court cited michele amoruso e figli fisheries development,and,parenthetically,in re kinoshita,cir.id.the court then went on to hold that i n view of the limited scope of the arbitration clause here,the fraud claims are to be resolved by this court,not the arbitrators.id.accordingly,the court granted ace motion to stay arbitration and denied cul to stay court proceedings and to compel arbitration.

discussion 
standard of review and applicable law 
a district court denial of a motion to compel arbitration is reviewed de novo.collins aikman prods,cir.
the second circuit has established a test for determining arbitrability of claims not involving federal statutes whether the parties agreed to arbitrate disputes at all and whether the dispute at issue comes within the scope of the arbitration agreement.hartford accident,at.a district court determination of these issues is reviewed de novo.oldroyd elmira sav.bank,fsb,cir.thus,whether ace claims of fraudulent inducement and contract termination fall within the scope of the agreement arbitration clause is a question that this court addresses without deference to the district court.
the faa,codified at,provides that written provisions to arbitrate controversies in any contract involving interstate commerce shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.id.there is a strong federal policy favoring arbitration as an alternative means of dispute resolution.hartford accident,at.in accordance with that policy,where,as here,the existence of an arbitration agreement is undisputed,doubts as to whether a claim falls within the scope of that agreement should be resolved in favor of arbitrability.see moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d a ny doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.nevertheless,a rbitration under the act is a matter of consent,not coercion,and parties are generally free to structure their arbitration agreements as they see fit.volt info,bd.of trs.of leland stanford,d.
ii.whether ace fraudulent inducement claim is within the scope of the arbitration clause 
it is well settled that a claim or defense of fraudulent inducement,when it challenges generally the enforceability of a contract containing an arbitration clause rather than specifically the arbitration clause itself,may be subject to arbitration.see prima paint flood conklin,d i f the claim is fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause issue which goes to the making of the agreement to federal court may proceed to adjudicate it.but the statutory language of the faa does not permit the federal court to consider claims of fraud in the inducement of the contract generally.this is true because arbitration clauses as a matter of federal law are separable from the contracts in which they are embedded,and where no claim is made that fraud was directed to the arbitration clause itself,a broad arbitration clause will be held to encompass arbitration of the claim that the contract itself was induced by fraud.id.at.
we recently explained prima paint doctrine of severability 
if a party alleges that a contract is void and provides some evidence in support,then the party need not specifically allege that the arbitration clause in that contract is void,and the party is entitled to a trial on the arbitrability issue pursuant to however,under the rule of prima paint,if a party merely alleges that a contract is voidable,then,for the party to receive a trial on the validity of the arbitration clause,the party must specifically allege that the arbitration clause is itself voidable.
sphere drake ins.clarendon ins,cir.in the present case,ace offers no evidence that the agreement is void.indeed,by consistently arguing that the agreement should be rescinded on the basis of fraud,ace has conceded that the agreement is,at most,voidable.see id.at a void contract is one that produces no legal obligation unlike a void contract,a voidable contract is an agreement that u nless rescinded imposes on the parties the same obligations as if it were not voidable.quoting samuel williston richard lord,a treatise on the law of contracts,at ed.moreover,ace has never contended that cul alleged fraud was directed specifically to the arbitration clause,but instead has argued that the entire agreement was fraudulently induced.thus,ace claim of fraudulent inducement is not on its face precluded from arbitration.
the question that remains is whether the arbitration clause at issue is broad enough to encompass ace fraud claim.see generally louis dreyfus negoce blystad shipping trading,cir,cert.denied,d.we conclude that the district court erred in ruling that the arbitration clause is not broad and that ace fraud claim is not arbitrable.the district court reached this result by ignoring more recent decisions of this court that,taken together,compel the conclusion that the arbitration clause at issue is broad and by relying on distinguishable second circuit case law.
this court in hartford accident addressed whether two differently worded arbitration clauses were broad enough to accommodate environmental pollution disputes that had arisen between an insurer and a reinsurer.at.the first clause clause i read,in pertinent part i n the event of any difference arising between the contracting parties it shall be submitted to arbitration id.at.the second clause clause ii was very similar to the one at issue in the present case i f any dispute shall arise between insurer and reinsurer with reference to the interpretation of this agreement or their rights with respect to any transaction involved,such dispute,upon the written request of either party,shall be submitted to arbitration id.this court concluded that both clauses had a broad scope.id.at.
the court reasoned that,while clause i was unquestionably sufficiently broad to encompass the disputed claims,clause ii also encompassed the disputes,even though it contained a measure of ambiguity in its phrasing.id.at.disagreeing with the district court conclusion that clause ii limited the scope of arbitration to individual transactions,this court offered the following analysis 
the district court explanation that the limitation of the arbitration to disputes particular to specific pending claims is made more explicit in clause ii is unavailing.by made more explicit,the district court must have read the phrase with respect to any transaction to modify both the interpretation of this agreement and their rights.this construction seems less natural than reading the prepositional phrase to modify only the phrase their rights.nevertheless,assuming both constructions to be reasonable,we are required to resolve this ambiguity in favor of arbitration.
id.at internal citations omitted.in short,based on a natural reading and given the presumption in favor of arbitrability,the hartford accident court read the phrase rights with respect to any transaction involved to constitute broad arbitration language.accord quackenbush allstate ins,cir finding the clause,if any dispute shall arise between mission and allstate with reference to the interpretation of this agreement or their rights with respect to any transaction involved such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration,to be broad in scope,calling for arbitration of all contractual disputes alteration in original 
the arbitration provision in the present case also contains the preamble,as a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder.relying heavily on this phrase,ace argues that the word hereunder renders the arbitration clause distinguishable from hartford acccident clause ii because it limits the scope of the clause to disputes arising under the contract and therefore excludes disputes over fraudulent inducement or that are arguably pre and formation.
we are not persuaded.we begin by noting that hartford accident clause ii actually included a prefatory phrase nearly identical to the one in the present case in quoting and discussing clause ii,however,both this court and the district court omitted any reference to the preamble.hartford accident,at hartford accident indem.swiss reinsurance am,d,moreover,by its terms,the prefatory clause does not limit the scope of the arbitration clause but rather establishes a limitation on when a judicial action may be brought under the agreement.
even if the word hereunder in the preamble were relevant to the scope of the provision in the present case,we have not automatically construed as narrow arbitration clauses containing such phrases as under the agreement or hereunder.in mineracao da utah international,cir,for example,this court considered the scope of an arbitration clause that read,in pertinent part whenever any question or dispute shall arise or occur under this,such question or dispute shall be finally settled by arbitration in paris,france id.at first alteration in original.noting that u nless excluded,claims of fraud in the inducement of a contract are arbitrable,this court held that the clause cover ed the claims of fraudulent inducement at issue.id.at 
the district court relied principally on michele amoruso.at citing kinoshita,at,in concluding that the arbitration clause at issue is not a broad clause applicable to all claims under the agreement and that a panoply of other potential disputes are excluded from coverage.ace capital,wl,at.in michele amoruso,the district court held that an arbitration clause referring to disputes arising out of this agreement was not broad,because it did not include any reference to disputes relating to the agreement.at.michele amoruso,however,is inconsistent with this court decision in louis dreyfus negoce,which held that the phrase arising from,as opposed to arising under,in an arbitration clause suggests a broad scope.at.
michele amoruso is also suspect for the still more compelling reason that it relied in turn almost exclusively on kinoshita,in which this court held that the phrase arise under this agreement in an arbitration clause renders the clause a narrow one if unaccompanied by an expansive phrase such as relating to.kinoshita,at.on the basis of this reasoning,the kinoshita court held that wher
