background 
in the spring of,g g,backed by a consortium of canadian coinvestors entered into negotiations with petra and ulrich buschmeier for the acquisition of heye,a german limited partnership.one of the principal negotiators acting on behalf of g g was richard deneau,president and ceo of anchor,a subsidiary of g petra buschmeier owned a interest in heye,and ulrich buschmeier owned another.in the course of the negotiations,the buschmeiers represented to g g that any sale of heye would require the buschmeiers to first purchase the interests of minority shareholders as well as the usufructuary rights of petra buschmeier mother.the buschmeiers indicated they had agreements in place that would allow them to force the sale of those interests but that time was of the essence because of an impending deadline within which a sale of minority interests could be compelled.
on september,g g executed an agreement to purchase heye.the agreement required payment in three installments,the first of payment of approximately due within three days.this sum was to be paid directly to petra buschmeier for use in purchasing her mother usufructuary rights.the second payment was due a week later and the final payment a month after that.the purchase agreement also contained an arbitration clause which stipulated that a ll disputes arising in connection with this agreement shall be finally settled under the rules of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with said rules.
apparently g g execution of the purchase agreement and the tight payment schedule to which it had committed caught its canadian coinvestors completely offguard.the day before the first payment was due,certain coinvestors reported that their boards would not authorize the release of the money needed to fund the initial installment until additional due diligence was performed.g g asked the buschmeiers for an extension of the initial payment due date in order to placate the demands of the coinvestors and secure the financial records they required.the buschmeiers refused to extend the deadline.
in an effort to meet the deadline and save the deal,g g turned to its subsidiary,anchor,for a million bridge loan.anchor agreed to loan g g the funds for the initial installment,provided that deneau receive assurances that the initial payment would be returned if g g and its coinvestors were unable to complete the acquisition of heye under the terms of the september agreement.to this end,ulrich buschmeier and deneau had telephone conversations on september and in which buschmeier allegedly promised that the initial payment would be repaid in the event the transaction was not completed.buschmeier also apparently reiterated that the deadline for making the initial payment could not be extended due to the impending expiration of heye agreements with its minority shareholders.deneau and his german counsel then drafted a letter for ulrich buschmeier signature dated september,addressed from buschmeier to g g ceo,in which buschmeier confirmed that this first installment will be repaid to g g investments,if for any reason,or without reason,the transfer of the sold interest in heye does not occur.buschmeier signed the letter and returned it to anchor german counsel.thus reassured,anchor immediately borrowed against its revolving line of credit and wired the funds directly into the personal bank account of petra buschmeier,thereby meeting g g september deadline for making the first payment.
when the deadline for making the second payment arrived one week later,g g canadian investors still had not completed their due diligence.the buschmeiers once again declined to extend the payment deadline.following a series of events irrelevant to the present suit,g g canadian investors completely withdrew from participation in the proposed acquisition of heye.g g attempted to secure replacement financing and negotiations to save the deal ensued,but none of these efforts bore fruit.by february all parties considered the deal to be dead.when petra buschmeier made it clear she had no intention of refunding the million due to g g breach of the payment schedule,a substantial volume of litigation ensued.
pursuant to the arbitration clause in the purchase agreement,g g requested arbitration before the international chamber of commerce icc on the question of whether the september letter,drafted by deneau and his attorney and signed by ulrich buschmeier,modified the terms of the purchase agreement such that petra buschmeier was required to return the initial payment.g g position was that the september letter amended the original purchase agreement and amounted to an exit clause,entitling it to rescind the agreement and obtain the return of the money if the sale went uncompleted for any reason,as ultimately occurred,g g own inability to timely secure financing petra buschmeier took the position that the september letter had no effect on the parties obligations established in the purchase agreement,and that the letter was intended to require the return of the first installment only if the ultimate transfer of heye became impossible because of her own failure to meet her obligations,most notably the possibility that she would be unable to purchase shares from the minority shareholders of heye.
g g and petra buschmeier were the only parties to the arbitration proceeding,and hearings before the panel of arbitrators were held in germany in june.one of the key not the key behalf of g g was deneau.among other things,deneau testified about his conversations with ulrich buschmeier on september and that culminated in the drafting and execution of the september letter at the heart of the dispute.
after the hearings concluded but before the arbitrators rendered their decision,anchor commenced the present action against the buschmeiers,seeking return of the initial installment payment on theories of breach of contract,fraud,promissory estoppel,conversion,and unjust enrichment.less than a month after this suit was filed,the icc issued a final arbitration decision,denying g g claim for a refund and sustaining petra buschmeier counterclaim for damages.the arbitrators,applying german law required by the purchase agreement,held that the legal effect of the september letter was determined by reference to ulrich buschmeier good faith understanding of its meaning at the time he signed it.more specifically,the arbitration panel held 
therefore,the september letter can only be given the meaning,significance and relevance as were accepted by ulrich buschmeier,in the sense that respondent petra buschmeier would be obliged to return the initial payment in case the transaction would not materialise for reasons within respondent sphere,if for any reason or for no reason respondent would not succeed to obtain the heye shares from the numerous heye minority shareholders emphasis in original.
in attempting to discern buschmeier understanding of what he agreed to in the september letter,the arbitration panel attached great significance to deneau testimony concerning his preletter conversations with buschmeier and buschmeier attorney.the panel concluded that in these conversations deneau intentionally downplay
