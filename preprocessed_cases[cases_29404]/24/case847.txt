facts and procedural background 
systemaire is a mechanical contractor operating in the louis,missouri,area.local is a louis labor union representing sheet metal workers.pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement with local,systemaire agreed to assign certain specified work to local.systemaire also entered into a collective bargaining agreement with another union,pipefitters local union pipefitters.a substantial overlap exists between systemaire collective bargaining agreement with local and the company collective bargaining agreement with the pipefitters with respect to the work reserved and to be assigned to each craft.as a result,jurisdictional disputes often arise between the two unions regarding systemaire allocation of its work between the two unions.
the collective bargaining agreement between systemaire and local contains a provision addressing the jurisdictional dispute issue.the cba states that i f a contractor is signatory to a labor agreement with more than one union and a jurisdictional dispute arises between the crafts the contractor employs,every attempt will be made to resolve said dispute including but not limited to any local or national jurisdictional disputes board which may exist.the contractors and the union agree to abide by any decisions made by any local or national jurisdictional disputes board.appellee app.at.the cba also contains the following language regarding grievances.pursuant to section of article x of the cba,g rievances of the employer or the union,arising out of interpretation or enforcement of this agreement,shall be settled between the employer directly involved and the duly authorized representative of the union,if possible.both parties may participate in conferences through representatives of their choice.appellee separate app.at.in addition,section of article x of the cba provides that g rievances not settled as provided in section of this article may be appealed by either party to the local joint adjustment board where the work was performed except in the case of a deadlock,a decision of a local joint adjustment board shall be final and binding.id.
as a means of resolving jurisdictional disputes,local,the pipefitters,the mechanical contractors association of louis mca,and the sheet metal and air conditioning contractors national association,louis chapter smacna established a local joint jurisdictional committee.on february,the committee met to adjudicate a jurisdictional dispute between local and the pipefitters.after a hearing,the committee awarded the disputed project to the pipefitters.one week later,local announced that it would no longer recognize the local committee or abide by its decisions.there is no evidence in the record that discloses the existence of a national jurisdictional disputes board.
some of the affected contractors including systemaire opted to adjudicate the jurisdictional disputes through the national labor relations board nlrb pursuant to the procedure outlined in k of the national labor relations act nlra.see k.consequently,from may to may,the nlrb heard several cases involving jurisdictional disputes between local and the pipefitters.in each case,the nlrb decided the dispute in favor of the pipefitters.the nlrb,however,refused to issue an ruling governing all future disputes between the two unions.rather,the nlrb limited relief to the particular controversy that gave rise to these proceedings.pipefitters local union systemaire,nlrb.
in april,another jurisdictional dispute arose between local and the pipefitters.the pipefitters threatened to strike if systemaire refused to award them a material handling pipe installation project for sunline brands.faced with competing claims to the work,systemaire concluded that the pipe installation work involved in the sunline project mirrored the type of work that the nlrb had previously awarded to the pipefitters and awarded the sunline project to the pipefitters.appellant app.at.
local then filed its grievance concerning the assignment of the sunline work pursuant to the grievance article of its cba with systemaire.the grievance came before the local joint adjustment board ljab as provided for in the cba.the pipefitters hold no seats on the ljab.rather than appear in person before the ljab,systemaire sent two letters.in the first letter appellant app.at,systemaire asserted that the issues were not grievable because they were jurisdictional disputes between the two unions,and that based on the nlrb ruling in a previous case involving similar work performed by systemaire,the sunline work had been correctly assigned by systemaire to its pipe fitter represented employees.in the second letter,which was sent a few days before the ljab scheduled hearing on the grievance,systemaire again asserted that the dispute was a jurisdictional one which it intended to pursue before the nlrb,but it also submitted its arguments on the merits of the grievance in the event the local joint adjustment board chooses to discuss these grievances in our absence asserting that the work allocation it had made to the pipefitters on the sunline project was in accord with the past area practice.the ljab proceeded to hold its hearing on the grievance on january.local appeared in person and presented its case systemaire did not.on february,the ljab issued its decision and unanimously found that systemaire had improperly awarded the sunline project to the pipefitters and levied the damage assessment against systemaire.the ljab written decision is silent with respect to systemaire contention that the issue was not grievable.
systemaire filed unfair labor practices charges against both local and the pipefitters before the nlrb.systemaire renewed its argument that the project in dispute was factually identical to projects previously awarded to the pipefitters.the nlrb,however,declined to hold a hearing on this matter.the nlrb concluded that the past assignments could not serve as a basis for attacking the ljab decision on the individual grievance because the nlrb had declined to issue an decision.consequently,the nlrb declined to issue complaints on systemaire unfair labor practices charges.
approximately seven months after the ljab decision,local filed this action in federal district court to enforce the ljab award.see.systemaire answered and filed a counterclaim asking the district court to vacate the award.local then filed a motion for summary judgment and systemaire responded by raising several defenses.most notably,systemaire argued that the award did not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.without addressing the merits of systemaire cba argument,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of local for statute of limitations reasons.systemaire appeals.
discussion 
in granting summary judgment in favor of local,the district court concluded that systemaire defenses were time barred because the company did not raise them in a timely action to vacate the award.we review the district court summary judgment determinations de novo.see amir louis,cir.
a party seeking to challenge the validity of an arbitration award generally must file a timely motion to vacate that award.see domino group,charlie parker mem l,cir.the failure to file a timely motion to vacate an award also typically bars a party from later raising any defenses to the confirmation of the award that could have been raised in the vacation motion.see id.at.although a of the labor management relations act lmra contains no statute of limitations regarding the filing of a vacation motion,see a,we have held that a district court must borrow a statute of limitations from state law most analogous to the dispute.lo
