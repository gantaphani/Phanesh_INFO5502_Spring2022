background 
comiskey patent application claims a method and system for mandatory arbitration involving legal documents,such as wills or contracts.according to the application,the claimed program requires resolution by binding arbitration of any challenge or complaint concerning any unilateral document or contractual document.
independent claim recites a method for mandatory arbitration resolution regarding one or more unilateral documents involving the following steps.first,the unilateral document and its author are enrolled.second,arbitration language is incorporated in the unilateral document requiring that any contested issue related to the document be presented to the arbitration program for binding arbitration.third,the method requir es a complainant sic to submit a request for arbitration resolution.fourth,the method conducts arbitration resolution.fifth,the method provides support to the arbitration.finally,the method determines an award or decision that is final and binding.independent claim is practically identical to claim,except that it refers to contractual documents rather than unilateral documents although the application written description references an automated system and method for requiring resolution through binding arbitration and a mandatory arbitration system through a computer on a network,claims and do not reference,and the parties agree that these claims do not require,the use of a mechanical device such as a computer.
independent claim recites a system for mandatory arbitration resolution regarding one or more unilateral documents.it includes the following limitations a registration module to register the unilateral document and its executor an arbitration module for incorporating to store and provide arbitration language that requires any contested issue related to the unilateral document be presented to the system an arbitration resolution module that enables a complainant to submit a request for arbitration resolution and a means for selecting an arbitrator from an arbitrator database and providing support to the arbitrator where the arbitrator determines an award or a decision that is final and binding.independent claim is practically identical to claim,except that it refers to contractual documents rather than unilateral documents four dependent claims claims,and also explicitly require use of a computer or other machine.each states,in full t he method system of claim,or wherein access to the mandatory arbitration is established through the internet,intranet,world wide web,software applications,telephone,television,cable,video or radio,magnetic,electronic communication,or other communication means.
comiskey filed his patent application with the united states patent and trademark office pto on december.on march,the examiner issued a first office action rejecting claims,and under a as unpatentable over ginter,patent patent,in view of perry,patent patent,and walker,patent patent.ginter discloses an electronic system for securely delivering documents from the sender to the recipient through the electronic equivalent of a personal document carrier that can validate transactions as well as actively participate in the transaction by,among other things,providing arbitration.patent abstract.walker discloses an electronic system that allows buyers to submit binding purchase offers and sellers to create contracts by accepting a purchase offer on its terms.it also teaches the inclusion of language in the purchase offers requiring that both parties submit to binding arbitration of all disputes and suggests that a central controller can support the arbitration process by providing an arbiter for each dispute.patent.perry discloses an electronic central depository for secure storage and rapid retrieval of unilateral documents such as wills.the examiner also found claims,and which added the additional limitation of displaying an arbitration schedule unpatentable over ginter in view of a document entitled arbitration fee schedule.the examiner final office action on may,provided the same basis for rejection.
comiskey filed an amendment after final rejection on august,to more distinctly claim and particularly point out the aspects of his invention that he believed were novel,namely the person in a mandatory arbitration system,including language in the document requiring submission of disputes to this system,and enabling a person to submit a dispute pertaining to the document to this system for binding arbitration.on december,the examiner mailed a final rejection of the amended claims,which rejected the claims on the same basis.after comiskey filed a request for continued examination,the finality of the prior office action was withdrawn,and the examiner mailed another rejection on july,based again on the same grounds.in response,comiskey submitted a declaration of long felt need on october,claiming that based on his experience representing clients involved in family disputes concerning unilateral documents,he believed his invention addressed an area of long felt need.on november,the examiner mailed a final rejection based on the same reasons as the prior office actions and rejected comiskey assertion of long felt need on the ground that the cited prior art references had recognized and addressed the problem prior to comiskey.
comiskey appealed,and on november,the board affirmed the examiner rejection.the board concluded that because all of the independent claims were argued together they stood or fell together,and it chose claim as representative.it concluded that the combination of ginter and walker rendered this claim obvious.despite concluding that all of the independent claims stood or fell together,the board proceeded to consider claims and,directed to unilateral documents,separately.it concluded that the addition of perry to ginter and walker rendered these claims obvious.finally,the board considered and affirmed the examiner rejection of claims,and as obvious in light of ginter,perry,walker,and the arbitration fee schedule.
comiskey timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction under a a.after oral argument,we requested supplemental briefing directed at the patentability of the subject matter of comiskey application under.in the supplemental briefing,comiskey argued for the first time that we lacked the power to consider a ground for rejection not relied on below.alternatively,comiskey argued that his application was patentable under,and that the subject matter of his application did not fall within an exception to patentability,such as an abstract idea,natural phenomena,or law of nature.
the pto urged that this court could properly consider the issue.indeed,the pto urged that this court resolve the case on this ground to give the office needed guidance in this area.pto supp.br.the pto argued that comiskey independent claims were directed at an unpatentable abstract idea,and not a patentable process,because they neither were tied to a particular machine nor operated to change materials to a different state or thing.rather the claims impermissibly encompasse d a method of controlling how humans interact with each other to resolve a dispute,based on a human arbitrator perception of the dispute.pto supp.br.
discussion 
we do not reach the ground relied on by the board the claims were unpatentable as obvious over ginter in view of walker,perry,and arbitration fee schedule because we conclude that many of the claims are barred at the threshold by.diamond diehr,d.it is that t he first door which must be opened on the difficult path to patentability is.state bank trust signature fin.group,quoting in re bergy,ccpa.only if the requirements of are satisfied is the inventor allowed to pass through to the other requirements for patentability,such as novelty under and,of pertinence to this case,under.see id.as the supreme court stated in parker flook,d,t he obligation to determine what type of discovery is sought to be patented so as to determine whether it is the kind of discoveries that the statute was enacted to protect must precede the determination of whether that discovery is,in fact,new or obvious.id.at.emphases added.
the pto acknowledges that the examiner,consistent with his obligation under the cases,must have addressed the predicate issue of patentable subject matter and implicitly concluded that the claims met the requirements of.see oral arg.tr.for the reasons discussed below,we disagree.see also manual of patent examining procedures mpep guidelines flowchart,listing the steps an examiner should follow in determining patentability,with determine whether the claimed invention complies with listed before determine whether the claimed invention complies with and.
we first address comiskey argument that we can not properly address the issue of patentable subject matter.at oral argument,comiskey admitted that the court could affirm on the ground if in fact we came to the conclusion that the subject matter of this claim does not address the statutory subject matter.in his supplemental briefing,comiskey attempts to withdraw any statement made at oral argument which would infer that this court could even consider a new statutory grounds for rejecti on.appellant supp.br.comiskey now asserts that t his court lacks the power to sua sponte raise and thereafter decide a statutory ground of patentability never raised during the agency proceeding below because our review of the board decision is required to be on the record before the patent and trademark office under and the administrative procedure act apa.id.at.
over sixty years ago in securities exchange commission chenery,the supreme court made clear that a reviewing court can and should affirm an agency decision on a legal ground not relied on by the agency if there is no issue of fact,policy,or agency expertise.the court said 
in confining our review to a judgment upon the validity of the grounds upon which the commission itself based its action,we do not disturb the settled rule that,in reviewing the decision of a lower court,it must be affirmed if the result is correct although the lower court relied upon a wrong ground or gave a wrong reason.it would be wasteful to send a case back to a lower court to reinstate a decision which it had already made but which the appellate court concluded should properly be based on another ground within the power of the appellate court to formulate.but it is also familiar appellate procedure that where the correctness of the lower court decision depends upon a determination of fact which only a jury could make but which has not been made,the appellate court can not take the place of the jury.like considerations govern review of administrative orders.if an order is valid only as a determination of policy or judgment which the agency alone is authorized to make and which it has not made,a judicial judgment can not be made to do service for an administrative judgment.
id.at.emphases added internal citations and quotation marks omitted.we have repeatedly applied chenery and have said that w e may,however,where appropriate,affirm the agency on grounds other than those relied upon in rendering its decision,when upholding the agency decision does not depend upon making a determination of fact not previously made by the agency.killip office of pers,emphases added see also newhouse nicholson,t he chenery doctrine is not implicated when the new ground for affirmance is not one that calls for a determination or judgment which an administrative agency alone is authorized to make.internal quotation marks omitted spears merit.prot.we note that the apa specifically states that the reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law.the supreme court has emphasized that in general the pto should be treated like other administrative agencies,and that patent cases are subject to the same general administrative law legal principles.dickinson zurko,d.thus,the same rules governing affirmance of agency action on a ground not relied on below necessarily apply in the pto context as in the administrative context generally.
as comiskey points out,some of our cases have concluded that it is inappropriate for this court to consider rejections that had not been considered by or relied upon by the board.in re margolis.but these statements referred to situations that required factual determinations not made by the agency.for example,in margolis and other cases the new grounds for decision would require this court to make factual determinations involving the scope and content of the prior art and differences between the prior art and the claims at issue,dippin dots,mosey,which had not been considered by the pto we decline to read these cases as rejecting the breadth of the chenery decision on which they explicitly relied.
it is that whether the asserted claims are invalid for failure to claim statutory subject matter under,is a question of law which we review without deference.at t excel commc ns.as a question of law,lack of statutory subject matter is a ground for affirmance within the power of the appellate court to formulate.chenery,at.while there may be cases in which the legal question as to patentable subject matter may turn on subsidiary factual issues,comiskey has not identified any relevant fact issues that must be resolved in order to address the patentability of the subject matter of comiskey application.moreover,since we would review a board decision on the issue of patentability without deference,see at t,at,the legal issue concerning patentability is not a determination of policy or judgment which the agency alone is authorized to make.chenery,at.
in these circumstances,chenery not only permits us to supply a new legal ground for affirmance,but encourages such a resolution where,as here,i t would be wasteful to send the case back to the agency for a determination as to patentable subject matter.at.we therefore may consider the patentability of comiskey claims under,and we turn to the merits of that question 
comiskey application may be viewed as falling within the general category of business method patents.at one time,t hough seemingly within the category of process or method,a method of doing business was rejected as not being within the statutory classes.state street bank,at quoting mpep a.in state street bank,we addressed the business method exception to statutory subject matter,and stated that w e take this opportunity to lay this exception to rest.id.at.state street bank involved a data processing system for managing a financial services configuration of a portfolio established as a partnership,and g iven the complexity of the calculations,a computer or equivalent device wa s a virtual necessity to perform the task.id.at.we held that this system was patentable,concluding that patentability does not turn on whether the claimed subject matter does business instead of something else.id.at.
although it has been suggested that state street bank supports the patentability of business methods generally state street bank explicitly held that business methods are subject to the same legal requirements for patentability as applied to any other process or method.id.at see also mpep i,mpep claims should not be categorized as methods of doing business.instead,such claims should be treated like any other process claims.we must then consider the requirements of in determining whether comiskey claims and for a method of mandatory arbitration for unilateral and contractual documents claim statutory subject matter.
the very constitutional provision that authorized congress to create a patent system,article i,also limited the subject matter eligible for patent protection to the useful arts.according to the supreme court,this constitutional limitation on patentability was written against the backdrop of the english curtailed by the statute of the crown in granting monopolies to court favorites in goods or businesses which had long before been enjoyed by the public.graham,at.in the and centuries,the english crown granted monopolies over entire types of business to specific individuals,for example the grant by james i to darcy in of the exclusive right to manufacture or sell playing cards or the exclusive right to the printing business held by the london guild of booksellers and printers.see peter meinhardt,inventions,patents,and monopoly ed eldred ashcroft,d.the purpose of such monopolies was to enrich the king as well as the grantee,at the expense of the community.meinhardt,supra,at.with this background in mind,the framers consciously acted to bar congress from granting letters patent in particular types of business.the constitution explicitly limited patentability to the national purpose of advancing the useful process today called technological innovation.paulik rizkalla,en banc.
beginning with the first patent act,the patent act of,congress responded to the bidding of the constitution,graham,at,by including provisions limiting patentable subject matter.see an act to promote the progress of useful arts,ch,stat.the standard used by the patent act of,which limited patentability to any new and useful art,machine,manufacture,or composition of matter,or any new or useful improvement thereof,is essentially the same as that used today.an act to promote the progress of useful arts and to repeal the act heretofore made for that purpose,ch,stat.the patent act of did replace the word art with the word process so that current states 
whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process,machine,manufacture,or composition of matter,or any new and useful improvement thereof,may obtain a patent therefore,subject to the conditions and requirements of this title 
however,the supreme court has made clear that the language change had no substantive effect,stating that a nalysis of the eligibility of a claim of patent protection for a process did not change with the addition of that term to.diehr,at.
patentable subject matter under the act is extremely broad.given the breadth of the categories listed in,it is not surprising that the legislative history of the act noted that congress intended statutory subject matter to include anything under the sun that is made by man.chakrabarty,at.quoting,internal quotation marks omitted.on the other hand,the supreme court has made clear that this statement does not suggest that has no limits or that it embraces every discovery.id.
specifically,supreme court decisions after the patent act have rejected a purely literal reading of the process provision and emphasized that not every process is patentable.flook,at.instead t he question is whether the method described and claimed is a process within the meaning of the patent act.gottschalk benson,d see also flook,at.r espondent incorrectly assumes that if a process application implements a principle in some specific fashion,it automatically falls within the patentable subject matter of.abstract ideas are one type of subject matter that the supreme court has consistently held fall beyond the broad reaches of patentable subject matter under.as early as le roy tatham,how,the supreme court explained that a principle,in the abstract,is a fundamental truth an original cause a motive these can not be patented,as no one can claim in either of them an exclusive right.id.at.since then,the unpatentable nature of abstract ideas has repeatedly been confirmed.see,diehr,at.chakrabarty,at.flook,at.benson,at.pencil howard,wall.the very cases of this court that recognized the patentability of some business methods have reaffirmed that abstract ideas are not patentable.see at t,at state street bank,at see also in re alappat,en banc.
the prohibition against the patenting of abstract ideas has two distinct though related aspects.first,when an abstract concept has no claimed practical application,it is not patentable.the supreme court has held that a n idea of itself is not patentable.pencil,at.in benson,the claim was for a method of converting decimal numerals into pure binary numerals that was not limited to any particular art or technology,to any particular apparatus or machinery,or to any particular end use.at.since the claim would therefore wholly preempt the mathematical formula and in practical effect would be a patent on the algorithm itself,the claim was unpatentable because its practical effect was to patent an idea in the abstract.id.at.see also at t,at holding that a mathematical algorithm must produce a useful,concrete,and tangible result to be patentable state street bank,at same mpep,c laims define nonstatutory processes if they simply manipulate abstract ideas without some claimed practical application.
second,the abstract concept may have a practical application.the supreme court has reviewed process patents reciting algorithms or abstract concepts in claims directed to industrial processes.in that context,the supreme court has held that a claim reciting an algorithm or abstract idea can state statutory subject matter only if,as employed in the process,it is embodied in,operates on,transforms,or otherwise involves another class of statutory subject matter,a machine,manufacture,or composition of matter.as the pto notes,t he supreme court has recognized only two instances in which such a method may qualify as a section process when the process either was tied to a particular apparatus or operated to change materials to a different state or thing.see pto supp.br.quoting flook,at.in diehr,the supreme court confirmed that a process claim reciting an algorithm could state statutory subject matter if it is tied to a machine or creates or involves a composition of matter or manufacture at.there,in the context of a process claim for curing rubber that recited an algorithm,the court concluded that t ransformation and reduction of an article to a different state or thing is the clue to the patentability of a process claim that does not include particular machines.id.quoting benson,at.see also in re schrader,holding when a claim does not invoke a machine,requires some kind of transformation or reduction of subject matter.thus,a claim that involves both a mental process and one of the other categories of statutory subject matter,a machine,manufacture,or composition may be patentable under.see diehr,at.holding a process that involved calculations using the arrhenius equation patentable because the claim involve d the transformation of an article,in this case raw,uncured synthetic rubber,into a different state or thing.for example,we have found processes involving mathematical algorithms used in computer technology patentable because they claimed practical applications and were tied to specific machines 
however,mental processes of human alone are not patentable even if they have practical application.the supreme court has stated that p henomena of nature,though just discovered,mental processes,and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable,as they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work.benson,at.emphasis added.in flook the patentee argued that his claims did not seek to patent an abstract idea an algorithm because they were limited to a practical application of that alarm limits for catalytic chemical conversion of hydrocarbons.at.the court rejected the notion that mere recitation of a practical application of an abstract idea makes it patentable,concluding that a competent draftsman could attach some form of activity to almost any mathematical formula.id.at.since all other features of the process were,including the use of computers for automatic,the court construed the application as simply provid ing a new and presumably better method for calculating alarm limit values.id.at.the court held the application unpatentable because if a claim as a whole is directed essentially to a method of calculating,using a mathematical formula,even if the solution is for a specific purpose,the claimed method is nonstatutory.at.quoting in re richman,ccpa.
following the lead of the supreme court,this court and our predecessor court have refused to find processes patentable when they merely claimed a mental process standing alone and untied to another category of statutory subject matter even when a practical application was claimed.in schrader we held unpatentable a method constitut ing a novel way of conducting auctions by allowing competitive bidding on a plurality of related items.at.in doing so,we rejected the patentee argument that the process used a machine.two of the alleged display in the front of the auction room and a television system for bidders in different not claimed by the patent,and the record in which bids could be be a piece of paper or a chalkboard.id.at.we therefore concluded that the patent impermissibly claimed unpatentable subject matter.similarly,in in re warmerdam,we held unpatentable a process for controlling objects so as to avoid collisions because the key steps of locating a medial axis and creating a bubble hierarchy described nothing more than the manipulation of basic mathematical constructs,the paradigmatic abstract idea.id.at.a machine was not required,id.at,nor was there any indication that the process operated on a manufacture or composition of matter.
decisions of our predecessor court are in accord.in re meyer,ccpa,held that a mental process that a neurologist should follow was not patentable because it was not limited to any otherwise statutory process,machine,manufacture,or composition of matter.id.at.similarly,in re maucorps,ccpa,held that an invention u ltimately directed toward optimizing the organization of sales representatives in a business was unpatentable.id.at.see also alappat,at maucorps dealt with a business method for deciding how salesmen should best handle respective customers and meyer involved a system for aiding a neurologist in diagnosing patients.clearly,neither of the alleged inventions in those cases falls within any category.
it is thus clear that the present statute does not allow patents to be issued on particular business as a particular type of depend entirely on the use of mental processes.in other words,the patent statute does not allow patents on particular systems that depend for their operation on human intelligence alone,a field of endeavor that both the framers and congress intended to be beyond the reach of patentable subject matter.thus,it is established that the application of human intelligence to the solution of practical problems is not in and of itself patentable.
having considered the governing legal principles,we now turn to comiskey application and begin with independent claims and which recite a method for mandatory arbitration resolution regarding unilateral and contractual documents.comiskey has conceded that these claims do not require a machine,and these claims evidently do not describe a process of manufacture or a process for the alteration of a composition of matter.comiskey independent claims and claim the mental process of resolving a legal dispute between two parties by the decision of a human arbitrator.they describe in essence conducting arbitration resolution for a contested issue and determining an award or a decision for the contested issue through a predetermined mandatory arbitration system,and thus claim the use of mental processes to resolve a legal dispute.thus,like the claims that the supreme court found unpatentable in benson and flook and the claims found unpatentable in our own cases,comiskey independent claims and seek to patent the use of human intelligence in and of itself.like the efforts to patent a novel way of conducting auctions which schrader found to be directed to an abstract idea itself rather than a statutory category,comiskey independent claims and describe an allegedly novel way of requiring and conducting arbitration and are unpatentable.see schrader,at.
we consider independent claims and separately.they recite the use of modules,including a registration module for enrolling a person,an arbitration module for incorporating arbitration language,and an arbitration resolution module for requiring a complainant or party to submit a request for arbitration resolution to the mandatory arbitration system.claim also recites a means for selecting an arbitrator from an arbitrator database.these claims,under the broadest reasonable interpretation,could require the use of a computer as part of comiskey arbitration system.see alan freedman,the computer glossary ed defining module as a hardware or software component that interacts with a larger system id.at defining database as any collection of data.similarly,even though comiskey did not separately argue his dependent claims,our decision is based on a different ground than the board,and we think it is appropriate to separately consider dependent claims,and.each of these claims adds the following limitation to its corresponding independent claim wherein access to the mandatory arbitration is established through the internet,intranet,world wide web,software applications,telephone,television,cable,video or radio,magnetic,electronic communication,or other communications means.
when an unpatentable mental process is combined with a machine,the combination may produce patentable subject matter,as the supreme court decision in diehr and our own decisions in state street bank and at t have confirmed.see diehr,at.holding patentable a process for curing rubber that used a mathematical algorithm to determine when to open the molding press at t,at,holding patentable a method for determining whether calls were being made between carriers or within a single carrier that used a mathematical algorithm and require d the use of switches and computers state street bank,at holding patentable a system that allows an administrator to monitor and record the financial information flow and make all calculations necessary for maintaining a partner fund financial services configuration where a computer or equivalent device wa s a virtual necessity to perform the task.while the mere use of the machine to collect data necessary for application of the mental process may not make the claim patentable subject matter,see in re grams,these claims in combining the use of machines with a mental process,claim patentable subject matter.
while independent claims and and dependent claims,and claim patentable subject matter under,the other requirements for patentability,including,must still be satisfied.see diehr,at.here,claims and at most merely add a modern general purpose computer to an otherwise unpatentable mental process and claims,and merely add modern communication devices.the routine addition of modern electronics to an otherwise unpatentable invention typically creates a prima facie case of obviousness moreover,there is no pertinent evidence of secondary considerations because the only evidence offered is of need for the unpatentable mental process itself,not need for the combination of the mental process and a modern communication device or computer see stratoflex,aeroquip,a nexus is required between the merits of the claimed invention and the evidence offered,if that evidence is to be given substantial weight enroute to conclusion on the obviousness issue.bourns,united states,noting that secondary considerations must be attributable to the combination of the claims to be worthy of consideration.
thus,it may be that these claims are unpatentable as obvious under.however,we do not now decide this issue.rather,having concluded that independent claims and and dependent claims,and claim patentable subject matter,we remand to the pto to determine in the first instance whether the addition of general purpose computers or modern communication devices to comiskey otherwise unpatentable mental process would have been to a person of ordinary skill in the art.
conclusion 
we conclude that comi
