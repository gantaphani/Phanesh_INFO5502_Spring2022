harbert international,llc,is a delaware corporation based in birmingham,alabama,which makes money in large construction projects including some done for the government.hercules steel company is a north carolina corporation based in fayetteville,north carolina,that manufactures steel used in construction.
on august,the united states army corp of engineers,savannah district,awarded harbert a contract to construct an office complex for the special operations forces at fort bragg,north carolina.harbert,in turn,awarded hercules a steel fabrication and erection subcontract on september.
the subcontract between the parties includes a provision that disputes between them will be submitted to binding arbitration under the auspices of the american arbitration association,using the construction industry arbitration rules.later,the parties executed a separate agreement to arbitrate,which recognizes that the federal arbitration act,would control arbitration proceedings.
the subcontract further provides that harbert will issue a progress schedule for the project and will provide a copy to each subcontractor.it states that the subcontractor must perform all work in accordance with progress schedule as prepared by harbert and as it may be revised from time to time with the subcontractor input.the subcontract also provides that the subcontractor is liable for damages caused by its failure to complete its work within the time provided in the project schedule.the terms progress schedule and project schedule are not defined.
harbert failure to define those terms might have gone unnoticed if it had created only one schedule for the project,but harbert developed two,which it referred to as the and schedules.harbert claims that it created the schedule to update the corps of engineers about the progress of the project,and the schedule to manage the work of its subcontractors,including hercules.in any event,neither schedule is mentioned in the subcontract.
the problem is that the schedule contained earlier completion dates than the one.according to the schedule,hercules was to begin work on march,and finish it by june.that did not happen.hercules began work in april of,and did not finish it until january of.that completion of the work was,however,within the more lenient deadlines of the schedule.
dissatisfied with the timeliness of hercules work,harbert stopped making payments to hercules and demanded that it pay delay damages exceeding the amount due hercules on the subcontract.in response,on january,hercules filed a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association,seeking to recover the balance due on the subcontract,other damages,interest,and attorney fees.harbert counterclaimed for delay damages,acceleration costs,miscellaneous back charges,interest,and attorney fees.
the arbitration proceedings took place on seven days in february and may as is customary in construction industry arbitrations,the parties decided not to have a court reporter take down the proceedings.we can,however,tell from the parties briefs and statements during oral argument in this court what their principal positions and arguments were in those proceedings.
we know that the main disagreement of the parties was about which of harbert two progress schedules applied to hercules.hercules took the position that the only one that applied to it was the schedule,which contained deadlines it had met.the several arguments hercules made in support of this position included one that the subcontract language was ambiguous because it referred to both a progress schedule and project schedule,but did not define either term.hercules argued that the subcontract provisions had to be interpreted in light of an implied element of reasonableness.it also argued that harbert had abandoned the schedule thereby authorizing hercules to perform in accordance with the schedule.additionally,hercules presented evidence that it did not have notice of the schedule at the time it began work on the project.
harbert,on the other hand,contended that the subcontract language unambiguously gave it complete authority to set the schedule which would mean that hercules was bound by the schedule.harbert asserted that the schedule was the progress schedule referred to in the subcontract because it was the only schedule harbert issued to all of its subcontractors.
after considering the parties opposing arguments and a voluminous record,the arbitrator issued his award of arbitrator on september.that award denied hercules delay damages claim,denied all of harbert counterclaims,denied both parties claims for attorney fees,and awarded hercules,representing the subcontract balance and the interest on that sum.because the award,not counting interest,was nearly less than the amount the parties had agreed was the subcontract balance,hercules believed that the arbitrator had made a scrivener or mathematical error.it submitted a request for clarification which pointed out the problem.
harbert moved for clarification and modification of the award but on different grounds.harbert motion pointed out that the award did not contain the specificity the parties had agreed they needed,and it requested that the arbitrator modify it to provide enough discussion on each of the six issues for decision that had been identified by the parties to enable them to understand the result and the arbitrator reasons for granting or denying any specific item of damages.the first of those six issues was what was the schedule to which hercules was bound under its subcontract with harbert 
on october,the arbitrator issued his disposition for application of of the award,a decision document which corrected the scrivener error by increasing the award from to.the document also revealed the arbitrator findings on the six issues,stating in answer to the first one that hercules was contractually bound to the more generous project schedule submitted to the corps of engineers which was used to build the project the schedule not the sixteen week schedule unilaterally set by harbert the schedule.the arbitrator stated in answer to another of the six issues that harbert was not entitled to any damages because t he delay and acceleration damages are necessarily dependent on the claimed project schedule which has been found not applicable.
on november,harbert filed in the district court a motion to vacate the arbitration award,contending that the arbitrator rationale reflected a manifest disregard of the applicable law.hercules opposed harbert motion with one of its own,asking the court to confirm the award pursuant to.
on february,the district court entered an order denying harbert motion to vacate the award and granting hercules motion to confirm it.while there was no transcript of the arbitration hearing,the district court had before it the pre and briefs that both parties had submitted to the arbitrator,and an affidavit from harbert lead attorney during the arbitration proceeding.a copy of that affidavit is not in the record on appeal,and harbert has made no effort to inform us of its contents.
the district court interpreted the arbitrator award and his disposition of harbert motion as concluding that the reason hercules conduct did not breach the subcontract is that it was bound by the schedule not the schedule.the court noted that the arbitrator had before him evidence of the schedule and some evidence that it had been sent to hercules before the subcontract was signed.finding no evidence of manifest disregard for the law,the court on that basis distinguished this case from montes shearson lehman,cir.as a result,the court entered judgment enforcing the arbitration award.
unhappy with the district court judgment,as it had been with the arbitrator decision,harbert filed a notice of appeal and a motion for stay of the judgment pending appeal.the district court granted the stay,and we now decide the appeal.
judicial review of commercial arbitration awards is narrowly limited under the federal arbitration act.see.the faa presumes the confirmation of arbitration awards,see davis prudential,cir lifecare int l,cd,cir,and federal courts should defer to an arbitrator decision whenever possible,robbins day,cir.the faa sets out four narrow bases for vacating an award,none of which are even remotely applicable in this case 
in addition to those four statutory grounds for vacatur,we have said that there are three grounds.an award may be vacated if it is arbitrary and capricious,ainsworth skurnick,cir,if enforcement of the award is contrary to public policy,delta air lines,air line pilots ass n,int l,cir,or if the award was made in manifest disregard for the law,montes,at.
harbert challenge to the arbitrator award rests solely on its contention that the arbitrator acted in manifest disregard of the law.this ground for vacating an arbitration award requires clear evidence that the arbitrator was conscious of the law and deliberately ignore d it.montes,at.a showing that the arbitrator merely misinterpreted,misstated,or misapplied the law is insufficient.id.at.we review de novo the district court legal conclusions on this issue.peebles merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.
this court first adopted manifest disregard for the law as a basis for challenging an arbitration award in the montes case.at.it remains the only case in which we have ever found the exceptional circumstances that satisfy the exacting requirements of this exception.see,universal constructors,cir w e have no indication of the arbitrators reasons for their award,and thus,we have no reason to believe that they disregarded the law in doing it brown itt consumer fin,cir even if the arbitrator applied the wrong legal standard,appellant did not show that that this alleged error was intentional or that the arbitrator made a conscious decision not to follow the appropriate legal standard.scott prudential,cir appellant arguments did not approach the type of disregard for the law that we found in montes and the record and briefs showed nothing more than a disagreement over the application of the law not its manifest disregard.
the montes litigation arose out of a dispute between an employer and employee about overtime pay.see montes,at.the controlling law,the fair labor standards act,was against the employer position,and during the arbitration proceedings its attorney repeatedly urged the arbitrators to disregard the requirements of the act and rule for the employer on the basis of equitable considerations.id.at.he told the arbitrators that you as an arbitrator are not guided strictly to follow case law precedent you can also do what fair and just and equitable and that is what my client is asking you to do in this case.id.instead of contending that the law could be applied favorably to his client position,the attorney argued to the arbitrators that in this case this law is not right,and t he law says one thing.what equity demands and requires and is saying is another.id.he explicitly asked the arbitrators not to follow the law.id.thus,as i said in my answer,as i said before in my opening,and i now ask you in my closing,not to follow the flsa if you determine that she not an exempt employee.
the arbitrators in montes found in favor of the employer,and in their award they repeated the plea of the employer attorney that they disregard the law.id.at.there was nothing in the transcript of the proceedings or the award itself to indicate that the arbitrators had not heeded that plea,and the evidence and law did not support the award.id.at.
in holding that the arbitrators had acted in manifest disregard of the law in montes,we disavowed any notion that an arbitrator decision can be reviewed on the basis that its conclusion or reasoning is legally erroneous.id.at accord id.at this does not mean that arbitrators can be reversed for errors or misinterpretations of law.and we emphasized the rare nature of the circumstances in that case.id.at.four facts came together in montes and will seldom recur 
those facts are that the party who obtained the favorable award had conceded to the arbitration panel that its position was not supported by the law,which required a different result,and had urged the panel not to follow the law that blatant appeal to disregard the law was explicitly noted in the arbitration panel award neither in the award itself nor anywhere else in the record is there any indication that the panel disapproved or rejected the suggestion that it rule contrary to law and the evidence to support the award is at best marginal.
id.at carnes,concurring.
while montes shows the exception,the rule is shown in every other case where we have decided if the arbitration loser had established manifest disregard of the law.in all of those other cases the loser in arbitration was the loser in our decision.see peebles,at cir.commons,at brown,at scott,at.
the facts of this case do not come within shouting distance of the montes exception.this is a typical contractual dispute in which the parties disagree about the meaning of terms of their agreement.there are arguments to be made on both sides of the contractual interpretation issue,and they were made to the arbitrator before being made to the district court and then to us.even if we were convinced that we would have decided this contractual dispute differently,that would not be nearly enough to set aside the award.see peebles,at a litigant arguing that an arbitrator acted in manifest disregard of the law must show something more than a misinterpretation,misstatement,or misapplication of the law.brown,at arbitration awards will not be reversed due to an erroneous interpretation of law by the arbitrator.montes,at an arbitration board that incorrectly interprets the law has not manifestly disregarded it.it has simply made a legal mistake.
harbert argument that the arbitration award clearly contradicts an express term of the contract is simply another way of saying that the arbitrator clearly erred,and even a showing of a clear error on the part of the arbitrator is not enough.the arbitration loser must establish more than that in order to have the award set aside,the more being that the arbitrator actually recognized a clear rule of law and deliberately chose to ignore it.peebles,at a manifest disregard for the law involves a conscious and deliberate decision to ignore the applicable law.id.at at most,the arbitration panel may have misunderstood the effect and weight to be given to cases cited by the parties.on the record before us,we can not find proof that the arbitrators recognized a clear rule of law and chose to ignore it.therefore,we can not find that the arbitrators acted in manifest disregard for the law.commons,at w e can not find proof that the arbitrato
