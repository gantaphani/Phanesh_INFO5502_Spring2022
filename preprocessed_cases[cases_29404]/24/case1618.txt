based on these provisions,homefirst petitioned to compel arbitration.plaintiffs opposed the petition on the ground that the underlying loan documents were unconscionable.the trial court ruled that the arbitration provisions within the loan documents were unconscionable pursuant to the filed decision of the supreme court in armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,armendariz.homefirst moved for reconsideration on the ground that the parties had not been given an opportunity to brief the question whether justification exists for the lack of mutuality in the arbitration agreement.the trial court then granted reconsideration but ruled that homefirst had failed to demonstrate a justification,and the court again denied the petition to compel arbitration.

collateral estoppel 
plaintiffs argue that homefirst is collaterally estopped to deny the unconscionability of the arbitration provisions by virtue of the judgment,affirmed by us on appeal,in san mateo county public guardian transamerica homefirst,et,nonpub.opn.reverse mortgage cases.we disagree.
one who was not a party to a former judgment may indeed invoke the doctrine of collateral estoppel against one who was a party to the former judgment.witkin,cal.procedure ed.judgment.however,the doctrine of collateral estoppel bars litigation of an issue already decided by a prior judgment only if the issue previously decided is identical to the one which is sought to be relitigated.amador unemployment ins.appeals bd.cal d.i f the very same facts and no others are involved in the second case,the prior judgment will be conclusive as to the same legal issues which appear,assuming no intervening doctrinal change.but if the relevant facts in the two cases are separable,even though they be similar or identical,collateral estoppel does not govern the legal issues which recur in the second case.thus,the second proceeding may involve an instrument or transaction identical with,but in a form separable from,the one dealt with in the first proceeding.in that situation,a court is free in the second proceeding to make an independent examination of the legal matters at issue.it may then reach a different result or,if consistency in decision is considered just and desirable,reliance may be placed upon the ordinary rule of stare decisis.before a party can invoke the collateral estoppel doctrine in these circumstances,the legal matter raised in the second proceeding must involve the same set of events or documents and the same bundle of legal principles that contributed to the rendering of the first judgment.commissioner sunnen.income tax for different years,italics and fn.omitted accord younger jensen cal d,subpoena served on different company.
although the legal principles applicable to the issues in the present case are the same as those underlying the judgment in the reverse mortgage cases,the facts are not.the loan agreement and deed of trust involved here were signed by different parties under different circumstances.despite virtually identical language,the documents and the loan transactions in the reverse mortgage cases are separate from those involved here.in light of the obvious similarity of the circumstances,we might have relied upon our opinion in the reverse mortgage cases under the doctrine of stare decisis.rule a of the california rules of court,however,precludes our reliance
