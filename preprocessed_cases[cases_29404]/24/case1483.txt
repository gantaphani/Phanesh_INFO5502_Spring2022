this is a declaratory relief action.the plaintiff,national casualty company national,appeals from a judgment in favor of sovereign general insurance services,sovereign,national insured under a policy of errors and omissions insurance.the policy is a policy.the policy period was august,to august.
the policy covered sovereign for its actual or alleged negligent acts,errors or omissions,libel,slander,or invasion of privacy,provided the claim for such act s was made within the policy period and was brought in the united states,puerto rico,or canada.
sovereign was authorized to issue certificates of insurance by certain underwriters at lloyd london lloyd and to process claims for lloyd.on march,attorneys for lloyd sent a letter to sovereign at its offices in stockton,california,asserting that sovereign underwriting and claims handling activities engaged in pursuant to agreements between lloyd and sovereign,had caused lloyd to suffer losses,and that lloyd intended to recover such losses from sovereign.sovereign submitted the claim to national.the letter was sent during the policy period and national does not dispute that the letter constituted a claim made during the policy period for the purpose of determining coverage.
the agreements between sovereign and lloyd provided for mandatory arbitration in london,england,of any disputes arising out of the agreements.slightly less than three years after lloyd sent sovereign its first letter demanding payment of its losses,and two years after this declaratory relief action was commenced,lloyd instituted arbitration proceedings in london against sovereign to recover its alleged losses.
the issue on appeal is whether the claim made against sovereign during the policy period was also first brought within the united states,puerto rico or canada national argues the only way to bring a claim is to file or institute some sort of legal action and,since the legal action the arbitration was filed in london,the claim was not brought within the coverage territory of the policy.however,the term claim is defined in the policy as a demand or assertion of a legal right seeking damages and includes,but is not limited to,an arbitration proceeding.
we shall conclude the term claim first brought is ambiguous,but the reasonable interpretation of the term in light of the policy as a whole is that a claim is first brought at the place where it is first tendered or made.this reading is consistent with the fact that otherwise the majority of sovereign business would not be covered by the insurance it purchased.
we shall affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
national issued a wholesaler,underwriting manager and managing general agent errors and omissions liability policy policy to sovereign.sovereign was a licensed surplus lines broker although the policy appears to have been issued on october,the policy period,the provision determining period of coverage,was from august,to august.
the policy stated that coverage was on a claims made basis.coverage applies only to those claims that are first made during the policy period and any extended reporting period.under the heading where and when we insure and the where we insure the policy stated this policy applies to a wrongful act commit t ed anywhere in the world provided that the claim is first brought in the united states of america including its territories and possessions,puerto rico or canada.under the when we insure the policy states this policy applies when a written claim is first made against any of you during the policy period or during any extended reporting period.
the term claim is defined by the policy to mean a demand or assertion of a legal right seeking damages made against any of you.a claim includes an arbitration proceeding to which any of you is required to submit or to which any of you has submitted with our consent.
prior to the issuance of the policy,sovereign submitted an application for insurance to national.in response to the question whether sovereign had ever placed any business with an insurer domiciled outside the united states,sovereign replied it had placed million of volume with lloyd.the total volume sovereign reported was.
sovereign entered into several agreements with lloyd pursuant to which sovereign was authorized to issue certificates of insurance and to process claims for lloyd.the agreements contained a territorial limitation,which provided the insureds under the policies issued by sovereign had to be domiciled in the united states.
the agreements also contained an arbitration clause requiring that arbitration of all matters arising under,out of or in connection with the agreements take place in london and be conducted in accordance with the laws of england.
on march,attorneys for lloyd sent a letter to sovereign referencing six of the agreements between lloyd and sovereign,and asserting that lloyd had suffered loss as a result of sovereign breach of the agreements.the letter put sovereign on notice of lloyd intention to recover all losses arising as a result of sovereign actions consequently,the letter continued,you should notify your professional indemnity insurer s immediately.the letter was sent from the office of lloyd attorneys in london.it was addressed to sovereign offices in stockton,california.
approximately one year later,lloyd attorneys sent another letter to sovereign.the letter referenced the arbitration clause in the agreements between lloyd and sovereign,and demanded arbitration of the contested agreements.a few days later,attorneys for lloyd sent another letter demanding the sum of million dollars to settle the claim.the letter was sent from the attorneys los angeles office.
on may,national sent a letter advising sovereign it would agree to provide a defense with respect to the lloyd claim,subject to a reservation of rights.in the letter,national acknowledged that the march,letter might constitute the foundational claim.however,national maintained that the march,letter also might represent a claim brought outside the territorial limits of the policy.national said it was of no import that one of the claim letters had been sent from the attorneys los angeles office,because the policy provided that in the event multiple claims arose from the same wrongful act,the claim would be deemed to have been made on the date of the first written claim involving the wrongful act 
national brought a complaint for declaratory relief on june.in the complaint,national conceded that the march,correspondence from lloyd attorneys to sovereign in stockton constituted the foundational claim,but alleged there was no coverage available under national policy because the letter constituted an extraterritorial claim.the complaint alleged,f urthermore,that the source of the second claim letter dated march,was leboeuf lamb lloyd attorneys los angeles office has no import.the policy provides in pertinent part that all claims arising from the same wrongful act or interrelated wrongful acts will be deemed to have been made on the earlier of the following dates the date the first of those written claims involving the same wrongful act or a wrongful act in a series of interrelated wrongful acts is first made against any of you thus,the march,letter involves the same wrongful act or wrongful act in a series of interrelated wrongful acts,that was referenced in the march,claim letter.
national took the position in its reservation of rights letter and complaint that the claim was brought outside the united states because it was contained in a letter sent from london.however,it argued at trial that the phrase provided that the claim is first brought in the has a special meaning in the insurance industry.it argued the phrase means that a legal proceeding must be initiated within the specified territory.the trial court disagreed.
following the trial court decision,national moved for a new trial.the trial court denied the motion for new trial and entered judgment in favor of sovereign.this appeal followed.
discussion 
national does not dispute that the claim was made when lloyd sent the march,letter to sovereign at its offices in stockton,california,during the policy period.national also has apparently abandoned the argument set forth in its reservation of rights letter and complaint that the claim was brought outside the united states because the march,letter from lloyd attorneys was sent from london.the only argument it makes on appeal is that claim first brought,contained in the where we insure provision of the policy,refers to the filing of a formal legal action,and since the arbitration in this matter was commenced in london,the claim was first brought outside the united states

we shall determine that the interpretation national urges is not a reasonable one,and that the judgment should be affirmed.
a.the purpose of the territorial limitation is unclear 
national concedes the when we insure provisions of its policy were met.the policy applied when a claim,which the policy defined as a demand or assertion of a legal right including an arbitration proceeding seeking damages against sovereign,was first made during the policy period.the policy stated that a claim was first made when it was first received by sovereign the policy period was from august,to august.thus,the claim was first made when sovereign received the march,letter from lloyd attorneys at its offices in stockton,california.
national argues,however,that a claim is not brought at the same time it is made.it asserts there is only one reasonable interpretation of when a claim is first brought,and that is when a lawsuit or other formal legal proceeding is first initiated against the insured.national argues the only claim that was brought in this case was the arbitration proceeding that was initiated in london,outside the territorial limitations of the policy.
citing couch on insurance ed section,page,national claims the purpose of the territorial condition is to prevent insurers from having to contend with lawsuits initiated in countries in which both the legal systems and social norms that they influence may be drastically different than in the location where the policy was written.however,this section of couch on insurance does not deal with the type of policy at issue here,but with the geographic restrictions on the place a covered event occurs that are found in automobile liability insurance policies.the entire quote states one obvious reason for this is that the risks of operating a motor vehicle,whether the coverage be liability,theft,or collision,can vary significantly from one location to another.this is particularly true in terms of foreign countries in which both the legal systems and the social norms that they influence may be drastically different than in the location where the policy was written.couch on insurance,supra.
the reasons for including a territorial or geographic limitation on the operation of an automobile in an automobile liability policy are not necessarily the same as the reasons for the territorial limitation in the errors and omissions policy before us.in the former,the insurer is attempting to limit coverage because the risk insured operating the vehicle is less discernible in a foreign country.in this case,the risk insured a wrongful act committed by sovereign does not vary from place to place.even if it did,the policy expressly covers a wrongful act committed anywhere in the world.
national does not tell us what the mutual intent of the parties or even what its own unilateral intent was in limiting coverage to claims first brought in the united states,puerto rico,or canada,and the accepted reasons for including a territorial limitation clause in an automobile liability policy are not present here.moreover,the facts of this case make it particularly difficult to believe that the parties intended claim first brought to mean the filing of a formal legal action.the majority of sovereign business was contracted through lloyd and sovereign agreement with lloyd contained an arbitration clause mandating that all disputes be arbitrated in london.it would have been wholly unreasonable for sovereign to pay for a policy that failed to cover the majority of its business out of million dollars.
b.the phrase claim first brought is ambiguous 
national points to the definition of claim as set forth in the policy,emphasizing that it includes both written demands and formal legal actions such as arbitrations.citing language from employers reinsurance phoenix insurance d.employers,national argues the only reasonable interpretation of the term claim in the context of the territorial condition is a formal legal proceeding against the insured.national points to the distinction employers made between claims made and suits brought to support its argument that the bringing of a claim requires the filing of a formal legal action.
however,the definition of claim in the policy is not limited to a legal proceeding.it applies both to the claims made and claims brought provisions of the policy.it does not use terms exclusively applying to the institution of a legal proceeding.it applies to any demand or assertion of a legal right,plainly including matters broader than the institution of a legal proceeding,consistent with its application to both the claims first made and claims first brought provisions.
in employers,the pertinent policy language was contained in an attorney professional liability policy that provided coverage if a claim is made or suit is brought against the insured during the policy period employers,supra,d at.the court had to determine whether the policy provided coverage where a lawsuit was filed within the policy period,but the insured did not receive notice of the lawsuit until after the expiration of the policy period.id.at.the insurer argued the term suit brought meant not only the filing of a lawsuit,but also the receipt of notice of the lawsuit.id.at.the insurer relied on hoyt paul fire and marine ins.cir hoyt,in which the court held that a letter requesting information was not a claim for purposes of a claims made professional liability policy.employers,supra,d at.hoyt said that a claim as contemplated by the policy was something in the nature of a demand or notice.ibid.
employers refuted the insurer argument that the bringing of a suit necessarily signified the receipt of summons or other process.employers,supra,d at.it was in this context that the court stated by use of the disjunctive or it is apparent that the terms claim is made and suit is brought are not one and the same.furthermore,if phoenix had intended for the term suit is brought to mean both the filing of a lawsuit and receipt of notice,it could have so specified in the policy.in addition,there is an inherent difference between the making of a claim and the bringing of a laws
