defendants and appellants pacificare of california,and pacificare health systems,appeal from a trial court order denying their petition to compel arbitration in a lawsuit filed by plaintiff and respondent donald imbler.we affirm the order.
factual and procedural history 
on july,plaintiff filed a complaint for damages against defendants pacificare of california,and pacificare health systems,collectively pacificare.
the complaint alleged as follows plaintiff had developed prostate cancer.plaintiff doctors recommended that he undergo proton beam therapy.because plaintiff employer was in the process of changing health plans and entering into a new contract with pacificare,plaintiff asked pacificare if it would cover the therapy.pacificare told plaintiff that the therapy would be covered.plaintiff subsequently enrolled in the pacificare plan,but pacificare denied coverage for the therapy.plaintiff complained to the california department of managed health care department.when the department submitted an inquiry to pacificare,pacificare advised the department that it would cover the therapy.thereafter,plaintiff received the therapy but pacificare then refused,and continues to refuse,to pay for the treatment.based upon these allegations,plaintiff asserted causes of action for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,breach of contract,unfair business practices under business and professions code section,intentional misrepresentation and negligent infliction of emotional distress.
on august,pacificare filed a notice of petition and petition to compel arbitration and for stay of proceedings hereafter petition.on november,the trial court denied the petition.pacificare appeals.
on appeal,pacificare raises two issues 
whether health and safety code section section is preempted by the federal arbitration act faa,or whether it is saved from preemption by the act.
assuming arguendo that section applies,whether pacificare plan documents comply with the disclosure requirements imposed by section.
i.the faa does not preempt section 
we first address preemption.based on a recent case on point,smith pacificare we conclude that the faa does not preempt section by operation of the act.
background 
pacificare is a licensed heath care service plan.in a declaration filed in support of pacificare petition,it stated pacificare is licensed in accordance with the health care service plan act of,as amended,cal.health safety code section et.pacificare is a health care service plan that arranges for and facilitates the provision of health services for employer groups with which they contract.
in california,health care service plans or hmo are licensed and regulated by the department of managed care under the act.one of the provisions of the act is section it provides that a health care service plan that includes terms requiring binding arbitration to settle disputes,or providing for a waiver of the right to a jury trial,shall include the terms requiring binding arbitration as set forth under section.
pacificare contends that section does not apply because it is preempted by the faa.the faa applies to any contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce which contains an arbitration clause.section of the faa provides that arbitration provisions shall be enforced,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.ibid.thus,a state court may,without violating section,refuse to enforce an arbitration clause on the basis of generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability.doctor associates,casarotto,d,casarotto.critically,however,a state court may not defeat an arbitration clause by applying state laws applicable only to arbitration provisions.ibid.
in erickson aetna health plans of california,we held that section was preempted by the faa.we noted that section imposes on arbitration clauses in health care plans a special notice requirement not applicable to contracts generally,and such arbitration clauses must satisfy special requirements as to form and content which are not imposed on contracts generally.hence,section takes its meaning precisely from the fact that a contract to arbitrate is at issue,and,consequently,conflicts with section of the faa.
in smith,the second appellate district,division three,recognized that t he faa would appear to apply to the pacificare agreements at issue here.smith,however,took the analysis one step further.smith analyzed the act and held that the faa can not preempt section because of the operation of the act.erickson did not address the act 
smith decided the precise issue in this case the act precludes the preemption of section by the faa 
the smith court aptly described the act as follows 
congress enacted in it sets forth a policy declaration that it is in the public interest that the primary regulation of the business of insurance be in the states,not in the national government.it was passed in response to a united states supreme court decision united states underwriters,which held that the business of insurance was commerce within the meaning of the commerce clause and therefore the business of insurance was subject to all federal laws,including those relating to antitrust.id.at.at.this was a major change in the law.in,the supreme court had held paul virginia wall,that insurance was not commerce and therefore was not subject to federal commerce clause statutes.
the clear purpose of was to abrogate this change and to insure that the states would continue to enjoy broad authority in regulating the dealings between insurers and their policyholders.italics added.cochran paco,cir.as the supreme court itself later explained,the act was passed in reaction to this court decision in united states underwriters,supra.prior to that decision,it had been assumed,in the language of the leading case,that i ssuing a policy of insurance is not a transaction of commerce.paul virginia,wall,supra.consequently,regulation of insurance transactions was thought to rest exclusively with the states.in underwriters,this court held that insurance transactions were subject to federal regulation under the commerce clause,and that the antitrust laws,in particular,were applicable to them.congress reacted quickly the act was the product of this concern.its purpose was stated quite clearly in its first section congress declared that the continued regulation and taxation by the several states of the business of insurance is in the public interest.stat,in context,however,it is relatively clear what problems congress was dealing with.under the regime of paul virginia,supra,states had a free hand in regulating the dealings between insurers and their policyholders.their negotiations,and the contract which resulted,were not considered commerce and were,therefore,left to state regulation.the underwriters decision threatened the continued supremacy of the states in this area.the act was an attempt to turn back the clock,to assure that the activities of insurance companies in dealing with their policyholders would remain subject to state regulation.sec national securities,d,national securities,italics added.
thus,there seems little question that congress,by its passage of,returned to the states the plenary power to regulate the business of insurance that they had enjoyed prior to the underwriters decision.if congress intended to invoke its commerce clause powers to occupy part of the field of insurance regulation,it would expressly say so.cochran paco,supra,at,fn.omitted.
the mandate of appears to be both plain and clear.an act of congress may not be construed to invalidate,impair,or supercede a state law enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance unless the federal act specifically relates to the business of insurance,b,italics added.there is no dispute between the parties that the application of the faa would have the effect of invalidating,impairing and superceding the operation of section indeed,it would absolutely preclude its use to regulate the wording and organization of pacificare arbitration clauses.similarly,there is no argument that the faa is a statute of general application which does not specifically relate to the business of insurance.thus,in order for us to conclude that does preclude the application of the faa in these consolidated cases we need only address the integrally related questions as to whether health care service plans,such as pacificare,are engaged in the business of insurance and whether section is a statute enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.
the smith court answered both questions in the positive.
pacificare is engaged in the business of insurance 
as to the first question,smith concluded that pacificare is engaged in the business of insurance hmo or health care service plans,such as pacificare,are engaged in providing a service that is a substitute for what previously constituted health insurance.the only distinction between an hmo and a traditional insurer is that the hmo provides medical services directly,while a traditional insurer does so indirectly by paying for the service citation,but this is a distinction without a difference.citations.in the end,hmos function the same way as a traditional health insurer.the policyholder pays a fee for a promise of medical services in the event that he should need them.it follows that hmos are in the business of insurance.citation.we believe the reasoning of these cases is sound and we have no trouble also concluding that pacificare,as a health care service plan or hmo,is engaged in the business of insurance.
moreover,smith recognized that the legislature has reached the same conclusion in a very public way.it has expressly recognized that health care service plans in california are engaged in the business of insurance within the meaning of the act.in,the legislature enacted the managed health care insurance accountability act of this statute provides a nonexclusive remedy for injuries caused by the failure of managed care entities and health care service plans to provide medically appropriate treatment to their subscribers.
in its reply brief,pacificare acknowledges that under the united states supreme court decision in rush hmos constitute a form of insurance.
rush supports the conclusion reached in smith.in rush,the supreme court stated that an hmo provides health care,and it does so as an insurer.it went on to state that the hmo could not checkmate common sense by trying to submerge hmos insurance features beneath an exclusive characterization of hmos as providers of health care.
section is a statute enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance 
as to the second question,smith concluded that section clearly purports to regulate an important aspect of the business of insurance relating to the performance and enforcement of the policy.thus,section does regulate the business of insurance within the meaning of.
in order to reach this conclusion,smith first analyzed the issue under the standard announced in sec national securities,statutes aimed at protecting or regulating the relationship between insurer and insured,directly or indirectly,are laws regulating the business of insurance within the meaning of that phrase as it is used in.national securities,supra.as the national securities court emphasized,the focus of is upon the relationship between the insurer and its policyholder.the relationship between insurer and insured,the type of policy which could be issued,its reliability,interpretation,and were the core of the business of insurance.undoubtedly,other activities of insurance companies relate so closely to their status as reliable insurers that they too must be placed in the same class.but whatever the exact scope of the statutory term,it is clear where the focus was on the relationship between the insurance company and the policyholder.id.at.at,italics added.
smith stated that s ection falls squarely within the standard announced in national securities,supra,d.it regulates the language and terms of the policies that hmo can offer in california,by requiring hmo that want to use mandatory arbitration to provide certain disclosures in the documents issued to its plan enrollees.because it defines the language that hmo must use in their plan documents,section operates directly on the relationship between the hmo and its.the disclosure requirement is plainly an effort to protect insureds,hence the state has exercised its power to protect or regulate the relationship between the hmo and its members.this is exactly what national securities says falls within the core of the business of insurance.national securities,supra,at.at.
smith next analyzed the test set forth in union labor life insurance and reached the same conclusion.based on previous supreme court decisions,the pireno court established a test to determine whether a particular practice is part of the business of insurance exempted from the antitrust laws f irst,whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder risk second,whether the practice is an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured and third,whether the practice is limited to entities within the insurance industry.the court,however,cautioned that,n one of these criteria is necessarily determinative in itself.
in fact,smith recognized that t he supreme court has recently made it clear that the pireno factors are merely considerations to be weighted in determining whether a state law regulates insurance,citation,and that n one of these criteria is necessarily determinative.unum life ins.of america ward,d,ward.
moreover,smith recognized that in department of treasury fabe the united states supreme court in pireno and its predecessor were focused on the second clause of united states code section b,which related to the narrow antitrust issue rather than the broader language of the first clause.the first clause commits laws enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance to the states,while the second clause exempts only the business of insurance itself from the antitrust laws.to equate laws enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance with the business of insurance itself,would be to read words out of the statute.fabe,supra,at.at,italics added.hence,it is unclear whether the pireno test applies in this context.pacificare contends that it does.
we need not determine whether the test applies because,as the smith court stated even accepting the contention,however,that the issue should be decided by application of the pireno factors,we believe that the facts and circumstances presented here demonstrate that those criteria are in fact sufficiently met.
as to the first prong,i t is true that section does not transfer risk.however,ward makes it clear that even if the pireno test is applied,not all three parts must be met.
as to the second prong,smith stated that because section directly regulates the words that pacificare may use in its plan if it wants to include an enforceable arbitration clause,it regulates an integral part of the policy relationship.this relates directly to the performance and enforcement of the policy,a factor of critical importance under fabe.
as to the third prong,smith stated that hmo are engaged in the business of insurance when they offer health coverage to their members,and section clearly regulates this aspect of their endeavor 
ultimately,therefore,even if the pireno test is to be applied,section meets that test as clarified and applied in ward.finally,as a simple matter of common sense,by conditioning the availability of arbitration in hmo subscriber contracts on the hmo compliance with the mandated disclosures,section regulates insurance.
we agree with the thorough reasoning set forth in smith and also conclude as follows w e conclude that pacificare is engaged in the business of insurance and section clearly purports to regulate an important aspect of that business relating to the performance and enforcement of the policy.thus,section does regulate the business of insurance within the meaning of.therefore,the faa,a federal statute of general application,which does not specifically relate to insurance,is foreclosed from application to prevent the oper
