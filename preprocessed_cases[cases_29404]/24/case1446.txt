appellants meshiel cooper traylor meshiel and her minor son craig lamar traylor craig appeal the judgment confirming an arbitration award in favor of craig former personal manager,respondent sharyn berg berg,for unpaid commissions under a contract between berg,meshiel and craig and unrepaid loans from berg because we find that craig had the statutory right as a minor to disaffirm both the original contract and the arbitration award,we reverse the judgment against craig.we affirm the judgment against meshiel.
factual and procedural 
the agreement 
on january,berg entered into a artist manager agreement agreement with meshiel and craig,who was then years old.meshiel signed the agreement and wrote craig name on the signature page where he was designated artist.craig did not sign the agreement.pursuant to the agreement,berg was to act as craig exclusive personal manager in exchange for a commission of percent of all gross monies or other consideration paid to him as an artist during the term of the agreement,as well as income from merchandising or promotional efforts or offers of employment made during the term of the agreement,regardless of when craig received such monies.the agreement expressly provided that any action craig may take in the future pertaining to disaffirmance of this agreement,whether successful or not,would not affect meshiel liability for any commissions due berg.the agreement also provided that any disputes concerning payment or interpretation of the agreement would be determined by arbitration in accordance with the rules of judicial arbitration and mediation services,jams.
termination of the agreement 
on or about june,craig obtained a recurring acting role on the fox television network show malcolm in the middle show.on september,four months prior to the expiration of the agreement,meshiel sent a certified letter to berg stating that while she and craig appreciated her advice and guidance,they no longer needed her management services and could no longer afford to pay berg her percent commission because they owed a huge amount of taxes.on september,berg responded,informing appellants that they were in breach of the agreement.
the lawsuit 
in,berg filed suit against meshiel and craig for breach of the agreement,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,breach of an oral loan agreement,conversion and declaratory relief.in july,the law firm of white curry avanzado represented meshiel and craig when the parties stipulated to submit the matter to binding arbitration before jams.but in november,the trial court granted that firm motion to withdraw due to appellants refusal to pay legal fees or communicate with the firm.
the arbitration 
the arbitration hearing was originally scheduled for december.in order to accommodate meshiel hospitalization for the premature delivery of her third child and to give appellants time to find new counsel,jams continued the hearing to february.in the meantime,appellants second counsel,the law firm of cohen gardner,represented appellants in unsuccessful settlement negotiations.
the arbitration hearing commenced on february.because appellants had failed to pay their share of the arbitration fees,berg did not anticipate their appearance and did not retain a court reporter.though meshiel and craig counsel failed to appear at the hearing,meshiel personally appeared with craig talent agent,steven rice.craig did not appear.according to meshiel,the arbitrator denied her request for a continuance.the arbitrator permitted meshiel to use rice assistance and advice in presenting her case.rice asserted that the agreement was invalid because craig was a minor at the time it was executed and there had been no court approval of the agreement.
the arbitration award 
on february,the arbitrator issued his award,which was served on the parties on february.noting that craig had not appeared at the hearing despite personal service of summons and notice from jams,the arbitrator stated that the award was issued against him through and default as provided for in the jams rules incorporated by reference after briefly summarizing the testimonial and documentary evidence presented,the arbitrator found that berg had proven her case by a preponderance of the evidence and reiterated that craig did not appear at the arbitration and the award of the undersigned is made on the basis of the evidence produced during the and is deemed a default judgment.the arbitrator awarded berg commissions and interest of,repayment of personal loans and interest of,and attorney fees and costs of.he also awarded berg for future earnings projected on a minimum of years for national syndication earnings,and stated that this part of the award would vest and become final,as monies earned after february,become due and payable.on february,the arbitrator served a clarification of the award,stating that all monies earned by craig traylor,pursuant to the contract with berg,are paid directly to berg after deduction of fees and commissions,the balance of the funds shall be forwarded to the client.
stipulated order 
following issuance of the arbitration award,appellants hired their third counsel,the law firm of white bordy levey.the parties then entered into a stipulated order signed by the court in march,which contained the following provisions appellants would pay berg plus percent of compensation earned by craig on the show until the award was satisfied and thereafter percent of all future compensation related to the show the award of unpaid commissions could not be reduced below and the award of attorney fees and costs could not be modified appellants could only seek an adjustment of the amount of the award if they disclosed all of craig earnings from the show with verified declarations and the arbitration award would be treated as final for all purposes until the parties agreed on any correction to the award or the arbitrator recalculated the commissions and interest due.pursuant to the stipulated order,appellants counsel directed fox television network to pay berg,and meshiel signed an authorization re payment to this effect on behalf of craig as his legal guardian.
petitions to confirm and vacate the arbitration award 
after appellants third counsel filed a motion to withdraw in june on the grounds that appellants refused to follow legal advice,pay legal fees or communicate with them,meshiel and her counsel filed a substitution of attorney on july,indicating that meshiel was representing herself.the substitution of attorney did not address craig representation.
on july,berg served a petition to confirm the arbitration award,which was filed on july.the petition sought confirmation of the award and a judgment entered thereon,together with a permanent injunction i prohibiting defendants from accepting compensation for malcolm in the middle and ii requiring defendants to direct all malcolm in the middle payors to pay all compensation directly into berg counsel client trust account for distribution to defendants after deduction of monies owed to berg.
on august,the law offices of robert pafundi substituted in as appellants fourth counsel.the same day,appellants filed a notice of disaffirmance of arbitration award by minor,which stated that in addition to his disaffirmance of the agreement on september,craig was also disaffirming the arbitration award and all other proceedings and orders arising out of the parties dispute,including the stipulation to submit the action to binding arbitration and the march stipulated order following the arbitration.also on that day,appellants filed a notice of intention to file documents in opposition to petition to confirm arbitration award and to file petition to vacate arbitration award.
on august,appellants filed a seeking to vacate the arbitration award.the petition to vacate was based primarily on the grounds that craig had exercised his statutory right to disaffirm both the original agreement with berg and the arbitration award and that berg was illegally practicing as an unlicensed talent agent.following a hearing,the trial court took the matter under submission and the next day issued an order denying the petition to vacate the arbitration award as untimely and granting berg petition to confirm the award.thereafter,the trial court entered a judgment in favor of berg consistent with the arbitrator award.
appellants then filed a motion to vacate the judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section.while the motion was pending,appellants filed a notice of appeal from the judgment.in a january order,the trial court determined that it had no jurisdiction to rule on the matter in light of the appeal and ordered the motion off calendar.
discussion 
simply stated,one who provides a minor with goods and services does so at her own risk.goldberg superior court th,d.the agreement here expressly contemplated this risk,requiring that meshiel remain obligated for commissions due under the agreement regardless of whether craig disaffirmed the agreement.thus,we have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that craig is permitted to and did disaffirm the agreement and any obligations stemming therefrom,while meshiel remains liable under the agreement and resulting judgment.where our difficulty lies is in understanding how counsel,the arbitrator and the trial court repeatedly and systematically ignored craig interests in this matter.from the time meshiel signed the agreement,her interests were not aligned with craig.that no,the arbitrator or the trial this conflict and sought appointment of a guardian ad litem for craig is nothing short of stunning.it is the court responsibility to protect the rights of a minor who is a litigant in court.williams superior court th,d.
standard of review.
our review of an arbitrator award is generally limited.in aguilar lerner cal th,d,aguilar,the supreme court stated when parties choose to forgo the traditional court system and arbitrate their claims,it is assumed they wish to have a final and conclusive resolution of their dispute.the legislature has recognized this underlying assumption of finality and has,by statute,limited the grounds for judicial review of an arbitrator award.code civ.consistent with this legislative intent,we recognized the general rule that an arbitrator decision can not be reviewed for errors of fact or law.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,moncharsh.we explained that because the legislature has provided certain statutory grounds to overturn or modify an arbitrator decision,courts should not subject such decisions to standard judicial review.id.at,d.in addition,however,to the statutory grounds for vacating an arbitrator award,we explained in moncharsh that there may be some limited and exceptional circumstances justifying judicial review of an arbitrator decision such cases would include those in which granting finality to an arbitrator decision would be inconsistent with the protection of a party statutory rights.id.at,d,italics added.although appellants cite neither aguilar nor moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,this exception appears to be the primary basis on which appellants rely in seeking judicial relief from the arbitrator award.
ii.the judgment is reversed as to the minor.
the trial court denied appellants petition to vacate the arbitration award on the ground that it was untimely.code of civil procedure section provides that a petition to vacate or correct an arbitration award must be served and filed no later than days after the date of service of a signed copy of the award on the petitioner.code of civil procedure section provides that a response to a petition to confirm an award must be served and filed within days after service of the petition.here,the arbitration award was served on february,and the clarification of the award was served on february.berg petition to confirm the award was served on july,and filed on july.it is undisputed that by the time appellants fourth and current counsel substituted into the action and thereafter filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award and response to the petition to confirm it on august,both of these statutory deadlines had passed.
appellants contend that despite the lapse of these deadlines,craig had the statutory right as a minor to disaffirm both the original agreement with berg containing the arbitration provision and the arbitration award itself.we agree.craig minority status entitled him to disaffirm the agreement and his minority status coupled with the absence of the appointment of guardian ad litem entitled him to disaffirm the arbitration award and judgment even after the statutory deadline for moving to vacate the arbitration award had passed.
disaffirmance of the agreement.
as a general proposition,parental consent is required for the provision of services to minors for the simple reason that minors may disaffirm their own contracts to acquire such services.ballard anderson cal d.according to family code section,a minor may make a contract in the same manner as an adult,subject to the power of disaffirmance provided by family code section.in turn,family code section states except as otherwise provided by statute,a contract of a minor may be disaffirmed by the minor before majority or within a reasonable time afterwards or,in case of the minor death within that period,by the minor heirs or personal representative.sound policy considerations support this provision the law shields minors from their lack of judgment and experience and under certain conditions vests in them the right to disaffirm their contracts.although in many instances such disaffirmance may be a hardship upon those who deal with an infant,the right to avoid his contracts is conferred by law upon a minor for his protection against his own improvidence and the designs of others.it is the policy of the law to protect a minor against himself and his indiscretions and immaturity as well as against the machinations of other people and to discourage adults from contracting with an infant.any loss occasioned by the disaffirmance of a minor contract might have been avoided by declining to enter into the contract.niemann deverich d,accord burnand irigoyen cal d.
berg offers two reasons why the plain language of family code section is inapplicable,neither of which we find persuasive.first,she argues that a minor may not disaffirm an agreement signed by a parent.she relies on two cases to support her position,both of which are inapposite because they address discrete public policy concerns not at issue here.in doyle giuliucci cal d,the court rejected a minor attempt to disaffirm a healthcare contract containing an arbitration provision signed by the minor father.the court explained that a minor statutory power to disaffirm a contract does not apply to contracts between adults and is therefore not controlling on the question of a parent power to bind his child to arbitrate by entering into a contract of which the child is a third party beneficiary.id.at.the court found compelling reasons for recognizing that the power to enter into a contract for medical care that binds the child to arbitrate any dispute arising thereunder is implicit in a parent right and duty to provide for the care of his child.id.at,see also pietrelli peacock th,d a parent power to bind a minor child to arbitration of claims arising from the minor health care contract is implied from the parent duties and rights as the child guardian.because it was unlikely that medical groups would contract directly with minors who could disaffirm their own contracts to pay for medical services,minors could therefore only be assured of the benefits of a group medical service if their parents contracted on their behalf.ibid.moreover,the arbitration provision did not unreasonably restrict a minor rights,for it does no more than specify a forum for the settlement of disputes.doyle giuliucci,supra,at.
here,in contrast,craig was not a third party beneficiary of the agreement signed by his mother,but a principal.moreover,there are no compelling reasons justifying binding craig to the agreement.an agreement for personal management services does not implicate a parent fundamental duty to provide for the care and health of a child.further,because there is a statutory procedure governing contracts in which minors agree
