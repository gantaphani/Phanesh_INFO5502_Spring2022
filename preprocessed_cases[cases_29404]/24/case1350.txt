a dispute arose between plaintiffs adam and joy toal and defendants valere and helen tardif each couple attorney signed a stipulation to resolve the dispute through private arbitration.although the parties themselves did not sign the stipulation,the document stated the attorneys signatures were for their clients.
arbitration ensued.the arbitrator entered an award in plaintiffs favor.plaintiffs petitioned the court for confirmation of the arbitration award.they attached a copy of the arbitration stipulation to their petition,but presented no evidence that defendants had consented to or ratified the stipulation.the court granted plaintiffs petition to confirm the award and entered judgment accordingly.
defendants challenge the judgment confirming the arbitration award.plaintiffs,contending the court erred in denying them an award of postarbitration attorney fees.
we reverse the judgment because plaintiffs failed to prove a basic prerequisite of private arbitration,the existence of a valid arbitration agreement.the signature of defendants attorney on the arbitration stipulation,standing alone,did not constitute substantial evidence that defendants agreed to arbitrate the dispute.plaintiffs is dismissed as moot.
plaintiffs bought a house from defendants and subsequently sued them for breach of contract,negligence,misrepresentation,and negligent misrepresentation.
defendants answered the complaint.
two months later,the attorneys for both parties advised the court they hoped to agree on a written stipulation for binding arbitration.the record does not reflect whether defendants were present at the hearing.neither attorney mentioned whether his respective clients had agreed to arbitration.
the next month,the parties attorneys and the court signed a stipulation and order for arbitration and appointment of arbitrator.neither defendants nor plaintiffs signed the stipulation,but the document signature lines stated the attorneys signatures were for their respective clients.the document stated the parties agreed that the matter would be resolved by binding arbitration and that court proceedings would be stayed pursuant to code of civil procedure section 
following arbitration,the arbitrator issued an award that stated witnesses were sworn and gave testimony at the hearing.the award does not reveal whether defendants were present or testified at the arbitration hearing the arbitrator awarded plaintiffs on their complaint,and nothing to defendants on their the arbitrator made no award of costs.
the following month,a substitution of attorney was filed substituting valere in propria persona for his former counsel,robert malin.the form was silent as to helen,who had also been represented by malin.the form was typed,had a professional appearance,and was signed by malin and valere.
plaintiffs petitioned the court to confirm the arbitration award and to enter judgment including costs and attorney fees.plaintiffs attached a copy of the arbitration stipulation to their petition,but no other evidence concerning the parties agreement to arbitrate their dispute.
valere,now in propria persona,filed a request for trial de novo after judicial arbitration.he attached his written statement,asserting he never verbally or in writing agreed to binding arbitration and that he told his attorney he did want to go to aarbitration sic but the attorney said it too late,i have already signed up for it.valere stated his blind trust in his attorney precluded him from questioning whether what the attorney said was the truth or not.although valere signed his statement,his signature was not made under penalty of perjury.he did not attach any declarations or other supporting evidence.
plaintiffs filed a response,arguing valere request for trial de novo after judicial arbitration was inapplicable because this matter was ordered into binding arbitration.plaintiffs further contended valere statement failed to give any factual or legal basis in support of any statutory ground to vacate the award.as to valere assertion he never agreed to binding arbitration,plaintiffs argued the claim was disingenuous and incredible and irrelevant to the petition to confirm or vacate the award.
the court granted plaintiffs petition for confirmation of the award.it remanded the case to the arbitrator and directed him to correct the award to include costs.the court ordered plaintiffs,upon the arbitrator issuance of a new decision,to petition to confirm the corrected award.apparently treating valere written statement as a request to vacate the award,the court denied his request for trial de novo and to vacate the award.
on remand,the arbitrator awarded costs to plaintiffs and corrected the award accordingly.
plaintiffs petitioned the court to confirm the corrected award and to enter judgment.they did not attach a copy of the arbitration stipulation to their petition,nor did they provide any evidence of its validity.
valere filed a request with the court asking it to dismiss the arbitration award.his statement alleged my attorney agreed to binding arbitration without my approval and without indicating or discussing with me what it would entail.on the first day of arbitration,when i realized what was going on,i complained to my attorney,whom i was paying and trusting to represent me in a fair way,who called me a big cry baby in his statement,valere argued section requires a court to dismiss a proceeding as to any person not bound by the arbitration award and not a party to the arbitration.valere signed his statement,but not under penalty of perjury.he attached no declarations or any other evidence.
plaintiffs filed a response to valere request to dismiss the arbitration award.they argued he failed to explain why he was not a party to the arbitration and why he should not be bound.
at the hearing on plaintiffs petition to confirm the corrected award,the court heard argument from plaintiffs counsel,then stated it would take the matter under submission.when valere attempted to address the court,the following colloquy ensued 
the court tardif,the only reason we are here is to either compel the arbitration award are not here to reargue the arbitration.you were represented by counsel.
tardif i understand that,your honor.
the court i can not revisit the arbitration.i not allowed to do that by law.the arbitration is over.i can only confirm the arbitration award.you want to talk about the fact that you are not happy with your attorney at the arbitration.i read your brief.i understand that.
the court this is the third or fourth time i have listened to you and the third or fourth time i have told you i do not have the authority to overturn an arbitration award.i are not here to determine if i can overturn the arbitration award.
in a written ruling,the court confirmed the corrected arbitration award 
valere filed a notice of appeal from the judgment confirming the arbitration award 
discussion 
appellate jurisdiction to decide the appeal from the judgment against helen 
as a preliminary matter,we must determine whether we have jurisdiction to decide the appeal purportedly taken from the judgment against helen,or whether our jurisdiction extends only over the appeal from the judgment against valere.plaintiffs contend that helen has not appealed and the judgment against her must therefore stand regardless of what this court decides in valere appeal.we disagree.
the notice of appeal is signed by valere,but the notice does not state the name of the party taking the appeal.the notice of appeal is on judicial council of california form,the first line of which has a space to fill in the name of the party appealing the judgment.the space on the notice signed by valere is neglected to fill in a name or names.thus,the notice of appeal states notice is hereby given that name appeals from the following judgment or order in this case,which was entered on date.the form then sets out a series of standard boxes whereby the appellant can indicate the nature of the judgment or order from which the appeal is taken.valere checked the box labeled judgment after court trial and the box labeled other to which he appended the description judgment after arbitration.
california rules of court,rule a provides that the appellant or the appellant attorney must sign the notice of appeal.this language has been construed,however,to allow any person,attorney or not,who is empowered to act on appellant behalf,to sign the notice of appeal.seeley seymour d.w e must conclude valere was authorized to act on behalf of helen in the absence of a clear and satisfactory showing that such authority was lacking.ibid.moreover,t he notice of appeal must be liberally construed.the notice is sufficient if it identifies the particular judgment or order being appealed.cal.rules of court,rule a.here,the notice clearly identifies the january,judgment as the judgment challenged on appeal,a judgment which,on its face,subjects both valere and helen to the same award.liberal construction of the notice of appeal,which does not expressly identify the name of the appealing party,but which does identify a judgment subjecting a husband and wife to the same award,compels our conclusion that both valere and helen have appealed.finally,no prejudice results from our liberal construction.the parties have argued the merits as to both appellants.
plaintiffs did not meet their burden of establishing an enforceable agreement for binding arbitration 
defendants contend the court erred by denying the request to vacate the arbitration award or dismiss plaintiffs petition to confirm it.they assert they were never made aware of the stipulation to submit the matter to binding arbitration and most certainly never consented to it.defendants claim valere raised this issue of his lack of consent five times in the context of the petitions he filed.relying on blanton womancare,cal d,blanton and sanker brown d.sanker,defendants argue that counsel may not waive his or her client substantial rights by entering into binding arbitration agreements without the client consent.
plaintiffs acknowledge defendants are correct that an attorney has no authority to submit his or her client to binding arbitration without that client consent.but plaintiffs contend defendants submitted no evidence that valere did not consent to binding arbitration.they argue his statements were not signed under penalty of perjury and were therefore inadmissible as evidence at a law and motion hearing.plaintiffs further contend that because the court did not issue a statement of decision,the court impliedly found defendants consented to arbitration.
on appeal from an order confirming an arbitration award,we review the trial court order not the arbitration award under a de novo standard.citations.to the extent that the trial court ruling rests upon a determination of disputed factual issues,we apply the substantial evidence test to those issues.lindenstadt staff builders,th,fn,d lindenstadt.
we divide the balance of our opinion into three sections.we first discuss the defining hallmark of private such arbitration is wholly predicated on the existence of a valid arbitration contract.we next examine a basic requirement for an enforceable arbitration each party must personally consent to or ratify the agreement.we then evaluate the court order confirming the arbitration award,with particular focus on the evidence plaintiffs presented to the court on whether defendants consented to or ratified the contract.
the requirement of a contract for private arbitration 
private arbitration also called contractual or nonjudicial arbitration is a procedure for resolving disputes which arises from contract it only comes into play when the parties to the dispute have agreed to submit to it.herman feil,design center of los angeles d.such arbitration is governed by the arbitration act et,a comprehensive,statutory scheme applicable to all written agreements to arbitrate disputes.american home assurance benowitz d.contractual arbitration awards,if valid,are presumed to be binding and final trabuco highlands community head th,d trabuco.
judicial intervention in the private arbitration process is strictly limited because the parties have agreed to bypass the judicial system moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,and submit their dispute to nonjudicial resolution by an independent third person or persons witkin,cal.procedure ed.proceedings without trial.by agreeing to arbitration,parties anticipate a relatively speedy,inexpensive and final resolution,one that may be based on broad principles of justice,rather than strictly the rule of law.moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.consequently,as a general rule courts will indulge every reasonable intendment to give effect to arbitration proceedings.marsch williams th,d.
a party may petition a court to enforce a valid arbitration contract under the arbitration act.compel arbitration,consolidation of arbitration proceedings,stay of pending action,appointment of arbitrator,et confirmation,correction,vacation of award.here,plaintiffs requested and obtained postarbitration enforcement of an arbitration award.in evaluating the propriety of the court ruling,however,we find it useful to review the well established law on prearbitration petitions to compel arbitration.
prior to arbitration,if a party to an arbitration contract refuses to arbitrate the controversy,the other party may petition the court to order arbitration under section.a party petitioning to compel arbitration must allege the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy brodke alphatec spine th,d.
in rosenthal great western fin.securities cal th,d,rosenthal,our supreme court set forth the procedure to be followed when a petitioner seeks to compel arbitration w hen a petition to compel arbitration is filed and accompanied by prima facie evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate the controversy,the court itself must determine whether the agreement exists and,if any defense to its enforcement is raised,whether it is enforceable.because the existence of the agreement is a statutory prerequisite to granting the petition,the petitioner bears the burden of proving its existence by a preponderance of the evidence.if the party opposing the petition raises a defense to fraud in the execution voiding the agreement,or a statutory defense of waiver or revocation citation that party bears the burden of producing evidence of,and proving by a preponderance of the evidence,any fact necessary to the defense.id.at,d.
thus,our supreme court has clearly stated that a court,before granting a petition to compel arbitration,must determine the factual issue of the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement.rosenthal,supra,cal th at,d.in this way,a court role,though limited,is critical.there is indeed a strong policy in favor of enforcing agreements to arbitrate,but there is no policy compelling persons to accept arbitration of controversies which they have not agreed to arbitrate and which no statute has made arbitrable.freeman state farm mut.auto.ins.cal d.
after arbitration has resulted in an award,the arbitration act permits a party to petition the court to confirm,correct or vacate the award.the opposing party may respond to such a petition by requesting the court to dismiss the petition or to confirm,correct or vacate the award.the proponent of the arbitration award whether it be the petitioner or the respondent must recite or attach a copy of the arbitration agreement,subd.a.a court presented with such a petition or response is empowered only to confirm,correct,or vacate the award or to dismiss the proceeding.if the court confirms the award,it shall enter judgment accordingly.
we have found no case that describes as clearly as did rosenthal for petitions to compel arbitration the postarbitration duty of a court to determine the existence and validity of an arbitration contract,and the burden of proof borne by an award proponent,when enforcement of an arbitration award is requested under circumstances where,as here,no prior judicial determination has been made as to the existence of the contract to arbitrate.but we see no reason why rosenthal analysis should not apply equally at this juncture.absent an enforceable agreement,an arbitration award is invalid.we conclude rosenthal prescription for the co
