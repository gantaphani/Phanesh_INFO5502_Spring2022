glencore grain rotterdam glencore grain filed an application in the district court under the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards convention for an order confirming its arbitration award against shivnath rai harnarain company shivnath rai.on shivnath rai motion,the district court dismissed glencore grain application for lack of personal jurisdiction.
we have jurisdiction over glencore grain appeal pursuant to.we hold that the convention does not eliminate the due process requirement that a federal court have jurisdiction over a defendant person or property in a suit to confirm a previously issued arbitration award.because glencore grain fails to identify any property owned by shivnath rai in the forum,or to allege facts that support a finding of personal jurisdiction,we affirm the district court dismissal of the complaint.
background 
this case arises out of a series of eleven contracts under which glencore grain,a netherlands corporation with its principal place of business in rotterdam,agreed to purchase approximately tons of rice from shivnath rai,a manufacturer and exporter of rice incorporated in india with its principal place of business in new delhi.the contracts called for the delivery of rice at the port of kandla,india.among the rights and responsibilities set forth in each contract were the following arbitration and choice of law clauses 
dispute arising on this contract shall be referred for settlement to the arbitration by two members of the london rice brokers association panel of arbitrators or their umpire,being also a member of this panel.each party to appoint one arbitrator and having the right to reject one nominee the parties to the arbitration shall have the right of appealing against any award except on questions of law within days from the date of award to the london rice brokers association,whose decision shall be final.any payments arising out of the award are due to be made within days of the date thereof.
the contract shall be deemed to have been made in england and shall be governed in all respects by english law.any dispute arising out of or in connection therewith shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the london rice brokers association.
a dispute arose between the parties concerning the delivery of rice and was submitted to arbitration before the london rice brokers association lrba.in its written decision from july,the lrba ruled in favor of glencore grain,awarding it roughly million including interest,the award exceeded million.shivnath rai did not challenge the decision in england,where the award became final and remains enforceable,nor did shivnath rai pay up.
in march,glencore grain filed suit in the high court of delhi at new delhi,india to enforce the unpaid arbitration award.shivnath rai objected to the enforcement of the award on several grounds,including its failure to consent to the arbitration provisions in the underlying contracts and the arbitrators allotment of insufficient time to defend its case on the merits.glencore grain enforcement action remains pending in the high court of delhi.
in july,glencore grain filed an application in the federal district court for the northern district of california,seeking confirmation of the arbitral award under the convention,june,reprinted following west.shivnath rai filed a motion to dismiss on six different grounds,including the absence of personal jurisdiction 
in its motion opposing dismissal,glencore grain submitted evidence of shivnath rai with california and with the united states as a whole to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction.glencore grain provided evidence of the following shipments of rice by shivnath rai a shipment into the port of los angeles seven shipments through east coast ports from to and fifteen shipments into the port of san francisco from march to march.in addition,glencore grain submitted documents indicating that alok mohan,president of asian brands,located in union city,california,served as shivnath rai sales agent for its rice sales throughout the united states.glencore grain contended that these contacts supported the exercise of either specific or general jurisdiction over shivnath rai.
unswayed,the district court dismissed the action for lack of personal jurisdiction.in rejecting the general jurisdiction argument,the district court reasoned p etitioner has not asserted that respondent conducts any business in the except through this sales agent,asian brands.accordingly,the district court found insufficient contacts to exercise general jurisdiction.in addition,the district court refused to exercise specific jurisdiction because glencore grain nowhere asserts that the cause of action arises out of or relates to shivnath rai activities within the forum.lacking personal jurisdiction over shivnath rai,the district court dismissed glencore grain application to confirm its arbitral award.
this timely appeal followed.

we review a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction de novo.myers bennett law offices,cir.because the district court dismissed the case without holding an evidentiary hearing,glencore grain need only make a prima facie showing of facts supporting jurisdiction through its pleadings and affidavits to avoid dismissal.see id.we accept as true glencore grain uncontroverted allegations,and resolve in its favor factual conflicts contained in the parties filings.see at t compagnie bruxelles lambert,cir.
ii the convention provides subject matter jurisdiction over glencore grain action to enforce its arbitration award 
in congress ratified the convention,a multilateral treaty providing for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards made in the territory of a state other than the state where the recognition and enforcement of such awards are sought.convention,art.i.congress implemented the convention by passing chapter ii of the federal arbitration act faa,which provides that 
a n action or proceeding falling under the convention shall be deemed to arise under the laws and treaties of the united states.the district courts of the united states shall have original jurisdiction over such an action or proceeding,regardless of the amount in controversy.
the faa further provides 
within three years after an arbitral award falling under the convention is made,any party to the arbitration may apply to any court having jurisdiction under this chapter for an order confirming the award as against any other party to the arbitration.the court shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said convention.
the convention governs this action to confirm glencore grain arbitration award because the award was obtained in the united kingdom london within three years of glencore grain suit in district court.see restatement third of foreign relations law cmt.b t he critical element is the place of the award if that place is in the territory of a party to the convention,all other convention states are required to recognize and enforce the award,regardless of the citizenship or domicile of the parties to the arbitration.thus the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over glencore grain application.
iii the convention does not abrogate the due process requirement that jurisdiction exist over the defendant person or property 
before considering glencore grain arguments for the existence of jurisdiction over shivnath rai,we feel it necessary to address briefly glencore grain intimation that the faa contemplates reduced jurisdictional requirements over a defendant in suits to confirm arbitral awards.for the reasons stated below,we find this position without merit.
the convention and its implementing legislation have a bias,a policy by the supreme court 
the goal of the convention,and the principal purpose underlying american adoption and implementation of it,was to encourage the recognition and enforcement of commercial arbitration agreements in international contracts and to unify the standards by which agreements to arbitrate are observed and arbitral awards are enforced in the signatory countries.
scherk,d.the mandatory language of the convention itself and of the faa reflects this partiality and leaves the district courts with little discretion.ministry of def.of the islamic republic of iran gould,cir.article iii of the convention is illustrative each contracting state shall recognize arbitral awards as binding without creating conditions or procedures more onerous than those applied to domestic arbitration awards.emphasis added.similarly,the faa instructs that a federal court shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the convention.emphasis added.
in light of this mandate to confirm awards,glencore grain seems to find significance in what the convention and the faa do not say neither the convention nor its implementing legislation expressly requires personal jurisdiction over the party against whom confirmation is sought and lack of personal jurisdiction over the defendant in the state where enforcement is sought is not among the convention seven defenses to recognition and enforcement of a foreign arbitration award.see convention,art.v.we do not.
it is a bedrock principle of civil procedure and constitutional law that a statute can not grant personal jurisdiction where the constitution forbids it.gilson republic of.this precept reflects the idea that a district court must possess authority over the subject matter and over the parties,distinct powers that flow from distinct areas of the constitution.though article iii,section,clause of the constitution delineates the character of the controversies over which federal judicial authority may extend,the lower federal courts rely on congress to confer this authority through statutory grants of jurisdiction.ins.of ir.compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d.jurisdiction,then,is an art.iii as well as a statutory requirement.id.at.
the personal jurisdiction requirement,by contrast,flows from the due process clause and represents a restriction on judicial power not as a matter of sovereignty,but as a matter of individual liberty.id.district courts determine the existence vel non of personal jurisdiction not by reference to statutory imprimatur,but by inquiring whether maintenance of a suit against the defendant comports with the constitutional notions of due process as outlined in international shoe washington,and its progeny.thus,it is not significant in the least that the legislation implementing the convention lacks language requiring personal jurisdiction over the litigants.we hold that neither the convention nor its implementing legislation removed the district courts obligation to find jurisdiction over the defendant in suits to confirm arbitration awards.
perhaps because our holding is so unexceptional,we have uncovered relatively little authority squarely addressing the issue.the little authority that exists unequivocally endorses our position.first,we note the following language from the restatement an arbitral award is ordinarily enforced by confirmation in a judgment as in respect to judgments an action to enforce a foreign arbitral award requires jurisdiction over the award debtor or his property.restatement third of foreign relations law cmt.c emphasis added.
second,we find uniform support from the few courts that have expressly considered the jurisdictional requirements under the convention.in transatlantic bulk shipping saudi chartering,a liberian plaintiff brought suit under the convention to confirm its london arbitration award against a saudi defendant.addressing the issue of personal jurisdiction,the court concluded 
a s to the faa,it authorizes the court to hear a new category of action not previously within its subject matter jurisdiction.it does not,however,give the court power over all persons throughout the world who have entered into an arbitration agreement covered by the convention.some basis must be shown,whether arising from the respondent residence,his conduct,his consent,the location of his property or otherwise,to justify his being subject to the court power.
two recent decisions expressly adopted bulk shipping reasoning.see italtrade int l usa,sri lanka cement,no.civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,dardana yuganskneftegaz,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,a third,cme media enters.zelezny,civ,wl,dist.lexis,followed bulk shipping in spirit,if not in letter.in zelezny,cme petitioned the court to confirm a million arbitration award obtained in amsterdam against a czech citizen,zelezny.cme argued that the court had jurisdiction to confirm its award because zelezny had account the forum.zelezny countered that the court could not hear the case because the court lacked personal jurisdiction the bank account,zelezny argued,could not suffice.zelezny,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court disagreed.noting that a court has authority to adjudicate a case based on its power over either the defendant person or the defendant property,the court held it could exercise quasi in rem jurisdiction over the property and,thus,had jurisdiction to confirm the award.id.at,dist.lexis,at 
a final consideration counsels our position.interpreting the faa to dispense with the jurisdictional requirements of due process in actions to confirm arbitral awards would raise clear questions concerning the constitutionality of the statutes.we avoid such constitutionally questionable constructions whenever fairly possible.united states buckland,cir en banc.
of course,the positions espoused in the preceding district court opinions and restatement third do not bind this court.nevertheless,we find them and persuasive.thus,we hold that in suits to confirm a foreign arbitral award under the convention,due process requires that the district court have jurisdiction over the defendant against whom enforcement is sought or his property.
iv the district court lacked jurisdiction over shivnath rai 
jurisdiction under rule k a and the california shivnath rai lacks minimum contacts with california 
when,as here,subject matter jurisdiction is premised on a federal question,the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant must be authorized by a rule or statute and consonant with the constitutional principles of due process.myers,at.because there is no applicable federal statute governing personal jurisdiction,our starting point is california statute.see.k a doe unocal,cir per curiam.california permits the exercise of jurisdiction to the limits of due process.see peterson highland music,cir.thus,our analysis of personal jurisdiction under california and the constitution collapse into one,and we consider only whether the exercise of jurisdiction over shivnath rai comports with due process.
constitutional due process is satisfied when a defendant has certain minimum contacts with the forum such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe,at.quoting milliken meyer.depending on the nature of a foreign defendant contacts with the forum,a federal court may obtain either specific or general jurisdiction over him.a court exercises specific jurisdiction where the cause of action arises out of or has a substantial connection to the defendant contacts with the forum.hanson denckla,d.alternatively,a defendant whose contacts are substantial,continuous,and systematic is subject to a court general jurisdiction even if the suit concerns matters not arising out of his contacts with the forum.helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d.whether dealing with specific or general jurisdiction,the touchstone remains purposeful availment.by requiring that contacts proximately result from actions by the defendant himself that create a substantial connection with the forum state,the constitution ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of random,fortuitous,or attenuated contacts.burger king rudzewicz,d quoting mcgee int l life ins,d and keeton hustler magazine,d.
i specific jurisdiction is not proper over shivnath rai 
our circuit applies a test to evaluate the propriety of exercising specific jurisdiction whethe
