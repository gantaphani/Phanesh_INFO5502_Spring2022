antionette marino marino,appeals from a district court order holding that marino was not entitled to any attorney fees for work she allegedly performed for,pioneer edsel sales,clutter motor sales,and ricky clutter collectively referred to as pioneer honda,in a class action lawsuit against american honda motor company,american honda.we affirm.
in,honda dealers around the country began suing american honda in federal courts alleging violations of,inter alia,the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et.one of these lawsuits was a class action.in the summer of,the judicial panel on litigation consolidated those cases for purposes and transferred them to the united states district court for the district of maryland.judge motz was assigned to the cases.
in a january order,judge motz certified a limited liability class for trial in the honda class action the honda class action.pioneer honda was a class representative.the january order contemplated a phase i,where all liability claims by the honda dealers would be tried against american honda.the order required,however,that each honda dealership individually prove its damages.thus,every plaintiff in the honda class action,including representative plaintiffs such as pioneer honda,expected to individually try its damages case in a phase iii proceeding.
sometime shortly after judge motz certification decision,it came to the attention of elizabeth graham,esquire,of the law firm of rapazzini graham,that american honda was attempting to settle the claims of pioneer honda by agreement with the dealership new owner,ricky clutter clutter.until that time,the former owners of pioneer honda,al reilly reilly and mildred radar radar,who were represented by rapazzini graham,had been actively prosecuting the claims pursuant to an alleged oral agreement with clutter.
on february,graham contacted marino,who was clutter and pioneer honda counsel at the time,and asked for an assignment of rights from clutter to reilly and radar ostensibly in exchange for a referral fee.in a subsequent conversation,graham told marino that she was representing other individual dealers in the honda class action and was interested in representing clutter.marino and graham ultimately convinced clutter to reject american honda settlement offer which at one time clutter and marino were inclined to accept and to prosecute pioneer honda claims through graham.
to avoid a dispute between the current and former owners,clutter agreed to work with reilly and radar and share the proceeds of any recovery from american honda in the honda class action.thereafter,rapazzini graham and clutter entered into an attorney representation agreement.
marino is not a party to the attorney representation agreement,but it reflects her status at that time as clutter personal counsel.paragraph of the attorney representation agreement provides as follows attorneys shall act as with my personal attorney,antoinette marino.this shall not increase the attorneys fees set forth herein.paragraph of the attorney representation agreement provides for a graduated contingent fee to be paid to rapazzini graham based upon rapazzini graham representation of clutter on an individual basis.the attorney representation agreement contemplated that marino could be required to perform work on clutter behalf should the case be tried individually and provided that marino would receive of the total attorneys fees provided for in paragraph or some other fair percentage.
in an april,letter that marino sent to clutter,marino explained the attorney representation agreement to clutter.marino explained that she would receive thirty percent of the attorney fees paid to rapazzini graham.marino also promised that t he shall in no way increase the attorney fees for which the client,pioneer edsel sales,agrees to pay rapazzini graham paragraph of the attorney representation agreement.on april,marino filed a notice of appearance in an action related to the honda class action that was pending in the district of maryland.this action,which was brought by pioneer honda against two fellow california honda dealerships and was transferred to the district of maryland as part of the america honda litigation,alleged,inter alia,that the dealerships along with american honda violated rico.
in june,american honda approached rapazzini graham,who by then had been appointed class counsel,about the possibility of a global settlement.a class action settlement the borman settlement agreement was negotiated in july and all proceedings were stayed pending a fairness hearing.an econometric model was developed and a formula was devised to distribute any settlement proceeds to the entire settlement class of honda dealers.thus,the damages settlement eliminated the need for any dealership,including pioneer honda,to prove damages individually.each class member needed only to elect to remain in the class to receive a recovery under the plan of distribution.according to rapazzini graham,this event rendered nugatory all individual contingent fee contracts with rapazzini graham,and rapazzini graham notified each class representative of that fact and the amount that they could expect to receive from the global settlement.
of note,in so approving the borman settlement agreement,judge motz expressly found that the total amount of settlement to be paid to the plaintiffs class under the borman settlement agreement was fair,reasonable,adequate,and in the best interests of the class as a whole.paragraph of the borman settlement agreement states that judge motz shall have exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over all disputes arising from or relating to the borman settlement agreement,including disputes concerning attorney fees.moreover,the october,order of final settlement approval states that the court shall have and retain exclusive jurisdiction with respect to any applications or disputes concerning attorney fees which may arise.
as a result of the borman settlement agreement and the october,order of final settlement approval,no contingent fee or attorney fees were paid to rapazzini graham under the attorney representation agreement.moreover,no fees or costs were paid to rapazzini graham pursuant to any individual fee contract once global negotiations began.rapazzini graham were paid as class counsel pursuant to their application to judge motz.the record reflects that,as class counsel,rapazzini graham were paid approximately twenty million dollars pursuant to the borman settlement agreement and the october,order of final settlement approval.pioneer honda recovery under the plan of distribution was approximately two million dollars clutter received approximately of that sum,with the balance being paid to the former owners of pioneer honda.according to marino,she was not paid,by rapazzini graham or pioneer honda,for the approximately hours of legal work she performed in connection with the prosecution of pioneer honda claims against american honda.
in june,marino filed an action against rapazzini graham in california state court asserting numerous claims including fraud and breach of contract.in essence,marino sought to recover thirty percent of the attorney fees rapazzini graham received for the representation of pioneer honda interests in the honda class action.
thereafter,rapazzini graham filed a motion before judge motz entitled motion for adjudication of fee dispute pursuant to the borman settlement agreement and request for reasonable attorneys fees pursuant to.rapazzini graham simultaneously removed marino state court action to the united states district court for the central district of california.marino filed a motion for remand.the judicial panel on litigation then transferred the case to the united states district court for the district of maryland.
judge motz initially ruled that he possessed jurisdiction to decide marino claims against rapazzini graham and went on to rule that marino claims were without merit.judge motz held that marino was not entitled to fees under the attorney representation agreement because it was rendered nugatory once class counsel,rapazzini graham,began negotiating the global sett
