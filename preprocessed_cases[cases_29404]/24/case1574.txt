appellants challenge an order of the trial court denying their petition to compel arbitration.we affirm.
relevant factual and procedural history 
on march,appellant cronus investments,cronus,filed a complaint against respondents concierge services,llc concierge,westrec marina management,westrec,westrec contracting,llc,michael sachs,william anderson,and michael robbins.the complaint asserted claims for breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,conversion,and fraud,and sought an accounting and declaratory relief.
the complaint alleged the following facts cronus is wholly owned by howard jon colman,who also owns a percent interest in concierge.westrec owns the remaining interest in concierge and is affiliated with westrec contracting.sachs is the chairman and chief executive officer of concierge,and is also a principal in westrec,as are anderson and robbins.
the complaint further alleges that in,colman operated a corporation named services,that managed homes at exclusive properties.in,sachs and colman entered into a trial relationship during which colman provided home management services for westrec at its lake las vegas project.at the end of the period,westrec participated in the formation of concierge,and colman sold to concierge.colman continued to provide services through concierge in a complex transaction involving six agreements,four of which contain arbitration clauses problems arose following the execution of the agreements,and on january,sachs fired colman from his employment with concierge.
after cronus filed its complaint,colman and cronus also submitted a demand for arbitration to the american arbitration association aaa under the arbitration clauses in the underlying agreements.on april,concierge filed a against colman and cronus,as well as nelson colman,colman father,and desert home services,desert,which is operated by nelson colman.
the asserts claims for breach of contract,fiduciary fraud,unjust enrichment,and inducement of breach of contract,and seeks an accounting and declaratory relief.it refers to five of the six agreements identified in the complaint,and alleges that colman and cronus improperly diverted business from concierge to nelson colman and desert,who were unjustly enriched by this conduct.
on may,colman and cronus filed a petition to stay the litigation and to compel arbitration.they stated that they had already demanded arbitration,and contended that five of the implicated agreements containing an arbitration clause.
on may,respondents filed motions under code of civil procedure section,subdivision c to consolidate the arbitration proceeding with the underlying action,and to enjoin arbitration pending the outcome of this action.they contended that permitting the arbitration proceeding and underlying action to proceed risked inconsistent results,and that the underlying action involved nonarbitrable issues whose resolution might render arbitration unnecessary.in response,cronus and colman argued,inter alia,that although the underlying agreements identify california law as governing law,the federal arbitration act faa et precluded application of section because the pertinent arbitration clauses specifically invoke the faa.
following the hearing,the trial court determined that some of the causes of action and controversies in the underlying action were not subject to arbitration,only three of the were arbitrable,and some of the litigants were not parties to agreements containing an arbitration agreement.on june,it denied the petition to compel arbitration and to stay the litigation,enjoined arbitration,and consolidated the three arbitrable with the action for all purposes this appeal followed.
discussion 
appellants sole contention is that under the circumstances of this case,the faa precluded the application of section,subdivision c section c.in our view,they are mistaken.
subparts and of section c permit a trial court to refuse to enforce the arbitration agreement or stay arbitration pending the outcome of the court action if it determines that a party to the arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court action or special proceeding with a third party,arising out of the same transaction or series of related transactions and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact.rulings on these matters are consigned to the trial court discretion.henry alcove investment,d.
as our supreme court observed in rosenthal great western fin.securities cal th,d,rosenthal,the procedures that the faa imposes on federal courts resemble california law in many respects.thus,the faa and california law,subd.c alike provide that when a court has ordered arbitration of a controversy,any pending litigation on the same controversy is to be stayed.cal th at,d,fn.omitted.however,the faa lacks any provision similar to section c,insofar as it authorizes the trial court to deny or stay arbitration pending completion of related litigation.cal th at,fn,d.
the focus of this appeal is section of the faa,which provides that an arbitration clause in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce is enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.italics added.appellants central contention is that section of the faa precluded the trial court from enjoining arbitration under section c.
as we elaborate below see pt.a,ante,although section of the faa establishes a broad principle of enforceability regarding arbitration agreements subject to the faa,it permits parties to such agreements to bind themselves to the application of section c.in view of these principles,appellants contend that the arbitration clauses at issue,properly understood,do not authorize the application of section c,and section of the faa precludes the operation of section c absent such contractual authorization.for reasons that we explain below see pts.b c,ante,we accept but reject,and thus conclude that appellants contention fails.
governing principles 
a complex body of case authority has evolved regarding when the terms of an arbitration agreement subject to the faa permit the operation of state laws that regulate or otherwise affect arbitration.we recount this authority,with due emphasis on the role that section c has played in its development.
broad principle of enforceability under section of the faa 
the central import of section of the faa is well established.this section is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary.the effect of the section is to create a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability,applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the faa.moses cone hospital mercury constr,d.thus,the faa generally bars the application of a state substantive or prevent the enforcement of an arbitration agreement subject to the faa,unless the state law meets the requirements of section of the faa.
as the united states supreme court stated in southland keating,d southland we discern only two limitations on the enforceability of arbitration provisions governed by the faa they must be part of a written maritime contract or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce and such clauses may be revoked upon grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.we see nothing in the faa indicating that the broad principle of enforceability is subject to any additional limitations under state law.fn.omitted,italics added.
in perry thomas,footnote,d perry,the united states supreme court further explained this broad principle of enforceability s tate law,whether of legislative or judicial origin,is applicable if that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity,revocability,and enforceability of contracts generally.a principle that takes its meaning precisely from the fact that a contract to arbitrate is at issue does not comport with this requirement of section of the faa.italics omitted.
following southland and perry,the court in energy group,liddington d.energy group addressed whether section of the faa preempts a stay of arbitration under section c.in energy group,the underlying contract provided solely that any arbitration would be held in california under aaa rules.d at,fn.when a dispute arose between the parties to the contract,some of these parties filed a petition to compel arbitration.id.at.in response,the trial court stayed arbitration under section c pending the outcome of related litigation involving a nonparty to the contract.d at.
citing southland and perry,the court in energy group reversed,concluding that section has been preempted by the faa if it is used in order to avoid or delay arbitration of a contract dispute governed by the faa.energy group,supra,d at.the energy group court reasoned that section c was not generally applicable to contracts,but applied only to contracts subject to arbitration,and its effects were indistinguishable from an order denying the petition.d at.
incorporation of state law into arbitration agreement 
notwithstanding the broad principle of enforcement found in section of the faa,parties may incorporate state arbitration laws into an arbitration agreement without offending the faa.this matter was first clarified in volt info.sciences leland stanford,d volt,which also concerned an application of section c.
in volt,the underlying contract,which concerned the installation of an electrical system on the stanford university campus,contained an arbitration clause and a provision stating that the contract shall be governed by the law of the place where the project is located.volt,supra,at.after a contract dispute arose,stanford university successfully obtained a stay of arbitration under section c pending the resolution of related litigation involving parties not bound by the contract.at.a state appellate court affirmed,concluding that the provision incorporated california rules of arbitration into the contract.id.at.
the court in volt accepted this construction of the provision as the resolution of a question of state law,and held that the faa did not bar the operation of section c because the parties had agreed that california arbitration laws would govern their arbitration.volt,supra,at.the volt court stated there is no federal policy favoring arbitration under a certain set of procedural rules the federal policy is simply to ensure the enforceability,according to their terms,of private agreements to arbitrate.id.at.noting that california arbitration rules,including section c,generally foster the federal policy favoring arbitration,the court reasoned that interpreting the provision to make such rules applicable did not offend any policy embodied in the faa.at fn.
the volt court further explained the faa contains no express provision,nor does it reflect a congressional intent to occupy the entire field of arbitration.citation.but even when congress has not completely displaced state regulation in an area,state law may nonetheless be to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal is,to the extent that it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.citation.the question before us,therefore,is whether application of section c to stay arbitration under this contract in interstate commerce,in accordance with the terms of the arbitration agreement itself,would undermine the goals and policies of the faa.we conclude that it would not.volt,supra,at.
as the united states supreme court subsequently concluded in doctor associates,casarotto,d doctor associates,volt does not modify the broad principle of enforceability stated in southland and perry.doctor associates addressed a montana statute that rendered an arbitration clause unenforceable unless notice of the arbitration clause was stated on the first page of the underlying contract.id.at.the montana supreme court concluded that section of the faa did not preempt this statute,reasoning that volt had displaced southland and perry,and that under volt,a state law was preempted only if it undermined the goals and policies of the faa.id.at.
the court in doctor associates rejected the montana supreme court interpretation of volt and reaffirmed southland and perry,stating courts may not invalidate arbitration agreements under state laws applicable only to arbitration provisions.citations.by enacting section of the faa,congress precluded states from singling out arbitration provisions for suspect status,requiring instead that such provisions be placed upon the same footing as other contracts.citation.doctor associates,supra,at.applying this standard,the court held that the faa displaced the montana statute because it conditioned the enforcement of arbitration agreements on notice requirements restricted to arbitration agreements.id.at.
following volt,california courts have examined the underlying contract containing the arbitration clause to determine whether the parties agreed to the operation of section c.thus,in health net th,d,the trial court denied a petition to compel arbitration under section c due to the risk of conflicting rulings with the pending civil action.the court in reversed,reasoning that the pertinent contract did not allow application of section c because it provided that california law would govern the manner in which arbitration would be conducted,but not that california law would determine when arbitration was required.th at,d.
by contrast,in mount diablo medical center health net of california,th,d,the underlying contract contained a broad provision stating that california law governed the validity,construction,interpretation and enforcement of the contract,and the court held that this provision permitted the operation of section c.
interpretation of underlying arbitration agreements 
we now turn to the first issue presented by appellants contention,namely,the extent to which the underlying contracts incorporate section c through their terms.in view of the aforementioned authority,we examine the pertinent contracts,which involve interstate commerce to determine whether they permit the application of section c.
the transaction underlying the complaint,and demand for arbitration involved six contracts a limited liability company agreement between cronus and westrec creating concierge a stock purchase agreement by which colman transferred stock to concierge an employment agreement between colman and concierge a covenant not to compete and confidentiality agreement between colman and concierge a consulting agreement between cronus and concierge and a guaranty agreement between westrec and colman.
the limited liability company agreement and guaranty agreement do not contain arbitration provisions.regarding the remaining contracts,the key arbitration clause is found in the stock purchase agreement.
the stock purchase agreement provides in section for the arbitration of a ny controversy,dispute or claim arising out of,in connection with,or in relation to the interpretation,performance or breach of the agreement,including any claim based on contract,tort or statute section further provides the designation of a situs or specifically a governing law for this agreement or the arbitration shall not be deemed an election to preclude application of the federal arbitration act,if it would be applicable.italics added.regarding governing law,section of the stock purchase agreement states construction.this agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with and governed by the laws of the state of california,without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions thereof.
the employment agreement,covenant not to compete,and consulting agreement expressly state that disputes shall be settled or resolved in accordance with section of the purchase agreement.like the stock purchase agreement,the employment agreement and covenant not to compete also provide that they shall be interpreted and performed or enforced in accordance with california law,without reference to its laws concerning conflicts of laws.
because all the arbitration clauses are tied to the arbitration clause in the stock purchase agreement,the key issue concerns the interpretation of the latter clause.we therefore examine the lan
