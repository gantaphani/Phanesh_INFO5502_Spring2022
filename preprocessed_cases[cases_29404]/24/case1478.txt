in this writ proceeding,five siblings who appeared in an episode of the television program extreme makeover home edition extreme makeover challenge an order compelling them to arbitrate most of their claims against various entities involved with the production and broadcast of the program.petitioners claim the arbitration clause contained in a written agreement they executed before the program was broadcast is unconscionable.we agree.accordingly,we grant the petition for writ of mandate.
factual and procedural background 
petitioners charles,michael,charis,joshua,and jeremiah higgins are siblings.in february,when they executed the agreement whose arbitration provision is at issue,they were,and years old,respectively.
real parties in interest,to whom we refer collectively as the television defendants,are american broadcasting companies,the network that broadcasts extreme makeover international television,which asserts it had no involvement with the extreme makeover program in which petitioners appeared lock and key productions,the show producer endemol usa,which is also involved in producing the program and pardee homes,which constructed the home featured in the extreme makeover episode in which petitioners appeared.
petitioners parents died in.the eldest sibling,charles,became the guardian for the then three minor children.to avoid confusion with his siblings,we refer to charles higgins by his first name.shortly thereafter,petitioners moved in with church acquaintances,firipeli and lokilani leomiti,a couple with three children of their own.the leomitis are defendants in the litigation but are not involved in the present writ proceeding.
according to charles higgins,after moving in with the leomitis,he was advised by members of his church that producers of extreme makeover had contacted the church and had asked to speak to him about the production of a show based on the loss of petitioners parents and that petitioners were now living with the leomitis in july or august,charles called and spoke with an associate producer of lock and key about the program and petitioners living situation.
over the next several months,there were additional contacts between petitioners and persons affiliated with the production of the program,including interviews and the filming of a casting tape.by early,petitioners and the leomitis were chosen to participate in the program in which the leomitis home would be completely renovated.
on february,a lock and key producer sent by federal express to each of the petitioners and to the leomitis an agreement and release for their signatures the agreement and release contains pages and numbered paragraphs.attached to it were several pages of exhibits,including an authorization for release of medical information,an emergency medical release,and,as exhibit c,a document entitled release.to avoid confusion with the exhibit c release,we refer to the agreement and release simply as the agreement,and to exhibit c as the release.
at the top of the first page of the agreement,the following appears in large and underlined print note do not sign this until you have read it completely.the numbered paragraph also states in pertinent part i have been given ample opportunity to read,and i have carefully read,this entire agreement i certify that i have made such an investigation of the facts pertinent to this agreement and of all the matters pertaining thereto as i have deemed necessary i represent and warrant that i have reviewed this document with my own legal counsel prior to signing or,in the alternative,although i have been given a reasonable opportunity to discuss this agreement with counsel of my choice,i have voluntarily declined such opportunity.
the last section of the agreement,which includes numbered paragraphs,is entitled miscellaneous.none of the paragraphs in that section contains a heading or title.paragraph contains the following arbitration provision 
i agree that any and all disputes or controversies arising under this agreement or any of its terms,any effort by any party to enforce,interpret,construe,rescind,terminate or annul this agreement,or any provision thereof,and any and all disputes or controversies relating to my appearance or participation in the program,shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the following procedure all arbitration proceedings shall be conducted under the auspices of the american arbitration association i agree that the arbitrator ruling,or arbitrators ruling,as applicable,shall be final and binding and not subject to appeal or challenge the parties hereto agree that,notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph,producer shall have a right to injunctive or other equitable relief as provided for in california code of civil procedure section or other relevant laws.
there is nothing in the agreement that brings the reader attention to the arbitration provision.although a different font is used occasionally to highlight certain terms in the agreement,that is not the case with the paragraph containing the arbitration provision six paragraphs in the agreement contain a box for the petitioners to initial initialing is not required for the arbitration provision.
the agreement also contains a provision limiting petitioners remedies for breach of the agreement to money damages.
the release is typed in a smaller font than the agreement.it consists of four paragraphs,the middle of which contains the following arbitration clause 
i agree that any and all disputes or controversies arising under this release or any of its terms,any effort by any party to enforce,interpret,construe,rescind,terminate or annul this release,or any provision thereof,shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration before a single,neutral arbitrator,who shall be a retired judge of a state or federal court.all arbitration proceedings shall be conducted under the auspices of the american arbitration association,under its commercial arbitration rules,through its los angeles,california office.i agree that the arbitration proceedings,testimony,discovery and documents filed in the course of such proceedings,including the fact that the arbitration is being conducted,will be treated as confidential 
there is no evidence that any discussions took place between petitioners and any representative of the television defendants regarding either the agreement or the release,or that any of the television defendants directly imposed any deadline by which petitioners were required to execute the documents.
on february,a field producer from lock and key and a location manager for the program went to the leomitis home and met with the leomitis.although physically present at the house,petitioners did not participate in the meeting.during the meeting,one of the leomitis asked about the documents they had received,and the producer and location manager advised the leomitis that they should read the documents carefully,call if they had questions,and then execute and return the documents.
according to charles,after this meeting,the leomitis emerged with a packet of documents,which they handed to petitioners.leomiti instructed petitioners to flip through the pages and sign and initial the document where it contained a signature line or box.charles stated that from the time leomiti handed the document to us and the time we signed it,approximately five to ten minutes passed.the document contained complex legal terms that he did not understand.he did not know what an arbitration agreement was and did not understand its significance or the legal consequences that could flow from signing it.he did not specifically state whether or not he saw the arbitration provisions contained either in paragraph or the release before he signed the documents.
each of the petitioners executed the agreement and signed all exhibits,including the release.
on february,representatives from the show appeared and started to reconstruct the leomitis home.when the new home was completed,it had nine bedrooms,including one for each of the five petitioners.the existing mortgage was also paid off.
the program featuring petitioners and the leomitis was broadcast on easter sunday.
petitioners allege that,after the show was first broadcast,the leomitis informed petitioners that the home was theirs the leomitis,and the leomitis ultimately forced petitioners to leave.charles contacted lock and key field producer and asked for help.the producer responded that he could not assist petitioners.sometime thereafter,the extreme makeover episode was rebroadcast.
in august,petitioners filed this action against the television defendants and the leomitis.according to the record before us,the complaint includes claims for,among other things,intentional and negligent misrepresentation,breach of contract,unfair competition bus,et,and false advertising bus,et.with respect to the television defendants,the complaint appears to allege that those defendants breached promises to provide petitioners with a home,exploited petitioners,and portrayed petitioners in a false light by rebroadcasting the episode when they knew the episode no longer reflected petitioners living situation.
the television defendants petitioned to compel arbitration pursuant to the federal arbitration act faa et.the television defendants maintained that all claims against both them and the leomitis should be arbitrated.the leomitis joined in the petition 
petitioners opposed the petition,claiming,among other things,that the arbitration provision was unconscionable.they claimed it was procedurally unconscionable because the parties had unequal bargaining power,the arbitration provision was buried in the agreement,petitioners were given only five to ten minutes before they were asked to sign the agreement,none of the television defendants explained the agreement to them,and copies of the executed documents were withheld from them 
petitioners also argued the agreement was substantively unconscionable because its terms were so as to shock the conscience.they claimed the agreement requires only them and not the television defendants to arbitrate,limits petitioners remedies to damages while the television defendants remedies are not so limited,precludes only petitioners from appealing,provides that the arbitration will be in accordance with the rules of the american arbitration association which unfairly requires arbitration costs to be borne equally by the parties,and allows the television defendants to change the terms of the agreement at any time.
after argument,the trial court issued an order granting the petition in most respects,conditioned on the television defendants paying all arbitration costs.the court denied the petition as to the claims against the leomitis and the unfair competition and false advertising claims against the television defendants,rulings not presently challenged.the court reasoned that although petitioners argue that the arbitration agreements are enforceable presumably the court meant unenforceable,their argument is directed not at the arbitration provisions but at the releases themselves.the court then cited united states and california supreme court decisions holding that under the faa,where a party seeks to avoid application of an arbitration provision on the ground that the agreement in which the provision it is contained is unenforceable,that claim must be considered by the arbitrator,not the court.the trial court also stated that since defendants have shown that plaintiffs signed the releases having had an opportunity to read them,the arbitration provisions are found by this court to be enforceable.the court did not address petitioners other specific claims of unconscionability,presumably because it construed petitioners opposition to the petition to compel arbitration as an attack only on the entire agreement and release,not on the arbitration provisions contained in those documents.
petitioners then filed this writ petition challenging the trial court ruling.we issued an alternative writ,received additional briefing from the parties,and heard oral argument.
discussion 
unconscionability as a defense to enforcement of arbitration provisions 
the trial court ruled,and petitioners do not dispute,that the enforceability of the arbitration clause is governed by the faa.federal law applies to arbitration provisions in contracts involving interstate commerce.see cronus investments,concierge services cal th,d,cronus investments.numerous cases observe that arbitration is generally favored under both the faa and california law,balandran labor ready,th,d ruiz sysco food services th,d.at the same time,our supreme court has emphasized that although we have spoken of a strong public policy of this state in favor of resolving disputes by arbitration citation,code of civil procedure section makes clear that an arbitration agreement is to be rescinded on the same grounds as other contracts or contract terms.in this respect,arbitration agreements are neither favored nor disfavored,but simply placed on an equal footing with other contracts.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,armendariz see also buckeye check cashing,cardegna,d,buckeye section of the faa embodies the national policy favoring arbitration and places arbitration agreements on equal footing with all other contracts cronus investments,supra,cal th at,d,the faa purpose is not to provide special status for arbitration agreements,but only to make arbitration agreements as enforceable as other contracts,but not more so.
thus,under both the faa and california law,arbitration agreements are valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
one ground is unconscionability,the basis asserted by petitioners below and in this writ proceeding.see flores transamerica homefirst,th,d.the strong public policy of this state in favor of resolving disputes by arbitration does not extend to an arbitration agreement permeated by unconscionability.ibid.as is frequently the case with inquiries into unconscionability,our analysis it does whether the agreement and release are contracts of adhesion.see armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.petitioners contend that they are and that the arbitration provisions are unconscionable.a contract of adhesion is a standardized contract that is imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength and relegates to the other party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it,quoting neal state farm ins.d.adhesion contracts are routine in modern day commerce,and at least one commentator has suggested they are worthy of neither praise nor condemnation,only analysis.corbin on contracts.if a court finds a contract to be adhesive,it must then determine whether other factors are present which,under established legal or to render it unenforceable.armendariz,at,d,citing graham,cal d,graham.
one established rule is that a court need not enforce an adhesion contract that is unconscionable.graham,supra,cal d at.as our supreme court explained in armendariz,the legislature has now codified the principle,historically developed in case law,that a court may refuse to enforce an unconscionable provision in a contract.code civ.because defenses to arbitration provisions under the faa are on equal footing with defenses to any other contract,unconscionability is neither favored nor disfavored as a reason to refuse enforcement of an arbitration clause.see doctor associates,casarotto,d.
recent appellate decisions have focused more on what is unconscionable and less on what is adhesive.see trend homes,superior court th,d morris redwood empire bancorp th,d harper ultimo th,d adhesion is not a prerequisite for unconscionability.
unconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element,the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,the latter on overly harsh or results.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.the prevailing view is that procedural and substantive unconscionability must both be present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability.citation.but they need not be present in the same degree.essentially a sliding scale is invoked which disregards the regularity of the procedural process of the contract formation,that creates the terms,in proportion to the greater harshness or unreasonableness of the substantive terms themselves.citations.in other words,the more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.ibid.
under the faa,a court may not consider a claim that an arbitration provision is unenforceable if it is a subterfuge for a challenge that the entire agreement in which the arbitration clause is only a part is unconscionable.that contention must be presented to the arbitrator.buckeye,supra,at.at,d at regardless of whether the challenge is brought in federal or state court,a challenge to the validity of the contract as a whole,and not specifically to the arbitration clause,must go to the arbitrator see rosenthal great western fin.securities cal th,d.our task,therefore,is does the petition here challenge the enforceability of the agreement and the release,in toto,or does it contest only the arbitration provision if it is the latter,is the arbitration provision unconscionable 
b.the standard of review 
the party petitioning to compel arbitration bears the burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement by a preponderance of the evidence.the party opposing the petition must meet the same evidentiary burden to prove any facts necessary to its defense.provencio wma securities,th,d.t he party opposing arbitration has the burden of proving the arbitration provision is unconscionable.szetela discover bank th,d.
whether an arbitration provision is unconscionable is ultimately a question of law.flores transamerica homefirst,supra,th at,d see also.where,as here,the trial court rules on the question of unconscionability based on declarations that contain no meaningful factual disputes,we review the trial court ruling de novo.flores transamerica homefirst,at,d brookwood bank of america th,d cpi builders,impco technologies,th,d.
c.the trial court incorrectly concluded petitioners were challenging the enforceability of the entire agreement and release 
the trial court offered two reasons for its decision to order arbitration.first,it concluded that petitioners opposition to arbitration was predicated on a challenge to the agreement as a whole,not to the arbitration provision in particular.from this premise,the trial court reasoned that,because the enforceability of the entire agreement is to be considered by the arbitrator,not the court buckeye,supra,at.at,d at,the petition should be granted.the trial court framing of the issue was seen in its written ruling,where it stated,although plaintiffs argue that the arbitration agreements are enforceable,their argument is directed not at the arbitration provisions but at the releases themselves.the court then provided a correct analysis of the law on the subject,citing prima paint flood conklin,d and rosenthal great western fin.securities,supra,cal th,d.the trial court concluded,here,plaintiffs attack the validity of the releases,not the arbitration provisions 
although we agree with the court legal analysis,its ultimate conclusion was flawed because petitioners opposition to the petition was that the arbitration clause in particular,not the entire agreement,was unconscionable.petitioners devoted considerable attention to paragraph of the agreement,emphasizing that it is not set out or made distinguishable in any manner.it is misidentified within the caption as miscellaneous.it is not distinguished in different type font size,bold letters,capital letters,in red,and does not contain any separate waiver notice.the caption of a argument made by petitioners reads the arbitration agreements are procedurally and substantively unconscionable thereby barring their enforcement.and in arguing that the arbitration provision was substantively unconscionable,petitioners quoted from paragraph in an effort to demonstrate that the provision was,requiring only them,and not the television defendants,to submit to arbitration.the principal thrust of petitioners oral argument to the trial court was likewise that the entire arbitration clause was itself.so only the plaintiffs under that clause have a duty to arbitrate.
we readily understand the potential for confusion in this area.uncertainty can become especially pronounced when parties or courts use the term arbitration agreement,when arbitration clause might be more precise.petitioners have contributed to this confusion because in the trial court they occasionally referred to the contract as being unconscionable,a practice they continue in their briefing in this court,when they ask us to declare the entire agreement unenforceable nevertheless,they argued separately that the arbitration clause itself is unconscionable,a point the trial court did not address.
the second justification offered by the trial court for granting the television defendants petition to compel arbitration was that petitioners had an opportunity to read the agreement and release before signing them.while this is factually correct and legally bears on whether the agreement is procedurally unconscionable,no authority is cited for a supposed rule that if a party reads an agreement he or she is barred from claiming it is unconscionable.such a rule would seriously undermine the unconscionability defense.
given the limited scope of the trial court ruling,we could remand to permit it to decide whether the arbitration provision is unconscionable.instead,because the case is before us on uncontested facts and our review is de novo,we decide the legal issues in the first instance.rayyis superior court th,d.
d.the arbitration provision is unconscionable 
the adhesive nature of the parties agreement 
we begin with whether the parties agreement was adhesive.see armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.as discussed above,t he term contract of adhesion signifies a standardized contract,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.ibid.
in this case,it is undisputed that the lengthy agreement was drafted by the television defendants.it is a standardized contract none of the petitioners names or other identifying information is included in the body of the document.there is no serious doubt that the television defendants had far more bargaining power than petitioners.
the remaining question is whether petitioners were relegated only to signing or rejecting the agreement.the television defendants note that there is no evidence petitioners were told they could not negotiate any terms of the agreement or that petitioners made any attempt to do so.although literally correct,the uncontested evidence was that on the day petitioners signed the agreement the television defendants initially met with the leometis alone.inferentially,at the television defendants urging,immediately after the meeting concluded,the leomitis gave the agreement and exhibits to petitioners with directions to flip through the pages and sign.the documents were returned in five to ten minutes.one of the producers testified that he told the leomitis that these agreements must be executed as a condition to their further participation in the program.
from these facts,we conclude the agreement was presented to petitioners on a basis by the party with the superior bargaining position who was not willing to engage in negotiations.accordingly,we conclude the agreement and exhibits constitute a contract of adhesion.
procedural unconscionability 
procedural unconscionability focuses on the factors of surprise and oppression citations,with surprise being a function of the disappointed reasonable expectations of the weaker party.harper ultimo,supra,th at,d.
in this case,the arbitration provision appears in one paragraph near the end of a lengthy,document.the entire agreement was drafted by the television defendants,who transmitted copies of it to the petitioners.the television defendants knew petitioners were young and unsop
