background 
jams provides private alternative dispute resolution services by promoting,arranging and handling the hiring of neutral individuals,such as retired judges,to assist with resolution of disputes.kinsella alleges jams acts as the promoter and as the booking agent for its neutrals,procuring engagements for them through the use of advertising and marketing.the neutrals are independent contractors,with jams collecting a fee from the neutrals for the services it provides in connection with the advertising,marketing,promotion,and booking services.jams,in fact,collects the fees from the consumers who pay for the services of the neutrals and jams in turn pays the neutrals.
jams allegedly directs and controls the publication of the jams web site and the statements made on that site.jams provides biographies of its neutrals on its web site and represents its family law neutrals are trusted experts.according to the complaint,the jams web site stated jams ensures the highest ethical standards and e verything we do and say will reflect the highest ethical and moral standards.we are dedicated to neutrality,integrity,honesty,accountability,and mutual respect in all our interactions.
sonenshine is on jams panel of neutrals.according to the complaint,she is a former california superior court judge and a retired california fourth district court of appeal justice.she is held out by jams as a neutral available for selection as a mediator,arbitrator,referee,and privately compensated temporary judge.
kinsella agreed to hire sonenshine through jams to adjudicate his pending marital dissolution action,involving assets he states were valued somewhere north of eight figures.these included assets from venture capital partnerships founded and managed by kinsella.at the suggestion of his wife attorney,kinsella reviewed the jams web site and sonenshine credentials.he alleged he did so carefully because he understood the importance of selecting someone he could respect and trust to rule on the decisions in his marital dissolution case and he wanted to assure himself he was selecting someone who satisfied his need to have confidence in the jurist and,specifically,a person who would understand principles of business ventures and private equity funding.
he alleged,based on the jams representations,he expected he could rely on the honesty and integrity of sonenshine biography,which he stated was impressive.kinsella alleged sonenshine was claiming experience that evidenced sufficient business acumen to understand his separate property holdings and private venture capital funds.
the stipulation and order appointing sonenshine as the privately compensated temporary judge for kinsella marital dissolution case gave sonenshine authority to make all orders necessary and proper to bring the case to judgment.after sonenshine began conducting hearings,kinsella alleged he became alarmed by what he saw and doubted that she possessed the business accomplishments her resume led him to believe she possessed.he began to look into her background to determine whether her biography accurately reflected her career achievements,especially as they concerned her business ventures.he concluded her biography omitted key information causing him to question her integrity.
kinsella filed a complaint alleging sonenshine biography on the jams web site was dishonest in two respects it proclaimed business success surrounding the and management of equico and rsm equico when the history of those two ventures is full of adverse and unfavorable accusations against sonenshine and her son in a class action lawsuit for fraud,and it proclaimed she was the founder of the escher fund,an equity fund that focused on,and businesses when the equity fund existed in name only as it never raised any equity capital and was,therefore,never funded and never operated as a functioning investment entity.
the complaint alleged sonenshine omitted information about the class action lawsuit because it would injure her reputation,reflect poorly on her background or discourage consumers from selecting her as a neutral.it further alleged sonenshine knew her biography was misleading in implying the escher fund was an actual operating fund,one that had successfully raised equity capital,when it never was either.
as to jams,the complaint alleged,b y representing sonenshine to be a person of the highest ethical standards,jams misrepresented the nature of her qualifications as a neutral to be hired from its web site.by ensuring that its neutrals conduct themselves with the highest ethical standards,jams accredited the deception committed by sonenshine.some capitalization omitted.
the complaint set forth four causes of action violation of the consumer legal remedies act civ.code,et based on deceptive representations made on sonenshine biography posted on the jams web site and based on deceptive representations made by jams fraud based on a sonenshine false representation she was the founder of the escher fund,yet that fund never existed inasmuch as it was never funded,b jams false representation that its neutrals act with highest ethical standards and jams acts with integrity,honesty,accountability,and mutual respect in all our interactions,and c the defendants concealment regarding sonenshine involvement with equico and rsm equico and the accusation of impropriety negligent misrepresentation and violation of business and professions code sections and.
the complaint stated all allegations of wrongdoing relate to information kinsella specifically viewed on defendant jams web site before he agreed to select sonenshine as the privately compensated temporary judge.some capitalization omitted.kinsella sought injunctive relief,actual damages exceeding,punitive damages,prejudgment interest,disgorgement,and restitution.
jams and sonenshine filed an motion contending kinsella action arose from protected activity because the statements in sonenshine biography and on the jams web site were made in connection with an issue under consideration by a judicial body.they also contended kinsella would be unable to show a probability of prevailing because sonenshine had no duty to disclose the facts she purportedly omitted and,if she did,judicial immunity litigation privilege bars the claim.
kinsella moved for an order determining the allegations in the complaint are exempt from the statute under the commercial speech exemption of section,subdivision c.jams and sonenshine opposed the motion contending the statements on the jams web site and in sonenshine online biography did not fall within the commercial speech exemption of section,subdivision c,because the exemption applies to representations of fact not to omissions or nonfactual representations such as puffery,sonenshine biography was not purely commercial speech because it was also used for noncommercial purposes such as for litigants to evaluate potential conflicts of interest or for dissemination to bar groups for noncommercial events.
the court determined the commercial speech exemption of section,subdivision c,applies to this case and precludes use of the special motion to strike.the court noted jams and sonenshine are engaged in the business of selling adr services,including private judging services,to the public.the alleged statements that form the basis of kinsella claims were posted on the jams web site for the purpose of promoting and securing sales or commercial transactions in defendants adr services.the intended audience was kinsella,a party involved in dissolution litigation,who actually engaged the services of jams and sonenshine.
the court determined the jams statements on the web site,which promotes adr services and allegedly describe its neutrals as having the highest ethical and moral standards and state they are dedicated to neutrality,integrity,honesty,were not mere puffery,but were statements that can be provably false factual assertions.the court concluded jams is a enterprise.its statements regarding the trustworthiness,integrity and honesty of its enterprise as well as its neutrals is purely commercial speech.the resume is included on the web site for commercial purposes to sell adr services.
discussion 
igeneral principles 
slapp lawsuits,masquerade as ordinary lawsuits but are generally meritless suits brought primarily to chill the exercise of free speech or petition rights by threat of severe economic sanctions against the defendant,and not to vindicate a legally cognizable right.simpson,gore cal th,simpson.in,out of concern over a disturbing increase in these types of lawsuits,the legislature enacted section and authorized the filing of a special motion to strike to expedite the early dismissal of these unmeritorious claims.ibid.a special motion to strike involves a process.first,the defendant must make a prima facie showing that the plaintiff of action aris es from an act by the defendant in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue.citation.if a defendant meets this threshold showing,the cause of action shall be stricken unless the plaintiff can establish a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,fn.omitted.the statute states it shall be construed broadly,subd.a.
in,concerned about the disturbing abuse of the statute,the legislature enacted section to exempt certain actions from it.simpson,supra,cal th at.one such exemption is for commercial speech.section,subdivision c,exempts from the law a cause of action arising from commercial speech when the cause of action is against a person primarily engaged in the business of selling or leasing goods or services the cause of action arises from a statement or conduct by that person consisting of representations of fact about that person or a business competitor business operations,goods,or services the statement or conduct was made either for the purpose of obtaining approval for,promoting,or securing sales or leases of,or commercial transactions in,the person goods or services or in the course of delivering the person goods or services and the intended audience for the statement or conduct meets the definition set forth in section,subdivision,c.simpson,at.
the commercial speech exemption is a statutory exception to section and should be narrowly construed.simpson,supra,cal th at.t he party seeking the benefit of the commercial speech exemption,has the burden of proof on each element.taxi cooperative,v.the independent taxi owners of los angeles th.we review the applicability of the commercial speech exemption independently.simpson,at.
jams and sonenshine contend the commercial speech exemption is not applicable for two reasons.first,they contend the statements about which kinsella complains are not representations of fact involving positive assertions of past or present conditions or events,but are omissions or nonactionable opinions.second,they contend the statements from which the causes of action arise were not made for purely commercial purposes.we are not persuaded by either contention.
we do not agree the commercial speech exemption is limited to exclude from the statute only causes of action arising from positive assertions of facts.this contention is not supported by either the plain language of the statute or its legislative history.
section,subdivision c,states in pertinent part section does not apply to any cause of action brought against a person primarily engaged in the business of selling or leasing goods or services arising from any statement or conduct by that person if both of the following conditions exist the statement or conduct consists of representations of fact about that person or a business competitor business operations,goods,or services,that is made for the purpose of obtaining approval for,promoting,or securing sales or leases of,or commercial transactions in,the person goods or services,or the statement or conduct was made in the course of delivering the person goods or services.the intended audience is an actual or potential buyer or customer,or a person likely to repeat the statement to,or otherwise influence,an actual or potential buyer or customer.italics added.
under the test of section,whether a section exemption applies is a first prong determination.demetriades yelp,th,demetriades.we do not consider whether the plaintiff has a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on the merits of his or her claims,which is the second prong of a section analysis.id.at.a conclusion about whether the plaintiff claims are the kind of claims the legislature intended to exempt from the scope of the statute when it adopted section is entirely independent of any evaluation of the merits of those claims,or even the adequacy of the pleadings.the inland oversight committee county of san bernardino th.
the legislative history indicates this legislation is aimed squarely at false advertising claims and is designed to permit them to proceed without having to undergo scrutiny under the statute.proponents of the legislation argued that corporations were improperly using the statute to burden plaintiffs who were pursuing unfair competition or false advertising claims and were being encouraged to use motions as a litigation weapon to slow down and perhaps even get out of unfair competition litigation.demetriades,supra,th at.
responding to concerns an exemption would impact the free speech rights of businesses,the legislative history of section indicates it was drafted to track constitutional principles governing regulation of commercial speech based upon guidelines discussed in kasky nike,cal th kasky see assem.com.on judiciary,on bill reg.sess.as amended june.in doing so,it followed kasky guidelines on commercial speech,focusing on the speaker,the content of the message,and the intended audience.id.at.commercial speech usually involves a speaker who is likely to be someone engaged in commerce that is,generally,the production,distribution,or sale of goods or services or someone acting on behalf of a person so engaged,and the intended audience is likely to be actual or potential buyers or customers of the speaker goods or services,or persons acting for actual or potential buyers or customers.kasky,supra,at.additionally,the factual content of the message should be commercial in character.in the context of regulation of false or misleading advertising,this typically means that the speech consists of representations of fact about the business operations,products,or services of the speaker,made for the purpose of promoting sales of,or other commercial transactions in,the speaker products or services.id.at.the language of section,subdivision c,closely tracks kasky discussion about the content of commercial speech.
neither the kasky decision nor the legislative history indicates the content of commercial speech must be an affirmative or positive representation,as opposed to an omission or.what matters for purposes of the commercial versus noncommercial speech analysis is whether the speech at issue is about the
