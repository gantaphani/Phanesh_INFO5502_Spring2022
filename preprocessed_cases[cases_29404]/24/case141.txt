in,cellular sales offered plaintiffs appellees employment.on or about january,both pratt and burrell signed compensation agreements with cellular sales that,in contrast with the prior sales agreements,contained an arbitration clause.this provision states,in relevant part all claims,disputes,or controversies arising out of,or in relation to this document or employee employment with cellular sales shall be decided by arbitration joint app.the first paragraph of the compensation agreement provides for an employment relationship,stating that cellular sales has employed you employee to sell verizon wireless services and related equipment.joint app.plaintiffs appellees allege that,after the compensation agreements were signed,cellular sales began to treat them differently by,inter alia,directly paying commissions to plaintiffs appellees and withholding federal taxes from those commissions.
plaintiffs appellees have temporally confined their claims to events that transpired prior to january.they allege that before the execution of the compensation agreements,cellular sales misclassified them as independent contractors when they were actually employees within the meaning of various labor laws because cellular sales controlled their work performance.as a result,plaintiffs appellees were allegedly deprived of,among other things,overtime compensation and minimum wage.plaintiffs appellees seek compensation owed under the fair labor standards act of flsa,et,new york common law,and various provisions of new york labor law,lab.law et,et mckinney.
defendants appellants cellular sales and cellular sales of knoxville,argue that the denial of their motion to compel arbitration conflicts with longstanding federal precedent under which all doubts as to the intent of the parties and the scope of an arbitration clause must be resolved generously in favor of arbitration.appellants br.plaintiffs appellees pratt and burrell respond that this court need not reach defendants appellants argument because the compensation agreement is unambiguous.under plaintiffs appellees view,the plain language of the contract reveals that the parties did not intend the arbitration clause to have a retroactive scope because plaintiffs appellees employment started the day the compensation agreements were signed.
in deciding whether a dispute is arbitrable,we must answer two questions whether the parties agreed to arbitrate,and,if so,whether the scope of that agreement encompasses the claims at issue.bank julius baer waxfield,cir alteration and internal quotation marks omitted,abrogated on other grounds by granite rock int l of teamsters.in this case,the parties agreed in the compensation agreement to arbitrate.thus,our discussion focuses on the scope of that agreement.the district court correctly determined that the arbitration clause at issue here is broad because it applies to a ll claims,disputes,or controversies arising out of,or in relation to this document or employee employment with cellular sales,joint app.see jlm indus.stolt nielsen sa,cir.further,since the arbitration clause has no explicit temporal limitation,our task is to analyze whether the claims aris e out of,or relate to employee employment with cellular sales,joint app.see cogeneration.smith cogeneration int l,cir.
i n light of the strong federal policy in favor of arbitration,the existence of a broad agreement to arbitrate creates a presumption of arbitrability which is only overcome if it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.id.internal quotation marks omitted.however,the federal arbitration act liberal policy in favor of arbitration is limited by the principle that arbitration is a matter of consent,not coercion.specifically,arbitration is a matter of contract,and therefore a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which it has not agreed so to submit.jlm,at alteration in original citations and internal quotation marks omitted.it is axiomatic that w hether enforcing an agreement to arbitrate or construing an arbitration clause,courts and arbitrators must give effect to the contractual rights and expectations of the parties.in this endeavor,as with any other contract,the parties intentions control.stolt nielsen animalfeeds int l,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
when considering whether claims fall within the scope of an arbitration clause,therefore,we analyze the factual allegations made in the plaintiff complaint,at.if the allegations underlying the claims touch matters covered by the parties agreements,then those claims must be arbitrated,whatever the legal labels attached to them.id.internal quotation marks omitted 
to support their argument that the compensation agreement arbitration clause applies only prospectively,pratt and burrell rely heavily on an unpublished opinion in which the fourth circuit interpreted an arbitration agreement in a context quite similar to this case.see newbanks cellular sales of knoxville,app x cir.as newly hired employees of the defendants one of which was cellular sales of knoxville,the newbanks plaintiffs signed compensation agreements that contained an arbitration clause.id.at.as in this case,the plaintiffs
