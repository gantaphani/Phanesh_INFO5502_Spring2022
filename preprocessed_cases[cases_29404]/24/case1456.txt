petitioners unsuccessfully moved to dismiss emard complaint on the ground of inconvenient forum.they argued the subcontract agreement between emard and templeton required emard to submit the dispute to mediation or arbitration in las vegas,nevada,before filing suit.the court ruled that code of civil procedure section section rendered the mediation provision unenforceable 
petitioners filed a petition for writ of mandate asking this court to set aside the trial court order denying their motion to dismiss.alternatively,they seek an order remanding the matter for determination whether the federal arbitration act,section et.faa,preempts section because we conclude the trial court was correct in ruling section controls,and emard was entitled to file suit under the terms of the subcontract agreement with templeton,we need not reach the federal preemption issue.
factual and procedural background 
templeton and emard entered into the subcontract agreement which is the subject of emard civil complaint on september.three paragraphs under the caption disputes relating solely to contractor acts or omissions formed the basis for petitioners motion to dismiss.
paragraph states in relevant part any dispute,claim or controversy collectively referred to as dispute between contractor and subcontractor not relating to or arising from any action or inaction of the owner and not involving the prime contract documents and which can not be settled through negotiation,shall be submitted to mediation administered by the american arbitration association under its commercial mediation rules before resorting to arbitration or litigation as discussed below,unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.either party may make a demand with the american arbitration association to proceed with mediation and this agreement to mediate shall be enforceable at law.mediation is an express condition precedent to the hearing of any arbitration demanded under this article and the mediation proceedings shall take place within twenty days of the mediation demand if either party resorts to arbitration or court action based on a dispute or claim to which this paragraph applies without first attempting to resolve the matter through mediation,then in the discretion of the arbitrator or judge,that party shall not be entitled to recover their attorney fees and costs even if such fees and costs would otherwise be available to that party in any such arbitration or court proceeding.italics added.
paragraph reads in relevant part if,and only if,the parties hereto are unable to resolve the dispute through mediation,then the dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration administered by the american arbitration association in accordance with its construction industry arbitration rules or to litigation at contractor election,and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator s may be confirmed by any court having jurisdiction thereof.unless contractor elects to have the dispute submitted to litigation before a court having jurisdiction thereof,the foregoing agreement to arbitrate shall be specifically enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction italics added.
paragraph provides unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing,any mediation or the arbitration shall be held in las vegas,nevada italics added.
without citing facts in support of their claim,petitioners asserted in their motion papers that emard failed to satisfy the condition precedents sic of resolving their disputes via mediation and arbitration in nevada prior to filing suit.they also maintained that as third party beneficiaries,carefree natomas limited partnership,carefree natomas,lp,and calgp corporation were entitled to assert the same rights under the contract as templeton 
emard responded that section void ed the subcontract agreement to the extent it require d a dispute to be determined outside of california and to the extent it purports to preclude a party from commencing a proceeding in california or california courts.emard represented in its points and authorities in opposition to the motion to dismiss that it had already made a mediation demand,and even after that demand was rejected,offered to stipulate to stay the action to conduct mediation.emard counsel stated in his declaration that he served a mediation demand on templeton on february,he received correspondence from templeton counsel on february,indicating an unwillingness to mediate in california he mailed templeton counsel a letter on february,outlining the requirement of ccp and once again demanding that templeton submit to mediation and on february,he received correspondence from templeton counsel once again rejecting the mediation demand.emard counsel stated he had personally spoken with petitioners counsel on numerous occasions offering to stay this matter and proceed with mediation or arbitration within the state of california.
petitioners did not dispute emard account of the facts surrounding its demand and templeton refusal to conduct mediation in california.instead,petitioners responded that the faa preempted section and the express provisions of the subcontract agreement applied.petitioners urged the court to dismiss emard complaint in its entirety because the parties have contractually agreed to resolve their disputes in an alternate forum.
the court rejected the petitioners argument.its tentative ruling read in part at issue initially is mediation,not arbitration.so,even if the faa would trump section,it would not apply to mediation.further,templeton failure to respond to emard mediation request,as required by paragraph,means that the matter can not go to arbitration.mediation is an express condition precedent to the hearing of any arbitration demanded under this article.id.thus,having failed to mediate neither party may request arbitration 
following the hearing on petitioners motion to dismiss,the court took the matter under submission.it affirmed the tentative ruling with the following modification at the hearing,templeton argued that ccp section does not apply to mediation.under subdivision a of that statute a provision which purports to require any dispute between the parties to be litigated,arbitrated,or otherwise determined outside of california is unenforceable.according to templeton,mediation need not always determine a dispute.yet a dispute might be determined by mediation.the statute does not require more.tellingly,templeton failed to suggest a meaning for the words otherwise determined if not mediation.they must mean something,otherwise they are mere surplusage.the court,of course,must avoid such an interpretation.cooley superior court cal th,d.furthermore,section also renders unenforceable any provision which purports to preclude a party from obtaining a judgment or other resolution in this state or the courts of this state.subdivision b.thus,the mediation requirement,which emard attempted to fulfill,did not preclude it from filing this lawsuit prior to seeking mediation.having determined ccp section applies to the parties agreement to mediate,the court need not address the issue of arbitration
