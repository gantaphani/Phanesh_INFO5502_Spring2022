the union alleged that the medical center violated the agreement because the reorganization resulted in loss of wages to its members was retaliatory because of the engineers safety complaints and was made during a period that was covered by the agreement.
the agreement provides for a sequential process for resolving employment grievances.at step,the union must file its grievance in writing with the medical center.the medical center must respond in writing,and the parties may schedule a step meeting to address the grievance.if the grievance is not resolved at step,the union may then move to step by written request.again,the medical center must respond in writing,and the parties may schedule a step meeting to address the grievance.if the grievance is not resolved at step,then the grievance may be sent to arbitration at step.the union is required to notify the medical center in writing of its intention to arbitrate.the medical center may agree to arbitrate,and the agreement provides procedures for selecting a arbitrator.
on october,valdez inquired whether the medical center would be willing to move the grievance directly to arbitration,which would mean jumping straight to step of the agreement grievance process.that same day,jonathan berke,the medical center labor relations director,denied valdez request,claiming that the union did not provide information explaining how its claim was grievable and arbitrable.berke stated that the matter was not grievable and was precluded from arbitration pursuant to article of the agreement,which excludes the medical center staff reduction decisions from arbitration.
the following day,october,valdez met with berke and patrick smith,the medical center director of facilities management,but the parties were unable to resolve the october grievance during this meeting.smith later described this october event as our step meeting.
on november,smith informed valdez via a formal letter on the medical center letterhead,delivered electronically,that the grievance was not subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of the agreement because it was covered by article,reduction in staff,and not articles,and.this series of events corresponds with step of the agreement grievance process.
on november,valdez requested that the medical center continue to follow the terms of the agreement grievance process and hold a step meeting with the union.berke refused to meet with valdez.on december,berke emailed valdez,stating,i am declining to process this grievance as this matter is neither grievable nor arbitrable.on december,valdez sent an email to berke stating,i f you are refusing to schedule a step ii meeting,we have no choice but to move this matter to the next step arbitration.in response,berke again declined to process the grievance that day.
following the grievance process procedure,in a letter dated january,valdez notified berke that the union appealed the grievance to step arbitration.with this notice,valdez included an additional allegation that the medical center violated article of the agreement by not providing notice and an opportunity to bargain with the union before changing the job description of the bargaining unit.
five months then passed with no response from the medical center.
the medical center finally responded on june.paul beshears,counsel for the medical center,sent a letter to kristina hillman,counsel for the union,advising the union that the medical center had not changed its position and would not arbitrate the grievance based on the express language in article of the agreement.
on july,bruce harland,counsel for the union,responded by letter to the medical center.the union july,letter informed the medical center that the union was complying with the grievance process outlined in article of the agreement and that the june letter from the medical center was the first official communication after the union demanded arbitration in which the medical center informed the union that it would not arbitrate.the union july letter also identified a pattern whereby the employer claims that the union grievance lacks merit,and then refuses to arbitrate.the union july letter urged the medical center to let an arbitrator determine whether or not the employer violated the agreement,just as the parties have bargained for.
proceedings before the district court
