factual background 
primary dispute 
for approximately twenty years,local has represented the employees at the standard concrete plant in corona,california.on october,standard concrete withdrew its recognition of local as the collective bargaining representative of the corona unit employees,and refused to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement with local.local filed charges with the national labor relations board alleging that standard concrete unlawfully withdrew recognition of local as the representative of the corona unit employees.in addition,local filed a petition with the national labor relations board seeking an election to establish its representation of the corona employees.
a month later,local won a new election to represent standard concrete employees at the corona facility.on december,the national labor relations board certified local as the collective bargaining representative of the corona facility employees.after local was recertified,the corona bargaining unit and standard concrete began negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement.
after several negotiating sessions,local determined that standard concrete was negotiating in bad faith.thus,on january,local corona bargaining unit went on strike to compel standard concrete to negotiate in good faith.the corona bargaining unit set up picket lines at standard concrete corona facility and at standard concrete job sites in riverside county.
on january,and january,the corona bargaining unit extended its picket lines to three of standard concrete facilities in orange county el toro,santa ana,and westminster.local also represents the workers at all three standard concrete orange county facilities under the orange county cba.
members of the orange county bargaining unit at all three orange county facilities honored the corona bargaining unit picket line at standard concrete orange county facilities.acting in solidarity with the corona bargaining unit,the orange county bargaining unit members informed standard concrete that they would not cross the corona bargaining unit picket line.none of the orange county bargaining unit members,however,participated in the corona bargaining unit picket line.
after three days of picketing,local and standard concrete agreed in writing to cease picketing at standard concrete orange county facilities from january,to january.in exchange,standard concrete agreed to resume negotiations with the corona bargaining unit.
at the expiration of the period,the corona bargaining unit resumed picketing to pressure standard concrete to negotiate in good faith.from january,to january,the corona bargaining unit again extended its picket lines to the orange county facilities.
members of the orange county bargaining unit again refused to cross the corona bargaining unit picket lines at standard concrete orange county facilities.again,members of the orange county bargaining unit did not join the corona bargaining unit picket lines.
on february,the corona bargaining unit and standard concrete settled their labor dispute.they subsequently entered into a collective bargaining agreement covering the employees at the corona facility.
secondary dispute 
this case arises out of the orange county bargaining unit sympathy strike that honored the corona bargaining unit picket lines at standard concrete orange county facilities.
the orange county cba in effect at the time contained several provisions relevant to this case.the orange county cba begins with a recognition clause,article,section,that states the employer recognizes the union as the exclusive representative for the purposes of collective bargaining for all employees in the bargaining unit working at its locations in westminster,el toro,and santa ana.article ix,section of the orange county cba provides that no employee shall be discharged or discriminated against because of union activities,including his her refusal to cross a picket line approved by the union.article ii,section of the agreement states that for the period of this agreement,neither the union nor its members will cause or take part in any strike and the union and its officers shall do all in their power to prevent strikes.
in addition,the orange county cba includes an arbitration provision.in article xi,section,the grievance procedure establishes a process by which standard concrete and local deal with grievances.
procedural history 
standard concrete did not submit its dispute with the orange county bargaining unit to arbitration.instead,on january,standard concrete filed suit in the united states district court for the central district of california.relevant to this appeal,standard concrete alleged that local violated the no strike provision of the orange county cba.on april,local filed a motion to dismiss the complaint,or in the alternative for summary judgment.local argued that standard concrete violated the orange county cba by failing to arbitrate its dispute with local before bringing suit in district court.
on november,the district court denied local motion to dismiss the complaint.the district court held that standard concrete was not required to arbitrate its complaint with the union because the arbitration clause in the orange county cba requires only employees,and not standard concrete,to arbitrate their grievances.
on march,local moved for summary judgment on the ground that the orange county bargaining unit acted in accordance with the orange county cba when its members honored the corona picket lines.standard concrete filed a for summary judgment,contending that local violated the orange county cba by extending the corona picket lines to standard concrete orange county facilities and encouraging the orange county members to honor the picket lines.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of standard concrete.during oral argument,the court interpreted the no strike clause in the orange county cba to mean that local had an obligation independent of the obligation of the orange county bargaining unit to not cause or take part in any strike.on april,the district court issued a written order holding that local violated the orange county cba because it did not abide by its duty to do all in their power to prevent strikes.the court held that article ii,section was a clear waiver of the union right to participate in a sympathy strike.furthermore,the court held that the orange county bargaining unit refusal to cross the corona bargaining unit picket lines was not a sympathy strike because it was not a different union that set up the line at standard concrete orange county facilities.
the district court held a bench trial to determine the damages standard concrete suffered as a result of local breach of the orange county cba.after a three day bench trial,the district court awarded standard concrete in damages.

discussion 
local argues that the district court erred in holding that the orange county cba did not require standard concrete to arbitrate its dispute with local.the district court decision,local contends,is contrary to the strong presumption in favor of arbitration and this court precedent.standard concrete argues that the district court correctly held that the grievance procedure,by its plain text,only requires employees to arbitrate their disputes.we agree with the district court and hold that the orange county cba did not require standard concrete to arbitrate its grievances with local before filing suit in district court.
under a,congress assigned the courts the duty of determining whether the reluctant party has breached his promise to arbitrate.united steelworkers warrior gulf navigation,d hereinafter warrior gulf navigation see also united food and commercial workers union,local geldin meat,cir hereinafter geldin meat the courts have the duty only to determine whether a party has breached its promise to arbitrate.the final method agreed upon by the parties is declared to be the desirable method for settlement of grievance disputes arising over the application or interpretation of an existing agreement.d.our determination whether the orange county cba required standard concrete to arbitrate its grievances must be strictly confined to the question whether standard concrete did agree to arbitrate.geldin meat,at quoting warrior gulf navigation,at.the party contesting arbitrability bears the burden of demonstrating how the language in the collective bargaining agreement excludes a particular dispute from arbitration.phoenix newspapers,phoenix mailers union local,cir.we are mindful that i n labor contracts with arbitration clauses,the presumption of arbitrability is very strong,dennis gen l.contractor cal.conf.of carpenters,cir,and that doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage,warrior gulf navigation,at.
the plain language of the grievance procedure in the orange county cba,however,overcomes the strong presumption in favor of arbitrating labor disputes.the orange county cba grievance procedure refers only to grievances.to bring a grievance under the orange county cba,a party is required to proceed in three chronological steps the language of steps one and two of the grievance procedure describe only the union and the employees duties in initiating a grievance against standard concrete.an employee having a grievance may first take grievance up with foreman if the grievance is not settled in step one within two working days it shall be presented in writing through the union to the employer.to the extent steps one and two require employer action,they describe only how standard concrete is obligated to respond to an employee grievance the employer shall produce the payroll records that bear upon the grievance.
local bases its argument that standard concrete must arbitrate its dispute with the union on the opening clause of the grievance procedure and on step three.the opening clause,the union argues,refers to the manner that g rievances shall be processed,and is not modified or limited to a particular party,an employee or union.step three states,in relevant part if the grievance is not settled within thirty working days in step two,from the time it was presented in writing,either the employer or the union may,within ten working days thereafter request the federal mediation and conciliation service to submit a list of arbitrators 
local argument that these provisions require standard concrete to arbitrate its grievances is without merit.
because steps one and two refer only to grievances,we can not conclude that the opening clause and step three of the procedure indicate the parties intent that standard concrete submit its grievances with the union to arbitration.first,the opening clause requires a grieving party to follow the chronological steps of the grievance procedure.it is also clear from the language and structure of the grievance procedure that any grievance must go through the steps sequentially.the steps are labeled chronologically as step one,step two,and step three.a party can not reach step three without exhausting steps one and two a grievant may only proceed to the next step of the grievance procedure if he or she is not able to resolve the grievance under the previous step.thus,step three can not refer to the way a new grievance should be filed it refers only to grievances that have gone through steps one and two.
we therefore affirm the district court ruling that standard concrete was not obligated to arbitrate its dispute with local.it is clear from the plain text of the orange county cba that the grievance clause only applies to employee grievances.atkinson sinclair ref,d holding that a cba did not require an employer to arbitrate a dispute where the arbitration procedures in the cba described only an employee grievance procedure and expressly limited the procedure to grievances.
we next consider local liability for damages under the cba.local argues that the district court erred in holding that local violated the orange county cba by engaging in a sympathy strike.local argues that it can not be held liable under the orange county cba because local did not clearly waive its right to take part in a sympathy strike.further,according to local,the district court incorrectly held that the members of the orange county bargaining unit were not technically on a sympathy strike when some of its members refused to cross the corona bargaining unit picket lines.local points out that the district court was incorrect to hold that a bargaining unit does not engage in a sympathy strike when its members refuse to cross the picket line of another bargaining unit represented by the same local union,even though the units are covered under separate cbas.we reverse the district court decision holding local liable for money damages under the orange county cba.
local argues that it did not violate the orange county cba because the agreement did not include a prohibition against sympathy strikes.to support its argument,local relies on children hospital medical center california nurses association,ci
