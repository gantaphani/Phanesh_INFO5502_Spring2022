in,united computer systems ucs signed a software licensing and development agreement with a company that later merged with its corporate parent,at t.this agreement contained a clause that purportedly made arbitration the exclusive means for resolving any claims or controversies between the parties arising under the agreement.the present case involves an action for arbitration by ucs against at t that has yet to be adjudicated by an arbitration panel because counsel for ucs with a singular obstinacy demonstrated throughout this litigation,filed suit in a california state court rather than pay the filing fee demanded by the american arbitration association aaa.in an effort to destroy diversity jurisdiction under,ucs also named jan stredicke,an aaa administrator,as a defendant.nevertheless,on a theory of fraudulent joinder,at t successfully removed this case to federal court pursuant to.the district court then dismissed all claims against stredicke and three corporate defendants,at t,lucent and ncr the district court also granted the corporate defendants motion for sanctions against ucs.the district court entered a total of five judgments against ucs,which are now before this court on appeal.for the following reasons,we affirm in part,reverse in part,vacate in part and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
in,at t information systems,at,then a subsidiary of at t,entered into a software licensing and development agreement the agreement with ucs.according to the agreement,any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement or the breach thereof shall be settled by arbitration in the state of california in accordance with the rules of the american arbitration association then in effect.prior to this case,ucs initiated three prior arbitrations arising from disputes arising under the agreement.arbitrations ii and iii had been consolidated by the aaa,and on june,an arbitration panel rendered a decision for at t and lucent ncr being no longer a party to the dispute,denying all of ucs claims.the panel determined that the license agreement was terminated no later than january,and all claims arising out of or relating to the license agreement either have been or could have been litigated in this arbitration.on september,the arbitration ruling was confirmed by a federal district court.ucs then appealed to this court,proffering thirteen separate grounds for vacatur,which we summarily rejected in an unpublished memorandum decision.see american.united computer systems.cir.
on october,the district court confirmed the award in arbitration but before we upheld its judgment on photocopied its complaint from arbitration iii and served it again as a statement of claims seeking yet another arbitral award arbitration iv.this latest effort now gives rise to the controversy currently before this court.on november,jan stredicke,an employee of the aaa in its los angeles office,sent ucs a letter advising the company that a filing fee was required before the aaa could administratively consider arbitration iv.stredicke letter also advised ucs that the corporate defendants objected to arbitration iv as being duplicative of the claims previously resolved in arbitration.
as indicated,arbitration iv has never taken place because ucs has not come up with the filing fee but has instead commenced a lawsuit in los angeles superior court.under various legal theories arguably premised on the agreement,ucs named stredicke and the various at t corporate entities as defendants,demanded a jury trial and sought damages and a declaratory judgment compelling arbitration.on a theory of fraudulent joinder,the corporate defendants successfully removed the case to federal court.on april,the district court dismissed,under.b,all claims against stredicke.because the district court had recently confirmed an earlier arbitration award based on the same set of operative facts as those underlying the current dispute,the district court ruled on april,that the doctrine of res judicata barred ucs claims against at t,lucent and ncr.an order denying ucs motion to remand to state court was entered on april.and on the same day,ucs filed a rule b motion for relief from judgment in light of this court decision in chiron ortho diagnostic systems,cir.this motion was denied on may.at t then filed a motion for sanctions against ucs and its counsel,steven stanwyck,which was granted on june.
on may,before the district court had ruled on the motion for reconsideration or the motion for sanctions,ucs filed its original notice of appeal,which referenced only the orders entered on april and and omitted the stredicke dismissal,which was entered on april.on july,ucs filed an amended notice of appeal,now referencing the april order stredicke dismissal,the may order denial of the rule b motion and the june order sanctions.

as a threshold matter,both ucs appeal of the stredicke dismissal and the denial of the rule b motion are untimely.the judgment against stredicke was entered by the district court on april.under fed.a a,ucs had thirty days,until may,to file its notice of appeal.the federal rules of appellate procedure state that a notice of appeal must b designate the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed.fed.c.in this case,the original notice of appeal specifying only the april and april judgments was filed before the district court made its ruling on the rule b motion.since that ruling was entered on may,the appeal of the april and the april judgments became effective on that date.see fed.a b i if a party files a notice of appeal after the court announces or enters a before it disposes of any motion listed in rule a a the notice becomes effective to appeal a judgment or order,in whole or in part,when the order disposing of the last such remaining motion is entered.even if we assume that the filing deadline for the stredicke dismissal was thirty days after the court entered the denial of the rule b motion entered on may,which is a plausible but not necessarily correct reading of fed.a a,the latest possible date for filing a timely appeal would have been june.in this case,however,ucs did not file its amended notice of appeal until july.
in summary,this court has jurisdiction only over the april judgment dismissing the corporate defendants,the april judgment denying the motion to remand to state court and the june judgment imposing sanctions on ucs.although we agree with the corporate defendants that the appeal of the rule b ruling is untimely,the merits of that motion,which sought relief based on our ruling in chiron,are nevertheless closely intertwined with the res judicata ruling leading to dismissal of the corporate defendants.but we will return to the importance of chiron in a moment.
with respect to the removal of this case to federal court,the district court order dismissing stredicke contained all the findings requisite to placing this case squarely within our fraudulent joinder doctrine.if a plaintiff fails to state a cause of action against a resident defendant,and the failure is obvious according to the rules of the state,the joinder is fraudulent and the defendant presence in the lawsuit is ignored for purposes of determining diversity.morris princess cruises,cir citing mccabe general foods,cir.the district court found that stredicke is not a party to any relevant contract on which plaintiff could predicate a claim against her.moreover,in reviewing ucs complaint against stredicke and the corporate defendants,it is readily apparent that all three claims against stredicke are predicated frivolously on the agreement between ucs and at.under california law,only a signatory to a contract may be liable for any breach.clemens american warranty,d.citing gold gibbons,d.sessions chrysler,cir.because stredicke was a fraudulently joined defendant,her citizenship is not relevant for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.see morris,at mccabe,at.
because ucs failed to timely appeal the stredicke dismissal,we need not consider the circumstances of the stredicke joinder in any greater detail.however,we must further address the denial of ucs motion to remand to state court because ucs offers additional,alternative grounds for finding the removal to be improper the notice of removal was untimely under b,and at least one of the corporate defendants is a citizen of california,thus destroying diversity jurisdiction under.both of these arguments fail.
on the issue of timeliness,ucs states that it served notice on stredicke on december,which it claims commenced the removal period provided in b.ucs points to teitelbaum soloski,for the proposition that the removal period in a case involving multiple defendants commences with service on the first party.see id.at because all defendants must join the a motion,the period for removal under b commences to run from the date the first defendant receives a copy of the complaint.teitelbaum is an example of the rule,which has been apparently adopted by the majority of courts that have addressed this issue.see mcanally enterprises,mcanally,d,collecting cases on majority rule and minority rule under b and adopting majority position.since notice of removal was not filed until february,ucs maintains that it is untimely.under ucs proposed construction of b,the corporate defendants right to remove this case to federal court would be extinguished before they were first notified of the existence of the lawsuit.
in addition to the fact that ucs proposed standard would encourage unfair litigation tactics,it ignores the crucial fact that the defendant in this case was fraudulently joined.although the usual rule is that all defendants in an action in a state court must join in a petition for removal,see wisconsin of corrections schacht,d kennedy,concurring removal requires the consent of all the defendants.citing chicago,martin.ely valley mines,hartford,cir discussing general unanimity requirement,the rule of unanimity does not apply to nominal,unknown or fraudulently joined parties,see emrich touche ross,cir emphasis added.if the fraudulence of a defendant joinder is irrelevant for purposes of determining diversity,and there is no obligation to join such a defendant in a removal petition,there is no good reason why date of service on a fraudulently joined defendant should commence the time period for removal under b.see charles alan wright,arthur miller,edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed collecting cases for the proposition that the time limits prescribed in section b will be ignored when removal is sought on the ground that some defendants have been joined fraudulently to prevent removal.the notice of removal in this case was therefore timely 
ucs next argues that removal under was improper because at least one of the corporate defendants is a citizen of california.in determining whether there is diversity of citizenship between corporate parties,a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any state by which it has been incorporated and of the state where it has its principal place of business.tosco communities for a better environment,cir quoting c.assuming that reliance on the state of incorporation does not settle the issue of jurisdiction,the principal place of business is determined by the following inquiry in what state does a substantial predominance of corporate activity take place or if the corporation activities are not predominant in a single state,then the principal place of business is where the majority of its executive and administrative functions are performed.id.at.it is relevant that a defendant who removes an action from state court to federal district court bears the burden on appeal of establishing that removal was proper.see duncan al stuetzle,cir citing harris provident life accident ins,cir.
in this case,the corporate defendants have met this burden by submitting the affidavits of knowledgeable company officials specifying the state of incorporation and providing statistics showing the number of corporate employees,income,sales and the location of top management,since these factors determine corporate activity in california or elsewhere.this detailed information sufficiently demonstrates that none of the corporate defendants is a citizen of california for the purposes of c.the district court correctly denied ucs motion to remand to the state court.
the next issue is whether the district court erred in granting the corporate defendants motion to dismiss on the grounds that ucs claims were barred by the res judicata effect of the prior judgment upholding arbitration.although ucs offers several convoluted arguments to establish that the case now before the court is not barred by the final judgment confirming arbitration,these arguments should be addressed to an arbitration panel rather than to a federal court.this case is controlled by our earlier decision in chiron,which held that a res judicata objection based on a prior arbitration proceeding is a legal defense that,in turn,is a component of the dispute on the merits and must be considered by the arbitrator,not the court.at citing national union fire ins.belco petroleum,cir.although the corporate defendants make a forceful argument that this case is nothing more than a naked attempt to claims that were finally laid to rest in arbitration,the merits of the underlying dispute have no bearing on the question of which forum can render a decision on a res judicata defense.here,the language of the agreement is crystal clear any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement or the breach thereof shall be settled by arbitration.emphasis added.
we must also emphasize that confirmation of the arbitration judgment by a federal court has no bearing on resolution of the res judicata issue.in chiron,the parties entered into a business agreement containing an arbitration clause similar to the one at issue here.id.at stating that t he parties arbitration clause is broad and far reaching any dispute,controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the validity,construction,enforceability or performance of this agreement shall be settled by binding alternative dispute resolution.the parties subsequently had a dispute that resulted in an arbitration award.when a second dispute arose,the defendant refused to participate in the arbitration proceedings on the grounds that plaintiff claims were the same as those that were addressed in the first arbitration.id.at.the plaintiff then sued in federal court,requesting an order to compel arbitration under of the federal arbitration act faa.although the district court in chiron entered such an order,it also granted the defendant request that the parties earlier arbitration be confirmed under of the faa.id.on appeal,this court rejected the defendant argument that a confirmation of an earlier arbitration award invests a federal court with the authority to consider a res judicata defense in any subsequent suit.id.at.
the corporate defendants attempt to distinguish chiron on the grounds that the defendant in that case was asserting the res judicata defense in the c
