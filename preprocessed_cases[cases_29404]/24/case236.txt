defendant société générale sg appeals from a decision and order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york daniels,denying its motion to stay this action in favor of arbitration,pursuant to section of the federal arbitration act faa.sg contends that the counterclaims it has asserted against plaintiff fsp,fsp implicate fsp activities and should therefore be arbitrated pursuant to the rules of the new york stock exchange nyse or exchange,of which fsp is a member.we affirm based on the record before us,but remand for further consideration in light of the claims made in sg answer,which the district court did not have when it decided the motion to stay.
background 
fsp,formerly known as cowen,is the general partner of financial square partners,formerly known as cowen cowen.in february,sg and fsp executed an acquisition agreement by which sg acquired substantially all of the investment banking and brokerage business of cowen pursuant to the acquisition agreement,sg assumed certain liabilities and agreed to indemnify and defend fsp against losses resulting from the assumed liabilities.the acquisition agreement also states that if a dispute arises concerning the obligation to indemnify and defend,and if the parties can not resolve that dispute amicably,any party may institute suit against the other party in the united states district court located in new york,new york,to resolve the matter.acquisition agreement.just such a dispute has arisen in this case.
in january,it was revealed that a broker named frank gruttadauria committed multiple acts of securities fraud while employed by cowen.soon after these revelations came to light,multiple lawsuits alleging,inter alia,common law fraud and violations of federal and state securities laws were filed against various entities that employed gruttadauria,including fsp fsp then wrote to sg claiming a right to indemnification and defense pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement.sg responded by suggesting that it may not be required to indemnify fsp against losses attributed to gruttadauria fraud if fsp knew or recklessly avoided knowledge through faulty procedures or otherwise of gruttadauria improper activities.sg did not dispute,however,that the losses for which fsp might become liable as a result of the lawsuits were within the definition of assumed liabilities under the acquisition agreement and therefore would be within the scope of its indemnity provisions.
fsp then filed a declaratory judgment action in the district court,seeking a declaration that sg is bound to indemnify and defend fsp in connection with the lawsuits.before filing an answer,defenses or counterclaims,sg moved to stay that action in favor of arbitration,pursuant to of the faa it argued that,because fsp was a member of the exchange,by virtue of its ownership of cowen,and because sg own defense to the claims of indemnification and defense implicate fsp conduct,the rules and constitution of the nyse mandate arbitration of the indemnification and defense claims.sg also argued in the district court that even if its dispute with fsp is not,its allegation of fsp misconduct in failing to uncover gruttadauria fraud places in issue fsp business practices,which is sufficient to bring this dispute within the mandatory arbitration rules of the exchange.see fsp,société générale,wl at,dist.lexis,at.
fsp argued that the instant dispute is simply one of contract interpretation,as sg obligation to defend and indemnify arises out of the acquisition agreement.moreover,fsp asserted that of the acquisition agreement evinces the parties intent to have disputes resolved in a judicial forum.
the district court denied the motion to stay,finding that the parties dispute does not concern business.rather,it found that t his is simply a contractual dispute wholly separate and apart from plaintiff activities.id.at,lexis at.notably,however,the district court did not have the benefit of sg answer,which may contain more specific facts or claims concerning fsp alleged misconduct.sg appeals the denial of the motion to stay.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court denial of a motion to stay an action in favor of arbitration de novo.in re salomon.shareholders derivative,cir.
a.the requirement 
although the faa expresses a strong federal policy favoring arbitration,see oldroyd elmira sav.bank,fsb,cir,arbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf navigation,d see also bell cendant,cir.sg argues that the constitution and rules of the exchange,which bind fsp,provide the requisite arbitration agreement in this case.
the constitution of the nyse provides in relevant part,any controversy between a member and any other person arising out of the business of such member shall at the instance of any such party,be submitted for arbitration.nyse const.art.xi.furthermore,rule a of the nyse arbitration rules provides that a ny dispute,claim or controversy between a and a member arising in connection with the business of such member shall be arbitrated under the constitution and rules of the new york stock exchange upon the demand of the.these provisions are sufficient in and of themselves to compel arbitration of covered disputes under of the faa.paine,webber,jackson curtis,chase manhattan bank,cir.of the exchange may invoke these rules in certain cases as third party beneficiaries.see spear,leeds kellogg central life assur,cir stating that decisional law recognizes that the faa requires the enforcement of an arbitration agreement not just in favor of parties to the agreement,but also in favor of third party beneficiaries of the members agreement to abide by the exchange constitution and rules when they join the nyse.
this court has,on several occasions,considered whether a particular dispute is covered by the exchange constitution and rules.we have held that when a member of the exchange accuses a of wrongdoing,the may compel arbitration of that dispute only when the dispute arises out of the member business.paine,webber,at.the difference in this case is that the member,rather than the,is being accused of wrongdoing.we have expressly left open the question of whether the underlying dispute in a case such as this,where it is the member conduct at issue,also must be.see id.at we wish to note that we are not deciding today whether a could compel arbitration of a dispute in an action in which the alleged wrongdoer is an exchange member and the transaction is not related to exchange business.we acknowledge that,depending on the facts,such a situation might come within the purview of an arbitration agreement adopted in light of the congressional mandate to exchanges of.
in haviland goldman,sachs,cir,plaintiff,a member of the nyse,accused a affiliate of goldman sachs of wrongdoing.the affiliate motion to stay the action in favor of arbitration was denied by the district court,and this court affirmed,based on the absence of an dispute.we noted in passing that if the affiliate had alleged misconduct by the plaintiff a broader reading of the arbitration rules may be warranted,because of the exchange interest in the business conduct of its members.id.at.in that case,however,it was not necessary to decide that question,because no misconduct by the plaintiff has been put in issue.id.
in a more recent case where,like the present case,a accused a member of misconduct,this court reversed the district court grant of a preliminary injunction enjoining arbitration,because the underlying dispute was.see spear,leeds kellogg,at.in light of that finding,we declined to decide whether the requirement ought to apply generally in cases where the alleges misconduct by the member.see id.at.
b.the instant appeal 
on appeal,sg,not a member of the exchange,argues that its dispute with fsp is to the extent that sg contractual obligation to defend and indemnify depends upon whether fsp bears any responsibility for the fraud committed by gruttadauria through its own misconduct in supervising him or in failing to uncover his fraud.alte
