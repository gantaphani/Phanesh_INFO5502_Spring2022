in green tree financial bazzle,d,the supreme court has held that in arbitration proceedings governed by the federal arbitration act faa et,where an arbitration agreement is silent on the issue of whether relief is available,an arbitrator,not a court,should resolve the class arbitration issue.in this case,which is also governed by the faa,we hold that the arbitrator should likewise decide whether the parties arbitration agreement permits consolidation of two arbitration proceedings.
facts and procedural history 
petitioner henry yuen is the founder and former president of gemstar.petitioner elsie ma leung is gemstar former chief financial officer.yuen developed the vcr system that allows a viewer to videotape television programs using a code.tv guide international acquired gemstar,now known as guide international.upon the sale of gemstar to tv guide,yuen and leung became gemstar employees.as part of the acquisition,yuen and leung each signed five written agreements,collectively referred to as the restructuring agreements.each agreement provided that the parties would submit any dispute involving the agreements to binding arbitration under the rules of the american arbitration association aaa.the arbitration was to be held in the state of new york but california law would apply 
the employment agreements also provided that yuen and leung could be terminated for cause.gemstar terminated both yuen and leung employment agreements on april,based on,among other things,alleged financial irregularities revealed in an accounting report.
on may,yuen and leung initiated separate aaa arbitration proceedings in new york.their arbitration demands are substantially identical.on june,the aaa provided petitioners counsel lists of potential arbitrators.each list contained different names.on july,petitioners counsel submitted petitioners arbitrator selection list.again,the list was different for each petitioner.on that same date,gemstar filed a consolidated answer and counterclaim.
on july,the aaa submitted to counsel a panel of arbitrators for each proceeding.there was a short delay in the yuen proceeding after yuen objected to the appointment of one of the arbitrators.the leung panel was appointed on august,and a replacement arbitrator was selected for the yuen panel on september.
gemstar raised the matter of consolidation during conferences with the arbitrators in september.the panels advised counsel that absent the parties agreement or a court order,the aaa did not have jurisdiction to consolidate the proceedings.the aaa case manager confirmed the aaa position in a letter to counsel dated october.
in early october,both sides commenced discovery in the leung proceeding.additional matters,including leung motions to dismiss gemstar counter claims and to advance attorney fees,were submitted to the arbitration panel.
yuen and leung would not agree to consolidate the arbitrations.on november,gemstar filed before respondent court a motion to consolidate the arbitrations pursuant to code of civil procedure section.that section provides that a court may order consolidation of separate arbitration proceedings where separate arbitration agreements or proceedings exist between the same parties or one party is a party to a separate arbitration agreement or proceeding with a third party and the disputes arise from the same transactions or series of related transactions and there is common issue or issues or law or fact creating the possibility of conflicting rulings by more than one arbitrator or panel of arbitrators.
respondent court granted the motion to consolidate in an order filed november.the court found it would be appropriate to consolidate the two arbitration proceedings because the facts alleged in the demands for arbitration were virtually identical,many of the same witnesses would testify in both proceedings,and counsel were the same in both proceedings.the court found that s eparate arbitrations would be costly,involve duplicative witnesses and might result in conflicting rulings by the respective aaa arbitration panels.the court found that the only remaining issue to be determined was whether section applied.neither party had cited or discussed green tree,and respondent court did not refer to green tree in its order granting the motion to consolidate.instead,the court based its analysis on california case law and earlier supreme court cases,particularly volt information sciences,board of trustees of leland stanford junior university,d,in which the court held that the faa did not preclude a california court from applying california procedural statutes governing arbitration.

discussion 
congress enacted the faa to overrule the judiciary refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate,volt,supra,at.the faa passage was motivated,first and foremost,by a congressional desire to enforce agreements into which parties had entered,citing dean witter reynolds byrd,d.
beyond ensuring that courts would enforce arbitration agreements covered by the faa,congress made no federal policy favoring arbitration under a certain set of procedural rules volt,supra,at.prior to the supreme court decision in green tree,california courts applied california statutes governing arbitration procedures to arbitrations covered by the faa.garcia directv th,d blue cross of california superior court th,d.
green tree,a commercial lender,was the defendant in two class actions bazzle and lackey filed by disgruntled customers.the plaintiffs loan agreements included a clause providing for arbitration of all disputes,but was silent on the issue of whether a arbitration was permissible.green tree moved to compel arbitration in both cases.the arbitrator who arbitrated both cases certified class arbitrations and ultimately ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in both cases.
among green tree arguments on appeal was that the matters should not have proceeded as class arbitrations because the contract prohibited them.the south carolina supreme court held that because the arbitration clauses were silent on the issue,state law applied.interpreting south carolina law,the court interpreted the agreements as permitting class arbitration.the supreme court granted certiorari to determine whether that ruling conflicted with the faa.
the supreme court held that the issue of whether the parties contract permitted class arbitration was a matter of state law contract interpretation that the arbitrator,not the court,should resolve.although a court should decide certain gateway matters,such as whether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement at all or whether a concededly binding arbitration clause applies to a certain type of controversy,issues that do not involve either the validity of the arbitration clause nor its applicability to the underlying dispute between the parties are for the arbitrator,not the court,to resolve 
t he question is not whether the parties wanted a judge or arbitrator to decide whether they agreed to arbitrate a matter.citation.rather,the relevant question here is what kind of arbitration proceeding the parties agreed to.that question does not concern a state statute or judicial procedures.citation.it concerns contract interpretation and arbitration procedures.arbitrators are well situated to answer that question.given these considerations,along with the arbitration contracts sweeping language concerning the scope of the questions submitted to arbitration,this matter of contract interpretation should be for the arbitrator,not the courts,to decide.citation.green tree,supra.at,original italics.
thus,under the line drawn by the supreme court in green tree,the court decides whether the matter should be referred to arbitration,but once a matter has been referred to arbitration,the court involvement is strictly limited until the arbitration is completed.finley saturn of roseville th,d.
the contracts in this case contain a california provision with an equally broad arbitration clause stating that all disputes relating to the contract shall be submitted to arbitration.green tree mandates that consolidation is such an issue.
although it declined to resolve the consolidation issue at the time gemstar informally requested consolidation,the aaa,in direct response to green tree,has recognized the impact of that case by adopting supplementary rules for class arbitration.pursuant to these supplementary rules,effective october,the aaa has agreed to administer demands for class arbitration where the underlying agreement specifies that disputes arising out of the parties agreement shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with any of the association rules,and the agreement is silent with respect to class claims,consolidation or joinder of claims.http,rules,supplementary rules for class arbitration.although these rules are specific to class arbitrations,and a request for consolidation may involve somewhat different considerations,the rules nonetheless provide an administrative mechanism by which the aaa may consider the consolidation issue raised here.
disposition 
the petition for writ of mandate is granted.a peremptory writ shall issue directing respondent court to vacate its order of november,granting defendant motion to consolidate separate arbitrations,and enter a new and different order denying the motion without prejudice to submitting the matter to the american arbitration association.the parties are to bear their own costs.
introduction 
this case involves a trial court order pursuant to code of civil procedure section compelling consolidation of two arbitrations involving different claimants with identical employment agreements with the same defendant.the majority hold that a california trial court may not,under a state statute and over the objection of one of the parties,compel consolidation of two arbitrations that involve interstate commerce,and that the issue of consolidation should be left to the arbitrator the majority state that the case is governed by the federal arbitration act,section,et.faa,and rely upon green tree financial bazzle,d green tree,a case that dealt with a class arbitration rather than consolidation pursuant to a state statute.
i come to the same conclusion as the majority and explain why i do so.interpreting the clauses in the agreements,i determine that the parties did not intend to incorporate state arbitration law,and that is why the faa applies.in the past,a majority of federal courts have held that the faa did not authorize the consolidation of arbitrations absent the agreement of the parties.in green tree,supra,d,a plurality of the united states supreme court held that the arbitrator should determine whether an arbitration agreement subject to the faa permitted or precluded class arbitration.the reasoning of green tree should result in the arbitrator or arbitrators deciding whether the arbitration agreements in this case permit consolidation and whether the arbitrations should be consolidated.
agreements 
the agreements provide that any dispute,controversy,claim or disagreement shall be resolved pursuant to confidential binding arbitration in new york,new york by a panel of three neutral arbitrators.the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the commercial rules of the american arbitration association then in effect.the agreements also state,this agreement,the legal relations between the parties and any action,whether contractual or,instituted by any party with respect to matters arising under or growing out of or in connection with or in respect of this agreement,the relationship of the parties or the subject matter hereof shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of california applicable to contracts made and performed in such state and without regard to conflicts of law doctrines.
applicable laws 
code of civil procedure section specifically authorizes the trial court to consolidate arbitrations under circumstances that existed in this case.any written agreement to arbitrate in a contract involving interstate commerce is subject to the faa.the parties to such an agreement may,however,make applicable state rules governing the conduct of arbitration,as long as state law is not preempted by the faa.volt information sciences,board of trustees,d.the transactions here are in interstate commerce.consequently,unless the parties agreed to apply state arbitration law that was not preempted,the faa would apply.
federal decisions before green tree 
a majority of federal appeal court decisions before green tree,supra,d,held that consolidation of arbitrations governed by the faa may not be compelled absent the parties express consent.see oehmke,commercial arbitration ed,domke on commercial arbitration ed,williston on contracts ed,jeydel,consolidation,joinder and class actions what arbitrators and courts may and may not do.disp.resol.shamoon tencate,absence of consent trumps arbitral economy consolidation of arbitrations under law am.int l arb,consolidation by federal courts of arbitration proceedings brought under federal arbitration act fed.courts have suggested when interstate commerce is involved,federal law does not preempt applicable state laws that permit compelling consolidation of arbitration proceedings.see new england energy,keystone shipping cir blue cross of california superior court th,d no preemption of state law allowing class arbitrations.
one authority has noted that t he driving force behind the majority of federal circuits that deny consolidation absent an explicit agreement of all parties is the lack of an underlying contract among all parties to arbitrate in a single proceeding.the law of contract is the cornerstone of arbitration.for example,an agreement by parties a and b to arbitrate a dispute does not mean,ipso facto,that parties a and b have also agreed to arbitrate in the same room at the same time before the same arbitrators some previously unimagined issues of law and fact with parties x and beyond arbitration traditional carrots of relative speed and greater economy,privacy is the other leg in this troika of features.parties a and b may not want their business affairs laundered in public,trade secrets,processes,procedures,methods,because forcing consolidated arbitrations may compromise business secrecy and confidentiality.contractual silence on the issue of consolidation should not be construed as consent to consolidation.parties legitimate expectations about arbitration and all of its nuances should be valued,even absent an express prohibition on consolidation in an arbitration agreement.parties have successfully opposed consolidation by proving it would undermine their stated expectations,especially regarding the arbitrator selection procedures.oehmke,supra,at.
matters to be decided by court or arbitrator 
a shift in the law could have been anticipated as a result of the united states supreme court decision in howsam dean witter reynolds,d howsam.in that case,the court held that the application of a national association of securities dealers nasd rule imposing a time limit on submission of disputes for arbitration was a matter for the arbitrator rather than the court.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court distinguished between a narrow category of questions of arbitrability that are to be resolved by the courts unless the parties have clearly agreed otherwise,and a broader category of other procedural issues that are presumptively reserved for the arbitrator resolution.id.at.the narrow category includes disputes about whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration clause and whether an arbitration clause in a concededly binding contract applies to a particular type of controversy.id.at.the broader category,by contrast,includes procedural questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition and disputes about such defenses to arbitrability as waiver,estoppel,laches,and time limits.id.at.the court concluded that the nasd rule on time limits fell into this second,broader category of issues to be determined by an arbitrator.id.at.
after howsam,supra,d,the court in shaw supermarkets,united food and commercial workers union,local cir,was faced with a united states district court order requiring plaintiff to arbit
