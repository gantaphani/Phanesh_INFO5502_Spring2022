a general contractor challenges the superior court decision to confirm an arbitration award,contending the award should have been vacated because the arbitrator violated his disclosure obligation.the general contractor argues that the arbitrator was required to disclose his law firm representation of a company that owed the general contractor over million.the record demonstrates that another attorney in the arbitrator law firm represented the debtor company at the beginning of a bankruptcy proceeding the debtor company interests were adverse to the general contractor interests those adverse interests resulted in litigation between the debtor company and the general contractor the arbitrator law firm had withdrawn from representing the debtor company before the litigation between the debtor company and the general contractor began and the arbitrator was appointed in the present case a year and a half after his firm withdrawal as attorney of record for the debtor company in its bankruptcy proceeding.
neither the california arbitration act caa the ethics standards for contractual arbitration,nor the cases applying those provisions address specifically the disclosure of an arbitrator legal representation of a third party who has an adversarial relationship with a party to the arbitration.we conclude,therefore,that the applicable rule of law is the general requirement that a proposed neutral arbitrator shall disclose all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be able to be impartial,subd.a.
the application of this general requirement to the issue presented in this case poses a question of fact that is subject to review under the deferential substantial evidence standard we conclude that the superior court finding that disclosure was not required is supported by substantial evidence.
consequently,we will affirm the judgment entered after the arbitration award was confirmed.

discussion 
deficiencies in the tentative ruling 
we first consider agrisystems claim that the proceeding should be remanded to the lower court because its tentative ruling insufficiently analyzes whether any conflict exists.
none of the cases cited by agrisystems addresses the level of detail that a superior court must set forth when ruling on a petition to confirm an arbitration award.in addition,agrisystems fails to cite the provision of the caa that addresses the contents of the superior court written decision.section provides a statement of decision shall be made by the court,if requested pursuant to section,whenever an order or judgment,except a special order after final judgment,is made that is appealable under this title.the implication of this provision is that the superior court has no obligation to prepare a statement of decision unless a party requests one,stermer modiano construction d.under,findings of fact and conclusion of law are not required unless requested.
agrisystems appellate brief includes no citation to the record that demonstrates a request for a statement of decision was made in accordance with section.nor has our own review of the appellate record uncovered such a request.
consequently,agrisystems has failed to demonstrate that it followed the process set forth in in re marriage of arceneaux cal d,for asserting that a trial court tentative decision is deficient.the first step requires the party to request a statement of decision as to specific issues to obtain an explanation of the trial court tentative decision.id.at.the second step requires the party to bring the purported deficiencies in the statement of decision to the attention of the trial court.in re marriage of arceneaux,at.pursuant to section,a party must point out deficiencies in the statement of decision as a condition of avoiding implied findings that support the judgment.
the legal consequences of agrisystems failure to follow the process are that the superior court did not commit reversible error by failing to provide a more detailed rationale for its order confirming the arbitration award and the appellate court will imply findings to support the judgment.in re marriage of arceneaux,supra,cal d at,see.
thus,we reject agrisystems argument that the trial court committed procedural error by providing an insufficient analysis of the alleged conflict.
ii.collateral estoppel 
iii.arbitrator obligation to disclose relationships adverse to a party 
rules regarding disclosure 
the caa addresses the disclosures that a proposed neutral arbitrator must make to the parties as well as the consequences of failing to make a required disclosure.
section,subdivision a provides that a court shall vacate an arbitration award if the arbitrator failed to disclose within the time required for disclosure a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was then aware.see casden park la brea retail llc ross dress for less,th,d in dispute,neutral arbitrator on a panel had no duty to disclose coworkers business dealings with tenant and arbitrator chosen by tenant where neutral arbitrator was unaware of coworkers transactions see also luce,forward,hamilton scripps,llp koch th,d vacatur of arbitration award was not required where arbitrator refused to disqualify himself based on disclosures he was not legally required to make.
statutory disclosure provisions 
section,subdivision a sets forth the general requirement that a proposed neutral arbitrator shall disclose all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be able to be impartial.the subdivision also provides a nonexclusive list of matters that qualify for disclosure under this general standard.the list identifies specific matters that must be disclosed and incorporates disclosure standards from other sources.
the specific matters that must be disclosed include 
any relationship the proposed neutral arbitrator has or had with any party or lawyer for a party to the arbitration proceeding.any professional or significant personal relationship the proposed neutral arbitrator has or has had with any party to the arbitration proceeding or lawyer for a party,subd.a.
the incorporated disclosure standards include the existence of any ground specified in section for disqualification of a judge any matters required to be disclosed by the ethics standards for neutral arbitrators adopted by the judicial council pursuant to this chapter,subd.a.
the only provisions of section mentioned in agrisystems opening appellate brief are from subdivision a a,which requires a judge to step aside if f or any reason i the judge believes his or her recusal would further the interests of justice.ii the judge believes there is a substantial doubt as to his or her capacity to be impartial.iii a person aware of the facts might reasonably entertain a doubt that the judge would be able to be impartial.the latter of these three requirements is similar to the general standard contained in section,subdivision a.
ethical standards 
in section,subdivision a,the legislature directed that,b eginning july,a person serving as a neutral arbitrator pursuant to an arbitration agreement shall comply with the ethics standards for arbitrators adopted by the judicial council.
the judicial council adopted the california rules of court,ethics standards for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitrations standards.standard requires the proposed arbitrator to make comprehensive disclosures regarding potential grounds for disqualification.
subparagraphs through of standard d specify the information that must be disclosed.the only one of these paragraphs addressed in agrisystems opening appellate brief is standard d,which provides for the disclosure of a ny relationship the arbitrator has or has had with a party or lawyer for a party.
agrisystems correctly acknowledges that standard d does not mention explicitly the disclosure of an arbitrator past or current legal representation of a third party with interests adverse to a party to the arbitration.the lack of a specific disclosure requirement,however,is not fatal to agrisystems claim.the comment to standard states 
while the remaining subparagraphs of standard d require the disclosure of specific interests,relationships,or affiliations,these are only examples of common matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the arbitrator would be able to be impartial.the absence of the particular interests,relationships,or affiliations listed in the subparagraphs does not necessarily mean that there is no matter that could reasonably raise a question about the arbitrator ability to be impartial and that therefore must be disclosed.cal.rules of court,ethics standards for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitration,com.to std.
contentions of the parties 
agrisystems relies primarily on two provisions to support its contention that the arbitrator was required to disclose his relationship with coast grain company.first,agrisystems quotes standard d,which requires disclosure of a ny relationship the arbitrator has or has had with a party or lawyer for a party,and contends that it simply means that the arbitrator should have disclosed that he was a member of the firm that represented coast grain company in its chapter reorganization.second,under the general disclosure standard,agrisystems contends that a person aware of the facts might reasonably entertain a doubt that the arbitrator would be able to be impartial,subd.a std.d a see,subd.a a iii.
foster contends that there was no existing adverse relationship to disclose at the time that the arbitrator was proposed and appointed,whether disclosure was required is a factual question for the trier of fact,the superior court findings are subject to review under the substantial evidence standard,and those findings are supported by substantial evidence.
