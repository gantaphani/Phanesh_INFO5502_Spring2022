a.the arbitration demand 
on july,irwin filed an arbitration complaint against lmb and cabot lyman,claiming damages related to the allegedly defective construction of a foot custom sailing vessel irwin alleged that lmb and cabot lyman had agreed to build the vessel with the best practices for quality yacht construction using the highest quality materials for a price of.however,there were cost overruns,and irwin eventually ended up paying over for the completed vessel.moreover,upon lmb delivery of the vessel to irwin,irwin allegedly discovered multiple defects,which necessitated a series of rejections and repairs.as of the date of filing of the arbitration complaint,the quality of the vessel was still unsatisfactory to irwin.
that complaint alleged eight causes of action intentional fraud,negligent misrepresentation,constructive fraud,breach of contract,rejection and revocation of acceptance under the uniform commercial code,breach of the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose,breach of the implied warranty of merchantability,and violations of maine unfair trade practices laws.irwin requested rescission of the agreement and a refund and damages for the time he spent and the expenses he incurred during the period when he repeatedly rejected the yacht because of its defects,as well as the return of the amounts overpaid to lmb and cabot lyman and the difference between the value of the highest quality version of the vessel that lmb and cabot lyman represented that irwin would receive and the actual version irwin received.he also requested punitive damages,attorneys fees and costs,interest,and such other and further relief as the court deems just and proper.
the arbitration complaint contained two paragraphs naming cabot lyman.first,irwin alleged that cabot lyman,the controlling owner of lmb,was the alter ego of the corporation,and alleged that a unity of interest exists between cabot lyman and lmb and injustice and fraud can only be avoided by piercing the corporate veil and holding cabot lyman jointly and severally liable for the wrongs alleged.
second,in the course of alleging violations of maine unfair trade practices laws,the complaint stated that lmb and cabot lyman 
made further repeated representations and promises to irwin about best practices and highest quality construction that they guaranteed for the completion of the vessel for example,cabot lyman expressly represented to irwin that he had extensive experience sailing worldwide including in the caribbean and he was aware of the most common problems irwin would encounter during his travels in tropical and other varying conditions as such he assured the vessel would be completed to withstand these issues.
after the insurer refused their request for defense,lmb hired a law firm,thompson bowie,llp,to represent both it and cabot lyman in the arbitration.that firm then filed this lawsuit on behalf of the insureds,seeking to recover from northern assurance the costs and attorneys fees incurred in the arbitration lmb and cabot lyman also brought a claim for unfair claims settlement practices,contending that northern assurance had not made a coverage decision in a timely manner.
