the primary issue before us is whether a plaintiff may dismiss a complaint in the trial court after the case has been ordered into arbitration,but before an arbitration has commenced.we conclude that there is nothing to preclude such a dismissal and that after a dismissal,the trial court no longer has jurisdiction to order the parties to complete the arbitration.
procedural history and statement of facts 
the facts are undisputed.this case involves two separate contracts.the purpose of the first contract was to document an investment in a limited partnership,and the second was a guarantee of the first.
in or around june,petitioner cardiff equities,cardiff,a california corporation with a principal place of business in los angeles,entered into a contract with robert iii,a real estate developer,pursuant to which cardiff made an investment of million as a limited partner in the formation of myrtle beach partners,lp mbp,a delaware limited partnership,to purchase,fund,and ultimately develop real property located in myrtle beach,south carolina the partnership agreement.this agreement contained an arbitration provision.
cardiff and also entered into a second agreement the guaranty,pursuant to which absolutely and unconditionally guaranteed to cardiff the repayment of cardiff full investment in mbp,plus an agreed return,on or before july.this agreement provided that was the sole member and manager of rwo acquisitions,llc,a delaware limited liability company,which was the general partner of mbp.the guaranty provided as follows this is a guaranty of payment and not of collection and independent promise by to pay and perform,and further waives any right to require that any action be brought against the partnership or any other person or party or to require that resort be had to any security or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of cardiff in favor of or any other person or party.the obligations hereunder are independent of the obligations of the partnership or any other person or entity to cardiff,and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against whether action is brought against the partnership or any other person or entity or whether any other person or entity be joined in any such action or actions and waives the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting his covenants,obligations and liabilities hereunder or the enforcement thereof.
the guaranty did not contain an arbitration provision.
on june,cardiff filed case no.case against,mbp,myrtle beach consolidated partners,mbcp,myrtle beach acquisitions,llc,mbc acquisitions,llc,and withers preserve management company,llc collectively the defendants.cardiff sued for breach of both the partnership agreement and the guaranty,copies of which were attached as exhibits to the complaint.cardiff alleged that the defendants breached these agreements by,failing to pay monies due to cardiff,by refusing to provide cardiff with access to mbp books and records,by refusing to account for profits of mbp,by misstating the results of mbp operations and the impact of its merger into mbcp,by failing to provide reports to cardiff,and by employing certain accounting improprieties designed to understate amounts due to mbp limited partners.
in response to the complaint,the defendants moved to compel arbitration and to stay trial proceedings pending completion of the arbitration.code civ.cardiff opposed the motion on the basis that the guaranty,rather than the partnership agreement,was the key document at issue in the case.citing section,subdivision c,cardiff argued that because the tort causes of action and the claims under the guaranty were not arbitrable,the court should allow the civil action to proceed,even if some or all of the claims under the partnership agreement had to be arbitrated at a later date 
the trial court granted the defendants motion to compel arbitration and ordered the trial proceeding stayed pending completion of the arbitration.the court found the gravamen of the action concerned the partnership agreement,which contained an arbitration provision to which cardiff was a signatory the nonsignatory affiliate defendants were entitled to invoke the arbitration clause in the partnership agreement because the causes of action against them were intimately founded in and intertwined with the underlying partnership agreement the guaranty was also a subject of the action the guaranty did not make the los angeles courts the exclusive jurisdiction for resolving the parties dispute the arbitration clause in the partnership agreement made arbitration before the american arbitration association aaa in new york the exclusive forum for resolving the parties dispute the partnership agreement provided that delaware law,as stated in james jackson,llc willie gary,llc,governed the arbitrability of the dispute delaware law had adopted the majority federal view that reference to the aaa rules evidences a clear and unmistakable intent to submit arbitrability issues to an arbitrator and the partnership agreement referenced the aaa rules.
cardiff did not seek review of the order by writ petition 
on october,cardiff filed an ex parte motion to shorten time to hear a motion to lift the stay imposed in case and for permission to file a,first amended complaint.the proposed pleading named as the sole defendant and,according to cardiff,deleted the claims that the court previously ruled were subject to arbitration and assert ed only legally separate claims that are not subject to arbitration.in opposition,the defendants argued that the ex parte motion was a violation of the order staying case and a thinly disguised motion for reconsideration of the order compelling arbitration.
cardiff ex parte motion to lift the stay was granted and a hearing was set on november,for the motion to amend.on october,cardiff filed a request for dismissal without prejudice of case.cardiff notified the court that it was taking its motion to amend the complaint off calendar.
on october,cardiff filed case no.case,naming as the sole defendant.the complaint,which was identical to the amended complaint cardiff had sought to file in case,restated some,but not all,of the claims asserted in case.at the same time that cardiff filed the complaint in case,it filed a notice in accordance with los angeles superior court local rule advising the court that case had been dismissed without prejudice and that the two cases were related because they involve d the same parties and were based on the same or similar claims.
on november,the superior court clerk entered the dismissal of case as requested by cardiff.
on november,the trial court found that case and case were related and set the matter for a status conference in december.
on november,filed a motion to stay case pursuant to section on the basis that the controversy alleged therein had been ordered to arbitration.requested sanctions for cardiff attempt to circumvent the trial court order compelling arbitration in case.
cardiff opposed the stay motion,claiming it had the absolute right to dismiss its prior action and thereafter to pursue only claims against under the guaranty.
on december,the trial court set a status conference for january,for cardiff counsel to file a brief informing the court of the selection of the arbitrator and the progress made in the arbitration on case.
on january,the trial court granted motion to stay case,concluding that the dismissal does effect the underlying order compelling arbitration.the trial court then signed the order with the finding that the complaint filed in case is nothing other than an attempt to plead around the court prior ruling compelling arbitration in case.the court previously issued an arbitration order in case in october,after making a finding that the claims asserted in case were subject to arbitration under the relevant partnership agreement since all of the claims were intimately founded on and intertwined with the underlying partnership agreement.the court finds that the claims as presently alleged in the instant case are also intimately founded o n and intertwined with the underlying partnership agreement and,therefore,is hereby stayed pending the arbitration in case pursuant to section.the court denied request for sanctions.
in february,cardiff petitioned this court for a writ of mandate compelling the trial court to vacate its order granting motion to stay case and to issue a new order denying the motion.thereafter,we issued an order to show cause why the requested relief should not be granted.
ii.contention 
cardiff contends that the voluntary dismissal of case,even after an order compelling arbitration was entered,coupled with the filing of case,divests the trial court of jurisdiction,and thus precludes the court from making further orders in case.cardiff also contends that dismissal of case and filing of case removes any impediment to cardiff plan to immediately litigate its guaranty claims in the trial court and to arbitrate its partnership agreement claims partnership claims at a later date,if at all.cardiff contends that the trial court erred in staying case.
iii.discussion 
de novo standard of review is required.
ordinarily a trial court decision to stay an action at law when a controversy has been ordered to arbitration is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.henry alcove inv.d.controversy ordered to arbitration pursuant to section and stay imposed.however,to resolve the question of whether case was properly stayed pursuant to section we must first decide whether cardiff voluntary dismissal of case and subsequent filing of case set aside the order,or portion thereof,compelling arbitration.the underlying decisive facts are undisputed.accordingly,we are presented with a legal question we decide de novo.see crocker bank city and county of san francisco cal d,application of a statute to undisputed facts presents a question of law subject to independent appellate determination.
cardiff actions severed the guaranty claims from the partnership claims,thereby relieving cardiff of the obligation of arbitrating its guaranty claims.
voluntary dismissal of case.
we first consider whether a plaintiff may voluntarily dismiss a case after a motion to compel arbitration of the case has been granted,but before arbitration has commenced.
real parties contend that dismissal could only be ordered by the arbitral forum.their reliance on blake ecker th,d,disapproved on other grounds in le francois goel cal th,d,is misplaced.in blake,one day after the trial court ordered a claim to arbitration,the decision in armendariz foundation health psychcare services,was issued by the court of appeal holding enforceable an contractual agreement for arbitration.blake,supra,at,d.the supreme court thereafter granted review in armendariz and ultimately issued its opinion in that matter.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d.after issuance of the supreme court opinion,the defendant in blake made a motion in the trial court to dismiss the complaint for failure to prosecute.the plaintiff moved to vacate the prior order compelling arbitration and staying the action based on the holding in armendariz.the trial court granted the motion to dismiss and found the plaintiff motion to set aside moot.blake,supra,at,d.
the court of appeal reversed the order of dismissal on the ground that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to consider the defendant motion after the order for arbitration had issued.rather,such relief should have been sought in the arbitration proceeding.but,the court of appeal ruled that the trial court did have jurisdiction to rule on the plaintiff motion to vacate under section,subdivision c blake,supra,th at,d.
despite broad language in blake suggesting that a trial court lacks jurisdiction to determine a motion to dismiss in all instances once it has granted a petition to compel arbitration and stayed the action at law,we can not conclude that blake supports real parties argument that a plaintiff can not voluntarily dismiss an action once the case is ordered to arbitration.we can not ignore the practical consequences of construing blake to apply to the circumstances here,as such a conclusion would require the plaintiff to open arbitration proceedings in new york and pay all necessary fees simply to seek dismissal of the case.moreover,construing blake to preclude a plaintiff from voluntarily dismissing a case ordered to arbitration before the arbitration has commenced would be at odds with the right of a plaintiff to dismiss a case voluntarily and without prejudice set forth in section,subdivision b and subdivision c,both of which provide that a plaintiff may voluntarily dismiss his or her complaint at any time before the actual commencement of trial.a trial actually commences at the beginning of argument of any party or his or her counsel,or if there is no opening statement,then at the time of the administering of the oath or affirmation to the first witness,or the introduction of any evidence,subd.a.
nor was cardiff voluntary dismissal precluded by cases holding,in a variety of contexts,that a plaintiff right to dismiss is superseded by a ruling or determination that effectively disposes of the plaintiff case and thereby obviates the need for trial.gray superior court th,d.the legal principles that have evolved in this area tend to focus on the reasons for the dismissal and whether the plaintiff acted in good faith or merely for tactical reasons designed to prevent a defendant from obtaining an otherwise inevitable summary judgment or other judgment of dismissal.tire distributors,cobrae th,d.here,even assuming that an arbitration can be considered a trial within the meaning of section,it was undisputed that no trial had commenced and no dispositive motion had been ruled upon prior to cardiff voluntary dismissal of case.under these circumstances,we conclude that cardiff had an absolute right to dismiss case after the trial court granted the defendants motion to compel arbitration.
filing of case.
cardiff contends it had the absolute right to file case following its voluntary dismissal of case.we agree.
a dismissal without prejudice necessarily means without prejudice to the filing of a new action on the same allegations,so long as it is done within the period of the appropriate statute of limitations.citations.eaton hydraulics continental casualty th,fn,d.thus,subject to the statute of limitations,cardiff had the right to file a new action eliminating all but one of the defendants named in the original action and containing some,but not all,of the claims previously set forth in case.in fact,following its voluntary dismissal of case,cardiff could have filed an action identical to the one it dismissed.elling superior court d.
the order compelling arbitration.
cardiff contends that it is no longer bound by that portion of the trial court order compelling arbitration of the guaranty claims.cardiff claims that its voluntary dismissal of case,coupled with the filing of case,acted to sever the partnership claims from the guaranty claims so that it is now free to immediately litigate the guaranty claims in the trial court and to file another action and arbitrate its partnership claims at a later date.we agree.
the trial court found that the partnership claims could not be severed from the guaranty claims because they are inextricably intertwined.it then rejected cardiff argument that arbitration of the partnership claims,which cardiff conceded were required to be decided in the arbitral forum,should be delayed until such time as the guaranty claims could be litigated in the trial court.the entire controversy was then ordered to arbitration.although dissatisfied with these findings and the order compelling arbitration,cardiff did not attack the order or the basis for it by seeking reconsideration,or a petition for writ of mandate.instead,cardiff voluntarily dismissed the original action,with language in the guaranty permitting claims on that agreement to be brought a second action containing some,but not all,of the claims previously asserted in case.this action effectively severed the partnership claims from the guaranty claims.since cardiff intends to pursue the guaranty claims independently,as permitted by the guaranty,there is no longer any basis for arbitration of the guaranty claims.see freeman state farm mut.auto.ins.cal d,no policy compelling persons to accept arbitration of controversies which they have not agreed to arbitrate united public employees city county of san francisco th,d.
c.the section stay.
cardiff contends the trial court erred in staying case pursuant to section.we agree.
section provides if a court of competent jurisdiction,whether in this state or not,has ordered arbitration of a controversy which is an issue involved in an action or proceeding pending before a court of this state,the court in which such action or proceeding is pending shall,upon motion of a party to such action or proceeding,stay the action or proceeding until an arbitration is had in accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such earlier time as the court specifies.
under section,a party to a judicial proceeding is entitled to a stay of those proceedings whenever the arbitration of a controversy has been ordered,and that controversy is also an issue involved in the pending judicial action.marcus superior court d.section,subdivision c,defines controversy as any question arising between parties to an agreement whether such question is one of law or of fact or both.heritage provider network,superior court th,d heritage.a controversy can be a single question of law or fact,and a stay shall be issued upon proper motion if the court has ordered arbitration of a controversy that is also an issue involved in an action or proceeding pending before it.citation.thus,a single overlapping issue is sufficient to require imposition of a stay.ibid.
the controversy ordered to arbitration in case included a cause of action for breach of the guaranty as well as claims arising out of the partnership agreement.the complaint filed in case sets forth primarily a cause of action for breach of the guaranty.the question is whether there is a single overlapping issue sufficient to support the trial court order staying case pending the arbitration ordered in case.
in heritage,the appellate court concluded that where there is at least one overlapping issue in a controversy in which some claims are subject to arbitration and others are not,it was error for the trial court to deny a motion for stay of the court action.heritage,supra,th at,d.here,the trial court found the partnership claims and the guaranty claims to be intertwined.given that finding,had cardiff not dismissed the entire case,the stay would have been proper.however,the effect of dismissal is different from a severance.with limited exceptions inapplicable here,a voluntary dismissal deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction in that case.shapell industries,superior court th,d.a court can not force a litigant to pursue claims it chooses to abandon.harris billings th,d trial court delay reduction,or fast track program did not affect a plaintiff right to voluntarily dismiss an action,as t he delay reduction program is concerned with the management and progress of cases currently in the court system,not with disputes which the parties wish to remove from the system.in light of the voluntary dismissal of case,there was no basis upon which the trial court could stay case.
d.the validity of the trial court order compelling arbitration is not at issue in connection with these writ proceedings.
cardiff finally suggests that in order to resolve the issue of whether the trial court erred in staying case we must first determine whether the trial court erred in granting the defendants motion to compel arbitration.we disagree.
the primary issues presented in connection with these writ proceedings are whether the procedure used by cardiff acted to set aside the order,or portion thereof,compelling arbitration,and whether the stay of case was authorized pursuant to section.our findings in this regard do not depend on a finding that the order compelling arbitration was valid or invalid.
while it is true that we have the discretion to review the trial court october order compelling arbitration in connection with these proceedings,we are not persuaded to exercise that discretion.an order compelling arbitration is nonappealable.bertero superior court d.
disposition 
the order to show cause is discharged and the petition for writ of mandate is granted.petitioner is awarded costs of appeal.
i respectfully dissent.
the majority frames the issue before us as whether a plaintiff may dismiss a complaint in the trial court after the case has been ordered into arbitration,but before an arbitration has commenced,the majority has misstated the primary issue presented in this petition for writ of mandate,the critical issue is not whether cardiff equities,cardiff could dismiss case no,but whether a plaintiff may circumvent an order compelling arbitration simply by dismissing its complaint and filing a new action based upon the same foundational facts.
keeping this mind,i agree with the majority that cardiff had an absolute right to voluntarily dismiss case no.without prejudice pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivisions b and c following the trial court order compelling arbitration.i also agree that cardiff filing of case no.was permissible,subject to the statute of limitations.however,for the reasons set forth below,i disagree with the majority conclusion that the trial court order staying the litigation in case no.was improper.in light of the unchallenged finding that cardiff claims in case no.were inextricably intertwined,the obvious overlapping and similar claims in case no,cardiff deliberate attempt to circumvent the order compelling arbitration,and legal authority that precludes a litigant from vacating a court order,i conclude that the trial court providently granted robert iii request for a stay pursuant to section.
procedural background 
cardiff files its first complaint,in case no.
on june,cardiff initiated litigation against and others collectively referred to as the defendants by filing case no.cardiff alleged that in,it invested in myrtle beach partners,lp mbp pursuant to the terms of a partnership agreement.cardiff invested million in mbp and in return received an ownership interest.it also was entitled to receive a preferred return on its investment.as an inducement to cardiff to make its investment in mbp,personally guaranteed certain aspects of cardiff investment and return thereon,and promised to pay certain fees to cardiff pursuant to the terms of a guaranty of payment and fee agreement guaranty.
cardiff later alleged that in,the defendants caused mbp to be merged into myrtle beach consolidated partners,lp mbcp.in connection with that merger,the defendants used accounting improprieties to reduce substantially the value of cardiff interest in mbp.the defendants also refused to provide an accounting of the amounts paid out by mbp.
based on the foregoing allegations,cardiff alleged that the defendants breached the partnership agreement and the guaranty by failing to pay monies due to cardiff,by refusing to provide cardiff with access to mbp books and records,by refusing to account for profits of mbp,by misstating the results of mbp operations and the impact of its merger into mbcp,by failing to provide reports to cardiff,and by employing certain accounting improprieties designed to understate amounts due to mbp limited partners,among other things.
the defendants move to compel arbitration 
in response to the pleading,the defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration.they pointed out that the partnership agreement contains an arbitration provision,and then argued that all of the claims alleged by cardiff were subject to arbitration.the allegations regarding the partnership agreement are incorporated into each of the causes of action in the complaint the allegations regarding the alleged breach are incorporated into of the causes of action.these are not independent actions,but depend on the existence of the partnership agreement.because each cause of action arose from the partnership agreement,that agreement was anything but peripheral to this dispute.
the trial court grants the defendants motion 
on october,the trial court granted the defendants motion to compel arbitration.it found that the gravamen of this action concerns the partnership agreement which contains an arbitration clause to which cardiff is a signatory.the defendants may invoke the arbitration clause in the partnership agreement to compel cardiff to arbitrate its claims because the causes of action against the defendants are intimately founded in and intertwined with the underlying partnership agreement.cardiff was ordered to submit this dispute to arbitration the action was stayed pending completion of the arbitration.
cardiff dismisses case no.and files a new action 
cardiff did not challenge the trial court october,order.instead,it voluntarily dismissed case no.without prejudice and filed a new action,case no.although the complaint in this new action named as the only defendant and overtly alleged only breach of the guaranty not the partnership agreement,the pleadings are strikingly similar.like the complaint in case no,the complaint in case no.alleges facts showing the formation of mbp,cardiff financial investment,and cardiff receipt of an ownership interest.it also sets forth execution of the partnership agreement,as well as the allegation that cardiff was entitled to receive a preferred return.
cardiff further alleges that in july,caused mbp to be merged into mbcp,and that in connection with the merger,and his affiliates unilaterally determined the value of cardiff mbp interest,significantly undervaluing its interest.according to the complaint,cardiff could not determine the exact amount of such underpayment without access to information which has refused to provide.
based on the foregoing allegations,cardiff asserts that breached the guaranty by failing to pay monies due to cardiff,by refusing to provide cardiff with access to mbp books and records,by refusing to account for profits of mbp and to explain deductions and payments to third parties,by causing mbp to breach its obligations to cardiff,by misstating the results of mbp operations and the impact of its merger into mbcp,by failing to provide reports to cardiff,and by employing certain accounting improprieties designed to understate amounts due to cardiff,among other things.
case no.and case no.are deemed related 
simultaneously with the filing of the complaint,cardiff filed a notice of related case,indicating that case no.was related to case no.on november,the superior court found the two cases to be related.
moves to stay case no.
then moved to stay case no.on the grounds that the claims alleged in cardiff complaint had been ordered to arbitration.argued that this action arose from the exact same set of facts as those presented in case no.because the trial court previously ordered this dispute to arbitration,argued that case no.should be stayed pursuant to section pending completion of the arbitration.
the trial court grants motion to stay 
over cardiff opposition,the trial court granted motion.the trial court explained t he complaint filed in case no.is nothing other than an attempt to plead around the court prior ruling compelling arbitration in the related case case no.the court previously issued an arbitration order in the related case in october after making a finding that the claims asserted in the related case were subject to arbitration under the relevant partnership agreement since all of the claims were intimately founded in and intertwined with the underlying partnership agreement.the court finds that the claims as presently alleged in the instant case are also intimately founded in and intertwined with the underlying partnership agreement and,therefore,the case is hereby stayed pending the arbitration in the related case pursuant to section.
cardiff files a petition for writ of mandate 
dissatisfied with the trial court order,cardiff filed a petition for a writ of mandate,asking us to set aside the order staying the litigation in case no.i see no basis to do so.
the order compelling arbitration remains intact 
cardiff claims in case no.are subject to the trial court prior order compelling arbitration.in case no,the trial court determined that the partnership claims and the guaranty claims were inextricably intertwined and subject to arbitration.although dissatisfied with this finding and order,cardiff did not attack the order,and thus the basis for it,by filing,for example,a motion for reconsideration clark first union securities,th,d or a petition for writ of mandate.thus,that order became final.
the majority attempts to avoid this inevitable result by concluding that cardiff procedural maneuvering effected a successful vacating of the trial court order compelling arbitration.what the majority ignores,however,is the principle that only trial courts,not litigants,may vacate prior court orders.see blake ecker th,fn,d,overruled on other grounds in lefrancois goel cal th,fn,d,brock kaiser foundation hospitals th,d a plaintiff voluntary dismissal of an action at law in the wake of an unfavorable arbitration order does not act to vacate the order compelling arbitration.unless an order compelling arbitration is set aside by the trial court,the parties are bound to resolve their dispute in the arbitral forum.see blake ecker,supra,th at,d.were the rule otherwise,every finding that arbitrable and nonarbitrable claims are inextricably every order compelling arbitration based on such a be evaded by the tactic of a plaintiff voluntary dismissal of the judicial action at law and subsequent filing of a new,related action.to allow a plaintiff to avoid a trial court order compelling arbitration in such a fashion would undermine the arbitration statutes and violate california public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.
the majority offers several reasons for its decision to grant cardiff petition for writ of mandate,each of which is unconvincing.for example,the majority concludes that the complaint filed by cardiff in case no.sets forth primarily a cause of action for breach of the guaranty,and that cardiff thus effectively severed,its partnership claims from its guaranty claims.i can not agree for at least two reasons.first,despite the majority holding that a party actions can sever claims alleged in a pleading,no legal authority supports such a novel proposition.rather,the weight of that i believe is that only a court may engage in the act of severance.see,armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,discussing a trial court capacity to sever an unconscionable provision of a contract people ochoa cal th,d,summarizing the criteria to guide trial court decisions on severance motions,and statutes that regulate the order of proof at trial in a malpractice action,the trial court must order a separate trial on a statute of limitations defense,subd.b court may order separate trials,subd.d the court shall,on application of any defendant,preclude the admission of evidence of that defendant profits or financial condition until after the trier of fact returns a verdict for plaintiff awarding actual damages and finds that a defendant is guilty of malice,oppression,or fraud.
second,although cardiff was careful not to specifically plead a cause of action for breach of the partnership agreement in case no,it is clear from the allegations summarized above that that is exactly what cardiff is claiming.after all,both pleadings allege the formation of mbp,the execution of the partnership agreement,and cardiff rights under the partnership agreement.significantly,both pleadings also allege that executed the guaranty to induce cardiff to invest in mbp.as for cardiff breach of contract cause of action in case no,other than referring only to as opposed to the defendants and deleting the breach of the partnership agreement label,the allegedly wrongful conduct that amounts to a breach is identical to that alleged in the complaint in case no.
in fact,cardiff could not allege otherwise.a plain reading of the guaranty reveals that a breach of the partnership agreement is a predicate to a claim for breach of the guaranty.the guaranty provide
