this appeal presents the following issue of first impression in this circuit whether of the federal arbitration act faa,prohibited the colorado district court from compelling arbitration in colorado when the parties contractual agreement designated washington,as the arbitration forum.like the district court,we conclude that did prohibit the district court from compelling arbitration in either colorado or washington,accordingly,we affirm the district court order denying arbitration 
background 
in their complaint,plaintiffs asserted the following facts.in,qwest and bur orally agreed that bur would purchase an indefeasible right of use iru for certain telecommunications services from qwest for conditioned upon qwest purchase of equipment from ansari sonus networks.qwest refused to memorialize the terms of both agreements in a single contract.on june,qwest and bur signed the iru agreement,and bur made an initial payment of.also,at that time,ansari pledged his personal sonus networks stock valued at as collateral for the balance due on the iru agreement.
the iru agreement gave bur the exclusive right to use a specified portion of a telecommunications cable owned by qwest,specifically the exclusive right to use eight circuits of specified capacity over five defined routes for their entire economically useful life.aplt.br.at.the iru agreement also contained an arbitration provision.this provision stated that any dispute between qwest and bur concerning the iru agreement shall be settled by arbitration in washington,in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association 
despite this arbitration provision,plaintiffs filed suit against qwest in colorado district court alleging several claims for relief fraud in the inducement breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing breach of warranty rescission unjust enrichment fraud and violation of a,b,a and of the communications act of.they asserted that federal law barred qwest from providing some of the circuit capacity identified in the iru agreement and that qwest induced bur to execute the iru agreement by entering into a contemporaneous equipment purchase agreement with sonus networks that qwest never intended to honor.
in response to the complaint,qwest filed a petition to compel arbitration in colorado under based on the arbitration clause in the iru agreement.qwest asserted that because plaintiffs initiated this action in colorado,arbitration was proper in colorado,even though the arbitration clause of the iru agreement stated arbitration was to be held in washington,plaintiffs opposed the petition.the magistrate judge recommended that the petition be denied,because the district court lacked power to compel arbitration in any district because the arbitration provision requires that arbitration occur in a forum outside the district.at see also id.at recommending petition to compel arbitration be denied because court lacked authority to order arbitration in colorado or washington.accordingly,the magistrate judge recommended that the district court adopt the position that if an arbitration agreement contains a forum selection clause only the district court in that forum can issue an order compelling arbitration under section of the faa.id.at citing cases.additionally,the magistrate judge recommended that the district court stay proceedings pending a determination in the district of columbia whether some or all of plaintiffs claims are arbitrable.
reviewing de novo,the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation.id.at.the court denied the petition to compel arbitration,ordered that any arguments regarding arbitrability of plaintiffs claims be decided by the district court in the district of columbia if qwest files a petition to compel arbitration there and stayed the action pending a determination by the district of columbia district court on the arbitrability of the claims and the outcome of any arbitration proceeding.
jurisdiction 
before addressing the merits,we must consider whether we have jurisdiction to consider this appeal.plaintiffs argue that this court lacks jurisdiction because the district court did not rule on the merits of qwest petition to compel arbitration and instead denied the petition after holding that it lacked authority to rule on the petition.the faa,however,makes no such distinction.it expressly permits an appeal from a district court order denying a petition under section to order arbitration to proceed.a b.
in interpreting this plain language,other courts have held,contrary to plaintiffs assertion,that a b does not require a final determination of the merits of a petition to compel arbitration.see,palcko airborne express,cir holding all orders declining to compel arbitration are reviewable under a,cert.denied,d madol dan nelson auto.group,cir permitting immediate appeal where district court reopened discovery and rejected magistrate judge recommendation compelling arbitration microchip tech.philips,agreeing with sister circuits that section allows for appeal of orders denying motions to compel arbitration even when the issue of arbitrability has not been finally decided colon grace,cir holding order denying arbitration under faa is immediately appealable boomer v.at t,cir permitting immediate appeal from order denying request for arbitration to proceed,where district court held that further discovery was needed before it could conclusively rule on motion to compel arbitration snowden checkpoint check cashing,cir recognizing sister circuits have reached conclusion that plain language of statute gives appellate jurisdiction over appeals from orders denying motions to compel arbitration sandvik ab advent int l,cir treat ing all orders declining to compel arbitration as reviewable in re pisgah contractors,cir recognizing appellate courts have jurisdiction to consider appeals from interlocutory orders denying motions to compel arbitration.see generally spahr secco,cir exercising,without specifically addressing,jurisdiction under when considering district court order denying arbitration.

accordingly,we conclude the plain language of a b provides for the immediate appeal of the denial of a petition to compel arbitration.because the district court here clearly precluded qwest from proceeding with arbitration in colorado,we therefore have jurisdiction to consider this appeal.
discussion 
qwest argues that the district court erred in failing to consider the merits of its petition to compel arbitration and should not have required qwest to initiate a new action in washington,qwest maintains that the plain language of the faa,its purpose,and its legislative history direct a conclusion that the district court had the authority to compel arbitration in colorado despite the language of the arbitration clause providing for arbitration to be held in washington,
