in gentry superior court cal th gentry,our supreme court held that,in arbitration agreements governing employment,class action waivers may be unenforceable in some circumstances because they would lead to a de facto waiver of employees statutory rights and would impermissibly interfere with employees ability to vindicate those rights id.at,italics added.
more specifically,gentry addressed the enforceability of class action waivers in the context of a claim for overtime compensation.the court grounded its decision on the conclusion that an employee right to overtime compensation is an unwaivable statutory right.gentry,supra,cal th at.in determining the validity of class action waivers,the court stated individual awards in cases tend to be modest id.at a current employee who individually sues his or her employer is at greater risk of retaliation id.at some individual employees may not sue because they are unaware that their legal rights have been violated id.at class actions may be needed to assure the effective enforcement of statutory policies id.and there may be real world obstacles to the vindication of class members rights to overtime through individual arbitration id.at.
gentry concluded that,when an employee alleges that an employer has systematically denied proper overtime pay to a class of employees,and a trial court finds,based on the foregoing factors,that a class action is likely to be a significantly more effective practical means of vindicating the rights of the affected employees than individual litigation or arbitration,and finds that the disallowance of the class action will likely lead to a less comprehensive enforcement of overtime laws for the employees alleged to be affected by the employer violations,it must invalidate the class arbitration waiver to ensure that these employees can vindicate their unwaivable statutory rights gentry,supra,cal th at,italics added.
in franco athens disposal,th franco i,we concluded that gentry invalidated a class action waiver where an employee alleged that his employer had violated the laws regarding employees rights to rest and meal periods statutory rights that are also unwaivable.franco i,at,citing,undesignated section references are to that code.we further concluded that,with respect to a claim under the labor code private attorneys general act of paga,gentry invalidated an arbitration clause prohibiting an employee from acting as a private attorney general see franco i,at.
after we decided franco i,the employer filed a second petition to compel arbitration,arguing that a change in the law rendered the class action waiver enforceable.the trial court denied the petition.that ruling is now before us.the question on appeal is whether gentry was overruled by stolt nielsen animalfeeds international.stolt nielsen and at t mobility llc concepcion.concepcion.we conclude that gentry remains good law because,as required by concepcion,it does not establish a categorical rule against class action waivers but,instead,sets forth several factors to be applied on a basis to determine whether a class action waiver precludes employees from vindicating their statutory rights.and,as required by stolt nielsen,when a class action waiver is unenforceable under gentry,the plaintiff claims must be adjudicated in court,where the plaintiff may file a putative class action.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
the facts in this appeal are taken from our prior opinion and the record in franco i and the exhibits filed in connection with the second petition to compel arbitration.
on april,plaintiff edixon franco filed a class action complaint against athens disposal company,dba athens services athens services.the complaint alleged as follows.
franco was employed by athens services as a nonexempt,hourly employee he brought this suit individually and on behalf of other similarly situated current and former employees.the potential class is significant in size such that individual joinder would be impractical.athens services engaged in a systematic course of illegal payroll practices and policies in violation of the labor code athens services subjected all of its hourly employees to the identical violations.
the first cause of action alleges that athens services violated labor code sections and by failing to pay overtime in the second cause of action,franco alleges that athens services violated section and the applicable industrial welfare commission wage order,wage order,codified at california code of regulations,title,section.more specifically,athens services allegedly failed to provide meal periods and to pay an additional hour of compensation per workday to employees who missed a meal period.the third cause of action alleges a separate violation of section and the wage order by failing to provide rest periods and to pay an additional hour of compensation per workday to employees who missed a rest period.in the fourth cause of action,the complaint asserts violations of sections,and,as well as the wage order,by failing to provide necessary payroll information to employees and failing to maintain records on each employee showing all hours worked and all meal periods taken.the fifth cause of action seeks civil penalties authorized by the paga for violating the labor code as to franco and other current and former employees franco alleges he exhausted the requisite administrative remedies under the act.see.franco i,supra,th at.
on june,athens services,represented by hill,farrer burrill the hill firm,filed a petition to compel arbitration and to dismiss or stay the civil action.the petition stated that athens services was in the business of trash removal,hauling,disposal,and recycling and was engaged in interstate commerce within the meaning of the federal arbitration act.athens services alleged that arbitration was required under the august arbitration agreement signed by franco written in spanish which was attached as an exhibit.franco i,supra,th at.
franco was employed by athens services from may,to may.in august,he signed an employee agreement to arbitrate that stated i acknowledge that i have received and reviewed a copy of the athens services mutual arbitration policy map,and i understand that it is a condition of my employment.i agree that it is my obligation to make use of the map and to submit to final and binding arbitration any and all claims and disputes that are related in any way to my employment or the termination of my employment with athens services or its parent,subsidiary,sister or affiliated companies or entities,and each of its their employees,officers,directors or agents the company and that both the company and i agree to forego any right to bring claims on a representative or class basis.i also agree that such arbitration will be conducted under the federal arbitration act and the applicable procedure rules of the american arbitration association aaa.t he company also agrees to submit all claims and disputes it may have with me to final and binding arbitration,and the company further agrees that if i submit a request for binding arbitration,my maximum expenses for the arbitrator and the administrative costs of the aaa will be an amount equal to the local civil court filing fee and the company will pay all of the remaining fees and administrative costs of the arbitrator and the aaa.if any provision of the map is found unenforceable,that provision may be severed without affecting this agreement to arbitrate 
the mutual arbitration policy map read athens services the company has adopted and implemented a new arbitration policy,requiring mandatory,binding arbitration of disputes,for all employees,regardless of length of service the map will govern all existing or future disputes between you and the company that are related in any way to your employment.the map covers all disputes relating to or arising out of an employee employment with the company or the termination of that employment likewise,the company agrees to be bound by the map.this mutual obligation to arbitrate claims means that both you and the company are bound to use the map as the only means of resolving any disputes b oth you and the company forego and waive any right to join or consolidate claims in arbitration with others or to make claims in arbitration as a representative or as a member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity no remedies that otherwise would be available to you individually or to the company in a court of law,however,will be forfeited by virtue of this agreement to use and be bound by the map.the company and you will share the cost of the aaa filing fee and the arbitrator fees and costs,but your share of such fees and costs shall not exceed an amount equal to your local court civil filing fee you and the company will be responsible for the fees and costs of your own respective legal counsel,if any italics added.the map permitted the company and its employees to sue in small claims court subject to that court jurisdictional monetary limit.
the map was described as a new arbitration policy because,at the time of hire on may,franco was given the athens services employee guide,which required arbitration in simple,concise terms any claim or controversy that arises out of or relates to the interpretation,application or enforcement of this agreement or any other matter concerning or relating to the employment relationship between the employer and employee shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration in accordance with the labor arbitration rules of the american arbitration association.the arbitration provision in the employee guide did not prohibit an employee from consolidating claims,pursuing a class action or other representative action,being a class representative or a member of a class,or acting as a private attorney general.the arbitration provision was silent as to those issues.franco signed an acknowledgment form,indicating he had been given a copy of the employee guide and that a company representative had explained its contents to him in detail.both the employee guide and the acknowledgment form were in spanish.
in support of the petition to compel arbitration,the president of athens disposal company,doing business as athens services,submitted a declaration stating that the company had complied with the labor code and the applicable wage order.the payroll manager submitted a declaration,stating i have been employed by athens services for years i am familiar with edixon franco personnel file.he was employed by athens services as a waste hauling driver.in that position,edixon franco held a commercial driver license and operated one of the company waste hauling vehicles a trash truck,which is a three axle commercial vehicle weighing more than pounds.as a driver operating such a vehicle,edixon franco,like all of athens services waste hauling drivers,was exempt from california overtime wage laws and regulations 
in opposition to the petition,franco submitted evidence showing that,based on his hourly wage,his estimated damages for the alleged denial of meal and rest periods totaled he would also be entitled to approximately in civil penalties under the paga franco filed a declaration in which he stated that,during his employment with athens services he did not know he was entitled to an hour pay if athens services did not give him a meal or rest period he was not aware of all of his rights under the labor code or other labor law in his experience,employees who complained about working conditions were looked down on by management and often los t their jobs or were treated in ways that force d them to quit and he did not feel secure enough to complain about anything he may have felt was wrong he felt that if he complained about anything he would be fired.franco i,supra,th at.
franco filed declarations from three attorneys who discussed the necessity of bringing his wage and hour claims as a class action,whether in court or arbitration.one declaration,from attorney matthew matern,read based on my experience and knowledge of labor code cases,it would be extremely difficult for the class member employees to obtain representation for their cases because of the relatively small amounts of damages each employee suffers if they are required to litigate each of their cases separately.that is assuming each class member knew his or her rights under the labor code were being violated,each had the ability to find an attorney to separately litigate his or her individual case in arbitration and had no fear of being fired for doing so.typically,these employees come into my office with no knowledge of the labor code.moreover,they rarely have worked for the employers for a substantial period of time,in some cases only a year or two,as is the case for the plaintiffs in this case.in fact,we have potential clients come into our office who worked for an employer less than a year and most assuredly many members of a class will have shorter times of employment with the employer,with correspondingly lower damages.
without the ability to litigate these cases as a class proceeding,my firm could not represent the individual class members especially if we had to arbitrate each one separately because of the low damages present in many of these cases,including this one.moreover,if the entire class were to come into my office,we could not litigate each case separately,either in court or in arbitration.
as to the argument that attorneys fees are available in these types of cases,because of the small amount of damages for each individual,the small amount of attorney fees that would be considered reasonable in relation to any individual claim would not be sufficient to permit me to invest my time.moreover,paying the claims of each individual employee who happens to walk into my or another attorney office will not deter the employer from continuing to deny rest and meal periods or force the employer to pay its employees the wages due.rather,preventing class proceedings from occurring will only allow this and other employers to pay the claims of a few employees,if any,and continue violating the labor code unabated.
the penalties sought under the paga are not damages and are apportioned percent to the state of california and percent to the individual class members,not the named plaintiff.based on the hourly wages paid to plaintiff franco,we estimate damages for him for denial of rest and meal breaks to be approximately.we estimate that penalties in this case for the individual named plaintiffs under the paga could reach approximately for plaintiff for rest and meal period violations,with franco retaining about approximately.italics added.
another attorney,victor george,declared in february of this year,i was named a top southern california attorney in southern california super lawyers.i have been listed as a super lawyer each of the four years the magazine has been in existence.according to the publishers of law politics magazine,super lawyers are the top of attorneys in their practice field.
all my cases are plaintiff cases.all have substantial risks.i advance all costs and all of our firm time.i am extremely selective about picking my cases trying to help those that are a the most clearly in need and b that might have a chance to prevail.even so,i recognize that often any financial remuneration will not be forthcoming until years and years after i initially begin to pursue a case.i litigate labor code cases similar to this case on a class basis and would not take a case from any of the absent class members if i had to litigate it on an individual basis because of the moderate damages and because these cases are labor intensive.additionally,it makes no sense to bring these cases individually because the employer can simply pay the small damages and not be forced to correct its unlawful behavior.
based on my experience and knowledge of wage and hour cases,it would be extremely difficult for an employee to obtain representation for their labor code cases if they needed to either arbitrate or litigate in court individually.many cases such as this one have damages significantly lower than your typical harassment or discrimination case these labor code cases involve many hours of attorney work and despite the possibility of obtaining attorneys fees upon a successful arbitration,the chances that an arbitrator will award the attorney the full amount of hours worked are not great.
in my experience,the employees that come into my office have little knowledge of their rights under california law and rarely do they come in while still working for the employer who wronged them.many times the employees who come into my office have worked for the employer for less than one year.
many of the cases that involve short term employees could not be litigated at all in superior court because of the low amount of damages.if one of the purported class members in this case came into my office after working for only a few months and not receiving any breaks,i would have to decline.without the ability to litigate these cases as a class proceeding,my firm could not represent the individual class members,especially if we had to arbitrate each one separately because of the low damages present in many of these cases.italics added.
franco argued that,under gentry,supra,cal th,the map class action waiver and the prohibition on acting as a private attorney general were invalid.athens services countered that gentry was not a blanket rule invalidating all class action waivers in employment arbitration agreements.rather,gentry applied only in cases where a class action waiver constituted a disadvantage to employees in vindicating their rights.id.at,italics added.according to athens services,franco had not made such a showing or satisfied the gentry factors.athens services also asserted that franco overtime claim was meritless because he was exempt from the state overtime compensation laws.
the trial court,judge elizabeth grimes presiding,granted the petition to compel arbitration,reasoning that although gentry applied to overtime claims,franco claim for overtime compensation lacked merit.the court also stated that,assuming gentry applied to franco nonovertime claims,classwide arbitration would not be significantly more effective than individual arbitrations because of the preponderance of individualized issues,the need for specific inquiries into the merits of each employee claims,and the varying extent of liability.the court opined that athens services arbitration program would not disadvantage any employee who pursued claims through individual arbitration.franco i,supra,th at.
on appeal,we concluded that,in ruling on the petition,the trial court had erred in considering the merits of franco overtime claim and treating the claim as if it had been dismissed.see franco i,supra,th at.as to franco claims alleging rest and meal period violations,we held that the pertinent laws,conferred unwaivable statutory rights on employees and that franco had satisfied the gentry factors.see franco i,at.we reached the same conclusion as to franco claim for civil penalties under the paga.see id.at.we stated that athens services evidence concerning whether it had complied with the labor code was premature t his type of evidence goes to the merits of franco claims and is not to be considered on a petition to compel arbitration id.at.we ultimately decided that,under gentry,the class action waiver was unenforceable.see id.at.we also concluded that the map prohibition on acting as a private attorney general was unenforceable as to franco claim under the paga,which authorizes an aggrieved employee to recover civil penalties on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former employees,subd.a see franco i,at.
finally,we determined that a class proceeding was likely to be a significantly more effective practical means of vindicating the rights of the affected employees than individual litigation or arbitration we conclude the record does not support the trial court determination that the employees claims would be so individualized as to render class treatment significantly less effective than individual arbitrations.at this early stage in the litigation,we know that athens services uses a computer and an electronic timecard system to keep track of its employees work hours.by law,an employer must maintain time records showing an employee total daily hours worked and meal periods,unless operations cease during meals further,athens services allegedly engaged in a systematic course of illegal payroll practices and policies in violation of the labor code and subjected all of its hourly employees to the same unlawful conduct.as a result,common questions of law and fact predominate over individualized issues.franco i,supra,th at.
accordingly,we found the map unenforceable,explaining if the central purpose of the contract is tainted with illegality,then the contract as a whole can not be enforced m ultiple defects indicate a systematic effort to impose arbitration on an employee not simply as an alternative to litigation,but as an inferior forum that works to the employer advantage.franco i,supra,th at.because the map contains a class arbitration waiver and also precludes franco from seeking civil penalties,contrary to the paga,we conclude that the agreement as a whole is tainted with illegality and is unenforceable athens services petition to compel arbitration should therefore be denied,and this case should proceed in a court of law.id.at,citation omitted.we reversed the trial court.
athens services filed a petition for review in the california supreme court,which declined to hear the case june.athens services then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court,which denied the petition on january,athens disposal,franco.the case returned to the trial court.
on january,the trial court,judge john kronstadt presiding,conducted a status conference.counsel for athens services the hill firm stated that franco had sued the wrong corporation athens disposal company,doing business as athens services,was not his employer arakelian enterprises,arakelian,doing business as athens services,was his actual employer.in subsequent responses to special interrogatories,the hill firm indicated that athens disposal company,had never employed franco,nor had it employed anyone during the relevant time period.on march,franco amended the complaint,adding arakelian as a doe defendant.
on may,arakelian filed a petition to compel arbitration,relying as had the first petition on the map,adopted in august.in its memorandum of points and authorities,the hill firm argued that our decision in franco i had been overruled by stolt nielsen,supra,making the map enforceable.in the alternative,the hill firm asserted that if stolt nielsen had not overruled franco i,the trial court should compel arbitration based on the arbitration provision in the athens services employee guide,which franco acknowledged receiving when he was hired on may.
in opposition to the petition,franco relied on his opposition to the first petition to compel arbitration.he filed supplemental papers contending that under the law of the case doctrine,arakelian was bound by franco i because it was in privity with athens disposal company,stolt nielsen did not constitute a change in the law,and if the map was unenforceable,the arbitration provision in the employee guide did not provide a basis for arbitration because it had been superseded by the map,and there was no legal grounds for reviving it.
with respect to arakelian late appearance in the case,franco pointed out that on may,around two years before he filed suit the hill firm appeared on behalf of arakelian enterprises,dba athens services in a different employment case flores arakelian enterprises,no.in flores,the hill firm successfully petitioned the superior court to compel arbitration.arakelian prevailed on the merits.on july,judgment was entered in flores,confirming the arbitration award in favor of arakelian.thus,the entire time the hill firm was representing athens disposal company,dba athens services in this case,the firm knew from its work in flores that arakelian,not athens disposal company,was the corporation doing business as athens services.yet the firm did not disclose that arakelian was franco employer until after we reversed the order granting the first petition to compel arbitration and athens services had exhausted all appeals.
on september,the trial court heard arakelian petition to compel arbitration.by minute order of the same date,the trial court denied the petition.on april,the trial court issued a more comprehensive order denying the petition on two grounds the law of the case doctrine and arakelian failure to identify itself as franco true employer until after the hill firm had filed the first petition to compel arbitration and exhausted the appeals process.
on april,arakelian filed a notice of appeal.six days later,on april,the united states supreme court issued its decision in concepcion,supra.
discussion 
the material facts are not in dispute.the question on appeal whether gentry,supra,cal th,has been overruled presents an issue of law we review de novo.see nickell matlock th,barr,south coast air quality management dist.th.
arakelian argues that gentry was overruled by stolt nielsen,supra,and concepcion,supra.we disagree.gentry held that,based on certain factors,a class action waiver may be unenforceable if it prevents employees from vindicating unwaivable statutory rights.stolt nielsen,on the other hand,held that if an arbitration agreement does not expressly or implicitly authorize a class action,a plaintiff can not pursue claims on a class basis in an arbitral forum.see stolt nielsen,at truly nolen of america superior court th.concepcion held that california discover bank rule discover bank superior court cal th discover bank did not provide a basis for revoking an arbitration agreement because it constituted a categorical rule against class action waivers in consumer contracts,thereby disfavoring arbitration.see concepcion,at.concepcion did not address or question prior supreme court cases recognizing that an arbitration agreement may be unenforceable if it prevents a plaintiff from vindicating his or her statutory rights.
issues not raised in franco i 
in franco i,the hill firm represented a corporation named athens disposal company,doing business as athens services.after we reversed the trial court order compelling arbitration and held that franco was entitled to a court trial,the hill firm unsuccessfully sought review in the california supreme court and the united states supreme court.
approximately days after the united states supreme court denied certiorari,the hill firm announced at a status conference in the trial court that franco had sued the wrong corporation.according to the hill firm,franco should have filed suit against arakelian.in its opening brief on this appeal,the hill firm maintains that athens disposal company,was an inactive corporate entity.yet in franco i,the hill firm submitted a declaration from the president of athens disposal company in support of athens services petition to compel arbitration.
after the hill firm announced that franco had sued the wrong corporation,he added arakelian as a doe defendant.the hill firm then filed a second petition to compel arbitration based on the same arbitration agreement the map we held unenforceable in franco simply put,the hill firm attempted to enforce the same arbitration agreement again.
the law of the case doctrine states that when,in deciding an appeal,an appellate court states in its opinion a principle or rule of law necessary to the decision,that principle or rule becomes the law of the case and must be adhered to throughout its subsequent progress,both in the lower court and upon subsequent appeal.abf capital grove properties th.absent an applicable exception,the doctrine requir es both trial and appellate courts to follow the rules laid down upon a former appeal whether such rules are right or wrong.as its name suggests,the doctrine applies only to an appellate court decision on a question of law it does not apply to questions of fact.gunn mariners church,th.
in denying the second petition to compel arbitration,the trial court stated that it would not consider any new legal arguments that could have been made in franco for instance,the trial court did not resolve arakelian contention that,if the map was still unenforceable under franco i,it should enforce the predecessor arbitration provision in the employee guide.in addition,the second petition was supported by preprinted statements signed by a number of athens services employees,declaring that the company had complied with the rest and meal period laws.but as stated in franco i,that type of evidence goes directly to the merits of franco claims and is not pertinent in ruling on a petition to compel arbitration.franco i,supra,th at see brinker restaurant superior court cal th.
we agree with the trial court that,under the law of the case doctrine,legal arguments that could have been raised in franco i will not be considered in this appeal.athens services,represented by the hill firm on both petitions to compel arbitration,should have presented all colorable legal arguments in franco see yu signet th.nevertheless,the law of the case doctrine does not apply where there has been an intervening change in the law.see bell farmers ins.exchange th,people stanley cal th.we therefore turn to arakelian principal issue on appeal whether gentry has been overruled by stolt nielsen and concepcion 
arbitration of statutory claims 
the federal arbitration act faa was enacted in and codified in as chapter,title of the united states code.see dumitru princess cruise lines,s.d.
at first,the arbitration of statutory claims under the faa received a judicial cold shoulder.in wilko swan.wilko,the supreme court held that claims under the securities act of were not subject to arbitration.as the court explained when the security buyer,prior to any violation of the securities act,waives his right to sue in courts,he gives up more than would a participant in other business transactions.the security buyer has a wider choice of courts and venue.he thus surrenders one of the advantages the act gives him and surrenders it at a time when he is less able to judge the weight of the handicap the securities act places upon his adversary.
even though the provisions of the securities act,advantageous to the buyer,apply,their effectiveness in application is lessened in arbitration as compared to judicial proceedings.determination of the quality of a commodity or the amount of money due under a contract is not the type of issue here involved.this case requires subjective findings on the purpose and knowledge of an alleged violator of the act.they must be not only determined but applied by the arbitrators without judicial instruction on the law.as their award may be made without explanation of their reasons and without a complete record of their proceedings,the arbitrators conception of the legal meaning of such statutory requirements as burden of proof,reasonable care or material fact,can not be examined.power to vacate an award is limited the united states arbitration act contains no provision for judicial determination of legal issues such as is found in the english law t he protective provisions of the securities act require the exercise of judicial direction to fairly assure their effectiveness wilko,supra,at,fns.omitted.
in scherk alberto culver.scherk,the court distinguished wilko and concluded that a dispute under the securities exchange act of is subject to arbitration where the parties agreement implicates international concerns accepting the premise that the operative portions of the language of the act relied upon in wilko are contained in the securities exchange act of,alberto culver company reliance on wilko in this case ignores the significant and,we find,crucial differences between the agreement involved in wilko and the one signed by the parties here.alberto culver contract to purchase the business entities belonging to scherk was a truly international agreement.alberto culver is an american corporation with its principal place of business and the vast bulk of its activity in this country,while scherk is a citizen of germany whose companies were organized under the laws of germany and liechtenstein.the negotiations leading to the signing of the contract in austria and to the closing in switzerland took place in the united states,england,and germany,and involved consultations with legal and trademark experts from each of those countries and from liechtenstein.finally,and most significantly,the subject matter of the contract concerned the sale of business enterprises organized under the laws of and primarily situated in european countries,whose activities were largely,if not entirely,directed to european markets.
such a contract involves considerations and policies significantly different from those found controlling in wilko.in wilko,quite apart from the arbitration provision,there was no question but that the laws of the united states generally,and the federal securities laws in particular,would govern disputes arising out of the agreement.the parties,the negotiations,and the subject matter of the contract were all situated in this country,and no credible claim could have been entertained that any international problems would arise.in this case,by contrast,in the absence of the arbitration provision considerable uncertainty existed at the time of the agreement,and still exists,concerning the law applicable to the resolution of disputes arising out of the contract.
such uncertainty will almost inevitably exist with respect to any contract touching two or more countries,each with its own substantive laws and rules.a contractual provision specifying in advance the forum in which disputes shall be litigated and the law to be applied is,therefore,an almost indispensable precondition to achievement of the orderliness and predictability essential to any international business transaction.scherk,supra,at,fn.omitted.
moses cone hospital mercury constr.addressed the interplay between state and federal courts in applying the faa.there,a hospital entered into an agreement with a construction contractor and agreed to resolve disputes through binding arbitration.when a dispute arose,the hospital filed suit in state court.the contractor filed an action in federal district court,seeking an order compelling arbitration.the federal district court issued a stay of its proceedings pending resolution of the state court case.the court of appeals reversed and instructed the district court to enter an order compelling arbitration.
the supreme court held that the district court had erred the basic issue presented in the contractor federal suit was the arbitrability of the dispute between it and the hospital.federal law in the terms of the arbitration act governs that issue in either state or federal court.title,section of the united states code is the primary substantive provision of the faa,declaring that a written agreement to arbitrate in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.section is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary.the effect of the section is to create a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability,applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the act.moses cone hospital mercury constr,supra,at,fn.omitted,italics added.the court also commented,congress can hardly have meant that an agreement to arbitrate can be enforced against a party who attempts to litigate an arbitrable dispute in federal court,but not against one who sues on the same dispute in state court.id.at,fn.
in southland keating,the court recognized that if a state law treats an arbitration agreement differently than contracts in general,it is preempted by the faa.at issue was a dispute under california franchise investment law.one provision of the law stated any condition,stipulation or provision purporting to bind any person acquiring any franchise to waive compliance with any provision of this law or any rule or order hereunder is void.the california supreme court had interpreted that provision to require a judicial resolution of a dispute arising under the franchise investment law.see southland,at.
the united states supreme court held that the state law was preempted,explaining in enacting of the faa,congress declared a national policy favoring arbitration and withdrew the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration.the faa provides a written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction,or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof,or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract,transaction,or refusal,shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.
congress has mandated the enforcement of arbitration agreements.
we discern only two limitations on the enforceability of arbitration provisions governed by the faa they must be part of a written maritime contract or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce and such clauses may be revoked upon grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.we see nothing in the act indicating that the broad principle of enforceability is subject to any additional limitations under state law.southland keating,supra,at,fn.omitted.
the court continued t he need for the law arises from the jealousy of the english courts for their own jurisdiction this jealousy survived for so lon g a period that the principle became firmly embedded in the english common law and was adopted with it by the american courts.the courts have felt that the precedent was too strongly fixed to be overturned without legislative enactment 
t he purpose of the faa was to assure those who desired arbitration and whose contracts related to interstate commerce that their expectations would not be undermined by federal judges,or by state courts or legislatures.southland keating,supra,at,citation omitted,italics added.thus,the faa was intended to overcome hostility to arbitration by both state and federal judges.
in dean witter reynolds byrd,the court addressed the situation where a plaintiff claims consist of arbitrable and nonarbitrable claims.the court rejected the proposition that a court should stay arbitration while the nonarbitrable claims are adjudicated in another forum even though bifurcated proceedings might interfere with the faa goal of speedy and efficient decisionmaking.id.at see id.at.
as the court stated the legislative history of the faa establishes that the purpose behind its passage was to ensure judicial enforcement of privately made agreements to arbitrate.we therefore reject the suggestion that the overriding goal of the arbitration act was to promote the expeditious resolution of claims.the act,after all,does not mandate the arbitration of all claims,but merely the enforcement upon the motion of one of the parties of privately negotiated arbitration agreements t he act makes clear that its purpose was to place an arbitration agreement upon the same footing as other contracts,where it belongs,and to overrule the judiciary longstanding refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate.this is not to say that congress was blind to the potential benefit of the legislation for expedited resolution of disputes.dean witter reynolds byrd,supra,at,citation fn.omitted,italics added.we therefore are not persuaded by the argument that the conflict between two goals of the arbitration act enforcement of private agreements and encouragement of efficient and speedy dispute resolution must be resolved in favor of the latter in order to realize the intent of the drafters.the preeminent concern of congress in passing the act was to enforce private agreements into which parties had entered,and that concern requires that we rigorously enforce agreements to arbitrate,even if the result is piecemeal litigation id.at,italics added.
in mitsubishi motors soler chrysler plymouth.mitsubishi motors,the plaintiff,a car manufacturer,filed a breach of contract action against one of its dealerships and sought to compel arbitration of the dispute pursuant to an arbitration provision in the parties contract.the dealer filed a counterclaim against the manufacturer,alleging a violation of the sherman act,the clayton act,and other statutes.see mitsubishi motors,at.the supreme court granted certiorari to decide whether an antitrust claim is subject to arbitration when the parties contract arises from an international transaction.mitsubishi motors,at.
in concluding that the antitrust claim should be arbitrated,the court stated by agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim,a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than a judicial,forum.it trades the procedures and opportunity for review of the courtroom for the simplicity,informality,and expedition of arbitration.we must assume that if congress intended the substantive protection afforded by a given statute to include protection against waiver of the right to a judicial forum,that intention will be deducible from text or legislative history having made the bargain to arbitrate,the party should be held to it unless congress itself has evinced an intention to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue.mitsubishi motors,supra,at,citation omitted,italics added.
in mitsubishi motors,the court disagreed with the assertion that an award of treble damages under the clayton act served a public purpose and therefore precluded arbitration.instead,the court concluded that treble damages constituted a private remedy intended to compensate a plaintiff the provision wielded by the private litigant is a chief tool in the antitrust enforcement scheme,posing a crucial deterrent to potential violators 
the importance of the private damages remedy,however,does not compel the conclusion that it may not be sought outside an american court.notwithstanding its important incidental policing function,the cause of action seeks primarily to enable an injured competitor to gain compensation for that injury.
the provision authorizing an award of treble damages is in essence a remedial provision.it provides treble damages to a ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws of course,treble damages also play an important role in penalizing wrongdoers and deterring wrongdoing,as we also have frequently observed it nevertheless is true that the provision,which makes awards available only to injured parties,and measures the awards by a multiple of the injury actually proved,is designed primarily as a remedy.
t he provision was conceived of primarily as a remedy for t he people of the united states as individuals.mitsubishi motors,supra,at,citations omitted,italics added.
last,in mitsubishi motors,the court noted that the parties contract contained a clause,requiring that arbitration be conducted in japan,as well as a clause,mandating the application of the laws of the swiss confederation.at,fn.the court then commented,i n the event the and clauses operated in tandem as a prospective waiver of a party right to pursue statutory remedies for antitrust violations,we would have little hesitation in condemning the agreement as against public policy,italics added.s o long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate its statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum,the statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function.id.at,italics added.
in express mcmahon.mcmahon,the court held that claims based on the securities exchange act of and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico are subject to arbitration.addressing the claim under the securities exchange act of,the court noted that in scherk,supra,at pages,it had required that claims under the act be arbitrated where the arbitration agreement arose in an international context.see mcmahon,at.in mcmahon,the court held that securities claims involving domestic agreements are subject to arbitration because,in enacting the securities exchange act of,congress did not exempt such claims from the faa.see mcmahon,at.the court also noted that an administrative agency,the securities and exchange commission,has sufficient statutory authority to ensure that arbitration is adequate to vindicate exchange act rights.id.at,italics added.
as to the rico claim,the plaintiffs in mcmahon argued that the availability of treble damages see c served a public purpose,making the claim nonarbitrable.the supreme court rejected that argument,as it had with respect to an award of treble damages in antitrust cases.see mitsubishi motors,supra,at.the court concluded that an award of treble damages is a remedy intended to compensate a plaintiff,not a benefit conferred on the public.see mcmahon,supra,at.in short,the private attorney general role for the typical rico plaintiff is simply less plausible than it is for the typical antitrust plaintiff,and does not support a finding that there is an irreconcilable conflict between arbitration and enforcement of the rico statute.the plaintiffs may effectively vindicate their rico claim in an arbitral forum,and therefore there is no inherent conflict between arbitration and the purposes underlying the provision authorizing an award of treble damages.mcmahon,at,italics added.
given the foregoing case law,it was inevitable that the decision in wilko,supra,which exempted claims under the securities act of from arbitration would soon meet its demise.in rodriguez de quijas.exp,the court overruled wilko,saying it reflected the old judicial hostility to arbitration rodriguez de quijas,at.
finally,in the seminal case of gilmer lane.gilmer,the supreme court held that an employee claim under the age discrimination in employment act of adea is subject to arbitration.there,the plaintiff asserted that the adea is designed not only to address individual grievances,but also to further important social policies.gilmer,at.in response,the court stated we do not perceive any inherent inconsistency between those policies,however,and enforcing agreements to arbitrate age discrimination claims.it is true that arbitration focuses on specific disputes between the parties involved.the same can be said,however,of judicial resolution of claims.both of these dispute resolution mechanisms nevertheless also can further broader social purposes.the sherman act,the securities exchange act of,rico,and the securities act of all are designed to advance important public policies,but claims under those statutes are appropriate for arbitration.s o long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate his or her statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum,the statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function.
we also are unpersuaded by the argument that arbitration will undermine the role of the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc in enforcing the adea.an individual adea claimant subject to an arbitration agreement will still be free to file a charge with the eeoc,even though the claimant is not able to institute a private judicial action the plaintiff filed a charge with the eeoc in this case.in any event,the eeoc role in combating age discrimination is not dependent on the filing of a charge the agency may receive information concerning alleged violations of the adea from any source,and it has independent authority to investigate age discrimination.gilmer,supra,at,citation omitted,italics added.
the court continued it is also argued that arbitration procedures can not adequately further the purposes of the adea because they do not provide for broad equitable relief and class actions.as the court below noted,however,arbitrators do have the power to fashion equitable relief t he nyse rules applicable here do not restrict the types of relief an arbitrator may award,but merely refer to damages other relief.the nyse rules also provide for collective proceedings.but even if the arbitration could not go forward as a class action or class relief could not be granted by the arbitrator,the fact that the adea provides for the possibility of bringing a collective action does not mean that individual attempts at conciliation were intended to be barred.finally,it should be remembered that arbitration agreements will not preclude the eeoc from bringing actions seeking and equitable relief.gilmer,supra,at,citations omitted,some italics added see eeoc waffle house.arbitration agreement between employer and employee did not preclude eeoc from seeking relief for employee.
in sum,the united states supreme court has recognized that the faa embodies a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary moses cone hospital mercury constr,supra,at a state law is preempted if it singles out an arbitration agreement for different treatment than contracts in general southland keating,supra,at,the faa was enacted to place an arbitration agreement upon the same footing as other contracts and to overrule the judiciary longstanding refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate dean witter reynolds byrd,supra,at the faa was also intended to enforce private agreements to arbitrate and encourage the efficient and speedy resolution of disputes id.at and the faa was necessary to overcome the old judicial hostility to arbitration rodriguez de quijas,supra,at.
at the same time,the high court has stated that so long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate his or her statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum,the statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function mitsubishi motors,supra,at if an arbitration agreement operates as a prospective waiver of a party right to pursue statutory remedies,it will be condemn ed as against public policy id.at,fn.b y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim,an employee does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute he or she only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than a judicial,forum id.at an award of treble damages is a private,not a public,remedy,and a cause of action that permits the recovery of treble damages is therefore subject to arbitration see id.at mcmahon,supra,at the arbitration of claims on an individual as opposed to a class basis may be required if the arbitration agreement or rules permit an employee to bring collective proceedings or if an administrative agency may seek relief gilmer,supra,at see also mcmahon,supra,at and arbitration clauses may be revoked upon grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract southland keating,supra,at.the court also suggested by implication that if a cause of action authorizes a public remedy,arbitration may not be mandatory.see mitsubishi motors,supra,at because award of treble damages is a private,not public,remedy,antitrust claim is subject to mandatory arbitration mcmahon,supra,at same as to rico claim.
vindication of statutory rights 
in cole burns intern.security services cole,an employee filed suit against his former employer,alleging race discrimination,harassment based on race,and retaliation in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of title vii to.the employee asserted that the parties arbitration agreement was unconscionable because it lacked certain procedural protections.the court initially stated the starting point of our analysis is the supreme court decision in gilmer,supra.in that case,the court held that an employee agreement to arbitrate disputes may require him to arbitrate statutory claims under the adea because b y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim,an employee does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute he only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than a judicial,forum.t he court emphasized that so long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate his or her statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum,the statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function.obviously,gilmer can not be read as holding that an arbitration agreement is enforceable no matter what rights it waives or what burdens it imposes.cole,at.
the court of appeals rejected the employee argument that the arbitration agreement was unconscionable,explaining we believe that all of the factors addressed in gilmer are satisfied here.in particular,we note that the arbitration arrangement provides for neutral arbitrators,provides for more than minimal discovery,requires a written award,provides for all of the types of relief that would otherwise be available in court,and does not require employees to pay either unreasonable costs or any arbitrators fees or expenses as a condition of access to the arbitration forum.thus,an employee who is made to use arbitration as a condition of employment effectively may vindicate his or her statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum.d espite the strong faa policy of ordering arbitration hearings and implementing arbitration awards,minimal standards of procedural fairness must be satisfied before a civil action may be stayed and arbitration ordered a federal court,before enforcing an employer demand for arbitration under an employment contract,must scrutinize the or contemplated arbitration system.cole,supra,at,citations omitted.
three years later,in armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th armendariz,our supreme court relied extensively on gilmer and cole in holding that claims under the fair employment and housing act feha,involve unwaivable statutory rights and,therefore,the arbitration of feha claims requires an adequate arbitral forum one in which an employee may fully vindicate those rights.see armendariz,at.as the court put it a rbitration agreements that encompass unwaivable statutory rights must be subject to particular scrutiny.this unwaivability derives from two statutes that are themselves derived from public policy.first,civil code section states all contracts which have for their object,directly or indirectly,to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another,or violation of law,whether willful or negligent,are against the policy of the law.agreements whose object,directly or indirectly,is to exempt their parties from violation of the law are against public policy and may not be enforced.second,civil code section states,anyone may waive the advantage of a law intended solely for his benefit.but a law established for a public reason can not be contravened by a private agreement.armendariz,at,citation omitted,original italics.
although the arbitration agreement in armendariz was governed by the california arbitration act code civ,not the faa see armendariz,supra,cal th at,the court concluded that its analysis applied to both acts see id.at.in describing the minimum requirements for the lawful arbitration of unwaivable statutory rights pursuant to a mandatory employment arbitration agreement id.at,the court first noted that,in a prior case,it had held that a neutral arbitrator was essential to ensuring the integrity of the arbitration process.id.at,citing graham scissor tail,cal d.the court went on to hold an arbitration agreement can not limit statutorily available remedies armendariz,at t he denial of adequate discovery in arbitration proceedings leads to the de facto frustration of the employee statutory rights id.at an arbitrator in an feha case must issue a written arbitration decision containing essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based id.at and in arbitrating feha claims,the arbitration agreement can not generally require the employee to bear any type of expense that the employee would not be required to bear if he or she were free to bring the action in court id.at.an agreement that mandates the arbitration of feha claims impliedly obliges the employer to pay all types of costs that are unique to arbitration.id.at.
in green tree financial.randolph.randolph,decided after armendariz,the plaintiff purchased a mobile home and financed the purchase through defendants.the finance agreement required the arbitration of disputes between the parties and stated it was governed by the faa.the plaintiff filed suit against the defendants in federal court,alleging violations of the truth in lending act and the equal credit opportunity act.the defendants moved to compel arbitration.the plaintiff opposed the motion on the ground that the agreement was silent as to the payment of filing fees,arbitrator costs,and arbitration expenses.the district court granted the motion,and the court of appeals reversed.
the supreme court held that the arbitration agreement was enforceable w e are mindful of the faa purpose to reverse the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration agreements and to place arbitration agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.
in light of that purpose,we have recognized that federal statutory claims can be appropriately resolved through arbitration,and we have enforced agreements to arbitrate that involve such claims we have likewise rejected generalized attacks on arbitration that rest on suspicion of arbitration as a method of weakening the protections afforded in the substantive law to complainants.these cases demonstrate that even claims arising under a statute designed to further important social policies may be arbitrated because so long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate his or her statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum,the statute serves its functions.randolph,supra,at,citations omitted,italics added.
the court concluded it may well be that the existence of large arbitration costs could preclude a litigant such as the plaintiff from effectively vindicating her federal statutory rights in the arbitral forum.but the record does not show that she will bear such costs if she goes to arbitration i t contains hardly any information on the matter w e lack information about how claimants fare under the defendants arbitration clause.the record reveals only the arbitration agreement silence on the subject,and that fact alone is plainly insufficient to render it unenforceable.the risk that the plaintiff will be saddled with prohibitive costs is too speculative to justify the invalidation of an arbitration agreement.
to invalidate the agreement on that basis would undermine the liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.it would also conflict with our prior holdings that the party resisting arbitration bears the burden of proving that the claims at issue are unsuitable for arbitration we have held that the party seeking to avoid arbitration bears the burden of establishing that congress intended to preclude arbitration of the statutory claims at issue similarly,we believe that where,as here,a party seeks to invalidate an arbitration agreement on the ground that arbitration would be prohibitively expensive,that party bears the burden of showing the likelihood of incurring such costs.the plaintiff did not meet that burden.how detailed the showing of prohibitive expense must be before the party seeking arbitration must come forward with contrary evidence is a matter we need not discuss for in this case neither during discovery nor when the case was presented on the merits was there any timely showing at all on the point.randolph,supra,at,citations omitted,italics added.
in kristian comcast cir,the court of appeals applied randolph to federal and state antitrust claims,specifically,the clayton act,and the massachusetts antitrust act,ch.see kristian,at.although both acts authorized an award of attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party a.laws,ch,the arbitration agreements precluded such an award.
in concluding that the agreements prohibition on an award of attorney fees and costs was unenforceable,the court of appeals stated the supreme court assumption in randolph that a showing of prohibitive arbitration costs is a valid challenge to enforcement of an arbitration agreement makes practical sense.if,because of a consumer agreement,a plaintiff only apparent dispute resolution forum is binding,mandatory arbitration,and the plaintiff can not afford to arbitrate because of an inability to recover attorney fees and costs,the plaintiff is essentially deprived of any dispute resolution forum whatsoever.
here,plaintiffs have a much stronger position than the plaintiff in randolph.the clause in randolph was silent on the question of costs and fees.by contrast,the arbitration agreements explicitly state that a plaintiff bears all of his or her own costs,including the cost of experts and attorneys.the conflict between the arbitration agreements and the statutes could not be clearer.more importantly,again in contrast to the plaintiff in randolph,plaintiffs make a strong showing that costs and attorney fees will be prohibitively expensive.in the district court,plaintiffs submitted extensive declarations from a former massachusetts superior court justice,an attorney who specializes in antitrust law and class actions,and an economist.these declarations establish that the pursuit of plaintiffs antitrust claims will require a huge outlay of financial resources.without the possibility of recovering costs and attorney fees,an individual plaintiff would undoubtedly have an impossible time securing legal representation kristian comcast,supra,at,italics added.as stated by the court of appeals,our conclusion on plaintiff vindication of statutory rights claim id.at,italics added compels the affirmance of the district court decision to sever the clause prohibiting the recovery of costs and attorney fees ibid.
in booker robert half international,an employee was required by contract to arbitrate any dispute arising out of or relating to employment.an employee filed suit under the district of columbia human rights act,to,alleging he had been discharged based on race.although the act authorized an award of punitive damages to a prevailing employee see,b arthur young sutherland,the arbitration agreement contained a provision barring such an award booker,at.the district court severed that provision and granted the motion to compel arbitration.the employee appealed.
relying in part on randolph,supra,the court of appeals said we take from these recent cases two basic propositions first,that the party resisting arbitration on the ground that the terms of an arbitration agreement interfere with the effective vindication of statutory rights bears the burden of showing the likelihood of such interference,and second,that this burden can not be carried by mere speculation about how an arbitrator might interpret or apply the agreement.booker robert half international,supra,at.the court of appeals affirmed the district court decision,severing the punitive damages provision and granting the motion absent the severed clause.id.at.
in little auto stiegler,cal th,our supreme court addressed the continuing validity of armendariz,supra,cal th,in light of two decisions.first,in brown wheat first securities,the same circuit court that decided cole,supra,held that cole requirements for arbitrating claims under title vii were limited to federal statutory rights.see brown,at.in armendariz,our supreme court had relied on cole in establishing minimum requirements for arbitrating claims under the feha.see armendariz,supra,cal th at.in little,the supreme court declined to follow brown,saying the brown court apparent position that only federal statutory rights may be subject to cole requirements,because any attempt to place conditions on arbitration based on state law would be preempted by the faa,is incorrect.the faa provides that arbitration agreements are valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.thus,a principle that takes its meaning precisely from the fact that a contract to arbitrate is at issue does not comport with the text of of the faa.but under section of the faa,a state court may refuse to enforce an arbitration agreement based on generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability.one such ground for refusing to enforce a contractual term is that it would force a party to forgo unwaivable public rights 
w hile we recognize that a party compelled to arbitrate such rights does not waive them,but merely submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than a judicial,forum,arbitration can not be misused to accomplish a de facto waiver of these rights.accordingly,although the armendariz requirements specifically concern arbitration agreements,they do not do so out of a generalized mistrust of arbitration per se,but from a recognition that some arbitration agreements and proceedings may harbor terms,conditions and practices that undermine the vindication of unwaivable rights.the armendariz requirements are therefore applications of general state law contract principles regarding the unwaivability of public rights to the unique context of arbitration,and accordingly are not preempted by the faa.little auto stiegler,supra,cal th at,citations omitted,some italics added.
in little auto stiegler,supra,cal th,our supreme court also addressed whether armendariz was preempted by the faa as construed in randolph,supra.there,the united states supreme court stated that if a party seeks to invalidate an arbitration agreement on the ground that arbitration would be prohibitively expensive,that party bears the burden of showing the likelihood of incurring such costs.randolph,supra,at.in armendariz,our supreme court held that where an employee is required to arbitrate an feha claim,he or she is not obligated to pay any type of cost unique to arbitration regardless of whether the cost would be prohibitively expensive.armendariz,supra,cal th at.in little,our supreme court concluded that armendariz was not preempted by randolph,explaining although randolph was not an employment case,most courts interpreting it have done so in the employment context.these courts have arrived at divergent meanings of the prohibitively expensive standard established in randolph.some courts have interpreted that term narrowly and maintain that it does not affect the validity of the categorical position set forth in cole,supra,that the employer should pay the costs of a mandatory employment arbitration of statutory claims.citations.other courts have held that randolph represents a departure from cole categorical position,and requires a analysis based on such factors as the employee ability to pay the arbitration fees and the differential between projected arbitration and litigation fees.citations.still other courts have held the information presented by the employee before arbitration was too speculative to warrant invalidation of the arbitration agreement,while retaining jurisdiction to reconsider the cost issue after arbitration.citations.little auto stiegler,supra,cal th at.
our supreme court continued armendariz and randolph agree on two fundamental tenets.first,silence about costs in an arbitration agreement is not grounds for denying a motion to compel arbitration.second,arbitration costs can present significant barriers to the vindication of statutory rights.nonetheless,there may be a significant difference between the two cases.although randolph did not elaborate on the kinds of arrangements that would be unenforceable,dicta in that case,and several federal cases,suggest that federal law requires only that employers not impose prohibitively expensive arbitration costs on the employee,and that determination of whether such costs have been imposed are to be made on a basis.armendariz,on the other hand,categorically imposes costs unique to arbitration on employers when unwaivable rights pursuant to a mandatory employment arbitration agreement are at stake.assuming that randolph and armendariz pose solutions to the problem of arbitration costs that are in some respects different,we do not agree that the faa requires states to comply with federal arbitration standards.
armendariz requirement is not preempted by the faa.it is not a barrier to the enforcement of arbitration agreements,nor does it improperly disfavor arbitration in comparison to other contract clauses.rather,it is derived from state contract law principles regarding the unwaivability of certain public rights in the context of a contract of adhesion.we do not discern from the united states supreme court jurisprudence on faa preemption a requirement that state law conform precisely with federal law as to the manner in which such public rights are protected.little auto stiegler,supra,cal th at,citations omitted,italics added.
discover bank 
in discover bank,supra,cal th,overruled in concepcion,supra,our supreme court determined whether a class arbitration waiver in a consumer contract was unenforceable under the doctrine of unconscionability.in that case,the plaintiff,a credit cardholder,sued the card issuer,discover bank,alleging a claim for breach of contract and a claim for violation of the delaware consumer fraud act ann,tit.discover bank,at.discover bank moved to compel arbitration pursuant to an arbitration provision in the cardholder agreement,which also contained a class action waiver.the trial court initially rejected the plaintiff attack on the class action waiver and ordered his claims to be arbitrated on an individual basis.upon reconsideration,however,the trial court struck the class action waiver and granted the motion to compel,leaving open the possibility that the plaintiff might succeed in certifying a class in the arbitration proceeding.discover bank filed a petition for a writ of mandate in the court of appeal,which granted the petition on the ground that any california law invalidating a class action waiver was preempted by the faa.
the supreme court granted review.in reversing the court of appeal,the court explained that class action waivers found in consumer contracts may be substantively unconscionable inasmuch as they may operate effectively as exculpatory contract clauses that are contrary to public policy.as stated in civil code section all contracts which have for their object,directly or indirectly,to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another,or violation of law,whether willful or negligent,are against the policy of the law.discover bank,supra,cal th at,italics omitted.
the court then set forth the traditional principles of unconscionability t he doctrine has both a procedural and a substantive element,the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,the latter on overly harsh or results.the procedural element of an unconscionable contract generally takes the form of a contract of adhesion,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.substantively unconscionable terms may take various forms,but may generally be described as unfairly.discover bank,supra,cal th at.
ultimately,the court distilled a specific rule of unconscionability for class arbitration waivers in consumer contracts w hen the waiver is found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages,and when it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money,then,at least to the extent the obligation at issue is governed by california law,the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party from responsibility for its own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another.discover bank,supra,cal th at,quoting.
two years later,our supreme court decided gentry,supra,cal th.in gentry,an employee filed a putative class action against his employer,alleging a violation of california overtime compensation statutes.more specifically,the plaintiff alleged that his employer,circuit city,had illegally misclassified customer service managers as exempt employees not entitled to overtime pay,when in fact,they were employees entitled to be compensated for hours worked in excess of eight hours per day and hours per week.gentry,at.circuit city moved to compel arbitration pursuant to its associate issue resolution package and dispute resolution rules and procedures,which required the arbitration of disputes.the arbitration agreement also contained a class action waiver.the plaintiff opposed arbitration and argued the class action waiver was unenforceable.the trial court found the class action waiver was valid and granted the motion,ordering the plaintiff to arbitrate his claims on an individual basis.the court of appeal denied the plaintiff petition for a writ of mandate,concluding the class action waiver was enforceable.
the supreme court granted review to clarify our holding in discover bank.gentry,supra,cal th at.the court began by stating that discover bank was based on the doctrine of unconscionability.gentry,supra,th at.the court pointed out that we had no occasion in discover bank to consider whether a class action or class arbitration waiver would undermine the plaintiff statutory rights.id.at,italics added.after concluding that the right to overtime compensation was an unwaivable statutory right id.at,the court noted that its decision in armendariz,supra,cal th,was based on unwaivable statutory rights under the feha see id.at.the court stated we have not yet considered whether a class arbitration waiver would lead to a de facto waiver of statutory rights,or whether the ability to maintain a class action or arbitration is necessary to enable an employee to vindicate unwaivable rights in an arbitration forum.we conclude that under some circumstances such a provision would lead to a de facto waiver and would impermissibly interfere with employees ability to vindicate unwaivable rights and to enforce the overtime laws.id.at,italics added.
in describing when a class action waiver might constitute a de facto waiver of statutory rights,the court stated first,individual awards in cases tend to be modest.in addition to the fact that litigation over the minimum wage by definition involves the workers,overtime litigation also usually involves workers at the lower end of the pay scale,since professional,executive,and administrative employees are generally exempt from overtime statutes and regulations according to the report of the department of labor standards enforcement,obtained in response to gentry california public records act request,the average award from its wage adjudication unit for was.gentry,supra,cal th at,citations omitted.
next,the court explained it is true that section permits employees to recover reasonable attorney fees if they prevail in an overtime litigation suit even assuming that such attorney fees were equally available in arbitration,employees and their attorneys must weigh the typically modest recovery,and the typically modest means of the employees bringing overtime lawsuits,with the risk of not prevailing and being saddled with the substantial costs of paying their own attorneys.moreover,the award of reasonable fees and costs is at the discretion of the trial court.assuming that the arbitrator had similar discretion,there is still a risk that even a prevailing may be undercompensated for such expenses.given these risks and economic realities,class actions play an important function in enforcing overtime laws by permitting employees who are subject to the same unlawful payment practices a relatively inexpensive way to resolve their disputes.gentry,supra,cal th at,italics added.
the court continued a second factor in favor of class actions for these cases is that a current employee who individually sues his or her employer is at greater risk of retaliation.we have recognized that retaining one employment while bringing formal legal action against one employer is not a viable option for many employees.the difficulty of suing a current employer is likely greater for employees further down on the corporate hierarchy.as one court observed although there is only plaintiff suggestion of intimidation in this instance,the nature of the economic dependency involved in the employment relationship is inherently inhibiting.
f ederal courts have widely recognized that fear of retaliation for individual suits against an employer is a justification for class certification in the arena of employment litigation,even when it was otherwise questionable that the numerosity requirements of rule fed.rules,rule,were satisfied.gentry,supra,cal th at,citation omitted.
as a third factor to be considered,the court said s ome individual employees may not sue because they are unaware that their legal rights have been violated i t may often be the case that the illegal employer conduct escapes the attention of employees.some workers,particularly immigrants with limited english language skills,may be unfamiliar with the overtime laws even english speaking or better educated employees may not be aware of the nuances of overtime laws with their sometimes complex classifications of exempt and nonexempt employees a federal district court recently concluded that an arbitration agreement with a class arbitration waiver was inconsistent with the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the federal fair labor standards act flsa.in this case,the imposition of a waiver of class actions may effectively prevent employees from seeking redress of flsa violations.the class action waiver thereby circumscribes the legal options of these employees,who may be unable to incur the expense of individually pursuing their claims.gentry,supra,cal th at,citation omitted,italics added.
fourth,class actions may be needed to assure the effective enforcement of statutory policies even though some claims are large enough to provide an incentive for individual action.while employees may succeed under favorable circumstances in recovering unpaid overtime through a lawsuit or a wage claim filed with the labor commissioner,a class action may still be justified if these alternatives offer no more than the prospect of random and fragmentary enforcement of the employer legal obligation to pay overtime.by preventing a failure of justice in our judicial system,the class action not only benefits the individual litigant but serves the public interest in the enforcement of legal rights and statutory sanctions.gentry,supra,cal th at,citations omitted,italics added.
if an employee wage and hour claim involves the foregoing factors,including any real world obstacles to the vindication of class members rights to overtime through individual arbitration gentry,supra,cal th at,then a class action waiver in an arbitration agreement has an exculpatory effect id.at.and an exculpatory agreement violates civil code section,which states all contracts which have for their object,directly or indirectly,to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another,or violation of law,whether willful or negligent,are against the policy of the law.yet,under gentry,the foregoing factors are not sufficient to invalidate a class action waiver.
after discussing those factors,the court concluded w hen it is alleged that an employer has systematically denied proper overtime pay to a class of employees and a class action is requested notwithstanding an arbitration agreement that contains a class arbitration waiver,the trial court must consider the factors discussed above the modest size of the potential individual recovery,the potential for retaliation against members of the class,the fact that absent members of the class may be ill informed about their rights,and other real world obstacles to the vindication of class members rights to overtime pay through individual arbitration.if it concludes,based on these factors,that a class is likely to be a significantly more effective practical means of vindicating the rights of the affected employees than individual litigation or arbitration,and finds that the disallowance of the class action will likely lead to a less comprehensive enforcement of overtime laws for the employees alleged to be affected by the employer violations,it must invalidate the class arbitration waiver to ensure that these employees can vindicate their unwaivable rights gentry,supra,cal th at,italics added.
under gentry,if a class action waiver is invalid,and no other provision in the arbitration agreement is unenforceable,the court should invalidate the waiver and send the case to arbitration,where it may be heard as a class action,or have the case heard in court but only if the parties so stipulate.gentry,supra,cal th at see id.at see also franco i,supra,th at,finding two provisions of arbitration agreement invalid and declaring arbitration agreement unenforceable,permitting case to proceed in court see fn,ante.
at this point in our discussion,we think it beneficial to point out some considerations that affect an employee ability to vindicate his or her unwaivable statutory rights through arbitration.first,gentry involved a claim for overtime compensation.an employee who prevails on a claim alleging the failure to pay overtime compensation or the minimum wage is entitled to an award of attorney fees.see,subd.a gentry,supra,cal th at.similarly,an employee is entitled to attorney fees if he or she prevails on a claim for the nonpayment of wages,fringe benefits,or health and welfare or pension fund contributions.in kirby immoos fire protection,cal th,the supreme court held that the labor code,does not permit an award of attorney fees to an employee who prevails on a claim alleging a violation of the rest period statute.see kirby,at.the analysis in kirby seems equally applicable to a claim alleging a failure to provide a meal period.for an employee like franco whose overtime claim may be meritless and whose principal claims are based on the rest and meal period statutes see franco i,supra,th at,the unavailability of attorney fees would make it significantly less likely that an attorney would pursue his rest and meal period claims on an individual basis.in cases alleging rest and meal period claims,kirby increases the need for class relief if employees are to vindicate their unwaivable statutory rights.
next,as to the second factor in gentry the risk of retaliation faced by a current employee who files an individual wage and hour claim gentry cited statistics compiled by the department of labor standards enforcement dlse the number of retaliation complaints filed with the dlse ranged annually from percent of all complaints in to retaliation complaints percent of all complaints in.see gentry,supra,cal th at.our examination of post dlse reports shows that there were retaliation complaints percent of all complaints in percent in percent in percent in percent in percent in percent in and percent in.see state of,of industrial relations,dlse,discrimination complaint report retaliation complaint reports as of.although the absolute number of retaliation complaints has varied over the years,that type of complaint has constituted over half of the dlse caseload and has been,by far,the largest category of complaints.
consequently,it remains true that these statistics are supportive of the position that retaliation against employees for asserting statutory rights under the labor code is widespread.given that retaliation would cause immediate disruption of the employee life and economic injury,and given that the outcome of the complaint process is uncertain,we do not believe the existence of an antiretaliation statute and an administrative complaint process undermines the point that fear of retaliation will often deter employees from individually suing their employers.gentry,supra,cal th,italics added.
as an illustration of gentry third factor some individual employees may not sue because they are unaware that their legal rights have been violated gentry,supra,cal th at we note that,while the legal community awaited the supreme court decision in brinker restaurant superior court,supra,cal th,no one could describe with assurance the scope of an employer duty to provide rest and meal periods.brinker devoted several pages to explaining the amount of rest time that must be authorized,and the timing of any rest periods.id.at see id.at.the court also addressed the propriety of a class action as to rest period claims.id.at.on the subject of meal periods,the court held that an employer satisfies its obligation if it relieves its employees of all duty,relinquishes control over their activities and permits them a reasonable opportunity to take an uninterrupted minute break,and does not impede or discourage them from doing so.t he employer is not obligated to police meal breaks and ensure no work thereafter is performed.bona fide relief from duty and the relinquishing of control satisfies the employer obligations,and work by a relieved employee during a meal break does not thereby place the employer in violation of its obligations and create liability for premium pay id.at,italics added.the court also discussed the timing of meal periods id.at,and the propriety of pursuing meal period claims as a class action id.at.
finally,in arguelles romero superior court cal.app th,the court of appeal explained the doctrinal distinctions between discover bank and gentry.as the court stated discover bank involved allegations of an unconscionable class action waiver the supreme court first concluded that when a consumer is given an amendment to its cardholder agreement in the form of a bill stuffer that he would be deemed to accept if he did not close his account,an element of procedural unconscionability is present.the court then turned to the issue of substantive unconscionability,and concluded that class action waivers may be substantively unconscionable inasmuch as they may operate effectively as exculpatory contract clauses that are contrary to public policy.arguelles romero,at,citation omitted.
in contrast,what we will call the rule of gentry is not a rule of unconscionability 
the seeds for the rule of gentry were planted not in discover bank,but in armendariz,supra,cal th.armendariz considered whether a plaintiff could be compelled to arbitrate discrimination claims brought under the fair employment and housing act feha.the supreme court began with the premise that feha rights are unwaivable the court agreed that,as a general matter,assuming the arbitral forum is adequate,an agreement to arbitrate a nonwaivable statutory claim does not waive the claim,it simply submits its resolution to another forum however,if the arbitral forum is not adequate,an agreement to arbitrate a nonwaivable statutory claim may,in fact,improperly compel the claimant to forfeit his or her statutory rights the armendariz court then considered the minimum requirements that any arbitral forum would have to meet so that forcing a party to pursue nonwaivable statutory claims in that forum would still enable the party to vindicate his or her rights 
the question that arose in gentry was whether the right to a class arbitration should also be included among the armendariz protections as a necessary minimum requirement for the arbitration of a nonwaivable statutory right.the supreme court concluded that it should,at least in some cases.arguelles romero superior court,supra,th at,citations fn.omitted.while discover bank and gentry were applications of the same general principle,it is also apparent that they involved different legal theories.discover bank is based on unconscionability,which is a legal determination subject to de novo review,while gentry is based on whether a class action is a significantly more effective practical means of vindicating unwaivable statutory rights,which is a discretionary determination subject to abuse of discretion review.id.at see franco i,supra,th at discover bank based on doctrine of unconscionability while gentry based on waiver of statutory rights.
class arbitration under the faa 
for our purposes,two decisions of the united states supreme court are pertinent in determining whether gentry remains good law.
stolt nielsen 
in stolt nielsen,supra,a dispute arose between a shipping company and one of its customers.the customer filed a putative class action in federal district court,alleging an antitrust claim.the parties had agreed to arbitrate their disputes.after filing suit in federal district court,the customer served the shipping company with a demand for class arbitration.id.at.the parties entered into a supplemental agreement providing that a panel of three arbitrators would decide if the case could be maintained as a class arbitration,and the arbitration clause was silent on that point.id.at.the arbitrators concluded the arbitration clause permitted class arbitration and issued an award resolving only that question.id.at.the panel stayed its decision to allow the parties to seek judicial review.ibid.
the district court vacated the award,concluding that the arbitrators should have based their decision on custom and usage in the maritime industry.the court of appeals reversed the district court on the ground that maritime law did not prohibit class arbitration.stolt nielsen,supra.at.
the supreme court granted certiorari and reversed the court of appeals.in holding that the arbitrators had exceeded their powers stolt nielsen,supra.at,the court stated rather than inquiring whether the faa,maritime law,or new york law contains a default rule under which an arbitration clause is construed as allowing class arbitration in the absence of express consent,the panel proceeded as if it had the authority of a court to develop what it viewed as the best rule to be applied in such a situation.id.at.w e have said on numerous occasions that the central or primary purpose of the faa is to ensure that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their terms.whether enforcing an agreement to arbitrate or construing an arbitration clause,courts and arbitrators must give effect to the contractual rights and expectations of the parties.in this endeavor,as with any other contract,the parties intentions control.this is because an arbitrator derives his or her powers from the parties agreement to forgo the legal process and submit their disputes to private dispute resolution underscoring the consensual nature of private dispute resolution,we have held that parties are generally free to structure their arbitration agreements as they see fit.id.at,citations omitted.i t follows that a party may not be compelled under the faa to submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to do so.id.at,original italics.
in the court view an implicit agreement to authorize arbitration is not a term that the arbitrator may infer solely from the fact of the parties agreement to arbitrate.this is so because arbitration changes the nature of arbitration to such a degree that it can not be presumed the parties consented to it by simply agreeing to submit their disputes to an arbitrator.in bilateral arbitration,parties forgo the procedural rigor and appellate review of the courts in order to realize the benefits of private dispute resolution lower costs,greater efficiency and speed,and the ability to choose expert adjudicators to resolve specialized disputes 
consider just some of the fundamental changes brought about by the shift from bilateral arbitration to arbitration.an arbitrator chosen according to an procedure no longer resolves a single dispute between the parties to a single agreement,but instead resolves many disputes between hundreds or perhaps even thousands of parties the arbitrator award no longer purports to bind just the parties to a single arbitration agreement,but adjudicates the rights of absent parties as well and the commercial stakes of arbitration are comparable to those of litigation even though the scope of judicial review is much more limited we think that the differences between bilateral and arbitration are too great for arbitrators to presume,consistent with their limited powers under the faa,that the parties mere silence on the issue of arbitration constitutes consent to resolve their disputes in class proceedings.stolt nielsen,supra.at,citations omitted.
thus,stolt nielsen held that class arbitration is not permitted unless the parties have expressly or implicitly agreed to it.gentry,on the other hand,concerned the enforceability of class action waivers that prevent the vindication of unwaivable statutory rights and that constitute exculpatory clauses.nevertheless,gentry concluded that,if a class action waiver is unenforceable,the court should invalidate the waiver and send the case to arbitration,where the plaintiff may attempt to certify a class.see gentry,supra,cal th at.but under stolt nielsen,class arbitration is not permitted unless the parties agree to that procedure.see stolt nielsen,supra.at truly nolen of america superior court,supra,th at.plainly,in a case where gentry applies to invalidate a class action waiver the parties have not agreed in any fashion to allow class arbitration.consequently,under stolt nielsen,the remedy under gentry should be the denial of the motion or petition to compel arbitration,permitting the case to be heard in court,where the plaintiff may seek to certify a class.see sutherland ernst young,llp d.
concepcion 
in february,vincent and liza concepcion purchased cellular telephones and service from at t.the telephones were advertised as free,but the concepcions were charged in sales tax based on the telephones retail value.the concepcions filed suit in the united states district court for the southern district of california.the case was later consolidated with a putative class action,alleging that at t had engaged in false advertising and fraud by charging sales tax on phones it advertised as free.concepcion,supra.at.
the purchase agreement between the concepcions and at t contained a provision requiring the arbitration of all disputes and prohibiting class or representative proceedings.the agreement further provided that customers may initiate dispute proceedings by completing a notice of dispute form available on at t web site.at t may then offer to settle the claim if it does not,or if the dispute is not resolved within days,the customer may invoke arbitration by filing a separate demand for arbitration,also available on at t web site.in the event the parties proceed to arbitration,the agreement specifies that at t must pay all costs for nonfrivolous claims that arbitration must take place in the county in which the customer is billed that,for claims of or less,the customer may choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person,by telephone,or based only on submissions that either party may bring a claim in small claims court in lieu of arbitration and that the arbitrator may award any form of individual relief,including injunctions and presumably punitive damages.the agreement denies at t any ability to seek reimbursement of its attorney fees,and,in the event that a customer receives an arbitration award greater than at t last written settlement offer,requires at t to pay a minimum recovery and twice the amount of the claimant attorney fees.concepcion,supra.at.
at t moved to compel arbitration.the district court denied the motion.it described at t arbitration agreement favorably,noting,for example,that the informal process was quick,easy to use and likely to promp t full or even excess payment to the customer without the need to arbitrate or litigate and that consumers who were members of a class would likely be worse off.concepcion,supra.at,italics added.nevertheless,the district court found the class arbitration waiver unenforceable under discover bank,supra,cal th.the ninth circuit affirmed for the same reason.
the supreme court granted certiorari to decide the following question presented whether the federal arbitration act preempts states from conditioning the enforcement of an arbitration agreement on the availability of particular procedures here,arbitration when those procedures are not necessary to ensure that the parties to the arbitration agreement are able to vindicate their claims.supreme,at t mobility llc concepcion,question presented as of,italics added.
in reversing the ninth circuit and overruling discover bank,the supreme court began by quoting section of the faa the act primary substantive provision.concepcion,supra.at.that section states a written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.concepcion,at,italics added.as the supreme court acknowledged the final phrase of permits arbitration agreements to be declared unenforceable upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.this saving clause permits agreements to arbitrate to be invalidated by generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,but not by defenses that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.concepcion,at.
the court then observed that discover bank classif ies most waivers in consumer contracts as unconscionable.concepcion,supra.at,italics added.the court continued when state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim,the analysis is straightforward the conflicting rule is displaced by the faa but the inquiry becomes more complex when a doctrine normally thought to be generally applicable,such as duress or,as relevant here,unconscionability,is alleged to have been applied in a fashion that disfavors arbitration.id.at.although saving clause preserves generally applicable contract defenses,nothing in it suggests an intent to preserve rules that stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the faa objectives.id.at.the overarching purpose of the faa is to ensure the enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms so as to facilitate streamlined proceedings the principal purpose of the faa is to ensur e that private arbitration agreements are enforced according to their terms.this purpose is readily apparent from the faa text.section makes arbitration agreements valid,irrevocable,and enforceable as written subject,of course,to the saving clause.concepcion,at.a prime objective of an agreement to arbitrate is to achieve streamlined proceedings and expeditious results.id.at.
in overruling discover bank,the court explained california discover bank rule interferes with arbitration.although the rule does not require classwide arbitration,it allows any party to a consumer contract to demand it ex post.the rule is limited to adhesion contracts,but the times in which consumer contracts were anything other than adhesive are long past the rule also requires that damages be predictably small,and that the consumer allege a scheme to cheat consumers the former requirement,however,is toothless and malleable,and the latter has no limiting effect,as all that is required is an allegation.concepcion,supra.at,citations fn.omitted.
the court went on to describe the differences between bilateral and class arbitrations.first,the switch from bilateral to class arbitration sacrifices the principal advantage of arbitration its informality and makes the process slower,more costly,and more likely to generate procedural morass than final judgment.concepcion,supra.at.second,class arbitration requires procedural formality.the rules of the american arbitration association governing class arbitrations mimic the federal rules of civil procedure for class litigation.ibid.third,class arbitration greatly increases risks to defendants.informal procedures do of course have a cost the absence of multilayered review makes it more likely that errors will go uncorrected.defendants are willing to accept the costs of these errors in arbitration,since their impact is limited to the size of individual disputes,and presumably outweighed by savings from avoiding the courts.but when damages allegedly owed to tens of thousands of potential claimants are aggregated and decided at once,the risk of an error will often become unacceptable arbitration is poorly suited to the higher stakes of class litigation.in litigation,a defendant may appeal a certification decision on an interlocutory basis and,if unsuccessful,may appeal from a final judgment as well.questions of law are reviewed de novo and questions of fact for clear error.in contrast,allows a court to vacate an arbitral award only where the award was procured by corruption,fraud,or undue means there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy,or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced or if the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award was not made.concepcion,at.
in its concluding remarks,the court stated the dissent claims that class proceedings are necessary to prosecute claims that might otherwise slip through the legal system but states can not require a procedure that is inconsistent with the faa,even if it is desirable for unrelated reasons.moreover,the claim here was most unlikely to go unresolved t he arbitration agreement provides that at t will pay claimants a minimum of and twice their attorney fees if they obtain an arbitration award greater than at t last settlement offer.the district court found this scheme sufficient to provide incentive for the individual prosecution of meritorious claims that are not immediately settled,and the ninth circuit admitted that aggrieved customers who filed claims would be essentially guarantee d to be made whole t he district court concluded that the concepcions were better off under their arbitration agreement with at t than they would have been as participants in a class action because it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress,california discover bank rule is preempted by the faa.concepcion,supra.at,citations omitted.
categorical rules against class action waivers 
as we read concepcion,the faa preempted the discover bank rule because it operated as a categorical prohibition on class action waivers in consumer contracts.according to the supreme court,discover bank would invalidate most of those waivers see concepcion,supra.at and allows any party to a consumer contract to demand classwide arbitration ex post id.at.
t he supreme court in concepcion concluded that the triggering conditions of california discover bank rule imposed no effective limit on its application the court implied that although the discover bank rule was cast as an application of unconscionability doctrine,in effect,it set forth a state policy placing bilateral arbitration categorically for certain categories of consumer fraud cases,upon the mere ex post demand by any consumer.cruz cingular wireless,llc cir.the lack of any requirement of showing actual unconscionability meant that discover bank created an essentially categorical requirement of class arbitration brewer missouri title loans.t he critical flaw leading to the preemption of the discover bank rule was that it required class arbitration even if class arbitration disadvantaged consumers and was unnecessary for the consumer to obtain a remedy.id.at.
based on our reading of concepcion,we reject the conclusion that the faa requires state courts to replace the essentially categorical discover bank rule requiring class arbitration with another categorical rule requiring individual arbitration in every case brewer missouri title loans,supra,at.
this interpretation is supported by the decision in marmet health care center brown.there,the supreme court held that the faa preempted a west virginia rule prohibiting arbitration agreements from encompassing claims against a nursing home for negligence resulting in personal injury or death.see id.at.relying on concepcion,the high court stated west virginia prohibition against predispute agreements to arbitrate or claims against nursing homes is a categorical rule prohibiting arbitration of a particular type of claim,and that rule is contrary to the terms and coverage of the faa.marmet health care center,at,italics added see also perry thomas.faa preempts california statute permitting civil action for collection of wages despite parties agreement to arbitrate wage disputes doctor associates,casarotto.faa preempts montana statute that requires a contract subject to arbitration to contain notice of arbitration on first page preston ferrer.when parties agree to arbitrate all disputes,faa preempts state statutes vesting administrative forum with primary jurisdiction over dispute.
concepcion recognized that t he overarching purpose of the faa is to ensure the enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms so as to facilitate streamlined proceedings.concepcion.at.but concepcion did not hold that every ground for revoking an arbitration agreement under the savings clause in section of the faa is preempted just because it interferes with the purposes of the act.that interpretation would render the savings clause meaningless.every ground for revocation under section such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability renders an arbitration agreement partially or totally unenforceable according to its terms.and in concepcion,the supreme court acknowledged that the saving clause permits agreements to arbitrate to be invalidated by generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability.concepcion,at accord,id.at principal purpose of the faa to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms is subject to savings clause.
as explained by commentators the savings clause of the faa provides that arbitration agreements are enforceable save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.concepcion then adds the proviso that,even if a defense is generally applicable to litigation and arbitration alike,it loses the protection of the faa savings clause if it stands as an obstacle to the intent of congress which means,at the very least,if it renders arbitration,as traditionally defined,unavailable in some category of cases.gilles friedman,after class aggregate litigation in the wake of at t mobility concepcion,fn.omitted.
concepcion is,at base,about obstacle preemption.in evaluating a defense under which plaintiffs must show that the imposition of the class waiver confers de facto immunity,the critical issue following concepcion is whether the defense will be deemed to stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress,as expressed in the faa.this inquiry turns on just what stands as an obstacle means.
so what was it about the discover bank unconscionability defense that made it an impermissible obstacle,so as to trigger preemption under the faa notwithstanding its nondiscriminatory general applicability within the meaning of the savings clause this much we know it was not because the successful invocation of that defense in any given case would render an arbitration clause unenforceable as written.any such objection would be circular it would mean the defense is an impermissible obstacle because it is a defense.whenever any common law contract defense is successfully invoked under the faa savings clause including fraudulent inducement,duress,or anything else the arbitration clause may not be enforced as written,or sometimes at all.so unless we are to rescind the savings clause,we must look elsewhere for the meaning of obstacle.in our view,the unconscionability defense in concepcion stood as an obstacle,for preemption purposes,because it was a categorical rule that applied to all consumer cases.the sin of the discover bank rule was that it did not require the claimant to show that the agreement operated as an exculpatory contract on a basis 
in essence the standard boils down to this.to support the rejection of an arbitration provision under the savings clause,a defense of exculpatory contract must be recognized as a ground for the revocation of contracts as a matter of state law apply to any contract,in or out of arbitration and be supported by a showing that the invocation of the arbitration clause in a specific case would be exculpatory or would confer de facto immunity upon the defendant.gilles friedman,after class aggregate litigation in the wake of at t mobility concepcion,supra.at,fns.omitted,italics added.if a state law exists that automatically holds all class action waivers as unconscionable,then the state law is preempted by the faa,which was the issue and holding in concepcion.note,there is still hope for the little guy unconscionability is still a defense against arbitration clauses despite at t concepcion whittier.
as we have previously discussed,gentry is not a categorical rule against class action waivers.see pt,ante.rather,it is a multifactor test applied on a basis that turns on whether,after an analysis of several factors,the court finds that a class is likely to be a significantly more effective practical means of vindicating the rights of the affected employees than individual litigation or arbitration,and finds that the disallowance of the class action will likely lead to a less comprehensive enforcement of wage and hour laws for the employees alleged to be affected by the employer violations gentry,supra,cal th at see id.at.indeed,in petitioning the trial court to compel arbitration the first time,athens services conceded that gentry was not a blanket rule invalidating class action waivers in all employment arbitration agreements.italics added.
as gentry itself recognized we can not say categorically that all class arbitration waivers in overtime cases are unenforceable.as the points out,some published cases over the last years in california have involved individual employees prosecuting overtime violations without the assistance of class litigation or arbitration.citations.not all overtime cases will necessarily lend themselves to class actions,nor will employees invariably request such class actions.nor in every case will class action or arbitration be demonstrably superior to individual actions.gentry,supra,cal th at.
consistent with the multifactor nature of the test in gentry,our supreme court remand ed th at case to the court of appeal with directions to remand to the trial court to determine whether,in this particular case,class proceedings would be a significantly more effective means than individual arbitration actions of vindicating the right to overtime pay of the group of employees whose rights to such pay have been allegedly violated by circuit city.if the trial court invalidates the waiver on public policy grounds,then the parties may initiate class proceedings gentry,supra,cal th at.
accordingly,gentry is not preempted by the faa because it is not a categorical rule that invalidates class action waivers the type of rule that concepcion condemned.
vindication of statutory rights 
as noted,the question presented in concepcion did not expressly address whether an arbitration agreement is enforceable if it fails to ensure that the parties can vindicate their claims.see pt,ante.nor did the opinion in concepcion mention the line of supreme court cases stating that an arbitration agreement is unenforceable if it prevents a claimant from vindicating his or her statutory claims.in the months since concepcion was decided,courts have reached different conclusions as to whether gentry has been overruled.see reyes liberman broadcasting,th,discussing cases.
to our knowledge,only one published decision has referenced the question presented in concepcion,and it held that a class action waiver was unenforceable because the waiver prevented the plaintiff from vindicating her statutory right to overtime compensation.in sutherland ernst young,llp,supra,f.supp d,and sutherland ernst young,llp d,an employee filed a putative class action alleging her employer had violated the fair labor standards act of by not paying overtime compensation.although the parties were subject to an arbitration agreement containing a class action waiver,the district court invalidated the waiver on the ground that the plaintiff could not afford to pursue her claim on an individual basis.
as the district court explained in its first decision sutherland uncontested submission estimates that her attorney fees during arbitration will exceed,and that costs will exceed sutherland will utilize expert assistance in support of her claims her expert,a professor of accountancy,has submitted an affidavit stating that his fees may exceed,and that he requires a retainer payment of in sum,sutherland would be required to spend approximately in order to recover double her overtime loss of approximately.sutherland ernst young,llp,supra,d at,citations fn.omitted.
the district court found that e ven if sutherland were willing to incur approximately to recover a few thousand dollars,she would be unable to retain an attorney to prosecute her individual claim.this is due largely to the arbitration agreement obstacles to reimbursement of fees and expenses.whether attorney fees and expenses incurred during arbitration are compensable is subject to the discretion of the arbitrators the amount of such reimbursement is also left to the arbitrators discretion.in light of the foregoing,sutherland can not reasonably be expected to retain an attorney to pursue her individual claim.sutherland ernst young,llp,supra,d at.sutherland only option in pursuing her individual claim is thus to retain an attorney on a contingent fee basis.but just as no rational person would expend hundreds of thousands of dollars to recover a few thousand dollars in damages,no attorney regardless of competence would ever take such a case on a contingent fee basis.if sutherland could aggregate her claim with the claims of others similarly situated,however,she would have no difficulty in obtaining legal representation this is because class proceedings achieve economies of time,effort,and expense id.at,citations fn.omitted.
in the district court second decision,the court concluded that preemption under concepcion occurs when a plaintiff lacks the incentive to pursue a claim,but,in the case before it,the plaintiff lacked the means to bring a claim the facts in sutherland case differ from concepcion with respect to the plaintiff ability to vindicate her statutory rights.the court in concepcion emphasized in detail the provisions in that arbitration agreement that benefitted plaintiffs and that ensured that the concepcions would be able to find redress for their claims t he question presented to the court in concepcion was whether the faa preempts states from conditioning the enforcement of an arbitration agreement on the availability of particular procedures here,arbitration when those procedures are not necessary to ensure that the parties to the arbitration agreement are able to vindicate their claims.in contrast to the facts in concepcion,sutherland has demonstrated that she would not be able to obtain representation or vindicate her rights on an individual basis.sutherland ernst young,llp,supra,d at,italics added in sutherland.
in distinguishing concepcion,the district court continued there is a difference between claims that might slip through the cracks because plaintiffs choose not to prosecute them individually,and claims for which a plaintiff seeks redress but is precluded from vindicating her rights.this difference is the difference between the situation faced by the concepcions and that faced by sutherland.the terms of the arbitration agreement at issue in concepcion ensured that the concepcions could bring their claim in arbitration on an individual basis,either representing themselves or with counsel.the fact that a plaintiff in the same situation as the concepcions might choose not to make a claim for such a small overcharge is not the court concern,even if a lawyer might be eager to bring the case on behalf of all similarly situated plaintiffs,but for the waiver.by contrast,the terms of the arbitration agreement and the cost of discovery in sutherland case preclude her from redressing alleged flsa violations.sutherland case is similar instead to situations discussed by the supreme court in which it has stated that it may not enforce contractual agreements that would operate as a prospective waiver of a party right to pursue statutory remedies.sutherland ernst young,llp,supra,d at,citing mitsubishi motors,supra,at,fn.
as the ninth circuit recently observed in upholding a class action waiver t he concepcion court examined this very arbitration agreement and concluded that aggrieved customers who filed claims would be essentially guaranteed to be made whole.
the dissent in concepcion focused on a related but different concern even if the arbitration agreements guaranteed via provisions that complaining customers would be made whole with respect to damages and counsel fees,most customers would not bother filing claims because the amounts are too small to be worth the trouble that is,the concern is not so much that customers have no effective means to vindicate their rights,but rather that customers have insufficient incentive to do so.that concern is,of course,a primary policy rationale for class actions but as the supreme court stated in concepcion,such unrelated policy concerns,however worthwhile,can not undermine the faa.coneff v.at t cir,citations fn.omitted,original italics.put another way,preemption under concepcion occurs if the arbitration process would make a prevailing claimant whole,but the amount in dispute is so small that a claimant does not think it worth the effort to pursue relief preemption does not occur under concepcion if a claimant lacks the means to pursue a claim in arbitration because the cost of pursuing relief on an individual basis whether in arbitration or court exceeds the potential recovery.
so it is here.franco lacks the means,not the incentive,to pursue his rest and meal period claims on an individual basis in arbitration.the attorney declarations submitted by franco in opposing the petition to compel arbitration stated that,based on his estimated recovery of around in damages and paga penalties,it would be highly unlikely that an attorney would represent him on an individual basis in either arbitration or court.thus,it does not matter that athens services would pay the arbitrator fee and any other expenses unique to arbitration franco case is not viable in either forum unless it can be brought as a class action.
as one attorney explained i advance all costs and all of our firm time even so,i recognize that often any financial remuneration will not be forthcoming until years and years after i initially begin to pursue a case.i litigate labor code cases similar to this case on a class basis and would not take a case from any of the absent class members if i had to litigate it on an individual basis because of the moderate damages and because these cases are labor intensive.additionally,it makes no sense to bring these cases individually because the employer can simply pay the small damages and not be forced to correct its unlawful behavior.i t would be extremely difficult for an employee to obtain representation for their labor code cases if they needed to either arbitrate or litigate in court individually.many cases such as this one have damages significantly lower than your typical harassment or discrimination case these labor code cases involve many hours of attorney work and despite the possibility of obtaining attorneys fees upon a successful arbitration,the chances that an arbitrator will award the attorney the full amount of hours worked are not great.italics added.
as noted,after we decided franco i long after the attorney declarations were submitted the california supreme court held that attorney fees are not recoverable by an employee who prevails on a rest period claim.see kirby immoos fire protection,supra,cal th at.the court analysis also appears to apply to employees who prevail on a meal period claim.
as stated by another attorney in support of franco opposition without the ability to litigate these labor code cases as a class proceeding,my firm could not represent the individual class members especially if we had to arbitrate each one separately because of the low damages present in many of these cases,including this one.moreover,if the entire class were to come into my office,we could not litigate each case separately,either in court or in arbitration.
p aying the claims of each individual employee who happens to walk into my or another attorney office will not deter the employer from continuing to deny rest and meal periods or force the employer to pay its employees the w
