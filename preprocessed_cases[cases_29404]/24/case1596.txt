discussion 
our analysis is narrowly tailored to this record,in particular to the parties agreements.we do not decide any issue as a matter of law.instead,on this record we simply conclude the parties agreements were adhesive contracts fatally infected with procedural and substantive unconscionability.
the purchase agreements were adhesion contracts 
the superior court concluded the parties agreements were contracts of adhesion because plaintiffs were presented with standardized contracts drafted by pardee and imposed on plaintiffs who could only accept or reject them.thus,in attacking the court denial of its motion for judicial reference,pardee first contends the parties agreements were not contracts of adhesion.more particularly,pardee asserts the court eliminated the parties contractual rights to judicial reference despite plaintiffs failure to produce evidence that the parties agreements were contracts of adhesion.specifically,pardee argues plaintiffs did not present evidence that if plaintiffs had refused to proceed with their home purchases from pardee,plaintiffs could not have obtained other tract houses in other developments in the same general area from different sellers with purchase contracts that did not include judicial reference provisions.
the term contract of adhesion signifies a standardized contract,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,armendariz villa milano homeowners il davorge th,d izzi mesquite country club d.if the contract is adhesive,the court must then determine whether other factors are present which,under established legal or to render it unenforceable.citation.generally speaking,there are two judicially imposed limitations on the enforcement of adhesion contracts or provisions thereof.the first is that such a contract or provision which does not fall within the reasonable expectations of the weaker or adhering party will not be enforced against him.citations.the principle of equity applicable to all contracts that a contract or provision,even if consistent with the reasonable expectations of the parties,will be denied enforcement if,considered in its context,it is unduly oppressive or unconscionable.citations.subsequent cases have referred to both the reasonable expectations and the oppressive limitations as being aspects of unconscionability.armendariz,supra,at,d.
unconscionability analysis begins with an inquiry into whether the contract is one of adhesion.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.although this record contains no specific evidence of adhesion,the introduction to pardee petition alleged that plaintiffs lawsuit was brought by individuals,with of those plaintiffs potentially filing suit as class representatives for up to additional sets of class members for the project where plaintiffs live or potentially additional sets of class members for the master plan development where plaintiffs project is located and each and every purchase agreement for the project and the entire master plan development included the judicial reference provision.by thus acknowledging that none of the hundreds of home purchasers struck out the judicial reference provision,pardee has effectively admitted the parties agreements were adhesive.further,as potential buyers interested in pardee homes,plaintiffs were unlikely to have significant economic bargaining power against developer pardee.moreover,since judicial reference provisions were contained in agreements for purchase of all homes in pardee large development,plaintiffs had little choice other than to sign those agreements as presented by pardee.as stated by the superior court at the hearing on pardee motion,the situation presented each buyer with a proposition and since each buyer was buying a house,not a piece of sporting equipment or some other regular type of product,factors such as location,view,and made it a pretty unique purchase,one that for most peopl
