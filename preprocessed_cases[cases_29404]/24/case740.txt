ross brothers construction company,brought suit against international steel services,and american oxide company to recover damages for labor and materials it furnished during a construction project.ross sued international steel for breach of contract,and sought to foreclose on a mechanic lien that it filed against real estate owned by american oxide.the defendants moved for summary judgment,seeking to have the breach of contract claim dismissed and transferred to arbitration,and the mechanic lien released and discharged.during the course of the summary judgment proceedings,a dispute arose as to the number of purchase order agreements at issue in the litigation.ross argued that it was seeking relief pursuant to three separate purchase order agreements.the defendants,however,contended that ross complaint only stated claims for relief under one purchase order agreement,not three.the district court held that ross complaint only requested relief under one purchase order agreement,and granted the defendants motion for summary judgment as to that agreement.the plaintiff appeals,and we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
on may,ross brothers construction,entered into a purchase order agreement with defendant international steel services,whereby ross agreed to supply labor and materials to international steel for the construction of an acid regeneration plant on real estate owned by defendant american oxide company,and its accompanying attachments,provided that the agreement was made under pennsylvania law,and included arbitration and waiver of lien clauses.in addition to,ross contends that it also entered into two subsequent verbal purchase order agreements with international steel,and,and that these agreements were separate and independent from.
ross submitted invoices to international steel for work performed and materials supplied pursuant to all three purchase order agreements.after international steel refused to pay the invoices,ross filed a mechanic lien on american oxide real estate in the amount of.ross then initiated an action in state court against international steel for breach of contract,and against american oxide to foreclose on the mechanic lien.the defendants removed the case to federal district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship,and filed a counterclaim against ross for breach of contract.shortly thereafter,the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that the arbitration provision contained in required ross breach of contract claim to be transferred to arbitration,and that ross had waived the right to file a mechanic lien because contained a valid lien waiver provision.in responding to these arguments,ross noted that was not the only purchase order agreement at issue in the litigation.ross asserted that it had performed work pursuant to three separate purchase order agreements,and.ross argued that and are not subject to the choice of law,arbitration,and lien waiver provisions contained in,and that even if these provisions apply to and they are void as a matter of law.the defendants countered by asserting that ross complaint did not state claims for relief pursuant to and,and requested that the district court hold this dispute is covered only by because ross is bound by its complaint which refers only to purchase.the defendants argued that ross was precluded from asserting these claims because it had failed to reference or even mention and in its prior pleadings,the complaint.the district court granted the defendants motion,transferring ross claim for breach of to arbitration and ordering ross to release and discharge the mechanic lien in its entirety.the district court did not,however,specifically address ross claims for breach of and,or whether the mechanic lien was valid to the extent that it encompassed these purchase orders.instead,the district court merely noted at the conclusion of its order that t his entry does not apply to other purchase orders that exist between the parties.
we begin our analysis with some jurisdictional housekeeping.after a preliminary review of the short record in this case,we discovered two potential jurisdictional problems and ordered the parties to brief the issues.we noted that while the district court judgment purported to be final,the status of the defendants counterclaim was unclear.we also questioned whether diversity of citizenship existed between the parties.after reviewing the parties respective briefs,we concluded that the district court disposed of the defendants counterclaim,and that diversity of citizenship existed between the parties in accordance with.
at oral argument,however,another jurisdictional wrinkle appeared,once again bringing into question the finality of the district court judgment.specifically,we questioned the parties as to whether the district court statement that t his entry does not apply to other purchase orders that exist between the parties meant that ross and claims remained pending before the court,thus depriving this court of jurisdiction under.the parties contended that the only matter pending before the district court was the defendants motion for attorneys fees.the supreme court has held that a q uestion remaining to be decided after an order ending litigation on the merits does not prevent finality if its resolution will not alter the order or moot or revise decisions embodied in the order,budinich becton dickinson,d,and therefore a claim for attorney fees is not part of the merits of the action to which the fees pertain.id.at.see also barrow falck,cir.the claim for attorneys fees notwithstanding,neither party was,quite understandably,sure how to characterize the district court cryptic reference to other purchase orders.nevertheless,both parties maintained that the district court judgment was final,and that we had jurisdiction to hear the appeal.parties may not,however,confer jurisdiction on this court by merely agreeing that the district court decision is final,and thus appealable under.see,itofca,megatrans logistics,cir.it is our own threshold and independent obligation to make that determination even when both parties agreeably consider an order to be final and appealable.horwitz alloy auto,cir.whether a decision is final for purposes of generally depends on whether the decision by the district court ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.megatrans,at citation omitted.as explained below,we conclude that the district court made a final determination with respect to ross and claims.because the district court order ended the merits phase of the litigation,it is a final appealable judgment for purposes of.id.
we now turn to ross argument that the district court improperly dismissed the claims it brought for breach of contract and to foreclose on the mechanic lien pursuant to and.ross contends that the district court order violates circuit rule because the court dismissed the and claims without explanation ross also challenges the district court decision ordering a complete release and discharge of the mechanic lien.according to ross,it was improper for the district court to order a release and discharge of the entire amount of the lien without first considering the lien validity as to and.furthermore,to the extent the mechanic lien covers,ross argues that the purchase order arbitration clause precluded the district court from ordering the release and discharge of that portion of the lien as well.
as an initial matter,we note the absence of any specific discussion by the district court of and in its order.while the district court order discusses in great detail,it was not until the end of the opinion that the court even acknowledged the existence of other purchase orders,noting t his entry does not apply to other purchase orders that exist between the parties.viewed in isolation,it is unclear what the district court intended to convey through this statement.hence,ross argument that we should remand the case back to the district court,pursuant to circuit rule,to enable the court to explain the meaning of the statement.
while we agree that the district court order violates circuit rule,we do not believe that it is necessary to remand the case for clarification.we have consistently held that lack of an explanation by a district court does not necessarily defeat appellate jurisdiction,at least where the reasons are apparent from the record.see,united states ettrick wood products,cir.after a careful examination of the record,we conclude that the district court accepted the defendants argument that ross failed to sufficiently plead claims for relief pursuant to and in its complaint,and that was the only purchase order at issue in the case we find this to be the case for two reasons.first,only three purchase orders were mentioned by the parties during the course of the litigation,and.as such,when the district court refers to other purchase orders it can only mean and.second,we must presume the district court read the briefs submitted during the summary judgment proceedings,where the parties spent a substantial amount of time arguing over the scope of the lawsuit,whether and were at issue.viewed in this context,the district court statement that t his entry does not apply to other purchase orders that exist between the parties,can only be interpreted as evidencing the court acceptance of the defendants argument that ross complaint did not state claims for relief pursuant to and,and that ross was precluded from clarifying the scope of its complaint during the course of the summary judgment proceedings.
in reviewing the district court disposition of ross and claims,our degree of scrutiny is governed by,which provides that a pleading is sufficient if it contains a short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court jurisdiction depends,unless the court already has jurisdiction and the claim needs no new grounds of jurisdiction to support it,a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,and a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks.a.as this court has consistently noted,the essential function of a complaint under the civil rules is to put the defendant on notice of the plaintiff claim.davis ruby foods,cir.in placing the defendant on notice,however,a plaintiff must comply with rule e,which requires that e ach averment of a pleading shall be simple,concise,and direct.e.nevertheless,n o technical forms of pleading or motions are required.id.finally,we note that rule f demands that a ll pleadings shall be so construed by a district court as to do substantial justice.f.with these principles in mind,we now turn to ross complaint to determine whether it stated claims for relief pursuant to and.
ross complaint contained the following averments a purchase order and subsequent verbal change orders were entered into between international steel and ross for certain construction services performed on the real estate ross has provided labor and materials relative to the real estate under the terms of the purchase order and subsequent verbal change orders ross has demanded payment in amounts currently due and owing under the terms of the purchase order and subsequent verbal change orders but international steel has failed and otherwise refused to make payment of same and t hat judgment be entered against defendant,international steel,in the amount due and owing under the contract and subsequent verbal change orders additionally,each of the invoices attached to the complaint refers to a specific purchase order.although most of the invoices were issued pursuant to,others specifically refer to and.
the mechanic lien affidavit attached to the complaint is further evidence that ross sought relief under three separate purchase orders.the affidavit asserts that the mechanic lien was filed pursuant to verbal contracts and contracts entered into after july.the parties stipulation that was executed on may,demonstrates that the defendants and the district court knew,or should have known,that this litigation involved multiple purchase order agreements.
while there is little question that ross complaint could have been drafted in a more precise manner,rule does not demand notice.we believe that ross complaint adequately placed the defendants on notice that it was suing them pursuant to three separate purchase order agreements.furthermore,if there was any doubt about the scope of the complaint,ross made its intentions abundantly clear during the summary judgment proceedings when it noted that t he work performed consisted of three separate and independent purchase orders purchase order and two additional unsigned purchase orders,and.ross then went on to argue that the arbitration,choice of law,and lien waiver provisions contained in were not applicable to and.
we have held that c omplaints in a system of notice pleading initiate the litigation but recede into the background as the case progresses.bartholet reishauer zurich,cir,and that subsequent pleadings can refine the claims and briefs and memoranda can supply the legal arguments that bridge the gap between facts and judgments.id.see also luckett,cir district judges must heed the message of rule the pleading stage is not the occasion for technicalities.moore city of harriman,cir concluding that e ven assuming the complaint itself failed to provide sufficient notice,moore response to the officers motion to dismiss clarified any remaining ambiguity.therefore,a s long as rule stands unaltered courts must follow the norm that a complaint is sufficient if any state of the world consistent with the complaint could support relief.south austin coalition cmty.council sbc communications,cir.
we,therefore,vacate the district court order,and remand the case so that ross and claims for breach of contract and foreclosure of the mechanic lien may be considered on the merits.on remand,the district court will need to consider the following whether and are separate and independent agreements,or merely part of if and are separate agreements,whether ross contractually agreed that all future purchase orders would include the terms and conditions contained in,the arbitration,and lien waiver clauses and if and contain provisions,whether any of them are void under indiana law we express no opinion on the resolution of these questions.
we also vacate the district court order instructing ross to release and discharge its mechanic lien.we do so for two reasons.first,because the district court erroneously concluded that and were not a part of the litigation,it failed to consider the validity of ross mechanic lien in relation to these purchase orders.this decision amounted to a de facto dismissal of ross claim to foreclose on the mechanic lien as to and.had the mechanic lien been discharged,ross would not be able to a file a separate mechanic lien covering only and.see a mechanic lien must be filed within days after the claimant furnishes labor or materials.second,to the extent the mechanic lien covers,the district court erred in ordering the release and discharge of that portion of the lien after determining that the arbitration clause contained in was valid.as both parties acknowledge,the arbitration clause must be interpreted pursuant to the purchase order agreement choice of law provision.choice of law provision requires that the agreement be construed according to pennsylvania law.because arbitration clause does not provide for the application of the pennsylvania uniform arbitration act,the clause is governed by the state common law.see,borgia prudential ins.under pennsylvania common law arbitration,when a party to an agreement seeks to enjoin the other from proceeding to arbitration,judicial inquiry is limited to the question of whether an agreement to arbitrate was entered into and whether the dispute involved comes within the ambit of the arbitration provision.rocca.ins,see also flightways keystone helicopter.in this case,neither party disputes the validity of the arbitration clause as it relates to.the only question then is whether ross claim to foreclose on its mechanic lien,pursuant to,is covered by the arbitration clause.
