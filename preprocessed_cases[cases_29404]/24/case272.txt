plaintiffs john hancock life insurance and signator investors,collectively,john hancock appeal an order and judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york,mcavoy,granting defendants motion to compel arbitration,denying defendants motion to stay the action pending arbitration and dismissing the complaint and counterclaims in their entirety.defendant joseph wilson and the defendants in ten consolidated actions collectively,the investors appeal the same order and judgment.
the parties present three issues on appeal whether the district court erred in determining whether the investors claims were arbitrable or whether that determination should have been made in the first instance by the arbitrators whether the district court erred in finding that the investors claims fell within the scope of the arbitration provisions of the national association of securities dealers,nasd and whether,after holding that the investors claims were subject to arbitration,the district court erred in dismissing,rather than staying,the action pending arbitration.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court judgment in its entirety.
background 
the investors underlying claims arise out of their purchase of fraudulent promissory notes from frank fucilo fucilo and fucilo associate,michael palladino,palladino.the investors seek to hold john hancock liable for fucilo and palladino wrongful actions.
relationships between the parties 
the relevant facts regarding the relationships between john hancock,fucilo and the investors are not complex and are largely undisputed.
fucilo,an independent insurance agent and investment broker,maintained an office at his home in kingston,new york.john hancock is a member of the nasd.in april,fucilo and john hancock entered into a sales representative agreement,which authorized fucilo to sell certain life insurance and annuities on behalf of john hancock.as a result,fucilo is an associated person under nasd regulations.see nasd,art.i ee defining an associated person of a member,in pertinent part,as a sole proprietor,partner,officer,director,or branch manager of a member or other natural person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions,or a natural person engaged in the investment banking or securities business who is directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by a member.
beginning in or about early,fucilo sold fraudulent promissory notes to the investors.the investors are customers of fucilo.they are not customers of john hancock.there is no evidence that fucilo represented to the investors that he was affiliated with john hancock,or that the investors knew that fucilo was affiliated with john hancock.fucilo had no authority from john hancock to sell the fraudulent investment products,nor did john hancock have any knowledge that fucilo was selling these products.
the only possible connection between john hancock and the investors was through their independent relationships with fucilo.to summarize in the district court words,there is an abundance of unrefuted evidence demonstrating that john hancock was in no way involved with the instant transactions that defendants may not have known fucilo to be a representative of john hancock and that defendants may not have been john hancock customers.
arbitration proceedings 
in late and early,the investors filed four substantially similar statements of claim against john hancock under the auspices of the nasd in florida.fucilo and palladino were not named as parties to any of the arbitrations.the investors invoked the jurisdiction of the nasd arbitration tribunal on the basis of john hancock membership in the nasd,the nasd code of arbitration procedure the nasd code and the form of fucilo and palladino they assert claims against john hancock for violations of federal securities laws,breach of contract,common law fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,negligence and gross negligence,and seek,inter alia,actual damages and rescission.
we need not recount the details of the investors arbitration claims,which range from to pages each,to resolve this appeal.it suffices to say that the investors allege that john hancock breached various duties that it owed to the investors with respect to the actions of john hancock registered representatives.as a result,the investors seek to hold john hancock liable under a number of alternative theories,failure to supervise and respondeat superior,for the losses they incurred as a result of fucilo and palladino wrongful actions.
proceedings before the district court 
on april,john hancock filed eleven separate actions against the investors in each,john hancock sought a declaration that the parties had not entered into a valid arbitration agreement and a preliminary and permanent injunction staying the arbitration proceedings.the district court joined the cases for pretrial purposes on may.
in its complaints,john hancock acknowledges that,as a member of the nasd,it is bound by the nasd code to arbitrate certain disputes arising out of or in connection with its business.john hancock argues,however,that the investors claims do not fall within the scope of the nasd code because the promissory notes fucilo sold to the investors were in no way related to john hancock business and because the investors were not customers of john hancock at the time they purchased the promissory notes.
on may,the investors moved pursuant to the federal arbitration act faa to stay the district court actions and compel arbitration.see and.on august,the investors filed an amended answer and counterclaim,in which they generally denied the allegations in the complaint and asserted as counterclaims the identical causes of action and sought the identical relief as they had in the arbitration proceedings.rather than set forth those claims anew,the investors attached and adopted the statements of claim that they had submitted to the arbitrators.the investors stated that they would pursue their counterclaims only if the district court or the arbitrators determine that the disputes between the parties are not arbitrable.
on september,the district court issued a decision from the bench granting the investors motion to compel arbitration,denying the investors motion to stay the action pending arbitration and dismissing john hancock complaint and the investors counterclaims in their entirety.as a threshold matter,the district court held that the parties had not manifested a clear and unmistakable intent to submit the question of arbitrability to the arbitrators.accordingly,the district court undertook that determination,holding that john hancock had agreed to arbitrate the investors claims by virtue of its status as an nasd member.the district court found that because fucilo was an associated person,john hancock was bound by the nasd code to arbitrate any disputes with the investors arising out of or in connection with fucilo business.in addition,the district court held that b ecause defendants expressly conditioned their counterclaims upon a determination that the disputes are not arbitrable,and,as noted,the court has found the disputes to be arbitrable,the counterclaims are also dismissed internal citation omitted.alternatively,the district court held that the investors had violated rule of the federal rules of civil procedure because their counterclaims did not contain a short and plain statement of their claims and prayer for relief.see.a and c.
the investors moved for reconsideration of the district court denial of its motion to stay the action pending arbitration.on november,the district court issued a written decision and order denying the investors motion.the district court entered final judgment on november.after john hancock and the investors timely filed notices of appeal,we ordered an expedited briefing schedule on december,and heard oral argument on february.
discussion 
we first address whether the district court properly undertook the arbitrability determination.because we hold that it did,we next discuss whether the district court properly compelled arbitration of the investors claims.finally,we briefly address whether the district court erred in dismissing,rather than staying,the action pending arbitration.
arbitrability 
at a glance,our resolution of the first two questions may seem inconsistent.we hold that john hancock membership in the nasd,without more,is not sufficient to show that the parties agreed to submit the question of arbitrability to the arbitrators,but that it is sufficient,without more,to bind john hancock to arbitrate the investors claims.
the supreme court,however,requires that our analysis of these two questions be guided by opposing presumptions.t he law treats silence or ambiguity about the question who primarily should decide arbitrability differently from the way it treats silence or ambiguity about the question whether a particular dispute is arbitrable because it is within the scope of a valid arbitration agreement.first options of chicago kaplan,d.i ssues of arbitrability are presumptively for the court to decide,while issues other than arbitrability are presumptively for the arbitrator.painewebber elahi,cir.we proceed with this important distinction in mind.
who decides the question of arbitrability 
unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise,the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to be decided by the court,not the arbitrator.at t techs.communications workers of,d see abram landau real estate bevona,cir painewebber bybyk,cir w here the arbitration agreement contains an ambiguity as to who determines eligibility,the faa presumption favoring arbitration is reversed so that the court will ordinarily decide the question.
the district court found that b ecause defendants are not parties to the nasd code,they never agreed to allow the arbitrator to make this determination.further,plaintiffs never agreed with defendants to allow the arbitrator to make this determination emphasis added.consequently,the district court held that john hancock and the investors had not shown a clear and unmistakable intent to submit the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrators.we review that determination de novo.see burns new york life ins,cir.
notwithstanding prevailing on their motion to compel arbitration,the investors claim that the district court erred by making that determination.they argue that the nasd code evidences john hancock clear intent to submit arbitrability determinations to the arbitrators.they rely primarily on rule of the nasd code,which provides that t he arbitrators shall be empowered to interpret and determine the applicability of all provisions under this code emphasis added.the investors also rely on rule,which provides that n o party shall,during the arbitration of any matter,prosecute or commence any suit,action,or proceeding against any other party touching upon any of the matters referred to arbitration pursuant to this code.
clear and unmistakable intent 
in bybyk,we interpreted and applied the supreme court requirement that the parties evidence a clear and unmistakable intent to submit the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrators.at quotation marks omitted.we held that the parties evidenced such intent when they agreed that any and all controversies are to be determined by arbitration.id.at holding that the phrase any and all controversies is elastic enough to encompass disputes over whether a claim is within the scope of arbitration.
in bybyk,the parties had entered into an express client agreement that employed the any and all language.we concluded that the client agreement evince d the parties intent to submit issues of arbitrability to the arbitrators.id.at.in response to a painewebber argument,we also noted,in dicta,that even if the nasd code had been incorporated by reference into the client agreement,t he language of the nasd code itself commits all issues,including issues of arbitrability and timeliness,to the arbitrators.id.at.but see merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith cohen,cir we hold that rule is not clear and unmistakable evidence of the parties intent to allow the arbitrator to determine the timeliness of the claim.the investors rely heavily on our dicta in bybyk.
in addition,the investors cite a litany of cases holding that parties may evidence a clear and unmistakable expression of their intent to leave the question of arbitrability to the arbitrators by adopting the provisions of the nasd code,smith barney shearson sacharow,quotation marks omitted.in each of the cases cited by the investors,however,the parties had entered into a separate,express agreement,that incorporated the broad language of the nasd code.see fsc sec.freel,cir finding that the parties expressly agreed to have their dispute governed by the nasd code of arbitration procedure smith barney keeney,iowa i n the present dispute,the customer agreement incorporated by reference the provisions of the nasd code.merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith havird,t he agreement to arbitrate states it is agreed that any controversy between us shall be submitted to arbitration conducted pursuant to the code of arbitration procedure of the nasd.smith barney bardolph,smith barney drafted the customer agreement,including the arbitration clause,which stated that all controversies between the parties shall be determined by arbitration before the national association of securities dealers,in accordance with the rules of such body then obtaining.but see weston sec.aykanian,t he case before us does not involve a negotiated arbitration clause in a commercial agreement.
neither our dicta in bybyk nor the case law cited by the investors answer the question presented by this appeal.rather,they stand for the proposition that parties may overcome the first options presumption by entering into a separate agreement that employs the any and all language described in bybyk,or expressly incorporates the provisions of the nasd code.whether one party membership in the nasd,in the absence of a separate agreement between the parties,can constitute a clear and unmistakable intent to submit the arbitrability of their disputes to the arbitrators remained open until now.today,we hold that it can not.
b.the need for an express agreement 
our analysis is driven by the underlying rationale for the supreme court decision in first options,and guided both by our implicit holding in spear,leeds kellogg cent.life assurance,cir spear,leeds,and by the pronouncements of our sister circuits on a different but related question regarding the issue of arbitrability.
in first options,the supreme court expressed concern that,if the general presumption in favor of arbitration were applied to the question of arbitrability,it might too often force unwilling parties to arbitrate a matter they reasonably would have thought a judge,not an arbitrator,would decide.at.the supreme court sought to alleviate this concern by revers ing the presumption to favor judicial determinations of arbitrability questions.see also dean witter reynolds byrd,d noting that the arbitration act basic purpose is to ensure judicial enforcement of privately made agreements to arbitrate.
the present case exemplifies the supreme court concern.the nasd code binds its members to arbitrate a wide variety of claims with a broad range of claimants.as we hold below,in some cases a third party with no direct relationship to the member can compel that member to arbitrate.see,spear,leeds,at d ecisional law recognizes that the faa requires the enforcement of an arbitration agreement not just in favor of parties to the agreement,but also in favor of third party beneficiaries of the members agreement to abide by the new york stock exchange constitution and rules when they join.kidder,peabody zinsmeyer trusts,cir customer entitled to invoke rule as an intended beneficiary.the investors proposed approach would prohibit members from going to the courts to define,as a threshold matter,the outer limits of their obligations.john hancock claims that under such a rule it would be required to submit to arbitration irrespective of what the product might be,whether the claimant has any relationship with the nasd member,or the connection or lack thereof between the business of the nasd member and the dispute at issue.although john hancock may be required to submit to arbitration in such circumstances,we are bound by the principles articulated in first options to preserve john hancock right to ask a court to make that determination.
we have reached the same result in the past,albeit without explanation.in spear,leeds,a member of the new york stock exchange nyse filed an action seeking to enjoin arbitration proceedings instituted against it by three insurance companies.at.the member and the insurance companies had never directly contracted with one another.id.at.the defendants sought to compel arbitration based on the nyse arbitration provisions,which are substantially similar to the nasd code provisions we held that the member must arbitrate the defendants claims because the defendants were beneficiaries of the nyse membership agreement.see id.at.prior to reaching that conclusion,however,we held that w hether or not a matter is arbitrable is a matter for judicial determination.id.at citing at t,at.
we glean additional indirect support from the statements of a number of our sister circuits.at present,the circuits are split over whether the six year time bar requirement of rule of the nasd code is an arbitrability question.see geneva sec.johnson,cir noting split among circuits see also,bybyk,at holding that the time bar limitation is an arbitrability question.here,it is beyond dispute that the parties pose an arbitrability question.we must determine whether that arbitrability question was properly resolved by the district court,rather than the arbitrators.the language used by our sister circuits in the course of their debate over the time bar provision sheds light on how they might resolve the issue before us today.
for example,after holding that the time bar issues raised arbitrability questions,the seventh circuit held that a bsent an independent agreement between the parties to the contrary,our precedent dictates that the parties did not agree to arbitrate the question of whether a claim was by section.geneva,at emphasis added.likewise,the first circuit has stated that certainly a party who did not sign the agreement did not consider who should decide arbitrability.elahi,at.thus,in considering whether certain issues are questions of arbitrability,these courts have recognized that an express agreement is required to evidence a clear and unmistakable intent to remove arbitrability questions from judicial determination.
at least one other district court in this circuit has anticipated our holding.see kidder,peabody marriner.in marriner,the district court was presented with the identical scenario that we faced in spear,leeds and that we face today,except under the american stock exchange amex constitution 
because the supreme court requires clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties wish to submit the issue of arbitrability to an arbitrator,and because the second circuit has implicitly found that no such evidence exists where the parties have an arbitration agreement by virtue of the firm member ship in an exchange,i find that the court,and not the arbitrator,must determine whether or not these matters are arbitrable.
see also zimring coinmach,wl,at,no clear and unmistakable intent evidenced where party is not a signatory to contractual provision in re herman miller,wl,at,where the party seeking arbitration is not a party to the arbitration agreement,the question of arbitrability is for the court,not the arbitrator,aff,herman miller,worth capital,cir unpublished table decision.
today,we expressly hold that which we implied in spear,leeds one party membership in an exchange,is insufficient,in and of itself,to evidence the parties clear and unmistakable intent to submit the arbitrability question to the arbitrators.of course,we do not intend to limit the ability of an exchange to fashion rules that bind its members to present arbitrability challenges to the arbitrators.see spear,leeds,at recognizing the importance of allowing and facilitating vigorous by an exchange.to do so,however,it must either use clear and unmistakable language or prohibit its members from bringing such challenges in the first place.accordingly,absent an express agreement between the investors and john hancock incorporating the nasd code or providing that any and all disputes be settled in arbitration,the district court properly undertook the determination of whether the investors claims are arbitrable.
scope of nasd rule 
having determined that the district court properly undertook the arbitrability question,we now determine whether the district court answered that question correctly.although it should go without saying,it is important to keep in mind that the validity of the investors underlying legal argument is not pertinent to our discussion.id.at emphasis added.we determine only whether the investors may compel john hancock to defend their claims in the arbitral forum,not whether we deem those claims meritorious.united steelworkers of america am,d.we express no view on the latter.
the district court held that the plain language of rule encompasses disputes between customers and members arising out of the business of associated persons.it found that what is important is that the investors were customers of a person associated with john hancock.because the investors were fucilo customers and fucilo was associated with john hancock,this dispute is arbitrable.we review de novo a district court determination that the parties agreed to arbitrate a given dispute.see burns,at.
arbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.bybyk,at quoting at t,at.thus,o ur initial task is to determine whether john hancock entered into an agreement to arbitrate.spear,leeds,at.here,john hancock concedes that it agreed by virtue of its membership in the nasd to arbitrate all disputes contemplated under rule.
therefore,we proceed directly to the second inquiry whether the present dispute between the investors and john hancock falls within the scope of that agreement.id.at.whether a party is bound by an arbitration clause is governed by federal law.see progressive cas.ins.reaseguradora nacional de venezuela,cir.nevertheless,in determining whether the parties agreed to arbitrate we look to general state law contract principles for guidance.chelsea square textiles bombay dyeing,cir.therefore,like the parties and the district court,we rely primarily on our prior precedent applying new york law.
like any other contract,courts must interpret an arbitration provision to give effect to the parties intent as expressed by the plain language of the provision.see bybyk,at am.express bank uniroyal,dep t rather than rewrite an unambiguous agreement,a court should enforce the plain meaning of that agreement.citation omitted.unlike most contracts,however,any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d see also thomas james,at.
w here the contract contains an arbitration clause,there is a presumption of arbitrability in the sense that a n order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.
at t,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
nasd rule a requires john hancock to arbitrate a ny dispute,claim,or controversy between a customer and a member associated person arising in connection with the business of such member or in connection with the activities of such associated persons upon demand of the customer.in determining that john hancock must arbitrate the investors claims we need look no further than the plain language of rule,keeping in mind that any ambiguity in the language must be construed in favor of arbitration.
rule can be broken down into two substantive parts.first,the investors claims must constitute a dispute between a customer and a member associated person.second,the dispute must aris e in connection with the business of such mem
