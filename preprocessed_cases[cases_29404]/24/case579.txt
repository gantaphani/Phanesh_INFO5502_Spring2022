plaintiff peter scovill filed this action against his former employer claiming he was discriminated against on account of his age in violation of the age discrimination employment act adea,and ohio law.plaintiff also brought a claim for unlawful retaliation under,invasion of privacy,promissory estoppel,and violation of ohio public policy.the defendants removed this case to federal court under and b and filed a motion to dismiss or,in the alternative,stay the action pending arbitration because the plaintiff had previously signed an arbitration agreement.the district court held the arbitration agreement was enforceable,and granted the defendants motion to dismiss,but severed three provisions from the agreement.
on appeal,plaintiff argues that the district court should not have severed the unenforceable provisions,but should have refused to enforce the entire agreement.plaintiff also contends the district court erred in finding that the arbitration agreement was not unconscionable.
on cross appeal,defendants argue that the court violated the supreme court holding in pacificare by deciding,prior to arbitration,the enforceability of a provision and an evidentiary provision.see pacificare health systems,book,d defendants further argue that even if the district court had this authority,the court erred in holding the provision unenforceable.for the reasons which follow,we affirm the severance of two of the provisions,the provision and the remedies provision,and leave the interpretation of the evidentiary provision to the arbitrator.
background 
plaintiff,peter scovill,was employed by the defendants as a news.he first began working for defendants on september.on september,plaintiff signed an employment agreement the agreement.the agreement includes an arbitration provision which provides,in relevant part,employee and employer agree to submit any dispute or controversy arising out of or relating to this agreement exclusively to final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator.
while the agreement provided for only a three year contract,the plaintiff claims he was told by a manager that he could expect both a salary increase and a contract renewal.on or about august,the plaintiff was told his contract would not be renewed on or about january,the defendants demoted mr scovill from his position as a news anchor and on or about february,defendants gave plaintiff a written reprimand.on february,plaintiff complained to his employer about discriminatory conduct.days after this complaint,plaintiff was notified that his employment was being terminated.
plaintiff subsequently filed an action in the court of common pleas for franklin county,ohio alleging that the defendants,his former employer,discriminated against him on account of his age,in violation of the adea.the defendants removed this action to the district court and filed a motion to dismiss or stay pending arbitration.
the district court held three provisions in the agreement were unenforceable a provision,a remedies provision,and an evidentiary provision.scovill,sinclair broadcast group,d.the court then severed these provisions,enforced the remainder of the arbitration agreement,and granted the defendants motion to dismiss.
plaintiff arguments 
a.the plaintiff argues that the district court erred in severing the provisions that the court held unenforceable.this presents a question of law to be reviewed de novo.morrison circuit city stores,cir.
the plaintiff first contends that ohio law,which is applicable in this case,instructs that when an arbitration agreement includes unenforceable provisions,courts should not sever those provisions,but rather,should find the agreement unenforceable in its entirety.yet,we have already decided,and recently reaffirmed in an en banc decision,that severance of unenforceable provisions is permissible.see morrison.
in morrison,this court found a provision and a limitation on remedies provision to be unenforceable.we then addressed the issue of severability,finding that courts should look to the parties intentions as revealed by their agreement.morrison at see also great earth simons,cir this court holding that when an agreement includes a severability provision,the intent of the parties and policy dictate in favor of following the intent of the parties and enforcing the arbitration agreement.we observed that if a severability clause is included in an agreement,then such a clause expresses the parties intentions in favor of severance.morrison,at.
in morrison,while the parties did include a severability clause,it was unclear from that clause whether the parties intended that the unenforceable provisions at issue were to be severed.however,despite this uncertainty,this court still ordered that the provisions be severed,since supreme court precedent instructs that courts resolve any doubts as to arbitrability in favor of arbitration.morrison,at quoting moses cone memorial,at.
in this particular case,like in morrison,the parties included a severability clause however,unlike in morrison,the severability clause in this case leaves little to doubt.the severability clause states 
severability.all rights,powers and remedies provided herein may be exercised only to the extent that the exercise thereof does not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited to the extent necessary so that they will not render this agreement invalid or unenforceable.if any term or provision of this agreement shall be held to be invalid,illegal,or unenforceable,the legality,validity,and enforceability of the other terms and provisions shall in no way be affected thereby and said illegal,unenforceable or invalid term or provisions shall be deemed not to be part of this agreement.
the parties also included another separate severability clause in the arbitration provision which states,in relevant part 
employee and employer agree that if any court of competent jurisdiction declares that any part of this arbitration provision is illegal,invalid or unenforceable,such a declaration will not affect the legality,validity or enforceability of the remaining parts of the arbitration provision and the illegal,invalid or unenforceable part will no longer be part of this arbitration provision.
the party intentions,as understood by the inclusion of two separate severability clauses,clearly indicates a preference for severance.thus,the district court did not err in severing these provisions.
next,the plaintiff argues that even if this court decides that severance is permissible in general,that severance is not permissible in the case at bar because there are multiple unenforceable provisions.the plaintiff cites to cases where courts have found that the cumulative effect of multiple illegal provisions may taint the overall agreement and prevent a court from enforcing that agreement.see alexander anthony internat l,cir the cumulative effect of so much illegality prevents us from enforcing the arbitration agreement.because the sickness has infected the trunk,we must cut down the entire tree.again,however,morrison is instructive.in morrison,this court found two provisions unenforceable and still enforced the agreement,noting that,when the arbitration agreement at issue includes a severability provision,courts should not lightly conclude that a particular provision of an arbitration agreement taints the entire agreement.morrison,at.in this case,we find only two provisions are unenforceable we do not think the plaintiff has presented enough evidence to show that the agreement in this case is one where the unenforceable provisions are so overwhelming as to taint the rest of the agreement.
finally,the plaintiff argues that even if the district court did not err in severing the unenforceable provisions,the district court erred by rewriting the provisions.the plaintiff argues the court affirmatively drafted whole new terms,instead of merely striking out illegal terms.emphasis added the plaintiff misstates the district court actions.the district court did not invent new contract terms.rather,after severing the unenforceable provisions pursuant to the holding in morrison,the district court concluded tha
