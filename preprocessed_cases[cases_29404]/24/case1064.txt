a settlement agreement reached on the eve of trial generated the dispute before us.after determining that the parties attorneys could have alerted the court to the settlement in time to avoid the expense of requiring the attendance of jurors in court the following morning,the district court assessed the expense of the jury impanelment jointly on the parties counsel.the attorneys for one of the parties,sally beauty,appeal the assessment.exercising jurisdiction pursuant to,we affirm.
on monday,january,jury selection for the case underlying this dispute began in district court.selected jurors were instructed to call friday,january,after to verify that trial was proceeding on tuesday,january,as scheduled.also on january,the parties reentered settlement conferencing with a magistrate judge.the magistrate judge informed counsel that the district court would need to know whether a settlement had been reached prior to on friday,january,in order to inform the jury.following a holiday weekend,at a hearing held the morning of tuesday,january,and while the jury waited in the jury assembly room,the parties informed the district court judge that a settlement had been reached the previous evening.
after ordering that judgment be entered in accordance with the submitted consent order,the trial court proceeded to assess the costs of the jury jointly on counsel for both parties.in support of this decision,the trial judge explained that she had asked the magistrate judge to communicate to counsel that if the jury was required to appear unnecessarily,counsel would be responsible for the cost of the jury panel.app.at.counsel responded that the magistrate judge informed them of the deadline so that the district court could advise the jury,but that they had not been informed that any settlement reached after that time would result in the assessment of costs.app.further,they argue,a settlement had not been reached until late into the previous evening.
the court explained 
i like to state for the record that this case has been announced settled to me something like five times in the last week i am not proposing sanctions against counsel only because counsel have never announced to me that this case settled well,the jury is here i going to impose the cost of that on counsel jointly.i do know who been at fault for what happened in this case or the communications that were made to me,and i do particularly want to know,but i hope that it will never happen again.what happened is an abuse of the system this case is dismissed.i will discharge the jury and you will be billed for your share of the jury costs.

we review a district court order imposing jury costs on counsel for an abuse of discretion.in re baker,cir en banc.in considering whether the district court abused its discretion,we will examine the totality of the circumstances,including the specific case under review,the total management problems for courts,and access and cost problems for litigants.id.
in this case,counsel concede that it is within a federal district court inherent power to assess costs against them.see,martinez thrifty drug discount,cir approving a district court shifting of jury costs,pursuant to local regulations,to counsel when counsel failed to notify the court of a settlement.nonetheless,they argue that such power must be exercised with restraint and discretion.roadway express,piper,d.in particular,counsel argue that jury costs may be assessed to counsel only when individual lawyers demonstrate conduct and only after affording counsel due process of law.see chambers nasco,d.counsel argues that the district court abused its discretion in levying costs because they did not act in bad faith and they did not have notice of the possibility of costs,nor were they given specific findings in support of the assessment of costs in violation of their due process rights.
we are not persuaded.as to bad faith,chambers held that the inherent powers of the district court extend to awarding as a sanction attorneys fees to the opposing party when a party has acted in bad faith,vexatiously,wantonly,or for oppressive reasons.at.citations omitted.importantly,chambers addressed the bad faith exception to the general american rule,which prohibits.the court did not,however,purport to limit to only bad faith contexts rather,it required a finding of bad faith,with the attendant due process requirements,when a district court relies upon its inherent power to sanction a party for bad faith conduct.we are persuaded by the record,moreover,that we are not reviewing sanctions,but rather a taxing of jury costs.the district court judge expressly disclaimed any intent to sanction any of the attorneys involved in this matter and refused to attempt to assign individual blame.accordingly,we reject counsel assertion that chambers controls here.
a more closely analogous case is baker,at,in which we concluded that in cases where an attorney conduct,the failure to take a deposition before trial wastes the jury time,a district court is well within its discretion to assign jury costs to the attorney.id.at.in fact,we held that in such cases,courts should assign costs where the fault lies.id.at.we recognized that by requiring those who created the costs to bear them,court efficiency is promoted and tax money saved.id.at.accord,united states mottweiler,cir costs should fall on those whose carelessness creates them,the better to induce people to take care.the public fisc should not be saddled with expenses that counsel could have averted by taking simple precautions.
in the instant case,counsel settled on the eve of trial.while judicial economy is generally promoted by encouraging settlements,see,bancorp mortgage bonner mall partnership,d,much of the benefit of settlements to the judicial system is lost when the court is obligated to require the attendance of jurors at the opening of a trial of an already settled matter.we reject counsel invitation to graft a requirement onto our existing precedent rather,we reiterate that in the instant matter,because attorney conduct resulted in unnecessary jury costs,it was within the district court discretion to assign costs.
turning to the question of due process,counsel first argues that the district court did not make sufficiently specific findings to support an assessment of jury costs.though we conclude that sanctions were not imposed here,we nonetheless look to the due process required to impose sanctions as a benchmark for evaluating whether counsel was given adequate process in the instant case.we have previously endorsed the view that when a court imposes sanctions it must sufficiently express the basis for the sanctions imposed to identify the excess costs reasonably incurred by the party to whom they will be due.braley campbell,cir en banc.following braley,to impose sanctions,a court must make specific findings sufficient to identify the excess costs providing a basis for the sanctions identify the conduct leading to the sanctions in order to provide notice and to allow a meaningful response from the sanctioned attorney and identify for the reviewing court the reason for the sanction.id.
counsel suggests that the trial court findings were deficient because the judge bundled the attorneys into a single group,not inquiring into individual responsibility and thus failing to specify which attorneys were liable to pay the assessed jury costs.baker,however,suggests that when the context for the assignment of costs is clear,and the justification for the imposition of costs is included in the record,as in this case,more specific findings are not required.baker,at while the record is not as explicit as it could be,we believe that the context is clear enough to understand the trial court justification for imposing the sanction.further,because counsel knew t
