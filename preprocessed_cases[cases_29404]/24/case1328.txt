a trustee in bankruptcy filed this action against three former officers of a defunct company,alleging breach of fiduciary duty.two of the officers engaged in discovery the third attempted to settle the action as to himself only.four months before trial,defendants remembered that their employment agreements contained an arbitration provision.they moved to compel arbitration.in opposition,the trustee argued defendants had waived the right to arbitrate by delay in bringing the motions and by engaging in discovery not available under the arbitration provision.
the trial court granted the motions,stating that because defendants had forgotten about the arbitration provision,they had not relinquished a known right.further,the trial court found that the same amount of discovery would have been allowed by an arbitrator.after the ruling,the trustee claimed she lacked the funds to arbitrate the case and declined to initiate arbitration.as a consequence,the trial court entered a judgment of dismissal with prejudice.the trustee appealed.
the trustee contends defendants waived the right to arbitrate notwithstanding that they forgot about the arbitration provision.defendants argue a waiver requires the relinquishment of a known right and point out the motions to compel arbitration were brought shortly after their attorneys first learned about the arbitration provision.
we conclude a waiver of the right to arbitrate does not require the relinquishment of a known right under the federal arbitration act faa or the california arbitration act caa code civ,undesignated section references are to that code.and as provided by the rules adopted in the arbitration provision,the parties were not entitled to any discovery in an arbitration proceeding.accordingly,the two defendants who conducted discovery in the trial court waived arbitration because they acted inconsistently with the right to arbitrate.as to them,the order compelling arbitration and the judgment dismissing the action are reversed.but the remaining defendant,who sought to settle the case,did not act inconsistently with the right to arbitrate.as to him,the order and judgment are affirmed.
background 
the allegations and facts in this case are taken from the complaint and the papers submitted on the motion to compel arbitration.
the original complaint was filed on december.a first amended complaint complaint was filed on may.it alleged as follows.

as noted,on december,zamora,as trustee,filed this action against lehman,weiss,and yukelson,alleging a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.
procedural history 
lehman and weiss took one approach to the in discovery.yukelson took to settle.
lehman and weiss 
on june,lehman and weiss filed a demurrer to the complaint,contending the action was barred by a statute of limitations.zamora argued that a limitations period applied.the trial court,judge william highberger,agreed with zamora and overruled the demurrer on july.the trial court stayed the action for one month to allow lehman and weiss to petition this court for relief.they filed a petition for a writ of mandate.we issued an order to show cause.after briefing and argument,we concluded the trial court had properly applied the statute of limitations and,on november,denied the petition lehman superior court,supra,th.
meanwhile,lehman and weiss had served zamora with a set of form interrogatories and a set of special interrogatories.the two sets of interrogatories sought the identification of every person,document,and fact supporting the allegations in the complaint.lehman and weiss also served zamora with a document demand.she produced over documents.
on january,lehman and weiss filed a joint answer,generally denying the allegations of the complaint and setting forth affirmative defenses.see,subd.d.the answer did not mention arbitration.on the same day,lehman and weiss served a on yukelson,alleging a claim for indemnity.
on june,lehman and weiss served zamora with a notice of deposition of person most knowledgeable of the estate of,the notice,consisting of pages,listed subjects of inquiry and demanded that the deponent produce all documents on those subjects.the list tracked the allegations of the complaint.in response to the notice,zamora moved for a protective order,asserting that because was an inactive company,defendants should use special interrogatories in lieu of a deposition.lehman and weiss brought a motion to compel the deposition.the trial court granted the motion to compel,denied the motion for a protective order,and imposed sanctions on zamora in the amount of.the deposition was set to commence on or before october.yukelson attorney,who was attempting to settle the case,requested that the other parties,including zamora,excuse him from attending the deposition and allow him to question the witness later if a settlement was not reached.they declined the request.
on october,adrian stern,a paid consultant and certified public accountant,appeared as the witness at the deposition.the attorneys for lehman and weiss questioned stern but did not finish.the deposition resumed on october.the session began with questions by yukelson attorney,who finished in two hours.counsel for lehman and weiss followed with the rest of their questions,completing the deposition.
at the beginning of the case,yukelson demurred to the complaint for lack of specificity and failure to allege the timeliness of the claim.the demurrer was sustained with leave to amend.after obtaining the ruling and before filing another pleading,yukelson commenced settlement discussions with zamora.they reached a settlement,subject to approval by the bankruptcy court,agreeing that the action would be dismissed against yukelson without his payment of any money in exchange for his granting a interview with zamora attorney.the settlement was reduced to writing,signed by yukelson and zamora attorney,and submitted to the bankruptcy court.on june,while the proposed settlement agreement was pending before that court,zamora filed a notice of settlement in the trial court.
over a year later,on september,the bankruptcy court rejected the settlement agreement but indicated it was still amenable to settlement if yukelson would provide more than five hours of assistance to zamora.yukelson entered into renewed settlement negotiations with zamora attorney.on november,zamora indicated she was no longer interested in settlement.yukelson had not yet filed an answer to the complaint,nor had he served any discovery requests.trial had been set for april.
motions to compel arbitration 
on november,after an inquiry by his attorney,yukelson located a copy of his employment agreement with.it contained an arbitration provision requiring that all disputes arising out of the agreement be submitted to a panel of three arbitrators and resolved pursuant to the labor arbitration rules of the american arbitration association aaa.italics added.the provision also stated that any claim for arbitration must be presented in writing by the claiming party to the other party within one year of the date the claiming party knew of or should have known of the facts giving rise to the claim or be forever barred.the agreement had a clause,as follows t he validity,interpretation,and legal effect of this agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of california.
on november,yukelson filed a motion to compel arbitration and stay the action pending the outcome of arbitration.in a supporting declaration,he stated because more than five years had passed between the time i left and the time i received notice of this lawsuit,i did not remember any of the terms of my employment agreement.similarly,yukelson attorney did not know that yukelson had a written employment agreement until november.in the motion,yukelson argued,while still in business,had been engaged in interstate commerce,and thus the faa applied.yukelson asserted that,under the faa,he had not waived the right to arbitrate because he had no knowledge of his contractual right to compel arbitration at the time the litigation began and only discovered that right three days ago.
on december,lehman and weiss jointly filed a motion to compel arbitration based on the arbitration provision in their respective employment agreements.that provision was identical to the one in yukelson agreement.lehman and weiss stated in declarations that they had forgotten about the arbitration provision in their employment agreement s until the week before the motion was filed.they,too,argued the faa applied and,under the faa,they had not waived the right to arbitrate because they did not know about the arbitration provision during the litigation.
zamora filed opposition papers contending the caa,not the faa,governed the case and,under the caa,defendants had waived the right to arbitrate by delay in bringing their motions and by engaging in discovery not available under the arbitration provision.zamora asserted that the discovery conducted by defendants had prejudiced her ability to pursue the case in arbitration.
the motions to compel were heard on february.at the hearing,the trial court stated had been engaged in interstate commerce,and the faa was therefore applicable.the trial court found it significant that defendants had forgotten about the arbitration provision until shortly before the motions were filed.to the court,this evidence satisfactorily explained the delay and meant defendants did not engage in bad faith conduct.the trial court also stated that,ordinarily,waiver involves the loss of a known right,and,here,defendants did not know about the arbitration provision during the litigation.further,according to the court,the discovery that been allowed in this case so far is in no way different from the discovery which would likely be allowed by a reasonable arbitrator given the issues in the case.the trial court concluded that the delay in bringing the motions and the discovery conducted by defendants did not prejudice zamora ability to present the case in arbitration.by order dated march,the trial court granted defendants motions to compel arbitration and stay the action.
zamora filed a petition for a writ of mandate with this court,seeking to overturn the trial court order.on june,we summarily denied the petition.
in a november,status conference report,zamora stated that the remaining funds did not permit her to commence a costly arbitration before the aaa especially one which requires three arbitrators and the entire cost of which must be borne by the bankruptcy estate.the trial court,judge mary strobel presiding,issued an order to show cause re dismissal for failure to initiate arbitration.a hearing was scheduled for february.
at the hearing,zamora counsel acknowledged that zamora had not initiated arbitration and did not intend to do so.on march,the trial court entered judgment dismissing the case with prejudice.zamora appealed.
discussion 
zamora contends the caa governs the issue of waiver and,under the caa,defendants waived the right to arbitrate by delay in bringing the motions to compel arbitration and by engaging in discovery not available under the arbitration provision.although zamora does not dispute that was engaged in interstate commerce,she argues the caa applies by virtue of the clause,which required that the validity,interpretation,and legal effect of the employment agreements be determined under california law.
defendants counter that the faa determines the applicable waiver analysis because was engaged in interstate commerce and that,under the faa,they did not relinquish a known right to arbitrate.for his part,yukelson maintains that,by participating in settlement negotiations and limiting his discovery to the deposition,he did not engage in conduct inconsistent with the right to arbitrate.
we conclude that the test for determining waiver of the right to arbitrate is the same under the faa and the caa.thus,we do not decide whether the agreements clause requires the application of the caa instead of the faa.further,the waiver test consists of several factors and does not include whether a defendant voluntarily or intentionally relinquished a known right to arbitrate.we therefore determine that lehman and weiss waived the right to arbitrate by delay in bringing their motion to compel arbitration and by engaging in discovery not available under the arbitration provision,resulting in prejudice to zamora.but yukelson ongoing efforts to settle the case and his de minimis participation in discovery were not inconsistent with the right to arbitrate and did not prejudice zamora.
standard of review 
while in general arbitration is a highly favored means of settling disputes,it is beyond dispute a trial court may deny a petition to compel arbitration if it finds the moving party has waived that right 
t he question of waiver is one of fact,and an appellate court function is to review a trial court findings regarding waiver to determine whether these are supported by substantial evidence.the appellate court may not reverse the trial court finding of waiver unless the record as a matter of law compels finding nonwaiver berman health net th,citations omitted.
waiver of right to arbitrate 
in platt pacific,andelson cal th,the supreme court discussed the concept of waiver in the arbitration context t he courts of this state have held that the failure to make a timely demand for arbitration results in a waiver of the right to compel arbitration it is true that some decisions have defined the term waiver as the voluntary relinquishment of a known right h owever,none of the cases concerning the failure to timely demand arbitration have used the word waiver to mean voluntary relinquishment of a known right.
federal as well as state courts have used the term waiver to refer to a number of different concepts generally,waiver denotes the voluntary relinquishment of a known right.but it can also mean the loss of an opportunity or a right as a result of a party failure to perform an act it is required to perform,regardless of the party intent to abandon or relinquish the right the term waiver has also been used as a shorthand statement for the conclusion that a contractual right to arbitration has been lost 
we have examined the california decisions stating that a party may waive its right to arbitrate by failing to timely demand arbitration.we conclude that those decisions use the word waiver in the sense of the loss or forfeiture of a right resulting from failure to perform a required act.the leading case for the rule that arbitration must be demanded within the time agreed upon by the parties is jordan friedman d.significantly,a review of jordan reveals that the court there did not use the term waiver in the sense of voluntary relinquishment of a known right.
in jordan,a subcontractor sued a general contractor to foreclose a mechanic lien.relying on an arbitration provision in the subcontract,the general contractor filed a motion to stay the proceedings pending arbitration.the parties subcontract required that a written demand for arbitration be filed with the architect no later than the time of final payment.the general contractor,however,made his demand for arbitration to the subcontractor rather than to the architect,and did so after the time for final payment had expired.the court of appeal held that,in failing to make a written arbitration demand to the architect as required by the contract,and in not making the demand until three months after the contractually specified date,the general contractor was foreclosed from compelling arbitration.the court went on to state where a contract provides that a demand for arbitration must be filed within a stated time and the party desiring arbitration permits the agreed period to pass without making demand,he waives his right to arbitration.it can not be said of the general contractor in jordan that it intended to voluntarily relinquish its right to arbitration,for it had demanded arbitration both orally and in writing.thus,the jordan court use of the term waiver in its holding was simply a shorthand way of stating that,by failing to perform certain acts specified in the parties contract,the general contractor had lost the right to arbitration.platt pacific,andelson,supra,cal th at,citations omitted.
in sobremonte superior court th sobremonte,the court of appeal recognized that s ince arbitration is a strongly favored means of resolving disputes,courts must closely scrutinize any claims of waiver.a party claiming that the right to arbitrate has been waived has a heavy burden of proof.id.at,citations omitted.to resolve the waiver claim before it,the sobremonte court applied a multifactor test used by the tenth circuit under the faa in determining waiver,a court can consider whether the party actions are inconsistent with the right to arbitrate whether the litigation machinery has been substantially invoked and the parties were well into preparation of a lawsuit before the party notified the opposing party of an intent to arbitrate whether a party either requested arbitration enforcement close to the trial date or delayed for a long period before seeking a stay whether a defendant seeking arbitration filed a counterclaim without asking for a stay of the proceedings whether important intervening steps,taking advantage of judicial discovery procedures not available in arbitration had taken place and whether the delay affected,misled,or prejudiced the opposing party sobremonte,supra,th at,bracketed material in original,quoting peterson,cir.
in agnes medical center pacificare of california cal th,the supreme court addressed a waiver issue where the parties agreement involved interstate commerce,such that the agreement fell within the provisions of the faa.agnes,at.the court adopted the tenth circuit multifactor test quoted in sobremonte for determining waiver issues under the faa and the caa.see agnes,supra,cal th at peterson,supra,at wagner construction.pacific mechanical cal th,fn.as the court explained in agnes,t he faa provides a written provision in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction,or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.a district court,upon being satisfied that the issue in controversy is arbitrable,shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement,providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.
in california,section similarly provides a written agreement to submit to arbitration a controversy thereafter arising is valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.section provides in relevant part on petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy,the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists,unless it determines that a the right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner or b grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement agnes,supra,cal th at.
as mentioned,the faa permits a party to obtain a stay of judicial proceedings pending arbitration unless such party is in default of that right.although this principle of default is akin to waiver,the circumstances giving rise to a statutory default are limited and,in light of the federal policy favoring arbitration,are not to be lightly inferred.accordingly,a party who resists arbitration on the ground of waiver bears a heavy burden,and any doubts regarding a waiver allegation should be resolved in favor of arbitration 
our state waiver rules are in accord.state law,like the faa,reflects a strong policy favoring arbitration agreements and requires close judicial scrutiny of waiver claims although a court may deny a petition to compel arbitration on the ground of waiver,subd.a,waivers are not to be lightly inferred and the party seeking to establish a waiver bears a heavy burden of proof 
both state and federal law emphasize that no single test delineates the nature of the conduct that will constitute a waiver of arbitration 
in sobremonte,supra,th,the court of appeal referred to a test consisting of several factors we agree these factors are relevant and properly considered in assessing waiver claims.agnes,supra,cal th at,citations omitted see knight et,cal.practice guide alternative dispute resolution the rutter group,to quoting factors.
it is not surprising that agnes adopted the same waiver test for both the faa and caa.in most important respects,the california statutory scheme on enforcement of private arbitration agreements is similar to the faa the similarity is not unusual,as the two share origins in the earlier statutes of new york and new jersey.cable connection,directv,cal th.california courts often look to federal law when deciding arbitration issues under state law.dream theater,dream theater th.
in agnes,the high court also reiterated t he term waiver has a number of meanings in statute and case law while waiver generally denotes the voluntary relinquishment of a known right,it can also refer to the loss of a right as a result of a party failure to perform an act it is required to perform,regardless of the party intent to relinquish the right in the arbitration context,t he term waiver has also been used as a shorthand statement for the conclusion that a contractual right to arbitration has been lost.agnes,supra,cal th at,fn,quoting platt pacific,andelson,supra,cal th at.
and the tenth source of the agnes the same conclusion about the meaning of waiver,stating the multifactor test was not intended to suggest a mechanical process in which each factor is assessed and the side with the greater number of favorable factors prevails.nor were we even suggesting that the list of factors is exclusive.rather,these factors reflect certain principles that should guide courts in determining whether it is appropriate to deem that a party has waived its right to demand arbitration 
a party should not be permitted to demand arbitration when it has previously waived its right to arbitrate in the narrow sense of waiver typically used in the context,where a waiver is an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.a party conduct may evince such an intentional relinquishment 
but the case law hardly limit s the concept of waiver to intentional relinquishment of a known right.indeed,in one case involving waiver of the right to arbitrate,we affirmed the determination of waiver even though the district court had explicitly stated that it could not tell whether the conduct at issue was intentional or negligent.hill ricoh americas cir,citations omitted,discussing reid burton const.carpenters dist.council,cir.
agnes also discussed the factor of prejudice more than two decades ago,we observed that u nder federal law,it is clear that the mere filing of a lawsuit does not waive contractual arbitration rights.the presence or absence of prejudice from the litigation of the dispute is the determinative issue under federal law.our review of more recent federal authorities discloses that this rule remains largely intact.
in california,whether or not litigation results in prejudice also is critical in waiver determinations that is,while w aiver does not occur by mere participation in litigation if there has been no judicial litigation of the merits of arbitrable issues,waiver could occur prior to a judgment on the merits if prejudice could be demonstrated.
because merely participating in litigation,by itself,does not result in a waiver,courts will not find prejudice where the party opposing arbitration shows only that it incurred court costs and legal expenses 
rather,courts assess prejudice with the recognition that california arbitration statutes reflect a strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution and are intended to encourage persons who wish to avoid delays incident to a civil action to obtain an adjustment of their differences by a tribunal of their own choosing.prejudice typically is found only where the petitioning party conduct has substantially undermined this important public policy or substantially impaired the other side ability to take advantage of the benefits and efficiencies of arbitration.
for example,courts have found prejudice where the petitioning party used the judicial discovery processes to gain information about the other side case that could not have been gained in arbitration or where a party unduly delayed and waited until the eve of trial to seek arbitration agnes,supra,cal th at,citations fn.omitted.t he vice is in the use of discovery to gain information which defendants could not have gained in arbitration,and the test does not require any further specific showing of how that information disadvantaged the plaintiffs.berman health net,supra,th at.
lehman and weiss 
we conclude lehman and weiss waived the right to arbitrate by delay in bringing their motion to compel arbitration and by engaging in discovery not available under the arbitration provision.
as a preliminary matter,the demurrer,which was based on the statute of limitations,did not affect lehman and weiss right to arbitrate because that issue could have been properly raised in arbitration.see wagner construction pacific mechanical,supra,cal th at.in other words,a statute of limitations defense may be heard in a civil action or an arbitration proceeding.thus,lehman and weiss timeliness argument,presented in the trial court,was not inconsistent with arbitration.see groom health net th,where complaint was vague,defendant did not waive arbitration by bringing demurrers that forced plaintiff to clarify legal theories and identify parties sued.
but with respect to when they moved to compel arbitration,lehman and weiss did not act consistently with the right to arbitrate.such a motion should be brought within a reasonable time.see,sobremonte,supra,th at arbitration waived where motion to compel brought months after service of complaint guess,superior court th,arbitration waived where motion to compel brought four months after commencement of suit davis continental airlines,th,arbitration waived where motion brought months after commencement of suit.lehman and weiss had the responsibility to timely seek relief either to compel arbitration or dispose of the lawsuit,before the parties and the court wasted valuable resources on ordinary litigation.sobremonte,at.they filed their motion to compel four months before the trial date and one year after we rejected their statute of limitations defense lehman superior court,supra,th.that delay was not reasonable.
further,lehman and weiss failure to remember that their employment agreements contained an arbitration provision does not preclude a finding of waiver.under agnes,courts do not take a defendant forgetfulness into account our supreme court held that arbitration may be waived regardless of the party intent to relinquish the right to arbitrate.agnes,supra,cal th at,fn.accord,platt pacific,andelson,supra,cal th at waiver of arbitration does not turn on whether defendant voluntarily relinquished known right hill ricoh americas,supra,at multifactor test governing waiver of right to arbitrate does not include whether defendant intentionally relinquished known right.in short,lehman and weiss delayed for a long period before seeking a stay of the action to pursue arbitration.agnes,at.
lehman and weiss also acted contrary to agnes by request ing arbitration enforcement close to the trial date.agnes,supra,cal th at.as noted,they filed their motion to compel arbitration four months before that date.
in addition,lehman and weiss took advantage of judicial discovery procedures not available in arbitration.agnes,supra,cal th at.they served zamora with extensive set of form interrogatories,a set of special interrogatories,and a document demand that resulted in the production of over they deposed the person with the most knowledge about the allegations of the complaint.under aaa labor arbitration rules,which the parties adopted in the arbitration provision,neither side was entitled to discovery in an arbitration proceeding.those rules accord only a right to subpoena witnesses and documents for the hearing.see aaa,labor arbitration rules,rule,http.as of june.in contrast,aaa rules governing an employment arbitration expressly provide for discovery.see aaa,employment arbitration rules and mediation procedures,rule,as of june.defendants contend their employment agreements mistakenly incorporated aaa labor arbitration rules instead of aaa employment arbitration rules.but no evidence was offered to support that contention.and although the labor rules apply to an arbitration conducted under a collective bargaining agreement,the aaa would either arbitrate this case under the labor rules or decline to handle the case altogether.the aaa could not arbitrate a case by unilaterally imposing rules different from those adopted by the parties.see alan superior court th,where parties agreement stated that arbitration would be c
