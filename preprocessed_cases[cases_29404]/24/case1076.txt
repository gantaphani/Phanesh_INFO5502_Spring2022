certification from the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit to the florida supreme court,pursuant to.const.art.v,b.to the florida supreme court and its honorable justices 
plaintiff james pendergast appeals the district court order granting the motion to compel arbitration filed by sprint solutions,and sprint spectrum,collectively,sprint.plaintiff is a former sprint wireless customer and sued sprint,on behalf of himself and a class,for allegedly charging improper roaming fees for calls placed within sprint coverage areas.the district court found the arbitration clause and class action waiver contained in the terms and conditions of plaintiff contract with sprint were valid and enforceable and barred this class action.
on appeal,plaintiff does not contest the arbitration clause itself but claims the class action waiver in sprint terms and conditions is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable under florida law.and because plaintiff contract provides the arbitration and class action waiver clauses are not severable,plaintiff claims the arbitration clause fails because the class action waiver is unenforceable.
after review and oral argument,we determine conflicting decisions in the florida intermediate appellate courts require that we certify certain questions to the florida supreme court.before addressing those legal issues,we provide a full factual background of this dispute.
factual background 
august service contract and samsung phone 
on august,plaintiff purchased a samsung wireless telephone from sprint and agreed to a service contract for sprint wireless telephone service on august,sprint shipped plaintiff initial samsung telephone to his address in miami,florida.plaintiff began using sprint wireless services on august.plaintiff initial bill,dated september,reflects that he held one account with sprint,numbered,and used wireless services through one phone number.

emphasis and capitalization in original the may terms and conditions contained a clause requiring arbitration of most disputes 
arbitration of disputes.any claim,controversy or dispute,whether sounding in contract,statute,or tort,including fraud,misrepresentation,or any other legal theory,related directly or indirectly to the services shall be resolved by arbitration as prescribed in this section.the federal arbitration act,not state law,governs the question of whether a claim is subject to arbitration.
the may,terms and conditions did not include a class action waiver as part of the arbitration clause 
plaintiff affidavit states that once i had contracted with sprint in,i could not have left sprint for another carrier without rendering my cell phone s useless,as they only worked on sprint network.however,sprint presented evidence that plaintiff was permitted to sell his mobile phone s to others,through websites such as,without interference from sprint.and third parties who acquire used sprint mobile phones can activate those phones and use them on the sprint network.
february phone 
on february,plaintiff acquired and activated a new samsung model mobile phone in person at a sprint store in coral gables,florida.plaintiff retained his original account number and original mobile phone number when he acquired and activated this new mobile phone.
the telephone box for the samsung model wireless phone contained a copy of the phone user guide,which contained a copy of sprint terms and conditions.the record does not reflect which version of sprint terms and conditions were printed in the user guide for plaintiff new samsung model phone.the packaging material on the outside of the box for the samsung model phone also stated that the box contained a copy of sprint terms and conditions.
july,service agreement and samsung phone 
on july,plaintiff signed a pcs advantage agreement with sprint.at the time he entered into the advantage agreement,plaintiff also acquired a new samsung mobile phone at a sprint store in coral cables,florida and activated a second phone line with a second phone number.
sprint subsidizes the purchase price of the majority of wireless telephones it sells to its subscribers.however,the record does not reflect how much of the purchase price of plaintiff new samsung mobile phone was subsidized by sprint,although plaintiff admits he received a discount on the purchase price of the phone.similarly,there is no evidence in the record indicating what,if anything,plaintiff paid for any of the phones in this case.
the telephone box for the new samsung wireless phone plaintiff acquired on july,contained a copy of the user guide for that phone,which contained a copy of sprint terms and conditions effective june,the box exterior also stated it contained a copy of sprint terms and conditions.

the june,terms and conditions contained an arbitration clause,similar to the one in sprint may terms and conditions,requiring arbitration of all disputes except for those within the jurisdiction of a small claims court.the june terms and conditions included a new class action waiver,printed in capital letters 
mandatory arbitration of disputes instead of suing in court,you and sprint agree to arbitrate any and all claims,controversies or disputes against each other arising out of or relating to this agreement the federal arbitration act applies to this agreement and its provisions,not state law,govern all questions of whether a claim is subject to arbitration.this provision does not prevent either you or sprint from bringing appropriate claims in small claims court,before the federal communications commission or a state public utilities commission.

plaintiff began using this second phone number on july.at the time plaintiff executed the agreement,at least two of sprint mobile and mobile phone service in his area without class action waivers.
when he acquired his second mobile phone line on july,plaintiff signed a advantage agreement.the advantage agreement explicitly notified plaintiff that an arbitration clause was in sprint terms and conditions.by signing the advantage agreement,plaintiff attested he had read and agreed to all terms of sprint most recent terms and conditions which contained the class action waiver.the advantage agreement as executed by plaintiff provides

on july,plaintiff changed the phone number on his second phone line to.plaintiff continued to use this second phone line with the new number by placing calls on it throughout july.so from july,plaintiff second phone number was,and from july,forward it was.
plaintiff first invoice,dated august,following the acquisition of his second phone line reflects plaintiff still carried only one account with sprint on which three different phone numbers were billed during july.plaintiff august,invoice also stated that plaintiff could view the most current version of sprint terms and conditions online or by contacting sprint in other words,plaintiff added the second phone line with number and then changed it to to his account for his first phone line.plaintiff august,invoice reflected that he continued to carry one account,stating because you added a new phone to your account,you will see charges for more than one month of service.
july phone 
on july,plaintiff activated a lg model mobile phone for use on his first phone line.the telephone box for the lg phone contained a copy of sprint terms and conditions as an independent document,as opposed to contained in the phone user guide 
plaintiff continued to use his one account with two phone lines until july.as of july,plaintiff second phone line then with the number became inactive.thus,as of july,plaintiff had what he started with in one phone line with the same phone number and the same account number.
in summary,the record shows that during,plaintiff moved this first phone line between three different phones a samsung from august,to february,a samsung from february,to july,and a lg from july,to january.plaintiff also had a second phone line with a samsung phone from july to july.each time he acquired a new phone,sprint provided plaintiff with a copy of its terms and conditions in effect at that time,and it appears plaintiff monthly invoices consistently informed plaintiff that sprint current terms and conditions always were available on sprint website.and he was given a copy of the terms and conditions containing the class action waiver in both and when he acquired new phones.
on december,sprint issued an invoice to plaintiff for his one account which gave the following advance notice that sprint terms and conditions for its service plans would change as of january,
important notice.
the terms conditions for sprint pcs and nextel services have been updated.these new terms are effective january,and are available at or upon request.please carefully review these terms as they apply to any future use of our services.
the revised terms and conditions effective as of january,were available on sprint website in december after receiving notice of the updates to sprint terms and conditions,plaintiff remained a sprint customer until january.
the january terms and conditions defined sprint service as our offers,rate plans,options,wireless services or devices on your account with us.the terms and conditions also provided these ts cs apply to our standard wireless services and any other service we offer you that references these ts cs.
similar to its terms and conditions since,sprint january terms and conditions provided that the customer accepts the terms by use of or payment for sprint services after the effective date 
when you accept the agreement 
you must have the legal capacity to accept the agreement.you accept the agreement when you do any of the following a sign a contract with us on paper or electronically b accept agreement through an oral or electronic statement c attempt to or in any way use the services d pay for the services or e open any package or start any program that says you are accepting the agreement when doing so.if you do want to accept the agreement,do do any of these things.
also similar to sprint previous terms and conditions,the terms and conditions effective january,gave sprint the unilateral right to amend the agreement and permitted plaintiff to terminate the contract within days of such an amendment 
our right to change the agreement your related rights 
we may change any part of the agreement at any time,including,but not limited to,rates,charges,how we calculate charges,or your terms of service.we will provide you notice of material changes,and may provide you notice of changes,in a manner consistent with this agreement see providing notice under this agreement paragraph.except as provided below,if a change we make to the agreement is material and has a material adverse effect on you,you may terminate each line of service materially affected without incurring an early termination fee only if you a call us within days after the effective date of the change and b specifically advise us that you wish to cancel services because of a material change to the agreement that we have made.if you do not cancel service within days of the change,an early termination fee will apply if you terminate services before the end of any applicable term commitment.

you agree our liability is consequential damages.
to the extent allowed by law,our liability for monetary damages for any claims you may have against is limited to no more than the proportionate amount of the service charges attributable to the affected period.under no circumstances are we liable for any incidental,consequential,punitive or special damages of any nature whatsoever arising out of or related to providing or failing to provide services in connection with a device,including,but not limited to,lost profits,loss of business,or cost of replacement products and services.
in the january terms and conditions,sprint expanded its arbitration provisions,now under the heading of dispute resolution.as the prior arbitration provisions had,the january arbitration provision allowed plaintiff to pursue qualifying claims in small claims court.all other disputes had to be brought before an arbitrator.however,the january terms and conditions expressly provided that,just as a court would,the arbitrator must honor the terms and limitations in the agreement and can award the same damages and relief,including any attorney fees,authorized by law.similar to the terms and conditions since june,the january terms and conditions continued to include a class action waiver,but now the class action waiver appeared as part of the arbitration clause,and a second time as a waiver of all potential class action claims.the arbitration clause and first notice of class action waiver,all under the heading dispute resolution,are offset from the rest of the terms and conditions in a box and provide the arbitration clause and class action waiver are not severable from each other

plaintiff remained a sprint customer from august,until january,when he had his original phone number ported to another service provider,without notification to sprint 
district court proceedings 
on february,plaintiff filed this action,individually and on behalf of a similarly situated class.plaintiff alleges sprint improperly charged customers roaming fees while they were physically in sprint coverage area.plaintiff alleges sprint network limitations caused it to route calls placed within its geographic coverage area to cellular towers owned by other carriers,causing improper charging of roaming fees.plaintiff asserts claims under the florida deceptive and unfair trade practices act fdutpa and florida law,including breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation.he seeks monetary damages and declaratory and injunctive relief.plaintiff estimates his actual individual damages to be approximately.
plaintiff bases his claims entirely on alleged improper roaming charges.in his first affidavit,plaintiff avers that during the summer of,i learned for the first time that sprint may have been wrongfully charging me for roaming fees for calls made or received in a pcs coverage area,so i examined my past invoices and saw several charges that i brought to my attorney attention.the record reflects plaintiff was charged for a total of roaming minutes between july,and june.each roaming minute was incurred on plaintiff original phone number.
plaintiff second affidavit avers that he can not afford a lawyer at an hourly rate to assert his claims against sprint and that,absent the benefit of a class action,he would not pursue his claims at all because the risk of and cost of arbitration outweigh the value of any potential award.
sprint filed a motion to compel arbitration,contending the arbitration and waiver clauses in its january,terms and conditions barred this suit.in response,plaintiff did not argue the arbitration clause itself is unconscionable.plaintiff argument is that the class action waiver is unconscionable and thus unenforceable.sprint january terms and conditions,as they have since january,explicitly require that the arbitration and class action waiver provisions not be severed from each other.the district court recognized that the enforceability of the class action waiver was a threshold issue not severable from the arbitration clause itself.all parties agreed,and the district court found,that the enforceability of the class action waiver in plaintiff contract with sprint is governed by florida law.
on january,following a hearing and supplemental briefing,the district court agreed with sprint,compelled arbitration,and dismissed the case.the district court reasoned that under florida law,plaintiff must show both procedural and substantive unconscionability to establish that a class action waiver is unenforceable.the district court found the class action waiver was not procedurally unconscionable and thus must be enforced.the district court expressly declined to address substantive unconscionability.
plaintiff filed this timely appeal 
ii.discussion 
florida law controls 
federal courts sitting in diversity apply the substantive law of the state in which the case arose.see erie tompkins.in this diversity case,we review the enforceability of the class action waiver in sprint terms and conditions in accordance with florida law.see associated mech.contractors,martin eby const,cir.
in instances where a state highest court has not ruled on a point of state law,federal courts are bound by decisions of a state intermediate appellate courts unless there is persuasive evidence that the highest state court would rule otherwise.bravo united states,cir quoting king order of united commercial travelers of.our precedent indicates that all other data may be considered to the extent they indicate how the florida supreme court might rule on an issue.see,at quoting putman erie city,cir the court is forced,therefore,to look to all available data for example,to such sources as the restatements of law,treatises and law review commentary,and the majority rule,keeping in mind that it must choose the rule which it believes the state court,from all that is known about its methods of reaching decisions,is likely in the future to adopt.
where there is any doubt as to the application of state law,a federal court should certify the question to the state supreme court to avoid making unnecessary erie guesses and to offer the state court the opportunity to interpret or change existing law.csx,city of garden city,cir quoting mosher speedstar div.of amca int l,cir.
florida standards for unconscionability 
the first issue on appeal is whether florida law requires a plaintiff to show both procedural and substantive unconscionability to establish that a class action waiver is unenforceable 
plaintiff argues that under florida contract law the test for unconscionability is and that at least some formulations of it do not require a showing of both procedural and substantive unconscionability.alternatively,plaintiff argues that even if both are required,florida courts use a balancing test or sliding scale,such that if a high amount of procedural unconscionability exists,plaintiff need show only a minimal amount of substantive unconscionability.plaintiff asserts the district court erred in assessing procedural and substantive unconscionability independently and stopping its analysis entirely after finding no procedural unconscionability.
our review of florida law confirms the district court interpretation of florida law as requiring a showing of both procedural and substantive unconscionability.precedent from the florida third district court of appeal consistently requires a showing of both procedural and substantive unconscionability.hialeah,llc basulto,so d,wl,at,our court has said that,to invalidate a contract for unconscionability under florida law,a court must find that the contract is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.quoting murphy courtesy ford,so d,see also golden mobil oil,cir stating in a commercial lease setting that florida courts require a plaintiff to show both procedural and substantive unconscionability.decisions from other florida appellate districts also consistently require a showing of both procedural and substantive unconscionability,bland health care retirement of,so d,fonte wireless,so d,powertel,bexley,so d.
nonetheless,there is some tension in florida law regarding the analytical framework courts should use in evaluating both procedural and substantive unconscionability.must courts evaluate both prongs simultaneously in a balancing exercise,or may courts stop the analysis after finding either procedural or substantive unconscionability to be independently lacking 
some florida courts appear to reject the unconscionability requirement as a rule of law or use a balancing or sliding scale approach.steinhardt rudolph,so d,stating that although most courts take a balancing approach requiring a certain quantum of procedural plus a certain quantum of substantive unconscionability,the analysis is only a general approach to the unconscionability question and is not a rule of law quotation omitted and emphasis added fonte,so d at the prevailing view is that procedural and substantive unconscionability must both be present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability.but they need not be present in the same degree romano manor care,so d,stating e ssentially a sliding scale is invoked and the more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.
other florida courts do not use,and some in fact never mention,a balancing or sliding scale approach and assess procedural and substantive unconscionability independently,concluding that if one part of the unconscionability test is not established,the other part need not be examined at all.bland,so d at this court,however,eschews the sliding scale approach.rather,we assess procedural unconscionability and substantive unconscionability independently.fin,mahan,so d,because the arbitration provisions in this case suffered from no procedural malady,we do not reach the question of substantive unconscionability.belcher kier,so d,stating the court must view unconscionability in a approach,procedural unconscionability and substantive unconscionability and because the appellees were unable to carry their burden as to both prongs,the ruling in their favor can not stand.see also hialeah,so d at,wl,at speaking for himself,the writer of the opinion suggests that in an appropriate future case,this court should reconsider murphy courtesy ford,so d although the requirement for both procedural and substantive unconscionability has been repeated in a number of arbitration cases in recent years,i respectfully suggest that holding is a illogical,and b inconsistent with this court decision in steinhardt rudolph,so d.cope,
as a result of this tension,there is a question as to the analytical,sliding scale or independent should use in considering procedural and substantive unconscionability issues under florida law,which we conclude should be certified to the florida supreme court.
procedural unconscionability 
whatever the approach used,it also is not clear whether sprint contract with the plaintiff is procedurally unconscionable under florida law.to determine whether a contract is procedurally unconscionable under florida law,courts must look to the manner in which the contract was entered into the relative bargaining power of the parties and whether the complaining party had a meaningful choice at the time the contract was entered into whether the terms were merely presented on a basis and the complaining party ability and opportunity to understand the disputed terms of the contract.powertel,so d at murphy,so d at.under florida law,a central question in the procedural unconscionability analysis is whether the consumer has an absence of meaningful choice in whether to accept the contract terms.belcher,so d at.in addition,florida courts might find that a contract is procedurally unconscionable if important terms were hidden in a maze of fine print and minimized by deceptive sales practices.powertel,so d at quotation marks omitted.
here,the district court determined that plaintiff had a meaningful choice and that sprint class action waiver was not procedurally unconscionable because plaintiff had notice of the class action waiver when he executed the advantage agreement,could have rejected the class action waiver within days of signing his agreement,could have used other mobile phone carriers while keeping the same phone number without signing a class action waiver,and was not prohibited from changing to an alternate provider due to the cost of lost equipment the mobile phone.
on appeal,plaintiff relies primarily on the first district powertel case to argue that the sprint class action waiver is procedurally unconscionable.in powertel,the florida first district court of appeal invalidated an arbitration clause in a cellular phone service contract.powertel,so d at.the florida appellate court determined the arbitration provision was unconscionable because the plaintiff lacked any meaningful choice in the matter,and canceling the contract was not an effective remedy since it would cause the loss of purchased equipment that worked only with powertel network and the plaintiff telephone number could not be transferred to a new provider.id.at.the florida appellate court added that its procedural unconscionability determination was supported by deficiencies in the way powertel notified its customers of the revised terms and conditions of service,including small print,no clear way to know what provisions were changed,and nothing to indicate it contained anything new.id the florida appellate court concluded the method powertel employed may have left many customers unaware of the new arbitration clause.id.
in contrast,florida fourth district court of appeal concluded in fonte wireless services that the arbitration action waiver in a mobile phone contract was not procedurally unconscionable.fonte,so d at.the fonte plaintiff executed an wireless contract and,at the time of the initial contract,received terms and conditions,which included arbitration and class action waiver clauses similar to the provisions in this case.see id.at.although suggesting the arbitration clause might be an adhesion contract the florida appellate court in fonte concluded the clause was not procedurally unconscionable,distinguishing powertel.id.at.the fonte court stated contrary to the manner in which the arbitration clause in powertel was imposed,at t included the arbitration clause in the original contract and notified the plaintiff numerous times to carefully review the terms and conditions,and the plaintiff had no prior investment in equipment id.at.the florida court also noted that the plaintiff in fonte was free to choose any alternate wireless carrier.id.at.
the parties cite several other florida intermediate appellate decisions discussing procedural unconscionability.each depends highly on the particular facts of the case.for example,in murphy courtesy ford,florida third district court of appeal affirmed the trial court determination that an arbitration clause contained as part of the conditions of an automobile purchase contract was not procedurally unconscionable.murphy,so d at.the florida court reasoned that the arbitration clause appeared in the same as the rest of the agreement,and there was no evidence that the automobile dealers actively discouraged or prevented the customer from understanding the terms.id.at the plaintiff can not avoid her contractual responsibility simply because she chose not to review the terms of her agreement.see also orkin exterminating,so d at t he arbitration provision was contained in the original contract between the parties.it was in large type on the first page of the agreement,not buried in a maze of fine print.while it was a preprinted provision,we can not agree with the circuit court finding that it was a contract of adhesion.
however,in steinhardt rudolph,florida third district court of appeal concluded a rent escalation clause in an initial condominium lease agreement was procedurally unconscionable.steinhardt,so d at.the florida appellate court noted several factors indicating procedural unconscionability,including the absence of individual condominium unit owners in the negotiations for rent increases,the inability of owners to opt out of the contract,and the fact that many contractual documents were not provided to individual owners until after closing.id.at.in belcher kier,florida second district court of appeal concluded rental price increases for mobile home tenants were procedurally unconscionable,mostly because the difficulties inherent in moving the home from one settled location to another made it nearly impossible for the mobile home tenants to be in the same bargaining position as mobile home park owners.belcher,so d at finally,in hialeah automotive basulto,florida third district court of appeal determined an arbitration clause in an initial automotive sales contract was procedurally unconscionable because its terms were in english,the plaintiffs did not speak english,and the dealership employees knew this fact and conducted the entire transaction,apart from the written agreement,in spanish,but did not inform the plaintiffs of the arbitration clause or provide a spanish language translation of the initial contract.hialeah,so d at,wl,at.
the facts of this case are different from all of the above florida decisions,and it is not clear what a florida court would do if this case were presented to it.here,at the time plaintiff purchased a second phone on the same account as his first phone,plaintiff advantage agreement contained the arbitration clause and expressly referenced sprint separate terms and conditions,which contained the class action waiver in clearly understandable print and terms,as discussed later.the class action waiver remained in the and terms and conditions,which sprint brought to plaintiff attention in monthly invoices and on its website.plaintiff argues,however,that sprint changed the terms and conditions over the course of to and did not call his attention to new provisions,such as the class action waiver,that were added in.
plaintiff stresses that once he contracted with sprint in,he could not have left sprint for another carrier without rendering his sprint mobile phone for his first phone line useless,as it only worked on sprint network yet the evidence in the record does not show how much plaintiff paid for his first phone in,much less how much it was worth,if anything,in instead,plaintiff asserts he ca know these things because he never attempted to terminate his plan or sell his phone,nor are they relevant since the mere fact that such a burden exists supports the plaintiff unconscionability argument.
plaintiff also argues he could not have effectively cancelled his service contract with sprint because there was no equivalent alternative carrier that did not also have a class action waiver in its contracts.however,the record indicates both tracfone and virgin mobile offered mobile service without a class action waiver in plaintiff service area in when he signed the advantage agreement.plaintiff claims neither carrier was an acceptable substitute because virgin mobile allegedly did not offer roaming services beyond the sprint pcs network,and tracfone settled a lawsuit in for allegedly charging its customers improper roaming charges.sprint responds that these de minimis differences from sprint service do not negate that tracfone and virgin mobile were available alternatives to the sprint service and did not have class action waivers in,and that florida law does not require that the available alternatives are perfect substitutes for the original service.
sprint also emphasizes,as did the district court,that plaintiff had a period following execution of the advantage agreement during which he could have cancelled his sprint services without incurring any penalty and would receive a full refund of his second phone purchase.although plaintiff arguably had no bargaining power as to the class action wavier in the advantage agreement,sprint provided a mechanism through which plaintiff could have avoided the contract entirely.thereafter,each time sprint amended its terms and conditions,plaintiff had days to cancel his service without payment of any penalty fees.as to his mobile phone equipment,plaintiff repeatedly changed mobile phone models and admits sprint subsidized the phones for his service agreements,although he has submitted no evidence of what he actually paid for the phones.and plaintiff mobile phone number was required by law to be portable to other carriers.
furthermore,the arbitration and class action clauses in this case are clearly demarcated from the rest of the document and emphasized by being in either bold,all caps,boxes,or all three.upon review of the entire terms and conditions applicable in,and,it is apparent that if plaintiff had read the terms and conditions he would have at a minimum noticed these arbitration and class action waiver clauses,as they are visually distinct from the rest of the contract and are relatively easy for nonlawyers to understand,mandatory arbitration of disputes no claim shall be resolved on a basis instead of suing in court,we each agree to arbitrate disputes no class actions.and when he signed the advantage agreement,plaintiff represented he had read the terms and conditions.this case is arguably distinct from florida appellate cases such as powertel,murphy,and hialeah in which unconscionable clauses were found in small print or buried within agreements,or were in a language other than the language in which the plaintiff carried out a sales transaction.nonetheless,sprint repeatedly changed its terms and conditions without calling to the subscriber attention whic
