randy turner established rancho la valencia,to acquire a piece of land called the tumbleweed property located in austin.rancho took out a million loan from omnibank to develop the property,with turner as the guarantor.problems arose during the development,so omnibank required rancho to bring in a new partner before it would continue financing.a rancho employee put turner in touch with eddie jones who agreed to a joint venture.for purposes of the joint venture,jones established aquaplex.rancho and aquaplex through their representatives turner and jones then signed the tumbleweed investment joint venture agreement jva,which included the following provisions 
contributions rancho would contribute the property and existing project aquaplex would contribute.
loans only rancho and the property remained responsible for the existing million omnibank had no liability.aquaplex also made a loan to the joint venture,with repayment priority second only to the omnibank loan.
ownership interest.
management aquaplex would be managing partner and would be paid up to a monthly management fee.aquaplex could make all but major decisions without rancho approval.one major decision was selling any of the development properties for less than per unit.even in a major decision,however,a partner could not unreasonably withhold its approval.
cash calls aquaplex,as managing partner,could issue a cash call when needed and both partners would be responsible for their share.if a partner failed to comply with the cash call,then the other partner could either contribute the amount,loan the joint venture the amount,or could seek to dissolve the joint venture.
offers on an offer of purchase by a of the property,either party that dissented to the sale could make a matching offer to buy the property.if no offer was made,the sale would go through.
disputes between aquaplex and rancho arose soon after the jva was signed.aquaplex terminated the project manager and took over the management.aquaplex also demolished the clubhouse,which rancho had already completed.aquaplex then issued a cash call under the terms of the jva,but rancho refused to contribute.rancho sued aquaplex,alleging fraud,breach of duties under the jva,and conversion and destruction of partnership assets.rancho claimed that aquaplex overstated the budgetary needs that led to the cash call and was needlessly destroying property.aquaplex,alleging frivolous suit,negligent misrepresentation,fraud,breach of the jva,and breach of warranty.aquaplex claimed that,prior to the jva,rancho misrepresented the status of the project and rancho own financial ability to meet continuing financial obligations.in the meantime,rancho loan with omnibank went into default,causing concerns about a potential foreclosure.
the parties proceeded to mediation.they entered into a rule memorandum of settlement agreement msa,which envisioned selling the property or ending the joint venture within six months.the terms of the msa provided that 
omnibank would roll all existing interest into the note and extend it for six months.
rancho would deposit into an omnibank account to pay all interest,taxes,and expenses on the property for those six months.
the property would be listed for six months at million,but that the property could be sold at any price exceeding million.rancho retained a right of first refusal on any offer.
rancho could acquire aquaplex interest in the joint venture for the approximate amount of aquaplex capital contribution,loan,interest,and management fees at any time in the next six months.
if the property was not sold or acquired in six months,rancho interest passed to aquaplex.
omnibank also agreed under a forbearance agreement not to post the property for foreclosure and if the property was not sold,to extend the maturity of the note with interest at the federal funds rate.the msa contemplated the later execution of a formal settlement agreement.however,rancho never established the account and a formal settlement agreement was never executed,causing omnibank forbearance agreement to lapse.
after the collapse of the settlement,the case proceeded to trial.a few days before trial,rancho trial counsel filed a motion to withdraw,claiming that his services were being used to perpetuate a fraud.rancho then filed for bankruptcy,which temporarily stayed the trial court proceedings.during the bankruptcy,an individual named jeff greenberg offered to purchase the tumbleweed property the greenberg offer for million.rancho refused to consent to the sale and filed a lis pendens on the property to prevent a sale of the property until the dispute was adjudicated.the bankruptcy court later dismissed rancho bankruptcy suit as a filing.the trial then resumed.aquaplex amended its petition to include allegations of breach and fraud related to the msa.at the close of rancho case in chief,the court directed a verdict against rancho on all of its claims,ruling that rancho breached the msa as a matter of law for failing to fund the account.this left aquaplex claims as the subject of the remainder of the trial.in a video deposition shown at trial,rancho former attorney testified under the exception about his dealings with turner.see evid.d there is no privilege i f the services of the lawyer were sought or obtained to enable or aid anyone to commit or plan to commit what the client knew or reasonably should have known to be a crime or fraud.the former attorney testified that he discovered that rancho did not intend to put up the deposit required under the msa and that rancho was negotiating with bankruptcy attorneys on the side during the settlement process.the jury found that rancho had breached both the jva and the msa and also committed fraud in connection with both.the jury also found that rancho had assigned its interest in the joint venture to omnibank in an earlier document.
aquaplex elected to recover damages for fraud under the msa and pursued declaratory and injunctive relief for the breach of the jva.the trial court entered judgment on the jury verdict,which awarded aquaplex 
actual damages for fraudulent inducement under the msa,itemized as 
for the loss of the greenberg offer 
for the omnibank deposit that rancho failed to set up 
for the loss of the forbearance agreement with omnibank 
for the amount aquaplex spent on legal representation during the bankruptcy proceedings.
