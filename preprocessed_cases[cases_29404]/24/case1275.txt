introduction 
this is an appeal involving an international commercial arbitration.it was conducted pursuant to title of the code of civil which is entitled,arbitration and conciliation of international commercial disputes.et at issue are the arbitration,not the conciliation,provisions.the arbitration provisions are found in sections through.
this case involves appeals from a december,judgment following orders confirming three international commercial arbitration awards.the first arbitration award,issued may,was in favor of plaintiff,comerica bank,and against defendants greenlight film television gary howsam gft circle films,road rage films,janus productions,gft going back films,gft heresy films,kotn films,and gft films.the second award,issued july,was in plaintiff favor and against howsam and greenlight film television,and their lawyer,charles coate.the third award,issued july,and was in plaintiff favor and against defendants and coate.the trial court refused to vacate these three awards and confirmed them.
in the published portion of this opinion,we will discuss four issues.first,we will discuss at some length whether the arbitrator failure to timely disclose an alleged disqualifying factor enumerated in section is a proper vacatur ground.defendants assert the failure to timely disclose under sections and is a ground for vacating an international commercial arbitration award.defendants rely on section,subdivision a a statutory vacatur ground which requires an award be vacated when an arbitrator fails to timely disclose a potentially disqualifying circumstance.citing section,plaintiff argues this issue can not even be raised on direct appeal from an order denying a vacatur motion.we agree with defendants that the issue may be raised on direct appeal after a vacatur motion is denied.but we hold the failure to timely disclose potential disqualifying circumstances,as required by sections and,is not a ground for vacatur under section,subdivision a.our ruling in this regard is limited to international commercial arbitrations conducted under section et.
second,we discuss whether the award was secured by corruption,fraud or other undue means,subd.a.among other things,we will analyze whether the arbitrator billing errors resulted in an award secured by corruption,fraud or other undue means.they did not.third,we will discuss whether the award resulted from a manifest disregard of the law.it did not.fourth,we will discuss whether the arbitrator exceeded his power when he decided alter ego issues.he did not.we affirm the orders denying the vacatur motion and confirming the award and the judgment.
ii.first amended complaint filed september,
the original complaint was filed on june.according to the first amended complaint,on november,plaintiff made loans totaling million to howsam and seven ontario,canada corporations controlled by him.howsam is alleged to be a toronto,ontario resident.the loans were to fund the production of seven different films.the loans were paid to all of the foregoing corporate defendants except greenlight film television.the loans were secured by the proceeds of the seven films.the primary collateral were foreign distributers minimum licensing fees.the collateral was in the form of guaranteed minimum license fees funded by foreign distributors.the first amended complaint alleges that certain documents that were necessary pursuant to the loan agreements were forged.the forged documents consisted of license agreements and notices and acknowledgments of assignments assignment notices.the forged assignment notices required the foreign distributors to directly pay plaintiff rather than defendants.the forged documents induced plaintiff to make the loans.the first amended complaint contains extensive alter ego allegations plaintiff never recovered the full amount of the loans and the security was worthless.
plaintiff was owed in excess of million.the causes of action were for contract breach fraud conspiracy to defraud fraudulent inducement an accounting money had and received account stated and open book account.plaintiff sought compensatory damages not less than million interest punitive damages an accounting imposition of a constructive trust injunctive relief attorney fees and costs.
iii.procedural history 
this appeal from a judgment after confirmation of three international commercial arbitration awards involves an extraordinarily complex series of events.the defaulted loans described in the first amended complaint resulted in federal bank fraud indictments against howsam and harel goldstein.goldstein was arrested by federal bureau of investigation special agents.goldstein pled guilty and then participated in a federal bank fraud investigation which targeted howsam.howsam was then indicted.later,the indictment was dismissed against howsam.the indictment against howsam was returned after the first amended complaint was filed and the arbitration had commenced.a lengthy stay in the arbitral proceedings ensued until the indictment was dismissed.proceedings resumed but later defendants withdrew from the arbitration and the arbitrator entered their default.an uncontested award was entered.
the difficulty in reciting the procedural scenario after howsam indictment was dismissed is that proceedings were sometimes simultaneously pending in the arbitral forum before both the arbitrator and the arbitration administrator the trial court before us and the california supreme court or in the federal courts.it is difficult to recite the somewhat confusing events simultaneously transpiring in different forums.but for purposes of clarity,we will set forth the events in strict chronological order.remarks of ted stevens on the death of steven ambrose,sess.abandon chronology at your peril.
events occurring after the first amended complaint was filed and before the stay was entered.
on october,seven defendants,except for howsam and greenlight film television,made a written demand to arbitrate the claims alleged in the first amended complaint.the basis of the seven defendants motion to compel arbitration were the agreements to arbitrate contained in the assignment notices.on october,defendants,other than howsam and greenlight film television,filed a motion to compel arbitration.on october,howsam and greenlight film television,filed a motion to quash on absence of jurisdiction grounds.on december,the motion to quash of howsam and greenlight film television was denied.on december,the motion to compel arbitration filed by defendants,other than howsam and greenlight film television,was denied.the mandate and review petitions challenging the december,order denying the motion to quash filed by howsam and greenlight film television were denied.greenlight film television superior court,nonpub.order greenlight film television superior court april,nonpub.order.on september,in an unpublished opinion,we reversed the december,order denying the motion to compel arbitration.comerica bank gft circle films,nonpub.opn.howsam and greenlight film television had filed a certiorari petition in the united states supreme court challenging the december,order denying their motion to quash.on november,the certiorari petition of howsam and greenlight film television was denied by the united states supreme court.howsam superior court.

the arbitration was conducted under the alliance rules for international arbitration.under its international commercial arbitration rules,the alliance acts as the administering agency.the alliance president,acting as the arbitral tribunal,designates a staff member as the arbitral agent.richonda starkey was designated by the alliance president as the arbitral agent.the alliance arbitral agent administers much of the arbitration including assisting in the selection or removal of the arbitrator.a party has a right to challenge a sitting arbitrator.under such circumstances,the arbitral agent determines whether to replace the arbitrator 
rules through of the alliance international commercial arbitration rules identify how the arbitrator is selected on october,starkey,the alliance arbitral agent,circulated a list of potential arbitrators.pursuant to paragraph of the alliance arbitration rules,steven strick was listed as one of the potential arbitrators.strick resume cataloged his undergraduate and graduate degrees his employment by various law firms including loeb loeb,talmadge,pritzger strick,rubin,bailin ortoli his employment in the entertainment industry by united artists corporation,home box office,dino delaurentis corporation,art commerce entertainment,and cst entertainment and his professional relationships including his membership in the association of the bar of the city of new york.nothing in mr strick resume stated he was a member of the state bar of california.on november,defendants moved to quash service of the notice of arbitration.also,on november,howsam and goldstein met in a local restaurant.goldstein was cooperating with the federal bureau of investigation and the meeting was video recorded.
on november,plaintiff listed strick as its first preference as the arbitrator.on november,howsam was arrested by the federal bureau of investigation on bank fraud charges.the charges arose out of the loan transactions at issue in this case.on november,defendants,other than howsam and greenlight film television,listed strick as their second choice to serve as the arbitrator.plaintiff struck defendants first choice to act as the arbitrator,bruce polichar.one of plaintiff attorneys explained their first choice,polichar,stated that i have acted as a mediator in several superior court cases in which coate represented one of the litigants.on that basis,plaintiff elected to strike polichar.therefore strick was their first eligible choice.
on november,strick was designated as the arbitrator.the parties were each individually assessed an initial charge.the arbitrator rate was per hour.howsam was indicted on november,on federal bank fraud and making false statements in loan documents charges.as noted,the fraud and loan documents involve the unpaid debts in this case.
on december,a preliminary telephonic hearing was held and the arbitrator scheduled a hearing on a motion to quash scheduled another preliminary hearing and noted that plaintiff had withdrawn its opposition to the arbitration tribunal jurisdiction.on january,the arbitrator denied defendants motion to quash service of the arbitration notice which had been filed november.the arbitrator ordered defendants to answer plaintiff notice of arbitration and file any within days.the arbitrator selected january,as the date for a further preliminary hearing.

events occurring after the stay was terminated and before defendants withdrew from the arbitration 
on may,plaintiff indicated its desire to resume arbitral proceedings to the alliance.on may,strick made the following disclosure i wish to disclose the following over the past years,i represented a client that maintained checking accounts at comerica bank cb.while i had signatory authority on some of the accounts,i have never had any personal interest in the company,its subsidiaries,the cb accounts or the proceeds thereof.i no longer represent the client,do not retain signatory authority on any such account and have no ongoing business or other relationship with cb.i am not now nor have i ever been a customer of cb or had any personal relationship with any of its officers or employees.in my opinion the facts here disclosed do not constitute a conflict with regard to the present arbitration,nor have they or will they in any way affect my impartiality and neutrality as arbitrator and would not be grounds for disqualification given the attenuated nature of the relationship.nevertheless i make this information available to the parties in what i believe to be an abundance of caution.
on june,defendants were ordered to file responsive pleadings by june.on june,howsam and greenlight film television demurred to the first amended complaint and the notice of arbitration and filed a motion to strike.on july,the arbitrator scheduled a september,hearing on a variety of issues.
on september,the scheduled hearing was held.also on september,plaintiff filed a first amended notice of arbitration.the first amended notice of arbitration alleges plaintiff has been damaged in a sum in excess of million.the first amended notice of arbitration also refers to the first amended complaint which alleges plaintiff has been damaged in excess of million.on september,the arbitrator issued a single spaced ruling addressing various motions and issues raised at the september,hearing which overruled defendants demurrer to the first amended complaint granted the motion to strike punitive damage allegations from the arbitration notice ruled alter ego issues were properly part of the arbitration and set a date for additional issues to be resolved.
on september,the arbitrator issued rulings concerning the scheduling of hearings on discovery disputes the approval of a deposition subpoena of goldstein the discovery date the dates for exchanges of expert witness information other hearing dates and the setting of the final hearings commencing february.the arbitrator expressly ruled that the statute of limitations on plaintiff claims was tolled upon the june,filing of the complaint.on november,howsam and greenlight film television objected to orders providing for formal discovery under the circumstances,a preliminary determination must be made if general alliance rules prohibiting formal discovery are to be deviated from in the first instance.if and only if,a determination that the interests of justice require procedures not regularly provided for will nevertheless be provided for here,then respondents must obviously have the opportunity to propound their own formal discovery.it can hardly be disputed that such alliance discovery will be extremely costly and burdensome and antithetical to the policies underlying arbitration in the first instance.however,when the claimant is a bank employing a law firm with unlimited resources,the true need for all of this discovery from the standpoint of respondents is to make the cost of the proceeding prohibitively expensive on november,the arbitrator issued orders limiting plaintiff admission requests to five distinct areas directing the parties confer concerning discovery issues directing all parties to produce their core documents by december,compelling production of documents by december,limiting each side to three depositions concerning possible stipulated facts permitting use of letters to raise discovery disputes and requiring payment of all arbitrator fees by november.
as noted,there was a video recording of the november,restaurant meeting between howsam and goldstein.on november,united states district court judge otis wright ordered the video recording unsealed over howsam objection.in connection with the unsealing proceedings,assistant united states attorney gregory lesser wrote the government notes,based upon the evidence presently before it,the government does not intend to further prosecute howsam for the offenses alleged in the indictment any related offenses involving similar loans obtained by howsam from comerica bank.
on november,the arbitrator issued an extensive order concerning discovery issues.the november,order extended to the scope of admissions requests document production allowing plaintiff to depose howsam and two other witnesses stipulated facts and the manner in which discovery disputes were to be resolved.in addition,the arbitrator ordered,counsel for each of the parties shall contact starkey on or before november,to make arrangements for the payment of all outstanding fees relating to these proceedings.
on november,defendants served admissions requests.on december,defendants served amended admissions requests.defendants motion to quash a subpoena duces tecum was denied on mootness grounds after judge wright ruled the video recording could be released.the video recording was of the meeting between howsam and goldstein.
on december,the arbitrator issued a further order concerning fees plaintiff and defendants shall bear arbitrator fees equally fifty percent of such fees shall be borne by plaintiff and fifty percent by defendants after the previously billed arbitrator deposits have been depleted.a final allocation of arbitration related costs and expenses among the parties will be made at the close of the proceeding.defendants had previously been ordered to pay of the arbitrator fees.in addition,the arbitrator ordered plaintiff to respond to supplemental admission requests.
on december,howsam and greenlight film television filed a terminating sanctions and disqualification motion in the trial court.defendants sought to disqualify plaintiff counsel on misconduct grounds.on december,counsel for howsam and greenlight film television requested a discovery stay or the opportunity to file a motion to that effect under california law the continued prosecution of discovery by claimant of this matter under the circumstances of this case raises constitutional issues and it is my understanding that you have now been served with a copy of a stay motion by associate counsel addressing the same.further,continued prosecution of this discovery with a motion for terminating sanctions and a motion to disqualify for violation of the california rules of professional conduct is contrary to law and compounds claimant violations.we object to such efforts while such motion is under consideration by the superior court.under the circumstances,would request a stay of discovery,or alternatively,leave to file a motion for stay of such discovery while such substantive matters are pending.on december,howsam and greenlight film television filed a motion in the trial court to stay the arbitration until april.april,is the date when the criminal statute of limitations would run on howsam dismissed federal bank fraud and related charges.
on january,the arbitrator denied the december,stay request i have claimant motion to compel production of documents and for monetary and evidentiary sanctions.respondents may file their opposition by january,claimant may reply by january.i also have respondents letter to me of december,requesting a stay of discovery,or leave to file a motion for leave to stay discovery.motion for stay is denied.however,respondents are granted leave file their motion by january,claimant may file its opposition by january if respondents wish to reply they may do so by january.unless and until a stay is granted,all discovery deadlines remain in effect.all documents ordered produced under this tribunal order of november,shall be produced forthwith,but not later than january.i would like to hold a hearing next week to consider outstanding issues including current discovery issues,prehearing scheduling and procedural issues next week.please let me know in advance if you have any agenda items to add.i will get back to you with a proposed and location.
on january,howsam and greenlight film television filed another stay motion before the arbitrator in absence of a current stay of this proceeding as previously requested,but further to the leave granted to move for a stay of this proceeding,without prejudice to respondents pending motions in the superior court,respondents herein give notice of their motion and herein move for stay of this proceeding pursuant to alliance rules,and,inter alia,at a hearing to be determined.counsel for respondents offers the use of the undersigned conference room for such purpose.the foregoing rules provide you with the equitable discretion to stay this arbitral proceeding until such substantive motions are adjudicated and finally resolved.the basis of the request for a reasonable stay of this proceeding until such motions are adjudicated and finally resolved is correspondingly set forth in the pending substantive motions before the superior court

on february,at from new york city,the arbitrator raised the issue of unpaid fees in an to all counsel thank you bertrand.receipt is acknowledged.we will take up the issues at tomorrow scheduled hearing.in the meantime,i invite defendants counsel to respond if they choose in advance of our scheduled teleconference tomorrow.also,i have been informed by my office that despite several messages and,long outstanding invoices for arbitrator fees have not been paid.i would like to remind counsel that under the alliance rules,failure to make deposits may be grounds for default.the relevant section is cited below.at any time after the commencement of the arbitration process,the arbitral agent or the arbitrator shall have the right to require each party to deposit with the arbitral agent or the arbitrator an equal amount as an advance against the arbitrator fees.the arbitrator shall give formal notice of any such failure to meet the deposit requirements and the consequences of such failure.the failure of any party to respond to such requests may be deemed by the arbitrator to be a default under rule above.the arbitral agent shall transmit all deposits upon receipt to the arbitrator.please make arrangements with my office for immediate payment of all outstanding invoices in advance of tomorrow call.
also on february,coate,counsel for howsam and greenlight film television,wrote starkey from santa monica and complained about the arbitrator billings.coate complained to starkey about the alleged terseness of the description of the arbitrator expenditure of time and the advance retainer of with regard to the arbitrator most recent invoice,a copy of which is attached it is noted that arbitrator strick in response to an ordered request that was required to be briefed and heard,reallocated fees so that they are fairly split between plaintiff on one side,and defendants on the other,but no credit has been provided to defendants for amounts that they previously paid in excess of such equal split on this invoice.we would ask for a proper recalculation so that prior amounts that were overpaid by defendants are properly allocated and that the invoice is accurately calculated to take such prior overpayments into account.also,we note a terseness or lack of description for many of the billing entries,and unfortunately are forced to query the time represented to be expended in connection with numerous entries.it is noted that in relation to the documents reviewed,a number of time descriptions do not appear to correspond in a meaningful way.for example,on december,hours are charged for simply review file and a half hour is expended reading a single letter on december.we also note that the lion share of the invoice does not address time that has already earned,but rather seeks a large advance retainer of fifteen thousand dollars that does not appear to be in relation to any task,or hearing,which is set in april.no explanation as to what this advance is for or entails is provided.we would kindly ask for some guidance from the alliance in this regard,especially when arbitrator strick today has threatened with virtually no notice the possible imposition of default tomorrow for failure to pay such invoice,notwithstanding the above.we do not believe that such a serious matter can be addressed in such a summary fashion and trust that the alliance concurs with such concerns in light of the above.
on february,howsam and greenlight film television filed a mandate petition in this court challenging the trial court february,order denying their stay motion.on the same date,howsam and greenlight film television filed a separate mandate petition in this court.the second petition challenged the trial court february,order denying their terminating sanctions and disqualification motions.
at a february,hearing before the arbitrator,defendants raised the issue of a stay pending our resolution of the two mandate petitions.also,the parties litigated issues concerning document production fee allocation and deposition duration allocation.in his february,written order,the arbitrator ruled on the issues raised at the february,hearing and denied defendants stay request issued orders in connection with document production and reserved ruling on questions concerning allocation of time at depositions.in addition the arbitrator addressed the issue of his fees the tribunal notes defendants comments with regard to a split of alliance fees and its petition for an accounting and a credit.it is further noted that starkey determined at the beginning of this proceeding that under alliance rules,arbitrator fees and expenses would be split between defendants and plaintiff,but that pursuant to paragraph of the order dated december,this tribunal ordered an equal split between defendants and plaintiff on a prospective basis,and ruled that a final allocation of arbitration related costs and expenses would be made at the close of proceedings.defendants petition for an immediate accounting and credit of fees is denied in the meantime,defendants are ordered to immediately pay their share of outstanding alliance arbitrator deposits in accordance with alliance rule.one of the omitted footnotes states the arbitrator had previously requested payment of fees on january.on february,plaintiff noticed howsam deposition.
on february,the arbitrator calculated his paid and unpaid fees.he had expended hours at a billing rate of per hour for a total due of.plaintiff had deposited.defendants had not deposited any moneys for arbitrator fees.the outstanding balance was.in addition,the arbitrator had ordered each side to post.thus,on february,plaintiff,which had already deposited,was to pay an additional.defendants,who had made no deposit,owed.on march,coate,counsel for howsam and greenlight film television,filed a stay request with the arbitrator.coate requested a stay pending ruling on the unresolved mandate petitions and an expedited hearing on that subject.
on march,kim tommaselli,the alliance senior counsel wrote in an that coate february,arbitrator fee challenge would be processed.in her,tommaselli requested a clarification as to what invoice was the subject of coate challenge.in response,coate clarified he was concerned about the arbitrator february,invoice which included the advance payment order.
on march,starkey wrote the arbitrator we have received your february,invoice which requires the parties in the above referenced matter to pay an additional fee deposit of.the amount requested far exceeds the customary deposits in an alliance arbitration.given the exceptional amount requested,the alliance asks that you provide to all parties and to the alliance an explanation of the arbitrator fees that this deposit is intended to cover.based on the extraordinary amount of time already spent on this matter to date hours and the further deposit requested,the parties should also be made aware of the time that you expect to spend through the conclusion of the matter,including the hearing and issuance of a final award.if you have any questions,please let me know.thank you in advance for your cooperation.also on march,we summarily denied the petition of howsam and greenlight film television directed at the trial court order refusing to stay the arbitration.greenlight film television superior court,nonpub.order.
on march,howsam and greenlight film television served by mail objections to a deposition notice.the deposition notice required howsam to appear on his own behalf and greenlight film television.the objections stated sections and do not apply to international depositions the depositions were conducted in violation of canadian law the dates were unilaterally selected and were inconvenient neither howsam nor greenlight film television would appear for the deposition on the scheduled dates and video recording the deposition would be burdensome and harassing.further,howsam and greenlight film television objected to three document categories in the deposition notice on the grounds they did not describe with particularity the papers to be produced the request was not calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and one category was premised on a falsehood.at that point,howsam deposition was scheduled for march and,in toronto.
on march,plaintiff counsel objected to any further delay of howsam deposition plaintiff wishes to remind the tribunal that its request for depositions was litigated and litigated again,and these depositions were ordered on november,originally scheduled for february sic by this tribunal january,order,and then rescheduled for the current march and dates by this tribunal february,order amended on february.in other words,there should be no further argument or dispute over these depositions.the interests of finality and judicial economy dictate that,if howsam fails to appear,terminating sanctions should issue.
also on march,the arbitrator reiterated his prior order concerning howsam deposition previous orders with respect to the ordered and agreed scheduling of two days of depositions on march and,are affirmed.in the even t that howsam fails to appear for depositions as previously ordered and noticed,this tribunal will favorably consider an award of default sanctions against howsam and greenlight film and television the arbitrator agreed to hear defendants objections to the proposed video recording of howsam deposition.on march,the arbitrator denied defendants further stay motion which had been filed on march.on march,plaintiff counsel responded to the fee challenge and copied the letter to the arbitrator.
on march,howsam counsel,coate,wrote to the arbitrator i n view of the pending writ regarding terminating sanctions,or in the alternative,for disqualification against plaintiff as well as the companion pending petition for review regarding the issuance of a stay under consideration before the california supreme court,and pursuant to objections timely served in accordance with the california discovery act,to avoid severe and unavoidable prejudice,cost and unnecessary expense,my clients will not and can not attend these improperly noticed international video depositions which were unilaterally set to commence tomorrow in toronto,ontario,canada.also on march,our supreme court denied the review petition of howsam and greenlight film television which sought to stay the arbitration.greenlight film television superior court,nonpub.order.
on march,howsam and greenlight film television filed a disqualification request with the arbitral agent,starkey.as noted,the arbitral agent was charged with the duty to decide disqualification issues.the challenge was based on the following allegations the arbitrator may,disclosure was untimely there had been depositions,extensive document production,use of interrogatories,and admissions requests had been propounded depositions had been ordered this was the first time coate,counsel for howsam and greenlight film television,had seen their use in an international arbitration the hearings had exclusively been held at plaintiff counsel offices and numerous unspecified motions had not yet been ruled upon.also,coate raised an issue concerning of allocation of fees.on march,we denied the mandate petition of howsam and greenlight film television challenging the trial court ruling denying their sanctions and disqualification motions.greenlight film television superior court,nonpub.order.on march,defendants,other than howsam and greenlight film television,filed a joinder in the march,disqualification request.
on march and,plaintiff filed a sanctions motion.on march,coate objected to any consideration being given plaintiff sanctions motions while the disqualification issue remained unresolved.coate wrote to starkey and tommaselli we are in receipt of recent pleadings accepted for filing by the arbitrator while there is a pending challenge before this tribunal regarding his ability to continue to serve as an arbitrator.we are also in receipt of a joinder to the challenge by other parties in this proceeding.we must object to continued participation in this proceeding by the arbitrator while the instant challenge is pending.for example,under section d a disqualified judge shall have no power to act in any proceeding after his or her disqualification or after the filing of a statement of his or her disqualification has been determined.notwithstanding that this matter is an arbitration,respondents can not be required to waive their right to have this threshold matter first determined.under the circumstances,please confirm that during this interim of the tribunal determination on the pending challenge,the arbitrator will refrain from improper consideration of matters before a threshold determination on the challenge is made.
while the disqualification request was being processed,starkey ruled on the fee dispute.on march,she wrote in response to your request for a retroactive reallocation of the arbitrator fees previously paid,arbitrator strick december,order states that the arbitrator fees shall be borne equally by claimant and respondents so that claimant is responsible for percent and respondents,collectively,are responsible for percent of the arbitrator fees.the order specifically states that such fee allocation become effective after all deposits have been depleted and that a final allocation of the fees will be done at the conclusion of the arbitration.the alliance does not have jurisdiction to overrule or supersede any order of the arbitrator.the alliance rule states,p rior to the appointment of the arbitrator,the arbitral agent shall make such decisions regarding procedural matters as may be required from time to time under these rules.after the appointment of the arbitrator,notices of all such matters shall be forwarded to the arbitrator with copy to the arbitral agent for decision and the arbitrator shall make such decision.e mphasis added.based on a review of the alliance file,several charges appear to be either duplicative or excessive based on the description of the work performed and the corresponding documents in the file for that time period.as such,the invoices dated january,and february,in the arbitration shall collectively be reduced by hours or five thousand two hundred fifty dollars.arbitrator strick is directed to refund the parties their respective shares of such amount based upon the allocation of fees in effect at the time of the invoice.fn.omitted.with regard to the advance deposit requested from the parties,arbitrator strick explained in his march letter that such amount was expected to cove the hearing days in april.the parties and the arbitrator shall be bound by this decision with regard to this fee challenge pursuant to the alliance rules.the omitted footnote states,the january invoice is reduced by hours and the february invoice is reduced by hours.immediately thereafter,counsel for howsam and greenlight film television reiterated their objections to strick remaining as the arbitrator.

on may,the arbitrator entered an interim award and factual findings in plaintiff favor on all its contract claims.the arbitrator found plaintiff entered into loan and security agreements with defendants,except for howsam and greenlight film television howsam created the seven corporations as vehicles for production of an equal number of films howsam signed the loan agreements on behalf of the seven corporations and the agreements were designed to provide production loans for the seven films.the collateral for the seven loans consisted of what the arbitrator termed documents.the arbitrator described the documents and their purpose are used to demonstrate the level of interest in a proposed film film industry confidence in the producer and distributors commitments to purchase rights to a film once it is distributed.the documents consisted of executed distribution agreements deal memos and assignment notices for the seven films.the security agreements in this case included provisions in which the borrowers represented the for each film was accurate the borrowers assigned their rights to distributor payments so as to satisfy the loan indebtedness and the borrowers acknowledged the loans would not have been made without the representations contained in the papers.the distribution agreements were forged.the forged distribution agreements were submitted to plaintiff prior to the funding of the loans by howsam and greenlight film television.plaintiff discovered the fraud when it later directly contacted the film distributors.
also,on may,the arbitrator found in plaintiff favor on its fraud based claims.the arbitrator found the forged distribution agreements were given to plaintiff to induce funding of the loans two foreign distributors testified they never entered into the distribution agreements other declarations established the distribution agreement signatures were forged plaintiff would not have funded the loans had its employees knew of any of the forgeries the forged instruments were provide by howsam and howsam knew the instruments were forged.according to the arbitrator,howsam complimented goldstein for one of the forgeries,referring to it as creative thinking directed goldstein and an assistant to forge signatures on other distribution agreements personally participated in one of the forgeries during a video secured by the federal bureau of investigation,admitted he knew of the forgeries during the video told goldstein to claim a subordinate forged the signatures and to lie about the scheme destroyed evidence of the fraud as to one of the films and shredded his own files paid goldstein living expenses and attorneys fees once plaintiff discovered the fraud made the payments in an effort to buy goldstein silence also paid the attorney fees for a witness,michelle glockler the video states glockler fees were paid to keep her quiet told goldstein to stay quiet and develop amnesia told goldstein to shred documents and transferred his assets to his wife name after plaintiff discovered the fraudulent scheme.
further,on may,the arbitrator found the seven corporations which received loan proceeds were the alter egos of howsam and greenlight film television.the arbitrator found howsam created and controlled cpc communications,greenlight film television is a wholly owned subsidiary of cpc communications,howsam is the sole director of greenlight film television cpc communications,is sole shareholder of greenlight film television all seven corporations used to fund the films are wholly owned subsidiaries of greenlight film television howsam transferred assets of these corporations and created a new entity the new entity received profitable assets from other defendants money from defendants corporate accounts was paid to goldstein spouse in order that he remain silent about the forgeries greenlight film television and the seven corporations which received the loans were never adequately capitalized howsam used the forged instruments to secure funding for films the funds were used interchangeably by all of the subsidiaries and howsam used the loan proceeds for matters unrelated to film production.finally,the arbitrator found defendants acted with malice,fraud and oppression.the arbitrator awarded compensatory damages in plaintiff favor against all defendants in the sum of plus interest from april,awarded plaintiff costs and attorneys fees and denied defendants.
on may,our supreme court denied the review petition of howsam and greenlight film television.the review petition challenged the trial court order denying their terminating sanctions and disqualification motion.greenlight film television superior court may,nonpub.order.on may,the trial court denied the motion of howsam and greenlight film television to disqualify the arbitrator.as noted,the disqualification motion of howsam and greenlight film television had been filed on april,before the arbitrator began hearing testimony.no defendant filed a mandate petition challenging the trial court may,order refusing to disqualify the arbitrator.
on july,the arbitrator granted plaintiff sanctions motions which had been filed on march and.the arbitrator found he had the authority to impose monetary sanctions.the arbitrator found that coate had engaged in abusive discovery practices by belatedly notifying plaintiff attorneys that howsam would refuse to attend his deposition this caused plaintiff counsel to unnecessarily travel to toronto and by disingenuously objecting to the videotaping of the deposition which implied howsam would be deposed.the arbitrator imposed in monetary sanctions against howsam and greenlight film television and their counsel,coate.plaintiff had sought a monetary sanctions award against raymond hamrick,the attorney for the seven corporations used to secure the loan funding.the arbitrator found hamrick had not engaged in any discovery abuses.on july,the arbitrator imposed in costs against defendants as follows fees and costs in the sum of in arbitrator fees and in sanctions.all awards were certified pursuant to article i of the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards of june.commonly referred to as the new york convention,it is codified in this country at title united states code sections through.
events occurring after the awards are returned 
on august,defendants filed petitions to vacate the arbitration awards.the petitions are based on all the grounds specified in section subdivision a.in addition,the petitions and points and authorities allege the arbitrator engaged in misconduct because he failed to make timely mandatory disclosures,rendered a duplicative billing,refused to rule on defendants motions and issued an inappropriate award the award is executed by stephen strick who was unknown to defendants the award was obtained through undue means the arbitrator improperly refused to stay the arbitration there were errors in connection with alter ego and discovery issues the arbitrator failed to resolve all necessary issues and the award was returned in manifest disregard of the law.defendants did not request a new arbitration hearing.plaintiffs filed an opposition.
on december,the trial court denied the petitions to vacate the awards.the awards were confirmed.defendants motions for issuance of a statement of decision were denied.on january,notice of entry of the two orders confirming the awards and denying the motion to vacate them was served.judgment was entered on march.notice of entry of judgment was served on march.notices of appeal were filed on behalf of defendants and coate on april.
iv.discussion 
defendants argue the award should be vacated on various grounds.the case was litigated in the trial court on the assumption california vacatur provisions applied to this dispute.the briefs are all premised on the assumption that this state vacatur provisions are applicable.at oral argument,in response to an inquiry from the bench,every attorney stipulated the arbitration confirmation and vacatur provisions of the california arbitration act apply.

failure to disclose 
background 
defendants argue the awards must be vacated because the arbitrator failed to timely disclose a basis for disqualification.defendants rely on the following facts the arbitrator was assigned on november,on may,the arbitrator disclosed that he had represented a client who had an account with plaintiff he had signatory authority over the account and on march,while responding to their for cause challenge,the arbitrator referred to clients.as noted,on march,howsam and greenlight film television filed a disqualification motion.the challenge was based in part on the arbitrator failure to disclose his signatory authority over a client account maintained with plaintiff.on march,the other defendants joined in the disqualification request of howsam and greenlight film television.
in response to march and,challenges,the arbitrator referred to a discussion with alliance officials concerning his clients and the duty to disclose.the reference to clients was made in the arbitrator march,response to defendants challenges.on march,howsam and greenlight film television filed a supplemental challenge premised on the arbitrator march,reference to clients in his response to defendants challenges.defendants challenges to the arbitrator were denied by starkey on march.on april,howsam and greenlight film television filed a motion in the trial court for an order disqualifying the arbitrator.on may,the trial court denied the motion of howsam and greenlight film television to disqualify the arbitrator.
defendants rely on section,subdivision a a and b which,as we have noted,state a subject to section,the court shall vacate the award if the court determines any of the following an arbitrator making the award either a failed to disclose within the time required for disclosure a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was then aware or b was subject to disqualification upon grounds specified in section but failed upon receipt of timely demand to disqualify himself or herself as required by that provision.however,this subdivision does not apply to arbitration proceedings conducted under a collective bargaining agreement between employers and employees or between their respective representatives.section,subdivision a identifies a specific circumstance where an arbitrator has a duty to disclose in any arbitration pursuant to an arbitration agreement,when a person is to serve as a neutral arbitrator,the proposed neutral arbitrator shall disclose all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be able to be impartial,including all of the following the existence of any ground specified in section for disqualification of a judge.one of the grounds for disqualification of a judge is if a person aware of the facts might reasonably entertain a doubt whether the jurist would be able to be impartial,subd.a a iii haworth superior court cal th,rebmann rohde th.defendants assert the arbitrator failure to disclose his signatory authority over an account maintained by a client or clients with plaintiff required his disqualification.as there are no disputed facts,we review this contention de novo.haworth superior court,supra,cal th at rebmann rohde,supra,th at.
the present case involves an international commercial arbitration.we conclude these contentions do not provide a basis for reversal on direct appeal from a judgment following confirmation of an international commercial arbitration award.as we will explain,the disclosure duties and the consequences of a failure to disclose differ in domestic and international commercial arbitrations.as a result,the failure to comply with the sections and disclosure obligations are not a ground for vacatur of an international commercial arbitration award.given our holding,we need not address the parties contentions regarding the arbitrator alleged duty to disclose his signatory power over a client or clients bank accounts.
disclosure duties under california international commercial arbitral law 
an arbitrator disclosure duties under california international commercial arbitration statutes materially depart from those applicable to domestic disputes.section states in part,t his title supersedes sections to,inclusive,with respect to international commercial arbitration and conciliation.as will be noted,the import of section is to abrogate the arbitrator disclosure duties under sections and.further,no court may intervene in matters governed by the international commercial arbitration statutes except as specified therein.section states,in matters governed by this title,no court shall intervene except where so provided in this title,or applicable federal law.
sections through impose disclosure requirements on arbitrators in international commercial arbitrations some of which materially deviate from those in sections and.section describes an international arbitrator disclosure duties a ll persons whose names have been submitted for consideration for appointment or designation as arbitrators or conciliators,or who have been appointed or designated as such,shall,within days,make a disclosure to the parties of any information which might cause their impartiality to be questioned including,but not limited to,any of the following instances the foregoing disclosure duty is mandatory.the duty to disclose is continuing,from the time of appointment and throughout the arbitral proceedings,an arbitrator,shall,without delay,disclose to the parties any circumstances referred to in section which were not previously disclosed.
section requires a challenge be made within days of becoming aware of the disqualifying circumstances the arbitral tribunal,in this case the alliance,then decides whether to disqualify the arbitrator.if a challenge is unsuccessful,the matter may be taken to superior court.section states if a challenge following the procedure under section is not successful,the challenging party may request the superior court,within days after having received notice of the decision rejecting the challenge,to decide on the challenge.if a challenge is based upon the grounds set forth in section,and the superior court determines that the facts support a finding that such ground or grounds fairly exist,then the challenge should be sustained.once the challenge has been ruled upon by the superior court,the decision is final and not subject to appeal.section provides,the decision of the superior court under section is final and is not subject to appeal.
appealability 
plaintiff argues defendants failure to disclose contention can not be raised on direct appeal from the judgment following an order confirming the three arbitration awards.as noted,section expressly states the superior court determination is not subject to appeal.there are two other provisions of california international commercial arbitration statutes which state the superior court decision is final and not subject to appeal.review of disputes over arbitrator selection review of disputes over an arbitrator failure to act.
the right to appeal is statutory subject to the constitutional right of review by an appellate court.our supreme court has repeatedly stated the right to appeal is statutory.people mena cal th,point safe harbor collective superior court cal th.however,the abrogation of the right to appeal must be clearly stated w e have repeatedly held that if the legislature intends to abrogate the statutory right to appeal,that intent must be clearly stated.the right of appeal is remedial and in doubtful cases the doubt should be resolved in favor of the right whenever the substantial interests of a party are affected by a judgment citations.in re matthew cal th.in re cal th.
in matthew,our supreme court reviewed language in former welfare and institutions code section,subdivision k which purported to restrict the right to appellate review.the order at issue was one setting a parental termination rights hearing.former welfare and institutions code section,subdivision k stated,an order by the court directing that a hearing pursuant to this section be held is not an appealable order,but may be the subject of review by extraordinary writ.stats,ch.our supreme court analyzed whether this language barred raising the appropriateness of an order setting a parental termination rights hearing in a appeal the phrase,not an appealable order,has long been applied to interlocutory orders that are not immediately appealable,but are subject to review on appeal from a subsequent final judgment.generally speaking,under the one final judgment rule,interlocutory or interim orders are not appealable,but are only reviewable on appeal from the final judgment.rao campo d,see southern pacific oppenheimer cal d.the theory behind the rule is that piecemeal disposition and multiple appeals in a single action are oppressive and costly,and review of intermediate rulings should await the final disposition of the case.rao campo,supra,d at.if an order is appealable,however,and no timely appeal is taken therefrom,the issues determined by the order are res judicata.see,reeves hutson d.in re matthew,supra,cal th at,fn.omitted.turning to other authority,our supreme court held in numerous cases,this court and the courts of appeal have used the phrase not an appealable order to characterize an order as being merely interim or interlocutory.citations.thus,to construe such language as forever precluding review on appeal from a final judgment would be a dramatic and wholly unwarranted departure from precedent.id.at.
here,the legislature never clearly stated an intent to abrogate the right to appeal a judgment entered after an international commercial arbitration award was confirmed.certainly,section speaks to superseding sections through.and section limits judicial intervention to circumstances specified in the international arbitration rules.but no international commercial arbitration statutory provision discusses awards.by contrast section,subdivision a provides a litigant may appeal from a judgment we have carefully reviewed the committee reports and numerous letters and memoranda before the legislature before sections through were adopted in.none of them even address the right to appeal under section,subdivision a.more to the point,no international commercial arbitration provision prevents raising a disqualification issue in a appeal.certainly,a superior court order addressing a disqualification may not be immediately appealed.but a disqualification issue can be litigated in a appeal as defendants have done here.therefore,we disagree with plaintiff argument that the disclosure issue can not be raised on direct appeal.as will be noted though,that does not resolve the question of whether the awards can be set aside under section,subdivision a a.
applicable disclosure provisions 
as noted,in,the legislature expressly stated international commercial arbitrations were not subject to sections to.sections and are part of the superseded domestic arbitration provisions.section,and by reference section,are relevant because they are referred to in the section,subdivision a vacatur provision.but section was enacted in after the international commercial arbitration provisions were adopted in.stats,ch.further,section was enacted in well after the international commercial arbitration statutes were adopted.stats,ch.we have examined the committee reports prepared in connection with the statutes when sections was amended and was adopted.com.on judiciary,analysis.of bill reg.sess.as amended april,rules,off.of floor analyses,bill,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended april,assem.com.on appropriations,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended august,rules,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended august,and rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended august.we have further examined the committee reports prepared in when section was adopted.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.may,com.on judiciary,off.of floor analyses,analysis of bill reg.sess.may,assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july,com.on judiciary,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended august,com.on judiciary,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended august,com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.august,and com.on judiciary,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended august.they never discuss international commercial arbitrations.complicating matters though,section,subdivision a,which relates to vacating an award,directly refers to section.
we believe that sections and,which are expressly superseded by section,do not apply to international commercial arbitrations for the following reasons.to begin with,they are expressly superseded.and section sets forth the mandatory arbitrator disclosures in international commercial arbitrations.see fn,supra.section identifies similar but also materially different disclosure duties.among the different disclosure duties listed in section are current or prospective employment arrangements with a party discussions with a party concerning possible employment matters specified in the ethics standards for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitration names of all parties to prior noncollective bargaining cases in which the arbitrator has served cases where the arbitrator is a party arbitrator and the results of arbitrations within a period.disclosure of enumerated factors in the case of a international commercial arbitration must be made within days of the arbitrator assignment.disclosure in domestic arbitrations must be made within calendar days of the assignment of the arbitrator,subd.b.there is an overlap between sections and,on one hand,and section,on the other,but the differences are material.section is the more specific of the two statutory schemes because it applies to international commercial arbitrations.since,it is more the more specific statute,section is the controlling disclosure statute in international commercial arbitrations not sections and.lake reed cal th,a more specific statute controls over a more general one prudential reinsurance superior court cal th,this violates the fundamental principle that where there is a conflict the more specific statute controls over the more general.this is particularly persuasive given the absence of any evidence the legislature intended the and enactments apply to international commercial arbitrations.
vacatur grounds 
apart from cases like pearson dental supplies,superior court supra,cal th at pages,and,the vacatur grounds listed in section,subdivision a are controlling.moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at oaktree capital management,bernard,supra,cal.app th at.the failure to disclose a section disqualifying ground is not listed as a basis for a section,subdivision a vacatur order.thus,the trial court correctly refused to vacate the award because of an alleged violation of section.this does not mean an errant trial court ruling on a disqualification issue in an international commercial arbitration is immune from appellate review.a litigant remains free to raise the failure to disclose issue in a writ petition.all we are holding is that noncompliance with section is not a proper ground for a judicial vacatur order under section,subdivision a.
corruption,fraud or other undue means 
defendants argue that the award was secured through corruption,fraud or other undue means.they argue that there were ex parte communications between the arbitrator and unidentified alliance officials the arbitrator threatened to default defendants if they failed to pay his fees in advance the arbitrator overbilled the arbitrator received a letter from plaintiff counsel during the fee challenge the award was prepared by plaintiff and the default award misspelled the arbitrator name.in the published portion of the opinion we will discuss the ex parte communication,the arbitrator order to pay fees and the overbilling issues.
section,subdivision a states that an award may be vacated if the award is secured by corruption,fraud or other undue means.fraud,as that term is used in section,subdivision a,is that perpetrated by the arbitrator or a party.only extrinsic fraud which denies a party a fair hearing may serve as a basis for vacating an award.maaso signer th,pour le bebe,guess th,pacific crown distributers.brotherhood of teamsters d,fn.as to undue means,a ninth circuit panel has defined the term thusly although the term has not been defined in any federal case of which we are aware,it clearly connotes behavior that is immoral if not illegal.see black law dictionary ed.undue means more than necessary not proper illegal,and denotes something wrong,according to the standard of morals which the law enforces.undue influence means any improper or wrongful constraint,machination,or urgency of persuasion whereby the will of a person is overpowered.edwards sons,mccollough cir,accord pour le bebe,guess,supra,th at.undue means can include representation of a party where an attorney is operating under a conflict of interest.id.at.undue influence occurs when there is bribery or intimidation of the arbitrator.id.at.
improper ex parte communications between an arbitrator and a litigant can serve as a basis for a corruption,fraud or other undue means finding.maaso signer,supra,th at.in the case of an ex parte communication between an arbitrator and an attorney,our colleagues in division six of this appellate district described why it was inappropriate to vacate the arbitration award we agree the arbitrator should have advised appellants counsel of the ex parte communication and that he would be issuing an amended arbitration award resolving the stop notice claim.in the absence of a showing that the arbitrator was improperly influenced or actually considered evidence outside the original arbitration proceedings such that appellants needed a further opportunity to be heard on the stop notice claim,appellants can not demonstrate that the amended award was procured by corruption,fraud,undue means,or misconduct of the arbitrator within the meaning of section,subdivisions a,b or c.classic,tri build development th.
defendants have the burden of showing the arbitrator committed error.frantz inter insurance exchange d,popcorn equipment page d,overruled on a different point in flores arroyo cal d.defendants must show they were prejudiced by the alleged corruption,fraud or undue means.pacific vegetable oil,cal d,in order that the claimed departure from the usual procedure be held to amount to misconduct of the arbitrators sufficient to vacate the award it must be shown that such departure had prejudiced the rights of the buyer.manson v,wilcox cal,the obvious meaning of this subdivision is that the misconduct or error complained of,to whatever class it may belong,must be of such a character that the rights of the party complaining were prejudiced thereby.cothron interinsurance exchange d,absent a showing of prejudice,even if error had been committed,the lower court was required to affirm the award.davey tree surgery international brotherhood of electrical workers d,an award will not be vacated for any error that does not prejudice the rights of the party complaining see moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at recommendation and study relating to arbitration,cal.law revision com.g.dictum in one case arising from an international arbitral dispute states a party who refuses to participate in a contractual arbitration is foreclosed from challenging an award.ganger rolf zeeland,it may not complain that it has not been heard on the merits before the arbitrators since it waived the right to do so granted to it by the arbitration agreement by which it bound itself.
none of the asserted grounds are a basis for vacating the award.before proceeding to an analysis of the individual contentions,we note defendants withdrew from the arbitration.the sole record provided by defendants of the arbitration itself were the arbitrator findings issued after the default hearing.that record reflects howsam and goldstein engaged in a sophisticated fraudulent conspiracy utilizing forged assignment notices and other documents to steal millions of dollars from plaintiff.defendants have presented no evidence which would support an inference they do not owe the money.defendants have failed to show that any of the claimed errors prejudiced them as they withdrew from the arbitral proceedings.
ex parte communications with the arbitrator provider 
defendants assert the ex parte communication between the alliance officials and the arbitrator on the disclosure issue constitutes corruption,fraud or other undue means.as noted,the arbitrator discussed that he had signatory authority over a client account with unidentified alliance officials.during that discussion,the arbitrator verified there was no disclosure duty concerning the account.defendants contention has no merit.no improper ex parte communication occurred between starkey and the arbitrator.no decisional authority holds that counsel must be present when an arbitrator communicates with an arbitration administrator.and the communication was perfectly legitimate.the arbitrator wanted to verify if,under the alliance rules,he had to disclose the fact he had signatory authority over a client account.the signatory authority issue was of little moment.the arbitrator had no financial interest in plaintiff.the arbitrator disclosed his signatory authority on may.defendants waited until march and,to raise the issue and only then when the arbitrator had made adverse rulings against them.the ex parte communication was not a basis for vacatur.classic,tri build development,supra,th at.
the requirement that fees be posted in advance of the arbitral hearing on the merits 
defendants argue the arbitrator threat to enter their default if they failed to pay his fees in advance requires vacatur.the alliance rules expressly provide for this scenario.the alliance rule provides at any time after the commencement of the arbitration process,the arbitral agent or the arbitrator shall have the right to require each party to deposit with the arbitral agent or the arbitrator an equal amount as an advance against the arbitrator fees.the arbitrator shall give formal notice of any such failure to meet the deposit requirements and the consequences of such failure.the failure of any party to meet the deposit requirements may be deemed by the arbitrator to be a default under rule above,unless otherwise provided by applicable law.the arbitrator may direct the other party or parties to pay the outstanding amounts to allow the arbitration to proceed subject to any award on costs.if such payment is not made by claimant s,the arbitrator may dismiss the proceedings without prejudice.the arbitrator may dismiss a claim or counterclaim,without prejudice,if a party fails to timely provide the full amount.rule of the alliance international arbitration rules states if,after proper notice,one of the parties fails to respond to any demand by the arbitrator for documents or other materials or in any manner fails to conform to the provisions of these rules or any order of the arbitrator,the arbitrator may declare that party to be in default and make appropriate orders or interim awards to require compliance or may make a final award however,no default shall be found after the matter has been submitted for decision solely because of a party failure to pay the arbitrator fees.thus,the alliance rules permit the arbitrator to order advance payment of fees and enter a default if they are unpaid.the award was not secured by corruption,fraud or other undue means because a potential default was authorized by the alliance rules and defendant withdrew from the arbitration.
the billing errors 
defendants argue the arbitrator overbilled them and this is evidence of corruption,fraud,or other undue means.as noted,the alliance sustained defendants fee challenge in part.originally,the alliance ordered defendants to pay of the arbitrator fees.on december,the arbitrator ordered that plaintiff pay his fees and defendants pay the other.by february,the arbitrator calculated he had expended hours at a billing rate of per hour for a total due of.plaintiff had posted for arbitrator fees but defendants had deposited none.on february,the arbitrator directed each side to post in fees as an advance for a total of.on february,plaintiff,which had already deposited,was to pay an additional.defendants,who had made no deposit,owed.on march,tommaselli,the alliance senior counsel wrote that february,arbitrator fee challenge would be processed.on march,starkey reduced a january,invoice by hours and february,invoice by hours.
based on starkey ruling,defendants argue the awards were procured by corruption,fraud or other undue means.no doubt,there are scenarios where an arbitrator billing errors can amount to corruption,fraud,or other undue means but this is not one of them.defendants have failed to provide this court with many of the papers filed with the arbitrator.included in that massive missing number of documents are the arbitrator billing statements which starkey relied upon in making her ruling on the billing challenge.as noted,it is defendants burden to demonstrate error by the arbitrator and the trial court.
in any event,our extensive chronological factual recitation demonstrates that by the time the january and february,invoices were served,both sides had litigated in the trial court,court of appeal and the california and united states supreme courts various jurisdictional and duty to arbitrate issues between december,and january,litigated a motion to quash and resolved other jurisdictional issues and on january,after howsam was indicted,and in response to a stay motion and stipulation,stayed the arbitration.on june,the arbitrator ordered the filing of responsive pleadings.what followed was extensive arbitral litigation which included scheduling and conducting hearings rulings on pleading challenges addressing substantial discovery disputes numerous stay motions filed by defendants and fee allocation issues.it is understandable how billing errors could occur under these circumstances with fast moving substantive challenges being pursued by both sides.defendants have only established the arbitrator negligently miscalculated his fees.there is no evidence of fraud.the arbitrators billing errors were corrected defendants have presented no evidence that after starkey march,ruling,any further miscalculations occurred.the billing errors were to the detriment of each side.also,the alliance had originally directed defendants to pay percent of the arbitrator fees.on december,the arbitrator modified the alliance allocation to require defendants to pay only percent of his fees.and as our record demonstrates,defendants never paid any fees.arbitrators and arbitration providers have a duty to insure litigants are correctly billed for services.here in two invoices,the arbitrator,based on starkey unchallenged findings,incorrectly invoiced the parties for arbitral services.but based on all of the foregoing,we conclude defendants have failed to demonstrate the billing errors resulted in an award being procured by corruption,fraud or other undue means.
part iv c is deleted from publication 
other arguments 
defendants argue the arbitrator received a letter from plaintiff counsel during the fee challenge.this,they argue is evidence of corruption,fraud or other undue means.as noted,at on february,in an from new york city,the arbitrator raised the issue of his unpaid fees.coate,on behalf of howsam and greenlight film television,responded on february,by writing to starkey,the arbitral agent.as noted,coate requested a reallocation of fees and credit for prior payments.the record before us indicates defendants never paid any fees.further,coate argued that the description of work performed was terse and complained about the arbitrator request for an advance payment in light of the anticipated lengthy arbitration hearings.on march,tommaselli,the alliance senior counsel,wrote an stating that coate fee challenge would be processed.during the fee challenge,plaintiff counsel sent a letter responding to coate allegations.the sole evidence concerning the letter is in coate declaration filed in support of the motion to vacate the award of howsam and greenlight film television.coate declaration states on march,plaintiff counsel copied the arbitrator on a letter to the alliance responding to defendants fee challenges.alliance r ule states in pertinent part,such challenge shall not be served on the arbitrator or any other party.
the matters specified in coate declaration do not constitute corruption,fraud or other undue means.alliance rule sets forth the procedures in the case of a fee challenge.alliance rule states in its entirety any party may challenge any fee requested by the arbitrator by appealing to the arbitral agent to determine the propriety,fairness and reasonableness of the fee requested.such challenge must be submitted within days of the transmission of the final invoice after the arbitration that is the subject of the challenge has concluded.the party challenging the fee requested by the arbitrator must provide specific reasons for the challenge,including the actual charges disputed,and,if applicable,supporting documentation.such challenge shall not be served on the arbitrator or any other party.the decision of the arbitral agent is final and the parties and the arbitrator shall be bound by such decision.as can be noted,alliance rule only prohibits the challenge being served on the arbitrator.alliance rule does not prohibit any other party from raising the issue.further,defendants have failed to sustain their burden of showing any prejudice.defendants did not provide the letter they have only referred to brief language in coate declaration.defendants have failed to demonstrate the award was procured by corruption,fraud or other undue means.
also,defendants argue that the misspelling of the arbitrator name is evidence he did not prepare the award.they assert this demonstrates the award was written by plaintiff counsel.no evidence support this assertion.even if plaintiff prepared the award,that is not evidence of corruption,fraud or other undue means.in judicial proceedings,courts often direct counsel to prepare awards and it is not indicative of corruption,fraud,other undue means,or misconduct.likewise,there is no merit to defendants argument that there were other improper ex parte communications.and defendants argument it was improper for plaintiff to communicate directly with the arbitrator after their defaults were entered is meritless they made the decision to withdraw from the arbitration.defendants contentions discussed in this paragraph are frivolous.
parts iv d and e and are to be published.
manifest disregard of the law 
defendants argue the award was secured in manifest disregard of the law.defendants argue that the award exceeds the amount specified in the september,arbitration demand.referring to section,subdivision a,they contend the award exceeds that allowable in the case of a default judgment.to begin with,defendants have forfeited this issue by withdrawing from the arbitration.in order to challenge an award in court,a litigant must have raised the point before the arbitrator.moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at illegality issue would have been forfeited had it not been raised before the arbitrator mossman city of oakdale th,i t is well settled that a party may not sit idle through an arbitration proceeding and then collaterally attack that procedure on grounds not raised before the arbitrators when the result turns out to be adverse.reed mutual service th,any claim of illegality must be raised before the arbitrator or it is deemed waived.paramount unified school dist.teachers of paramount th,noncompliance with government claims act forfeited because the issue was not raised before the arbitrator.by withdrawing,defendants have forfeited their opportunity to challenge the actual results of the arbitration on the ground there was noncompliance with section,subdivision a.

defendants argue the arbitrator exceeded his powers in two respects.initially,they argue that the arbitrator exceeded his powers by resolving plaintiff alter ego allegations.we will discuss this issue in the published portion of the opinion.and,defendants assert the arbitrator exceeded his powers by making various discovery rulings.we disagree with defendants on both counts.
the arbitrator did not exceed his powers by deciding the alter ego issue.on october,defendants,other than howsam and greenlight film television,served a written demand to arbitrate the claims in the first amended complaint.the arbitration clauses,which are the same in all of the assignment notices,provide for arbitration of any dispute between the parties.the arbitration clauses in all of the assignment notices provide in part each of the parties hereto agrees that any dispute under the distribution agreement or this agreement,including,without limitation,any disputes relating to distributor obligation to pay the advance to the bank when due,shall be resolved by mandatory binding arbitration the first amended complaint contains extensive alter ego allegations.see fn,supra.on october,those same defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration.when their motion to compel was denied,defendants appealed.and,in an unpublished opinion,we reversed the order denying the petition to compel arbitration.comerica bank gft circle films,supra.on november,howsam and greenlight film television moved to compel arbitration.the remaining defendants who are parties to this appeal joined in the petition of howsam and greenlight film television.the initial arbitration demand served by plaintiff attached the first amended complaint with its alter ego allegations.thus,defendants sought arbitration of the issues raised in the first amended complaint which included the alter ego claims.
moreover,defendants sought arbitration under california international commercial arbitration statutes.section provides that the arbitrator may rule on his or her own jurisdiction further,under the alliance rules,the arbitrator is charged with determining his or her powers.rule states,the arbitrator shall have all jurisdiction and powers to make rulings as to procedures for the conduct of the arbitration including,but not limited to,the situs of the arbitration,the governing law and the arbitrability of any claims or cross claims which the arbitrator deems necessary or proper to ensure the just,expeditious,economical and final determination of all matters in dispute.the authority to make a final determination of all matters in dispute includes alter ego issues which were directly posited in the first amended complaint.having agreed to arbitrate under the alliance arbitration rules with its broad grant of arbitrable power,defendants can not now claim the arbitrator erred in his making his alter ego findings.hotels nevada,llc pacific center,th.moreover,their alter ego analysis has no merit because defendants submitted to the alliance international arbitration rules which vested the arbitrator with extensive powers.greenspan ladt,llc th,judicial arbitration and mediation service rule granting arbitrator authority to decide arbitrability issue enforced dream theater,dream theater th,american arbitration association rules grant of power to arbitrator to decide arbitrability issues enforced.further,the arbitration clause did not restrict the arbitrator from deciding alter ego issues.hotels nevada,llc pacific center,supra,th at.and any doubt concerning arbitrability must be resolved in favor of arbitration.pacificcare health systems,book,fn.at t technologies,communication workers of america.
defendants argue though that an arbitrator may never decide alter ego issues.defendants rely on retail clerks union bloom sons d,retail clerks,supra.in that case,the plaintiff was a union which had entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the defendant,bloom sons.bloom sons operated three shoe stores in santa clara county.bloom sons opened a fourth store in valley fair,which,at that time,was in an unincorporated area in santa clara county.id.at.the fourth store operated as a separate corporation,bloom salinas,id.at.bloom sons refused to apply the terms of the collective bargaining agreement to the employees at the new store operated by bloom salinas,id.at.
the plaintiff filed a petition to compel arbitration where the arbitrator would decide whether the collective bargaining agreement terms would apply to the new store operated by bloom salinas,retail clerks,supra,d at.the defendant filed an affidavit in response to the petition to compel arbitration.defendant,bloom sons,denied the existence of any relationship with bloom salinas.the plaintiff argued the new store operated by bloom salinas,was the alter ego of bloom sons.the trial court ruled that any alter ego issue was to be decided in the judicial forum.the trial court then dismissed the case because bloom salinas,which was never served with the petition,was an indispensible party.id.at.
the court of appeal affirmed the arbitration petition dismissal based on the absence of an indispensible party.the court of appeal noted it was conceded that bloom sons and bloom salinas,were separately incorporated.retail clerks,supra,d at.further,the court of appeal expressly stated bloom salinas,is not a party to the contract.it did not consent to have this issue decided by an arbitrator rather than by a court of competent jurisdiction.ibid.the court of appeal,held in language relied upon by defendants in our case plaintiff maintains that bloom salinas,is but the alter ego of bloom sons,that it has no identity apart from bloom sons,and that therefore the contract of bloom sons is,in reality,also the contract of bloom salinas,plaintiff begs the question.it must first be determined whether bloom salinas,is in fact but the alter ego of bloom sons.a corporation separate identity will be disregarded only when,and to the extent that,it is necessary so to do in order to prevent fraud or injustice.citations.the proper forum for that determination is,of course,a court of law.ibid.
the present case is entirely different from retail clerks,supra,d at pages.to begin with,defendants all agreed to arbitrate the claims contained in the first amended complaint,with its alter ego allegations,under the alliance international arbitration rules.as noted,alliance rule vests the arbitrator with the power to decide all issues.defendants all filed or joined in petitions to compel arbitration.finally,numerous california decisions hold that,depending on the circumstances,an arbitrator can decide alter ego issues.hotels nevada,llc pacific center,supra,th at greenspan ladt,llc,supra,th at suh superior court th,rowe exline th.defendants argument that an arbitrator can never decide alter ego issues based on retail clerks,supra,d at page is without merit.
defendants also rely on carpenters ca conference bd.zcon builders cir,carpenters,supra.in that case,an alleged corporate alter ego,sharon hill,was not present at a hearing to compel arbitration.a codefendant,zcon builders,was subject to an arbitration agreement with a union.the alleged corporate alter ego,sharon hill,was not a signatory to the arbitration agreement.at issue was whether the corporation,sharon hill,agreed to have the arbitrator decide the alter ego issue.id.at.the court of appeals found there was no evidence the alleged corporate alter ego,sharon hill,ever agreed to submit the alter ego issue to the arbitrator.id at.thus,the arbitrator did not have the power to decide the alter ego issue.ibid.
but the ninth circuit panel in carpenters distinguished that case from a prior decision with a scenario closely resembling the present case.in carpenters,the court of appeals explained in george day const.united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners,local,cir,we held that consent to grant the arbitrator such authority may be implied from the conduct of the parties in the arbitration setting.the rationale behind our holding was that a claimant may not voluntarily submit his claim to arbitration,await the outcome,and,if the decision is unfavorable,then challenge the authority of the arbitrator to act.george day,at citing ficek southern pacific,cir.carpenters,supra,at.as can be noted,carpenters,supra,at pages has no relationship to the facts in this case.here,defendants actively sought to arbitrate under broadly stated alliance rules and an international arbitration statute,section.

discovery orders 
defendants argue that the arbitrator did not have the authority to order the deposition of howsam in canada.this contention has no merit.rule of the alliance international arbitration rules states except as provided herein,no formal discovery procedures shall be permitted under these rules except that the parties may by mutual agreement or on order of the arbitrator a exchange lists of anticipated witnesses summaries of the testimony anticipated to be elicited from each of its witnesses b exchange documents or other evidence to be introduced at the hearing c submit prehearing briefs,or any or all of the above.additionally,in the interest of justice,the arbitrator may permit formal depositions or other appropriate discovery of information,but such procedures shall not be permitted to delay the orderly and speedy processes of the arbitration.the assignment notices explicitly state they are governed by california law.defendants themselves sought to take three depositions and engaged in the use of other discovery devices.thus,the arbitrator had the power to order howsam be deposed.and defendants took the position that howsam must be deposed in canada rather than los angeles.california law determined the scope of depositions not canadian law.societe nat.aero.dist.court,american home assurance societe commerciale toutelectric th.the arbitrator had the power to order howsam be deposed at the place he demanded the deposition occur.

failure to decide all issues 
defendants assert the arbitrator failed to decide all of the issues submitted to him.defendants argue there was an undue delay in pursuing the arbitration.that issue could have been presented to the arbitrator during the arbitration hearing.but defendants withdrew from the arbitration.because they withdrew,they have forfeited the right to assert this as a ground for vacatur.moncharsh heily blaise,supra,cal th at mossman city of oakdale,supra,th at reed mutual service,supra,th at paramount unified school dist.teachers of paramount th.
g.howsam contention his self incrimination rights were substantially prejudiced because his stay requests were denied 
howsam argues his rights were substantially prejudiced because his multiple stay requests were denied.as noted,on november,howsam was indicted by a federal grand jury on fraud related charges.howsam and greenlight film television moved to stay all arbitration proceedings.the parties stipulated to a series of stays.on april,the indictment naming howsam was dismissed without prejudice.on may,plaintiff indicated to the alliance a desire to proceed with the arbitration.on november,judge wright conducted a hearing on the issue of releasing a video recording of the november,restaurant meeting between goldstein and howsam.in preparation for that hearing,an assistant united states attorney,in a memorandum dated september,indicated the government had no present intention of prosecuting howsam.
on november,the arbitrator ordered howsam submit to a deposition.on february,plaintiff noticed the deposition of howsam.on march,howsam objected to the deposition notice defendants object to the noticing of these depositions as they intentionally violate canadian law as it applies to these canadian parties.see the canada evidence act revised statues of canada,e and section of the evidence act of ontario.defendants further objected to howsam deposition because sections and do not apply to international depositions the dates were unilaterally selected by plaintiff and were inconvenient to defense counsel it should not be videotaped and it was burdensome and oppressive for the deposition to exceed one day.as noted,howsam never appeared at his deposition and all defendants withdrew from the arbitration.
on appeal,howsam argues a stay request should have been granted.howsam argues he was still subject to potential criminal liability notwithstanding the dismissal of his indictment.this,he argues,required the trial court vacate the award.plaintiff argues that after the indictment was dismissed,no stay request based the fifth amendment rights or canadian law was presented to the arbitrator.we agree with plaintiff.
as noted,in order to preserve an issue when seeking vacatur,the issue must be presented to the arbitrator.moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at mossman city of oakdale,supra,th at reed mutual service,supra,th at paramount unified school dist.teachers of paramount,supra,cal.app th at.after the indictment was dismissed,defendants presented multiple stay requests to the arbitrator.but they never sought a stay before the arbitrator based on the fifth amendment or canadian law.no doubt,defendants objected,based on canadian law,to howsam deposition being taken.but they never sought a stay from the arbitrator based on the fifth amendment or canadian law.further,on december,howsam and greenlight film television filed a motion in the trial court seeking a stay of the arbitration based on howsam fifth amendment privilege.but that motion,based solely on the fifth amendment privilege,was filed in the trial court not before the arbitrator.thus,any issue concerning a stay of the arbitration based on howsam rights may not serve as a basis for vacatur.
statement of decision 
defendants argue the trial court should have issued a statement of decision as required by section.but we agree with plaintiff the shotgun like interrogatories directed at the trial court were insufficient to trigger the duty to prepare a statement of decision.in re marriage of falcone fyke th,people casa blanca convalescent homes,th,see yield dynamics,tea systems th,we do not suppose perfection can fairly be required in the framing of a request for a statement of decision,but neither do we suppose that a trial judge can be required to sift through a host of improper specifications in search of the few arguably proper ones.wegner et,cal.practice guide civil trials and evidence the rutter group,et the request may ask for the basis for the judge decision.but it may not interrogate the judge on evidentiary matters.under these circumstances,the trial court was not obligated to issue a statement of decision.
