plaintiffs smiley,amber blow,and kelsey turner appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees dupont de nemours company and adecco usa,collectively,dupont on their claims under the fair labor standards act flsa,et and pennsylvania wage payment and collection law wpcl,et.plaintiffs filed a putative collective action and class action against dupont,seeking overtime compensation for time they spent donning and doffing their uniforms and protective gear and performing shift relief before and after their shifts.dupont contended that it could offset compensation it gave plaintiffs for meal breaks during their shift for which dupont was not required to provide compensation under the flsa against such required overtime.
the district court agreed with dupont.we conclude that the flsa and applicable regulations,as well as our precedent in wheeler hampton,cir,compel the opposite result and will therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
appellants worked shifts at dupont manufacturing plant in towanda,pennsylvania in addition to working their shifts,plaintiffs had to be before and after their shifts to don and doff uniforms and protective gear.dupont also required them to participate in shift relief,which involved employees from the outgoing shift sharing information about the status of work with incoming shift employees.the time spent donning,doffing,and providing shift relief varied,but ranged from approximately thirty to sixty minutes a day.
dupont chose to compensate plaintiffs for meal breaks despite no flsa requirement to do so during their shifts.the employee handbook set forth dupont company policy for compensating meal breaks,stating that e mployees working in areas requiring hour per day staffing and who are required to make shift relief will be paid for their lunch time as part of their scheduled work shift.employees who worked,schedules,as did plaintiffs in this case,were entitled to one thirty minute paid lunch break per shift,in addition to two thirty minute breaks.the paid break time always exceeded the amount of time plaintiffs spent donning and doffing and providing shift relief.
dupont treated the compensation for meal breaks similarly to other types of compensation given to employees.it included the compensation given for paid meal breaks when it calculated employees regular rate of pay,and meal break time was included in employees paystubs as part of their total hours worked each week.
plaintiffs brought this putative collective action and class action against dupont,claiming that dupont violated the flsa and wpcl by requiring plaintiffs to work before and after their shifts without paying them overtime,time and,compensation.plaintiffs sought to recover overtime compensation for time spent donning and doffing their uniforms and protective gear and performing shift relief.dupont argued that their claims fail because it could offset the paid breaks dupont voluntarily provided plaintiffs against the unpaid donning and doffing and time.plaintiffs filed a motion to conditionally certify a flsa collective action,which the district court granted.plaintiffs counsel sent a notice of the flsa class to the prospective class members,and more than workers opted in.following the close of discovery,dupont filed its motion for summary judgment.
the district court granted dupont motion for summary judgment,holding that the flsa allowed dupont to use paid time to offset the required overtime and dismissing the lawsuit entirely the district court held that plaintiffs were not owed any additional compensation because the amount of paid time exceeded unpaid work time.although it recognized that t he flsa does not expressly grant employers permission to use paid time to offset unpaid work time,app,the district court nonetheless concluded offset was not specifically prohibited and therefore granted summary judgment in favor of dupont.
prior to oral argument,we invited the department of labor dol to file an amicus brief to assist us in understanding the intricacies of the important flsa issue presented by this case.at our request,the dol and dupont each filed letter briefs further addressing how we should analyze the issue of offsetting paid time against unpaid time worked under the flsa.we are to give deference to the dol position and guidelines under skidmore swift.see madison res.for human,cir.i nformal agency interpretations in opinion letters and similar documents are entitled to respect under skidmore swift but only to the extent they have the power to persuade.internal footnote omitted.under skidmore,t he weight of an agency judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.skidmore,at.

to provide context for the ultimate issue before us,we begin by reviewing the contours of the flsa and the circumstances in which an employer may offset compensation already given to an employee against required overtime.
overtime and calculating regular rate under the flsa 
we have noted that the flsa has a broad remedial purpose.de asencio tyson foods,cir.the central aim of the act was to achieve certain minimum labor standards.mitchell robert demario jewelry.the act established baseline standards through federal,and overtime guarantees that can not be modified by contract.genesis healthcare symczyk.
among the bedrock principles of the flsa is the requirement that employers pay employees for all hours worked.under the act an employee must be compensated for all hours worked.see also ballaris wacker siltronic,cir.one of the principal purposes of the flsa is to ensure that employees are provided appropriate compensation for all hours worked.emphasis in original.pursuant to the flsa,employers can not employ any employee for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment at a rate not less than one and times the regular rate at which he is employed.a.in other words,employers are required to compensate employees for time in excess of forty hours with overtime compensation,which is paid at a rate of one and times the employee regular rate of pay.
the regular rate at which an employee is paid for straight time or the first forty hours of work in a week is integral to the issue of overtime payment under the flsa.the regular rate is determined by way of a calculation.it is a rate per hour that is determined by dividing the total remuneration for employment except statutory exclusions in any workweek by the total number of hours actually worked by him in that workweek for which such compensation was paid.thus,the regular rate is a readily definable mathematical calculation that is explicitly controlled by the flsa.walling hardwood,once the parties have decided upon the amount of wages and the mode of payment the determination of the regular rate becomes a matter of mathematical computation,the result of which is unaffected by any designation of a contrary regular rate in the wage contracts.as the supreme court has explained,the regular rate is not an arbitrary label chosen by the parties it is an actual fact,that by its very nature must reflect all payments which the parties have agreed shall be received regularly during the workweek,exclusive of overtime payments.id.at citing bay ridge operating aaron,and walling,at.there are two components to the calculation the dividend,which includes total remuneration minus statutory exclusions and the divisor,which includes all hours worked.see.
the flsa characterizes the compensation that must be included in the dividend of the regular rate calculation broadly.it include s all remuneration for employment paid to,or on behalf of,the employee except the exclusions that are listed in section e.e emphasis added.further,o nly the statutory exclusions are authorized a ll remuneration for employment paid which does not fall within one of these seven exclusionary clauses must be added into the total compensation received by the employee before his regular hourly rate of pay is to be determined.c emphasis added.we have recognized that there are several exceptions to the otherwise rule set forth in section e,but the statutory exclusions are narrowly construed,and the employer bears the burden of establishing that an exemption applies.minizza stone container.corrugated container div.plant,cir.internal citations omitted.thus,although a handful of types of compensation are statutorily excluded from the definition of all remuneration,all other compensation is included in the regular rate.
the divisor in the regular rate calculation is comprised of all hours worked.hours worked includes all hours worked under an employee contract express or implied or under any applicable statute.in general,hours worked includes time when an employee is required to be on duty,but it is not limited to active productive labor and may include circumstances that are not productive work time.see.employers have a measure of flexibility in determining whether otherwise work time will be considered hours worked under the flsa.for instance,meal periods while not necessarily productive work time may nevertheless be considered hours worked under the act.id.some of the hours spent by employees in meal periods are regarded as working time and some are not.to the extent that those hours are regarded as working time,payment made as compensation for these hours obviously can not be characterized as payments not for hours worked.the decision to treat otherwise work time as hours worked is fact dependent.relevant here,the regulations provide that p reliminary and postliminary activities and time spent in eating meals between working hours fall into this category of work that an employer may compensate his employees for even though he is not obligated to do so under the flsa.the agreement of the parties to provide compensation for such hours may or may not convert them into hours worked,depending on whether or not it appears from all the pertinent facts that the parties have agreed to treat such time as hours worked.
thus,if the time at issue is considered hours worked under the act,the corresponding compensation is included in the regular rate of pay.whether or not the time is considered hours worked under the act,however,if the time is regarded by the parties as working time,the payment is nevertheless included in the regular rate of pay unless it qualifies for exclusion from the regular rate as one of a type of payments made for occasional periods when no work is performed due to failure of the employer to provide sufficient work,or other similar cause as discussed in or is excludable on some other basis under section e.id.
permissible offsetting under the flsa 
the flsa explicitly states when an employer may use certain compensation already given to an employee as a credit against its overtime liability owed to that employee under the act.offsetting with compensation against incurred overtime is discussed in section h,which states 
except as provided in paragraph,sums excluded from the regular rate pursuant to subsection e shall not be creditable toward wages required under section or overtime compensation required under this section.
extra compensation paid as described in paragraphs,and of subsection e of this section shall be creditable toward overtime compensation payable pursuant to this section.
h emphasis added.as noted above,subsection e sets forth the exclusions from the regular rate.thus,the flsa explicitly permits offsetting against overtime only with certain compensation that is statutorily excluded from the regular rate,that is,only three categories of compensation,which are extra compensation provided by a premium rate.id.e.unlike the compensation addressed by the other exclusions,the three categories of excludable compensation that qualify for the offsetting provision at section h are paid at a premium rate.accordingly,we have previously characterized these three categories listed in section e as credit s for premium pay and limited permissible employer offsets to only those premium payments.see wheeler hampton,cir.the regulations also support limiting employers ability to offset overtime liability.only extra compensation that falls within sections e,and may be creditable n o other types of remuneration for employment may be so credited.see c.
nothing in the flsa authorizes the type of offsetting dupont advances here,where an employer seeks to credit compensation that it included in calculating an employee regular rate of pay against its overtime liability.rather,the statute only provides for an offset of an employer overtime liability using other compensation excluded from the regular rate pursuant to sections e and paid to an employee at a premium rate.
in wheeler,as here,the employer,hampton township,had voluntarily included pay which did not need to be included in the regular rate under the act in the regular rate calculation.it sought to offset compensation it was required to include in the regular rate,but did not,with compensation it voluntarily chose to include in the regular rate.wheeler,at.we held that this was not permitted.we could not find any textual reason to credit the township for including such pay in its regular rate.id.at.we explained that while e protects the township from having to include pay in the regular rate,it does not authorize the township now to require such augments to be stripped out,or to take a credit for including such augments.id.in essence,at the point at which compensation is included in the regular rate regardless of whether the act required it be included,an employer may not use that compensation to offset other compensation owed under the act.we determined that w here a credit is allowed,the statute says so.id.at.the township was not entitled to a credit under the explicit offset contemplated by section h,so we concluded that the flsa did not permit the offset.id.the township seeks a credit for allegedly including pay presumably at a rate in the cba basic annual salary.the flsa does not provide for such an offset.
we based our conclusion that offsetting was limited to the type addressed by section h on our recognition that section h offsetting pertained only to extra compensation,which is distinct from regular straight time pay.wheeler,at.indeed,such extra compensation is a kind of overtime compensation,and thus need not be added to the regular rate.likewise,such compensation may be credited against the act required overtime pay.id.courts have widely recognized that an employer may offset its overtime liability with accumulated premium pay given to employees under sections e.see,singer city of waco,cir.kohlheim glynn cty,cir.the offset created by section h is logical because it authorizes employers to apply one type of premium pay to offset another,both of which are excluded from the regular rate see e.it is undisputed that the compensation paid for meal breaks was included in plaintiffs regular rate of pay,and thus could not qualify as extra compensation.accordingly,dupont may not avail itself of the offset provisions explicitly allowed by h.
dupont argues that the flsa failure to expressly prohibit offsetting where the compensation used to offset is included in the regular rate indicates that offsetting is allowed.we disagree with dupont notion that the flsa silence indicates permission.while it is true that the statute does not explicitly set forth this prohibition,the policy rationales underlying the flsa do not permit crediting compensation used in calculating an employee regular rate of pay because it would allow employers to the compensation.the dol convincingly urges this viewpoint.it observes that t her
