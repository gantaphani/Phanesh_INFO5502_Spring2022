introduction 
we are well acquainted with this case,having addressed it several years ago in london market insurers superior court th,lmi.there,we considered whether thousands of asbestos bodily injury claims brought against respondent kaiser cement and gypsum corporation kaiser constituted a single annual occurrence within the meaning of comprehensive general liability cgl policies issued by respondent truck insurance exchange truck.we concluded that they did not because under the relevant truck policies occurrence meant injurious exposure to asbestos,the thousands of claims against kaiser could not be deemed a single annual occurrence.
the present appeal concerns a separate but related coverage issue,which arises in part out of the supreme court seminal decision in montrose chemical admiral ins.cal th montrose.in montrose,the court adopted a continuous injury trigger of coverage approach to continuing injury claims.under that approach,bodily injuries and property damage that occur in several insurance policy periods are potentially covered by all policies in effect during those periods.id.at.montrose provides no guidance,however,as to how to apportion liability among insurers in continuing injury cases.
that question of apportioning liability for continuing injuries is raised squarely by the present case.between and,kaiser purchased primary insurance policies from four different insurers,including truck.during many of the same years,kaiser also purchased excess insurance policies.for purposes of this litigation,kaiser has selected the truck cgl policy in effect in the primary policy,which has a per occurrence limit and no annual liability limit,to respond initially to all claims that allege asbestos exposure in that year.at issue here is who is responsible to indemnify kaiser for asbestos claims that exceed the primary policy per occurrence limit.kaiser and truck contend that appellant insurance company of the state of pennsylvania icsop,which issued a excess policy to kaiser for the excess policy,is responsible to pay claims over icsop disagrees it contends that primary insurance limits must be stacked,such that all available primary insurance policies that is,all truck policies issued to kaiser between and,as well as primary policies issued to kaiser by three other carriers between and are exhausted before any excess insurer need indemnify kaiser for asbestos bodily injury claims.
on june,we issued an opinion in which we concluded that under the language of the primary policy and principles of california law,truck maximum exposure for asbestos bodily injury claims was per occurrence.we thus agreed with the trial court that,based on the policy language,once truck contributed per occurrence,its obligation to kaiser ceased.we did not affirm the trial court grant of summary adjudication,however,because there was no evidence in the record as to whether the policies issued to kaiser by primary insurers other than truck had been fully exhausted.we therefore could not determine whether icsop had a present duty to indemnify kaiser.kaiser cement gypsum insurance of state of pennsylvania th,review granted.
the california supreme court granted review on august.on october,the supreme court transferred the matter to this court with directions to vacate our decision and to reconsider it in light of state of california continental ins.cal th continental.having done so,we again conclude that the policies truck issued to kaiser can not be stacked,and we remand to the trial court to determine whether kaiser therefore is entitled to summary adjudication of the fifth and sixth causes of action of the.
statement of facts and of the case 
i.the underlying asbestos litigation 
kaiser manufactured a variety of products,including joint compounds,finishing compounds,fiberboard,and plastic cements,from through the.kaiser manufactured these products at different facilities at various times.lmi,supra,th at.
truck provided primary insurance to kaiser from to,through four cgl policies covering annual policy periods as relevant here,the policy in effect from january,through march,contained a per occurrence liability limit and,in policy years and,a deductible for each occurrence.until april,the policy did not contain an annual aggregate limit.
kaiser apparently was also insured by three other primary carriers between and fireman fund insurance company fireman fund from through home indemnity company home indemnity from through and national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh national union from through.in,truck and kaiser entered into agreements with fireman fund,home indemnity,and national union to share defense and indemnity costs until the aggregate limits of each primary policy were exhausted.according to truck,by april,all three primary carriers had given notice that their aggregate limits were exhausted thus,after april,truck was the only primary carrier continuing to pay defense and indemnity costs for asbestos bodily injury claims.
icsop issued a first layer excess policy to kaiser from january,through january.that policy provided that icsop would indemnify kaiser for its ultimate net loss in excess of its retained limit,up to the policy limit of per occurrence.other insurers,including amici curiae certain underwriters at lloyd,london,and certain london market insurance companies,issued excess insurance policies to kaiser in other years.
by,more than claimants had filed products liability suits against kaiser alleging that they had suffered bodily injury,including asbestosis and various cancers,as a result of their exposure to kaiser asbestos products.kaiser tendered these claims to truck.by october,truck indemnity payments for asbestos bodily injury claims exceeded million and included at least claims that resulted in payments in excess of.ibid.
ii.the present coverage action 
truck filed the present action against kaiser on april,seeking a declaration that its primary policies had been exhausted and it had no further obligation to defend or indemnify kaiser for asbestos bodily injury claims.it filed a second amended complaint in august,adding causes of action for equitable subrogation and contribution against kaiser excess insurers.
kaiser against its excess insurers,including icsop,seeking a declaration that the excess insurers were obligated to defend and indemnify kaiser for asbestos bodily injury claims once primary coverage was exhausted.as relevant to this appeal,the fifth and sixth causes of action in the operative third amended consolidated allege as follows 
fifth cause of action 
declaratory relief against all cross defendants 
a controversy and dispute currently exists between kaiser,truck and the excess insurers with kaiser and truck contending,and the excess insurers failing to acknowledge that the excess insurers are currently obligated under the excess policies to defend and to make liability payments in response to abic asbestos bodily injury claims asserted against kaiser or to indemnify kaiser for the costs of defending and making liability payments in response to abic asserted against kaiser.
truck has alleged in its second amended complaint that truck has exhausted its policies by paying the full applicable limits of its insurance in response to abic and that truck owes no further duties and obligations to kaiser pursuant to its policies with respect to such abic.additionally,those primary insurers with policy periods before and after truck policy periods have also exhausted their policies with respect to abic.
where,as here,kaiser has excess insurance coverage extending through multiple consecutive policy periods and where,as here,insurance coverage in multiple consecutive policy periods covers kaiser liabilities arising out of the occurrence or accident that resulted in the abic asserted against kaiser,kaiser is entitled to the protection of the full limits of such policies to the extent necessary to fully indemnify kaiser.with respect to each individual abic,kaiser is entitled to select,among the triggered policies,the policy or policies to pay the loss.each excess insurer with an excess policy immediately in excess of kaiser primary policies for any given policy period is obligated to provide coverage upon the exhaustion of the primary policy for that policy period.the remaining excess insurers are obligated to provide coverage upon the exhaustion of each applicable underlying excess policy.
sixth cause of action 
breach of contract against cross defendant icsop 
o nce the truck policy incepting january,responds to an individual abic by paying its occurrence limit of,icsop is obligated under its excess policy incepting january,to indemnify kaiser for the ultimate net loss in excess of for such claim up to per occurrence.
by correspondence dated july and july,kaiser confidentially notified the excess insurers,including icsop,of the existence of a number of claims that have been settled in excess of truck per occurrence limit of,and the amount paid to settle each such claim.
icsop has breached the terms of its first layer excess policy incepting january,policy by failing to pay to kaiser all amounts that kaiser has been forced to incur to make settlement payments for abic that exceed the truck per occurrence coverage limits for the primary policy incepting january.kaiser has complied with all conditions precedent to obtain icsop performance under its excess policy,or such performance has been excused.
as a direct and proximate result of icsop breach of its excess policy,kaiser has been damaged in an amount which can not be fully ascertained at this time,but which currently totals in excess of million,and in an amount to be proven at trial.
iii.truck motion for summary adjudication 
in october,truck moved for summary adjudication,seeking a declaration that its policies had been exhausted and it had no further duty to defend or indemnify kaiser.according to truck,under the plain language of its policies,all claims in any given year arose out of a single annual occurrence because all had the same underlying cause the design,manufacture and distribution by kaiser and its subsidiaries of products.truck contended,therefore,that its total liability for asbestos bodily injury claims for all policy years was million and its policies were exhausted as of january.lmi,supra,th at.
the trial court initially denied the summary adjudication motion.several months later,however,on its own motion the court ordered reconsideration and supplemental briefing.it then granted summary adjudication for truck,finding that truck and kaiser reasonably intended to treat all asbestos bodily injury claims as a single annual occurrence under the policies.lmi,supra,th at.
we reversed.we concluded that the plain language of the policies was not susceptible of the conclusion that kaiser design,manufacture,and distribution of asbestos products was an occurrence.lmi,supra,th at.rather,the relevant occurrence was injurious exposure to asbestos products.thus,we held that the trial court erred in granting summary adjudication for truck.
iv.truck motion for determination of threshold coverage issues 
following our ruling,truck moved for a determination of the number of occurrences at issue in the underlying asbestos bodily injury claims.specifically,truck asked the trial court to find that with regard to the one lot claims in truck policies from to,all claims arising from exposures to products produced at the same kaiser manufacturing facility could be aggregated and deemed a single occurrence and with regard to the same general conditions claims in truck policies from to,all claims arising from exposures to products produced at the same kaiser manufacturing facility could be deemed a single occurrence,or,alternatively,all claims resulting from the same corporate decision to place asbestos into products,or from multiple corporate decisions made at the same location,could be deemed a single occurrence.truck stipulated that if the court denied all of the legal rulings it sought,then each asbestos bodily injury claim should be treated as a separate occurrence.
in a january,order,the court noted that truck had stipulated to a number of key facts,including that there was no evidence proffered in support of any asbestos bodily injury claim that connected any claimant alleged injurious asbestos exposure to any particular asbestos purchase,manufacture,or sale.claims,therefore,could not be aggregated by product line or manufacturing plant.the court concluded that for purposes of further proceedings in the case,the claim of each asbestos bodily injury claimant shall be deemed to have been caused by a separate and distinct occurrence within the meaning of the truck policies.italics added.
june,coverage ruling 
following the january ruling,pursuant to fmc plaisted companies th fmc,disapproved of in continental,supra,cal th at page,kaiser selected truck primary policy which had a per occurrence liability limit,a per occurrence deductible,and no aggregate limits to respond to each of the claims alleging injury during that year kaiser then sought an order declaring that,if an asbestos bodily injury claim alleged against kaiser triggers the primary policy of comprehensive general liability insurance issued by plaintiff truck insurance exchange truck for the year,and kaiser selects that policy year to respond,then the umbrella policy issued by cross defendant icsop incepting january,and,if necessary,any excess policies directly above it become liable for that claim once truck has paid and exhausted its limit for that year,and kaiser has paid its deductible for that year.kaiser asserted that california law was unclear as to whether,in the case of an occurrence that triggers multiple successive primary policies,the policyholder is entitled to primary coverage of as much as the combined per occurrence limits of all the triggered policies,stacking of policy limits,or no more than the per occurrence limit of one such policy kaiser urged that the better view is that stacking is not appropriate.consequently,if a claim triggers multiple primary policies,including the truck policy,then once kaiser has exhausted the limits of the policy year,kaiser will have fully exhausted all primary coverage available for that claim.alternatively,kaiser urged that if the court rejected an rule,the excess policy should not be construed to require horizontal exhaustion of all primary policies before triggering icsop policy.rather,the icsop umbrella policy should be construed,in accordance with its express terms,to require only the exhaustion of a single primary policy limit listed in its schedule of underlying insurances namely,the single truck limit of available to kaiser for the truck policy period.
truck agreed with most of the positions kaiser articulated.as relevant here,it agreed that primary occurrence limits should not be stacked because stacking is contrary to truck policy language,contrary to california law,contrary to the law of the majority of jurisdictions that have addressed this issue,including many cases in the asbestos context,and as kaiser properly argues,contrary to the reasonable expectations of the insured.
icsop opposed kaiser motion in its entirety.it urged that under principles of horizontal exhaustion,an excess insurer could not be required to indemnify an insured before the liability limits of all primary insurance policies were exhausted.icsop did not discuss truck policy language,but assumed that many of truck policies were not yet exhausted.accordingly,it urged,kaiser proposed tender of any claims in excess of truck primary policy limit to the icsop policy should be denied until such time as there is full exhaustion of all applicable underlying primary coverage.
the court granted kaiser motion on june.it found that under the clear and unambiguous language of the primary policy,truck was liable for only one per occurrence limit on each claim.if it were to rule as icsop urged it to that is,to find that primary coverage for each insured year could be stacked then truck would be required to pay multiple occurrence limits on each claim because it issued policies in multiple years the language of the policy at issue does not permit such a result.after reviewing several relevant decisions,the court concluded t he issue comes down to the language of the truck primary policy and the risk s truck agreed to defend when read in conjunction with the icsop excess policy r ecognizing the following undisputed facts kaiser selected the policy year for coverage of abic claims which arose during that year the truck primary policy specifically spelled out a per occurrence limit and contained no aggregate limit for and this court january,determination that an occurrence is defined as an individual abic it is clear that icsop excess coverage would drop down once the primary limit is exhausted for individual abic since,aside from the limit in the truck primary policy,there is no other underlying insurance collectible by the insured or valid and collectible insurance with any other insurer under the icsop excess policy,once the limit is exhausted.
icsop and two other excess insurers filed a petition for writ of mandate and request for immediate stay on july.we summarily denied the petition on october.
vi.kaiser motion for summary judgment 
on july,kaiser moved for an order summarily adjudicating that there was no defense to its against icsop and that final judgment in the action as between kaiser and icsop should be entered.specifically,kaiser sought adjudication of the following two issues 
issue there is no defense to the fifth cause of action declaratory relief against cross defendant icsop in kaiser corrected third amended cross complaint because kaiser has selected the policy year to apply to all of those asbestos bodily injury claims abic alleged against it that exceed in settlement or judgment truck has paid its policy year limit of for such abic,subject to a deductible payable by kaiser and kaiser is entitled to a judicial declaration that icsop policy is responsible to pay for all amounts paid for abic over the truck policy year limit of.internal record reference omitted.
issue there is no defense to the sixth cause of action breach of contract against cross defendant icsop in kaiser corrected third amended cross complaint because kaiser has selected the policy year to apply to all of those asbestos bodily injury claims abic alleged against it that exceed in settlement or judgment truck has paid its policy year limit of for such abic,subject to a deductible payable by kaiser and icsop policy is responsible to pay for all amounts paid for abic over the truck policy year limit of,an amount which is confidential but known to all parties,including icsop.internal record reference omitted.
in support of its motion,kaiser largely repeated the arguments it had advanced in support of its june coverage motion.icsop and truck responses,too,largely tracked their responses to the june motion 
the court granted the motion.it noted that truck primary policy stated that the per occurrence limit is the limit of the company liability for each occurrence.thus,it found an apparent conflict between the language in truck primary policy and the rule articulated in community redevelopment agency aetna casualty surety th community redevelopment,requiring horizontal exhaustion of all primary policies in effect on a risk stretched out over multiple policy periods before any excess insurance obligations arise.the court resolved this conflict by again looking to the language of the truck primary policy,the risk s truck agreed to indemnify,and the excess language in the icsop policy.it noted that the language of the primary policy indicated that truck agreed to insure risks on a per occurrence basis for the policy year,with a limit and no annual aggregate limit.thus,since kaiser selected the policy year for coverage of abic claims which partially arose during that year the truck primary policy specifically spelled out a per occurrence limit and contained no aggregate limit for and this court determination that an occurrence is defined as an individual abic,icsop excess coverage would drop down under its policy once the primary limit is exhausted for individual abic since,aside from the limit in the truck primary policy,there is no other underlying insurance collectible by the insured or valid and collectible insurance with any other insurer under the icsop excess policy,once the limit is exhausted.
the court concluded the motion for summary judgment is granted as to both issues.with respect to issue,the court determines there is no defense to the fifth cause of action declaratory relief against cross defendant icsop in kaiser corrected third amended cross complaint because kaiser has selected the policy year to apply to all of those asbestos bodily injury claims abic alleged against it that exceed in settlement or judgment truck has paid its policy year limit of for such abic,subject to a deductible payable by kaiser and kaiser is entitled to a judicial declaration that icsop policy is responsible to pay for all amounts paid for abic over the truck policy year limit of.with respect to issue,the court finds there is no defense to the sixth cause of action breach of contract against cross defendant icsop in kaiser corrected third amended cross complaint because kaiser has selected the policy year to apply to all of those asbestos bodily injury claims abic alleged against it that exceed in settlement or judgment truck has paid its policy year limit of for such abic,subject to a deductible payable by kaiser and icsop policy is responsible to pay for all amounts paid for abic over the truck policy year limit of,an amount which is confidential but known to all parties,including icsop.
a ll of kaiser claims against icsop having been entirely adjudicated by the summary adjudication motion,the court entered judgment for kaiser and against icsop on kaiser.icsop timely appealed.
standard of review 
the standard of review of a trial court decision to grant summary adjudication is well established.a motion for summary adjudication shall be granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of action,an affirmative defense,a claim for damages,or an issue of duty.code civ,subd.f.the moving party bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact if he carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th.we independently review an order granting summary adjudication.snatchko westfield llc th.
contentions of the parties 
icsop contends that the issue before us is whether its excess indemnity obligations are conditioned on exhaustion of all available primary insurance or simply exhaustion of the immediately underlying primary insurance policy issued by truck.as to this issue,icsop contends,the law is clear because the asbestos bodily injury claims potentially trigger up to annual truck policy periods,the policy limits for these separate policy periods must be stacked such that not only must the truck limit in the policy period be exhausted,but so must all of truck primary limits in its other eighteen annual policy periods.thus,icsop urges,the trial court erred in concluding that its indemnity obligations attach now,because while the primary policy has been exhausted as to many claims that exceed,primary policies for other years remain unexhausted.icsop contends that it has no indemnity obligations with regard to any asbestos bodily injury claims until the per occurrence limits of each of truck annual policies,which icsop suggests total million,have been exhausted.
kaiser disagrees.it notes that icsop indemnity obligation explicitly is conditioned on exhaustion of the primary insurance indicated on the schedule of underlying policies plus the applicable limit s of any other underlying insurance collectible by the insured.underlying insurance,kaiser contends,means insurance under the icsop policy primary policies providing coverage during the same period covered by the icsop policy.accordingly,kaiser urges that underlying insurance for purposes of icsop excess policy refers exclusively to the primary policy,and thus only the primary policy need be exhausted before icsop indemnity obligations are triggered.in the alternative,kaiser contends that under the plain language of the primary policy,occurrence limits can not be stacked.
truck urges a somewhat different approach.while it concurs that icsop excess indemnity obligation is conditioned on exhaustion of all available underlying primary insurance,it urges that the dispositive issue before us is whether a single primary occurrence limit per asbestos bodily injury claim constitutes the only available primary insurance,such that when one such limit is exhausted,the excess insurer must indemnify kaiser for any additional loss.as to that issue,truck contends that under the plain language of its policies,kaiser may collect up to the policy limits of only one policy for each occurrence.thus,truck urges that the trial court correctly found that kaiser may collect only once for each occurrence not once per occurrence per year,or once per occurrence per policy 
in part i of our discussion,we consider whether,under the terms of the excess policy,icsop indemnity obligation attaches as soon as the primary policy is exhausted,or only once all available primary policies have been exhausted.in part ii,we consider whether primary policies can be stacked such that kaiser can recover under more than one primary policy for the same claim.in part iii,we discuss whether,in light of our resolution of these issues,the trial court properly granted summary adjudication of kaiser against icsop.
discussion 
under the language of icsop excess policy,icsop indemnity obligation does not attach until all collectible primary policies have been exhausted 
icsop contends that under the plain language of its excess policy and the principle of horizontal exhaustion,it is not responsible to indemnify kaiser for losses until all primary policies have been exhausted.kaiser urges,to the contrary,that the excess policy is excess to only the primary policy,and thus icsop must indemnify it once the primary policy is exhausted.we conclude icsop is correct.
overview of legal principles 
there are two levels of insurance coverage primary and excess.primary insurance is coverage under which liability attach es to the loss immediately upon the happening of the occurrence.citation.liability under an excess policy attaches only after all primary coverage has been exhausted.citation.north river ins.american home assurance d.community redevelopment,supra,th at.
before coverage attaches under an excess or umbrella policy,the policy limits of the underlying primary policy or policies normally must be exhausted.citations.primary coverage is exhausted when the primary insurers pay their policy limits in settlement or to satisfy a judgment against the insured.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group rutter,insurance litigation.where several primary policies are in effect,the issue arises whether the policy limits of one or all of such policies must be exhausted or otherwise off the risk before excess coverage applies.the issue is uniquely complicated where,as in the present case,damages are spread over an extended period of time.
normal rules of policy interpretation apply in determining coverage under both primary and excess policies.rutter,insurance litigation.although insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.foster gardner,national union fire ins.cal th,bank of the west superior court cal th.thus,the mutual intention of the contracting parties at the time the contract was formed governs,foster gardner,supra,cal th at.we ascertain that intention solely from the written contract if possible,but also consider the circumstances under which the contract was made and the matter to which it relates,american alternative ins.superior court th.we consider the contract as a whole and interpret the language in context,rather than interpret a provision in isolation,american alternative ins,supra,th at.we interpret words in accordance with their ordinary and popular sense,unless the words are used in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage,american alternative ins,supra,th at.lmi,supra,th at.
although the primary policy may be consulted in interpreting an excess policy,each policy is a separate document and is interpreted separately.rutter,insurance litigation,at to northrop grumman factory mut.ins.cir,though the primary policy must be consulted in interpreting the excess policy,see cal,we decline to treat the two documents as only one contract.
policy language 
we begin with the language of icsop excess policy.it provides indemnity for kaiser ultimate net loss in excess of the retained limit hereinafter stated,up to,as the result of any one occurrence.ultimate net loss is the total sum which the insured,or any company as his insurer,or both,become obligated to pay by reason of personal injury or property damage either through adjudication or compromise.kaiser retained limit is an amount equal to the limits of liability indicated beside sic the schedule of underlying policies that is,primary comprehensive general liability insurance of combined single limit plus the applicable limit s of any other underlying insurance collectible by the insured.italics added.
icsop urges that under the policy,its liability is excess to all other collectible primary insurance whether for or any other year and we agree.as the provisions indicate,by its plain language the excess policy provides that kaiser retained limit is equal to the limits of liability indicated in the schedule of underlying policies,plus the applicable limit s of any other underlying insurance collectible by the insured.any is a broad term that means one or more without specification or identification or whatever or whichever it may be.random house webster college dict.accordingly,we believe that the policy reference to any other underlying insurance necessarily means whatever or whichever primary insurance is available to kaiser not,as kaiser suggests,only that primary insurance that expressly covers the policy year.
kaiser suggests that any other underlying insurance must mean the primary policy because underlying means l ying under or beneath something.according to kaiser,it would be natural to describe kaiser primary coverage for,and as lying under or beneath icsop policy for those years,but it would be awkward to describe kaiser primary coverage for,or,or as lying under or beneath the icsop policy covering the period from to.we do not agree.we believe that in the context of icsop excess policy,underlying insurance simply means primary insurance.in other words,we believe that the reference to underlying insurance clarifies the excess nature of the icsop policy,that the policy does not attach immediately upon a loss,but only after all available primary insurance has been exhausted.
kaiser also suggests that the term underlying is used in other ways in the icsop policy that can not mean other truck primary policies.specifically,it notes the following two provisions 
maintenance of underlying insurances it is a condition of this policy that the policy or policies referred to in the attached schedule of underlying insurances shall be maintained in full effect during the currency of this policy failure of the insured to comply with the foregoing shall not invalidate this policy but in the event of such failure,the company shall only be liable to the same extent as they would have been had the insured complied with the said condition.
underlying insurance it is understood and agreed that,in the event coverage is afforded by primary policies listed on the schedule of underlying insurances which is not otherwise afforded by this policy,the company agrees to follow all the terms and conditions of said primary policies or renewals or rewrites thereof.
as to these provisions,kaiser asserts that,t hese uses of the word underlying in the icsop policy show the parties mutual intent when they used the phrase other underlying insurance collectible by kaiser.without exception,all of these uses refer to insurance that covers the same period of time,in whole or in part,as the icsop policy.again,if icsop had intended other underlying insurance collectible by kaiser to mean primary policies existing at the time the icsop policy was issued in as icsop argues now,it could have eliminated any ambiguity by listing them.
kaiser argument proves too much.as used in these two provisions,underlying insurances appears to refer to only the primary insurance listed in the attached schedule of underlying insurances.but underlying insurances can not mean only scheduled insurance,because the policy defines retained limit as an amount equal to the limits of liability indicated in the attached schedule,plus the applicable limit s of any other underlying insurance collectible by the insured.italics added.thus,the retained limit definition,considered with the other two provisions highlighted by kaiser,makes clear that underlying insurance is not only scheduled insurance,but any other collectible primary insurance as well.
c.our analysis is consistent with prior appellate opinions 
our analysis of icsop policy is consistent with the analyses of other appellate courts that have interpreted similarly worded excess policies.in community redevelopment,supra,th,the court considered the indemnity obligations of primary and excess insurers in the context of a complex construction defect case.the insured was a developer who filled a redevelopment area on which it constructed residential housing developments.the fills and building pads were defectively designed and engineered,causing excessive subsidence and damage to the developments between and.id.at.between and,the developer had purchased primary insurance policies from united pacific insurance company and state farm fire and casualty insurance company,each worth million for policy year through,it had also purchased a million excess policy from scottsdale insurance company.the excess policy provided that scottsdale would be liable for the developer ultimate net loss in excess of its underlying limit,defined as an amount equal to the limits of liability indicated beside the underlying insurance listed in the schedule of underlying insurance plus the applicable limits of any other underlying insurance collectible by the insured.id.at,some italics omitted.
in litigation between the insurers,the primary insurers contended that scottsdale was obligated by the terms of its policy to provide coverage once the primary policy was exhausted.scottsdale contended that it need not provide coverage until the primary policies for all years were exhausted.community redevelopment,supra,th at.
the court of appeal held that scottsdale policy was excess to all primary policies,and thus that scottsdale need not indemnify the developer until all primary policies had been exhausted.community redevelopment,supra,th at.it explained there is no dispute that scottsdale million coverage was purchased as excess to the million primary policy issued by state farm.however,the express provisions of the policy further provide that scottsdale liability was also excess to the applicable limits of any other underlying insurance collectible by the insured parties.italics added.the policy also provided that the insurance afforded by the policy shall be excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance available to the insured parties whether or not described in the schedule of underlying insurance which schedule listed state farm million policy.id.at.this policy language,the court said,could hardly be more clear that scottsdale exposure was excess to all other primary coverage available to the insured.id.at.
its conclusion,the court said,was consistent with the principle of horizontal exhaustion the notion that all primary insurance must be exhausted before a secondary insurer will have exposure.community redevelopment,supra,th at.it noted that horizontal exhaustion raised particular problems in cases of continuous loss,because i n such cases,primary liability insurers may have exposure to defend and perhaps indemnify claims arising before or after the effective dates of such policies.as a result of the supreme court conclusion that a continuing or progressively deteriorating condition which causes damage or injury throughout more than one policy period will potentially be covered by all policies in effect during those periods montrose,supra,cal th at,the horizontal exhaustion versus vertical exhaustion issue will become an increasingly common one to be resolved.as we find to be the case here,primary policies may have defense and coverage obligations which make them underlying insurance to excess policies which were effective in entirely different time periods and which may not have expressly described such primary policies as underlying insurance.community redevelopment,supra,th at.
the court concluded absent a provision in the excess policy specifically describing and limiting the underlying insurance,a horizontal exhaustion rule should be applied in continuous loss cases because it is most consistent with the principles enunciated in montrose.in other words,all of the primary policies in force during the period of continuous loss will be deemed primary policies to each of the excess policies covering that same period.under the principle of horizontal exhaustion,all of the primary policies must exhaust before any excess will have coverage exposure.community redevelopment,supra,th at.thus,scottsdale responsibility to respond was not triggered by state farm exhaustion not until exhaustion of all primary policies,including united,would scottsdale have had any duty to provide a defense to the insureds.ibid.
the court reached a similar result in stonewall ins.city of palos verdes estates th,also a continuing loss case with multiple primary and excess insurers.there,the court held that if the limits of liability in the available primary policies were adequate to cover the insured liability,no excess carrier would be liable.it explained in substance we adopt the horizontal allocation of the risk approach to liability as between primary and excess carriers,rather than the vertical approach.to begin with,it seems clear from the insured assertion that all of its primary insurers covered its liability that the insured reasonable expectations treated the excess policies as a secondary source.moreover,the horizontal approach seems far more consistent with montrose continuous trigger approach.that is,if occurrences are continuously occurring throughout a period of time,all of the primary policies in force during that period of time cover these occurrences,and all of them are primary to each of the excess policies and if the limits of liability of each of these primary policies is adequate in the aggregate to cover the liability of the insured,there is no excess loss for the excess policies to cover.id.at.
we concur with the reasoning of these cases and conclude,for all the reasons discussed,ante,that the excess policy is excess to all collectible primary insurance,not merely to the primary insurance purchased for the policy year.
ii.under the language of truck primary policy,truck liability can not exceed per occurrence 
having concluded that icsop policy is excess to all collectible primary insurance,we now turn to the second issue raised by icsop appeal what primary insurance is collectible icsop contends that the excess policy requires exhaustion of all primary insurance as a condition precedent to coverage,and it assumes that primary insurance is not exhausted until the primary insurer or insurers have paid policy limits for each year in which coverage exists.truck and kaiser disagree,urging that under the language of the primary policy,truck is responsible to pay policy limits only once per occurrence,not once per occurrence per year or once per occurrence per policy.we conclude truck and kaiser are correct.
icsop policy language is silent as to whether the underlying primary policies must be aggregated before excess insurance is available 
as we have said,the excess policy provides that icsop is liable for kaiser ultimate net loss in excess of its retained limit,defined as an amount equal to the limits of liability indicated in the schedule of underlying policies,plus the limits of any other underlying insurance collectible by the insured.italics added.the other insurance provision uses nearly identical language,providing that icsop policy is in excess of the scheduled primary insurance policy plus other valid and collectible insurance with any other insurer.italics added.thus,by the plain language of its policy,icsop liability is in excess not of all primary insurance,but only of primary insurance that is both valid and collectible.
icsop contends without analysis that because under montrose,supra,cal th,multiple truck policies are triggered by the underlying asbestos bodily injury claims,each triggered policy necessarily provides valid and collectible coverage for each claim.in other words,icsop assumes that the policy limits of each primary policy can be stacked so that the available primary insurance for each occurrence is equal to the sum of the occurrence limits for each triggered policy year.icsop contention,however,explicitly is not grounded in the language of the primary policies indeed,icsop faults the trial court for examining the language of those policies,characterizing such examination inexplicabl e.according to icsop,it is axiomatic that icsop policy obligations are located in its own insurance contract not the underlying truck primary policy and that,as a matter of basic contract law,the icsop policy wording governs the determination of when icsop obligations under the policy attach.
icsop analysis is flawed.the excess policy expressly premises icsop duty to indemnify on the validity and collectibility of underlying primary insurance.by its plain language,thus,the policy bases its coverage obligation on the coverage provided to kaiser by its primary insurers the more primary insurance available to kaiser,the smaller icsop indemnity obligation the less primary insurance available to kaiser,the greater icsop indemnity obligation.under these circumstances,we can not determine icsop policy obligations without first determining truck.since truck policy obligations necessarily depend on the language of its policies,we therefore turn to those policies and the supreme court recent analysis of stacking in continental,supra,cal th.
continental 
in continental,the california supreme court considered a variety of coverage issues in connection with a federal court ordered cleanup of the stringfellow acid pits stringfellow site.the stringfellow site was an industrial waste disposal site designed and operated by the state of california state from to.the state had been advised prior to opening the stringfellow site that there was no threat of hazardous materials migrating from it however,contaminants escaped during periods of heavy rain,eventually contaminating the groundwater.cal th at.
in,a federal court found the state liable for,among other things,negligence in investigating,choosing,and designing the stringfellow site,overseeing its construction,failing to correct hazardous conditions,and delaying its remediation.the federal court held the state liable for all past and future cleanup costs,which the state claimed could reach million.the state then filed an indemnity action against five insurers.continental,supra,cal th at.four of those insurers had issued the state single excess cgl policies the fifth,wausau,had issued four excess cgl policies,covering policy periods,and.
the policies issued by the five insurers contained nearly identical language.under the heading insuring agreement,the insurers agreed t o pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law for damages because of injury to or destruction of property,including loss of use thereof.occurrence was defined as an accident or a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which result in damage to property during the policy period liability limits were stated as specified dollar amounts of the ultimate net loss of each occurrence.continental,supra,cal th at.
among the issues considered by the court was how to allocate liability among several insurers in a long tail injury,which it characterized as a series of indivisible injuries attributable to continuing events without a single unambiguous cause.continental,supra,cal th at.the court noted that injuries produce progressive damage that takes place slowly over years or even decades.traditional cgl insurance policies,including those drafted before such environmental suits were common,are typically silent as to this type of injury.hickman deyoung,allocation of environmental cleanup liability between successive insurers,hickman deyoung.because of this circumstance,many insurers are unwilling to indemnify insureds for claims.their refusal to indemnify often causes insureds to sue for coverage t hese suits tend to be complex.typically they involve dozens of litigants and even larger numbers of insurance policies covering multiple time periods that stretch back over many years.continental,supra,at.
the court began its analysis of the allocation issues before it by discussing its holdings in montrose,supra,cal th,and aerojet general transport indemnity cal th,aerojet.in montrose,the court adopted a continuous injury trigger of coverage,pursuant to which a continuous condition becomes an occurrence for the purposes of triggering insurance coverage when property damage results from a causative event consisting of the accident or continuous and repeated exposure to conditions.continental,supra,cal th at.the court adopted an all sums rule in aerojet,pursuant to which an insurer on the risk when continuous or progressively deteriorating property damage or bodily injury first manifests itself remains obligated to indemnify the insured for the entirety of the ensuing damage or injury.in other words,as long as the property is insured at some point during the continuing damage period,the insurers indemnity obligations persist until the loss is complete,or terminates.ibid.
in continental,the insurers advocated a pro rata rule for indemnity allocation,under which an equal share of the amount of damage is assigned to each year over which a injury occurred.cal th at.but although the court acknowledged that some states had adopted a pro rata approach,it found itself constrained by the language of the applicable policies here,which it said supports adoption of the all sums coverage principles.ibid.it explained under the cgl policies here,the plain all sums language of the agreement compels the insurers to pay all sums which the insured shall become obligated to pay for damages because of injury to or destruction of property ante,at.as the state observes,t his grant of coverage does not limit the policies promise to pay all sums of the policyholder liability solely to sums or damage during the policy period.id.at.the court therefore concluded that the policies at issue obligate the insurers to pay all sums for property damage attributable to the stringfellow site,up to their policy limits,if applicable,as long as some of the continuous property damage occurred while each policy was on the loss.the coverage extends to the entirety of the ensuing damage or injury citation,and best reflects the insurers indemnity obligations under the respective policies,the insured expectations,and the true character of the damages that flow from a injury.id.at.
having so concluded,the court then turned to a related issue whether the state could stack policy limits across multiple policy periods.it explained that stacking policy limits means that when more than one policy is triggered by an occurrence,each policy can be called upon to respond to the claim up to the full limits of the policy.citation.when the policy limits of a given insurer are exhausted,the insured is entitled to seek indemnification from any of the remaining insurers that were on the risk citations.continental,supra,cal th at.
the court concluded that allowing an insured to stack policies under the circumstances presented properly incorporates the montrose continuous injury trigger of coverage rule and the aerojet all sums rule,and effectively stacks the insurance coverage from different policy periods to form one giant with a coverage limit equal to the sum of all purchased insurance policies.continental,supra,cal th at.it explained instead of treating a injury as though it occurred in one policy period,this approach treats all the triggered insurance as though it were purchased in one policy period.the insured has access to far more insurance than it would ever be entitled to within any one period.citation.the rule means that the insured has immediate access to the insurance it purchased.it does not put the insured in the position of receiving less coverage than it bought.it also acknowledges the uniquely progressive nature of injuries that cause progressive damage throughout multiple policy periods.citation.ibid.
in adopting an rule,the court rejected the court analysis in fmc,supra,th,which it said disregarded the policy language entirely and resorted to judicial intervention in order to avoid stacking.continental,supra,cal th at.the court said that the policies at issue,which do not contain antistacking language,allow for its application.ibid.
the court concluded that an rule has numerous advantages.it resolves the question of insurance coverage as equitably as possible,given the immeasurable aspects of a injury.it also comports with the parties reasonable expectations,in that the insurer reasonably expects to pay for property damage occurring during a loss it covered,but only up to its policy limits,while the insured reasonably expects indemnification for the time periods in which it purchased insurance coverage.coverage allocation ascertains each insurer liability with a comparatively uncomplicated calculation that looks at the injury as a whole rather than artificially breaking it into distinct periods of injury.as the court of appeal recognized,if an occurrence is continuous across two or more policy periods,the insured has paid two or more premiums and can recover up to the combined total of the policy limits.there is nothing unfair or unexpected in allowing stacking in a continuous loss.continental,supra,cal th at.the court,noted,however,that there exists a significant caveat to indemnity allocation.that caveat contemplates that an insurer may avoid stacking by specifically including an antistacking provision in its policy.of course,in the future,contracting parties can write into their policies whatever language they agree upon,including limitations on indemnity,equitable pro rata coverage allocation rules,and prohibitions on stacking.id.at.
truck policy language does not permit stacking of the various truck policies 
although continental adopted an rule in the absence of contrary policy language,it made clear that any stacking analysis must begin with the relevant policy language.here,pursuant to the insuring agreements of the primary policy,truck agreed t o pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become obligated to pay,as damages or otherwise,by reason of the liability imposed upon him by law,assumed by him under the contract as defined,or by reason of any other legal liability of the insured however arising or created or alleged to have risen or to have been created because of 
personal injury,sickness,disease,including death 
injury to or destruction of property 
including all loss resulting therefrom.
the limit of liability portion of the policy limits truck liability for personal injury or property damage to per occurrence.italics added.it further provides part iv,policy period,territory,limits 
the limit of liability stated in this policy as applicable per occurrence is the limit of the company liability for each occurrence.
there is no limit to the number of occurrences for which claims may be made hereunder,however,the limit of the company liability as respects any occurrence involving one or any combination of the hazards or perils insured against shall not exceed the per occurrence limit designated in the declarations.italics added.
truck and kaiser contend that the primary policy does not permit stacking of truck annual per occurrence limits,and we agree as the italicized language indicates,the policy contains a per occurrence limit not,as truck notes,a per occurrence per policy or per occurrence per year limit this language is facially inconsistent with permitting kaiser to recover from truck more than the occurrence limit for a single occurrence.
further,the policy specifically provides that,t he limit of liability stated in this policy as applicable per occurrence is the limit of the company liability for each occurrence and the limit of the company liability as respects any occurrence shall not exceed the per occurrence limit designated in the declarations.notably,the policy does not say that the per occurrence limit is the limit of the company annual liability for any occurrence,or that the per occurrence limit is the limit of the company liability under the policy.rather,it says that the per occurrence limit is the limit of the company liability.we presume,as we must,that the parties intended this language to mean what it plainly says that for any single occurrence,truck is liable up to the per occurrence limit,and no more.we thus conclude that the trial court correctly determined that kaiser may not stack the liability limits of truck primary policies,but rather may recover only up to the per occurrence limit of one policy.
our conclusion that kaiser may not stack truck annual liability limits is consistent with the supreme court analysis in continental.although the court in continental adopted an default rule,it made clear that rule applied only in the absence of contrary policy language and said that an insurer could avoid stacking by specifically including an antistacking provision in its policy.continental,supra,cal th at see also id.at we are constrained by the language of the applicable policies here.although the court did not describe such a provision with any specificity,we believe truck term is exactly such a provision with regard to the stacking of truck own policy limits.as we have said,the primary policy expressly caps truck liability for each occurrence and provides that the limit of the company liability as respects any occurrence involving one or any combination of the hazards or perils insured against shall not exceed the per occurrence limit designated in the declarations.italics added.we do not know what more truck could have said when the policy was drafted in to make clear that its policy term was an absolute cap on its per occurrence exposure and,as such,it is fundamentally inconsistent with stacking the liability limits of the several truck policies.
further,our result satisfies the supreme court stated goal in continental of giving the insured immediate access to the insurance it purchased and avoiding put ting the insured in the position of receiving less coverage than it bought.continental,supra,cal th at.in continental,stacking policies increased the insured coverage because it effectively stack ed the insurance coverage from different policy periods to form one giant with a coverage limit equal to the sum of all purchased insurance policies.ibid.in contrast,in the present case stacking would decrease,not increase,the insured coverage because it would potentially make kaiser responsible for multiple deductibles per claim.see fn,ante.
we note,finally,that the issue before us is somewhat different than that before the court in continental.with the exception of wausau,the insurers in continental each had issued the state a single cgl policy thus,the court considered only whether any of the relevant policy language prohibited stacking of policies issued by different insurers.it did not consider the issue before us whether an insured may stack multiple policies issued by the same insurer.this distinction is significant because the relevant language here t he limit of liability stated in this policy as applicable per occurrence is the lim
