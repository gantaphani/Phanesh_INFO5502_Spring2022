introduction 
in this class action,plaintiff timothy sandquist purports to appeal from the trial court august,order granting defendants motion to compel him to arbitrate his individual claims,as well as defendants motion to dismiss all class claims without prejudice.although this order is not appealable,we liberally construe sandquist notice of appeal to include the trial court october,order dismissing his class claims with prejudice,which is appealable under the death knell doctrine.limiting our review to sandquist challenges to the order dismissing the class claims,we agree with sandquist that the trial court erred by deciding the issue whether the parties agreed to class arbitration,and that the court should have submitted the issue to the arbitrator.therefore,we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
sandquist began working in sales at manhattan beach toyota in september.joel rabe,sandquist sales floor manager,provided sandquist with a large amount of paperwork to fill out but did not discuss any of the documents with him.rabe simply told sandquist to complete the paperwork quickly so he could get out onto the sales floor.the paperwork consisted of about pages,including an employee handbook.sandquist filled out the paperwork as best and as quickly as he could.due to time constraints sandquist did not review the documents and did not know he was signing multiple arbitration agreements.he signed the documents because he needed the job.
among the documents sandquist signed was a document entitled applicant statement agreement.it provided in pertinent part i and the company both agree that any claim dispute,controversy including,but not limited to,any claims of discrimination and harassment,whether they be based on the california fair employment and housing act,as well as all other applicable state or federal laws or regulations which would otherwise require or allow resort to any court or other governmental dispute resolution forum between myself and the company or its owners,directors,officers,managers,employees,agents,and parties affiliated with its employee benefit and health plans arising from,related to,or having any relationship or connection whatsoever with my seeking employment with,employment by,or other association with the company,whether based on tort,contract,statutory,or equitable law,or otherwise,with the sole exception of claims arising under the national labor relations act which are brought before the national labor relations board,claims for medical and disability benefits under the california workers compensation act,and employment development department claims shall be submitted to and determined exclusively by binding arbitration 
sandquist also signed a separate document acknowledging that he was an at will employee and agreeing that any claim,dispute,controversy including,but not limited to any claims of discrimination and harassment which would otherwise require or allow resort to any court or other governmental dispute resolution forum,between me and the company or its owners,directors,officers,managers,employees agents,and parties affiliated with its employee benefits and health plans arising from,related to,or having any relationship or connection whatsoever with my seeking employment with,employment by,or other association with,the company,whether based on tort,contract,statutory,or equitable law,or otherwise,shall be submitted to and determined exclusively by binding arbitration 
finally,sandquist signed a document entitled employee acknowledgment and agreement.in addition to an acknowledgment of receipt of the dealership employee handbook,the document contained the following arbitration provision i agree that any claim,or dispute,or controversy including,but not limited to,any and all claims of discrimination and harassment which would otherwise require or allow resort to any court or other governmental dispute resolution forum between myself and the company or its owners,directors,officers,managers,employees,agents,and parties affiliated with its employee benefit and health plans arising from,related to,or having any relationship or connection whatsoever with my seeking employment with,employment by,or other association with the company,whether based on tort,contract,statutory,or equitable law,or otherwise,with the sole exception of claims arising under the national labor relations act which are brought before the national labor relations board,claims for medical and disability benefits under the california workers compensation act,and employment development department claims,shall be submitted to and determine d exclusively by binding arbitration 
all three arbitration provisions further specified that arbitration would be governed by the federal arbitration act faa in conformity with the procedures of the california arbitration act code civ,et.
sandquist,who is african american,filed this class action on january,against defendants lebo automotive,doing business as john elway manhattan beach toyota,john elway,mitchell pierce,jerry williams,and darrell sperber,who had purchased the dealership in.on february,sandquist filed his operative first amended class action complaint alleging violations of california fair employment and housing act feha,et and unfair competition law bus,et,and seeking injunctive and declaratory relief and damages.
sandquist asserted individual and class claims against the dealership for race,color,national origin,and ancestry discrimination and against all the defendants for hostile work environment.sandquist also alleged an individual claim against the dealership for constructive discharge.he alleged that despite his enormous success at and loyalty to the dealership,he was passed over for promotions,denied salary increases,and harassed on the basis of his race.he not only experienced discrimination on a routine basis,but he also witnessed elway,pierce,and williams participate in,aid,abet,substantially assist,condone,or ratify discrimination and harassment in the face of widespread complaints that gm sperber was a repeat harasser who freely and openly harassed employees of color.after persevering for four years against the ongoing discrimination and hostile work environment that permeated the dealership,sandquist was forced to resign in.
on march,defendants filed a motion to compel individual arbitration pursuant to code of civil procedure section and to stay or dismiss the proceedings with the trial court retaining jurisdiction to enforce any arbitration award.in support of their motion defendants relied on the three arbitration agreements signed by sandquist on his first day of work.
on august,the trial court granted the motion.the trial court concluded that the faa applied and that the agreement was not unconscionable,finding no substantive unconscionability and a low level of procedural unconscionability with regard to the class claims the trial court ruled and to clean up any procedural details with regard to class allegations,the court is going to dismiss or strike the class allegations as being irrelevant,false or an improper matter in the complaint under code of civil procedure section because there no basis,contractual basis,to compel class arbitration.since the plaintiff himself is now going to be subject to individual arbitration,there would no longer be any representative in the lawsuit that would be able to adequately represent a class action to pursue the claims that are asserted by plaintiff.the trial court further stated that it would dismiss the class allegations without prejudice and set a time limit of days for plaintiff to amend.and if plaintiff does not amend to bring forth a class representative that could support this class action to reinstitute the class allegations,then the defendant may request the dismissal of the case with prejudice.
on september,counsel for sandquist advised the trial court that they had been unable to locate an employee of the dealership who had not signed the arbitration agreements.in the absence of a substitute class representative the trial court stated it would dismiss the class claims with prejudice.
on october,the trial court signed an order dismissing the class claims with prejudice.the court order noted that sandquist was provided up to and including september,to amend his complaint in order to bring forth a class representative that could support plaintiff class action to reinstate the class allegations.plaintiff having failed to amend his complaint by september,it is hereby ordered that plaintiff class claims are dismissed with prejudice.that same day,october,sandquist filed a notice of appeal from the august,order granting defendants motion to compel arbitration and dismissing class claims without prejudice,and attached a copy of the august order to his notice of appeal.sandquist did not include in the notice of appeal the october,order entered that same day.
discussion 
appealability 
because the question of appealability goes to our jurisdiction,we are dutybound to consider it on our own motion.desaulles community hospital of the monterey peninsula th,quoting olson cory cal d,see koshak malek th,because appealability implicates our jurisdiction,we review the issue on our own motion.
in his opening brief sandquist states that t his appeal arises from the august,and october,orders of the los angeles superior court.in his notice of appeal,however,sandquist only listed the august,order.therefore,as a preliminary matter,we must decide whether the trial court august,order is appealable and,if not,whether sandquist failure to include the court october,order in his notice of appeal requires dismissal of his appeal.
an order granting a motion to compel arbitration is not appealable.code civ,subd.a goldman sunbridge healthcare,llc th,fn.nelsen legacy partners residential,th,nelsen.rather,it is reviewable on appeal from the final judgment entered after confirmation of the arbitration award.nelsen,supra,at kinecta alternative financial solutions,superior court th.in his opening brief sandquist acknowledges that orders granting motions to compel arbitration are not ordinarily appealable but asserts that the instant appeal is authorized under the death knell doctrine,which allows appeal from any order that is tantamount to a dismissal of the action as to all members of the class other than the plaintiff.
the death knell doctrine is applied to orders in class actions that effectively terminate class claims,such as orders denying class certification or decertifying a class,while allowing individual claims to persist.citations.the doctrine is animated by the concern that an individual plaintiff may lack incentive to pursue his individual claims to judgment,thereby foreclosing any possible appellate review of class issues.citation.to preserve appellate review of class issues,the death knell doctrine permits appeal from an order that amounts to a de facto final judgment for absent plaintiffs,under circumstances where the persistence of viable but perhaps de minimis individual plaintiff claims creates a risk no formal final judgment will ever be entered.citation.under this doctrine,an order compelling a plaintiff to pursue his or her claim in arbitration and dismissing the action as to all other members of the class has been held to be immediately appealable.citation.phillips sprint pcs th,see in re baycol cases i ii cal th,only an order that entirely terminates class claims is appealable daar yellow cab cal d,order that is tantamount to a dismissal of the action as to all members of the class other than plaintiff is appealable elijahjuan superior court th,termination of class claims is a prerequisite for the death knell doctrine.
although the august,order compelled sandquist to arbitrate his individual claims against the defendants,the trial court order did not finally terminate the class claims.by dismissing the class claims without prejudice the trial court left open the possibility that the class claims would continue with the substitution of a new class representative.such an order was not final and appealable.see aleman airtouch cellular th,an order denying class certification without prejudice is not appealable as t he death knell has not yet sounded.because the death knell doctrine applies only to those orders that effectively terminate class claims but permit individual claims to continue in re baycol cases i ii,supra,cal th at,this doctrine does not make the august order appealable.although sandquist could have sought immediate review of the august order by filing a petition for writ of mandate,he did not do so.see phillips sprint pcs,supra,th at immediate review of an order granting a motion to compel arbitration may be obtained by a petition for writ of mandate kinecta alternative financial solutions,superior court,supra,th at same.
while we may treat a nonappealable order granting a motion to compel arbitration as a writ,we decline to do so here.w rit review of orders compelling arbitration is proper if the matters ordered arbitrated fall clearly outside the scope of the arbitration agreement or if the arbitration would appear to be unduly time consuming or expensive.citation.kinecta alternative financial solutions,superior court,supra,th at,quoting zembsch superior court th,accord,parada superior court th.sandquist individual claims do not fall clearly outside the scope of the arbitration agreements,and nothing in the record indicates that arbitration of sandquist individual claims would be unduly time consuming or expensive.therefore,we do not at this time review the propriety of the trial court august,order,including the trial court determination that the arbitration provisions were not unconscionable.
the question remaining is whether we may and should liberally construe sandquist notice of appeal to include an appeal from the october,order dismissing the class claims with prejudice.in walker los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority cal th,after the trial court had entered a judgment in favor of the defendant,the plaintiff unsuccessfully moved for a new trial.the plaintiff appealed from the nonappealable order denying his motion for a new trial but did not appeal from the existing judgment.the walker court contrasted cases like rodriquez barnett cal d,where the appellant appeals from both an appealable judgment and a nonappealable order with cases where the appellant appeals only from a nonappealable order.walker,supra,cal th at.the walker court noted that,in the latter category of cases,dismissal of the appeal from the nonappealable order would have the effect of completely denying appellate review.the supreme court held that b ecause t he law aspires to respect substance over formalism and nomenclature citation,a reviewing court should construe a notice of appeal from an order denying a new trial to be an appeal from the underlying judgment when it is reasonably clear the appellant intended to appeal from the judgment and the respondent would not be misled or prejudiced.id.at,fn.omitted.
here,sandquist filed his notice of appeal the same day that the trial court entered its order dismissing the class claims with prejudice.because this order effectively terminated the class claims,it was appealable under the death knell doctrine.see in re baycol cases i ii,supra,cal th at.we therefore liberally construe sandquist notice of appeal to encompass the trial court october,order.
b.the determination of whether an arbitration agreement provides for class arbitration trial court or arbitrator 
sandquist contends that the trial court wrongly conducted a clause construction analysis of the acknowledgements and held that they contain an implied class action waiver.sandquist,citing green tree fin.bazzle,d bazzle and garcia directv,th garcia,argues that the arbitrator,not the court,determines whether the arbitration agreement provides for class arbitration.defendants argue that the trial court correctly relied on stolt nielsen animalfeeds int l,d stolt nielsen in ruling that the court decides this issue.it turns out that this issue is not entirely settled.
a rbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.citations.howsam dean witter reynolds,d howsam see am
