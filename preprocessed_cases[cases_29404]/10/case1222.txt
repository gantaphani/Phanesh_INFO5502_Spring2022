raymond vinole and ken yoder plaintiffs appeal the district court order granting countrywide home loans,countrywide motion to deny class certification.in this dispute,plaintiffs seek to represent a proposed class of current and former countrywide employees who are or were employed as external home loan consultants hlcs.they allege that countrywide hlcs as exempt outside sales employees and,as a result,countrywide impermissibly failed to pay premium overtime and other wages.in a procedural wrinkle,countrywide filed its motion to deny certification before plaintiffs filed a motion for certification pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure rule and prior to the pretrial motion deadline and discovery cutoff.
on appeal,we consider whether the district court abused its discretion by considering countrywide motion to deny class certification before plaintiffs had filed a motion to certify and prior to the pretrial and discovery cutoffs,and denying class certification based on its reasoning that individual issues predominate over common issues.see.b.we affirm.first,no rule or decisional authority prohibited countrywide from filing its motion to deny certification before plaintiffs filed their motion to certify,and plaintiffs had ample time to prepare and present their certification argument.second,the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying certification under rule b because the record supports its conclusion that individual issues predominate over common issues.
countrywide is a corporation that provides mortgages to homeowners and home purchasers.it employs roughly hlcs,like plaintiffs vinole and yoder,in small satellite offices throughout california to sell loan products on its behalf.hlcs are focused on outside sales and represent countrywide in local communities,and specifically work with realtors,builders,and other potential business partners in order to develop business relationships and obtain referral business.they are paid entirely on commission,based on loan production countrywide declares that it has no control over what hlcs actually do during the day and does not monitor how hlcs perform their work activities.it further states that i t is immaterial how much,or how little time hlcs spend in the office,or working overall and that i t is up to each hlc to decide how much time they want to spend doing this,how they want to market themselves,and how much money they want to make.hlcs can earn several hundreds of thousands of dollars,and the average annual compensation of countrywide hlcs during the relevant period was over.
countrywide applies a uniform wage exemption to hlcs,categorizing them as exempt outside salespeople to whom countrywide is not obligated to pay overtime and related wages.it relies on the outside salesperson exemption found in the california industrial wage commission wage order,c,codified at,tit,and a similar exemption in the fair labor standards act flsa,a.wage order,m defines an outside salesperson as a person who customarily and regularly works more than half the working time away from the employer place of business selling tangible or intangible items or obtaining orders or contracts for products,services,or use of facilities.
evidence in the record,in the form of declarations from hlcs regarding the amount of time individual hlcs spent inside and outside the office,suggests that the time spent in or out of the office varies greatly.countrywide does not keep records reflecting whether any particular hlc qualifies for the exemption and does not monitor any possible change in an hlc exemption apparently only tracks the number and value of loans that hlcs close each month.
in october,plaintiffs filed a complaint in california state court,which countrywide removed to federal court in january.the first amended class action complaint complaint alleges twelve causes of action against countrywide on the theory that countrywide impermissibly classified all hlcs as exempt despite the fact that most hlcs primarily engaged in activities inside the office plaintiffs seek to represent a putative class defined as follows 
all current and former employees having a title of loan consultant other similarly designated titles,who have worked for defendant countrywide home loans,within the last four years from the filing of the complaint up to and including the time of trial for this matter loan consultants.
the complaint also proposes eight within the larger class.
on august,before the discovery cutoff and pretrial motion cutoff,countrywide filed a motion to deny certification.the discovery cutoff was scheduled for november,and the pretrial motion cutoff was scheduled for december.plaintiffs had not yet filed an affirmative motion for class certification.plaintiffs opposed the motion,arguing that the motion was not ripe and was procedurally improper because plaintiffs had yet to file a motion for class certification and class certification was substantively warranted based on the evidence they presented,which included nine declarations from hlcs that served as a preview of the motion for class certification that plaintiffs intended to file.
on november,the district court granted countrywide motion.first,the district court held that it was permitted to decide the question of certification on countrywide motion under rule notwithstanding the fact that countrywide had filed its motion before the pretrial motion and discovery cutoff dates.second,the district court held that class certification was not substantively proper because plaintiffs had not met their burden to demonstrate the applicability of one of the rule b certification grounds.specifically,it concluded that individual issues predominated over common issues because determining the propriety of a hlc exempt status would require an individualized analysis of how each hlc spent his or her time,and that countrywide had no common scheme or policy that would diminish the need for individual inquiry.order at.

we review a district court order denying class certification for an abuse of discretion.zinser accufix research,cir.as we stated in parra bashas,
w e limit our review to whether the district court correctly selected and applied rule criteria.an abuse of discretion occurs when the district court,in making a discretionary ruling,relies upon an improper factor,omits consideration of a factor entitled to substantial weight,or mulls the correct mix of factors but makes a clear error of judgment in assaying them.
cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
we first address plaintiffs argument that a defense motion to deny class certification brought outside the context of a plaintiff motion actually seeking certification is procedurally improper per se.although we have not previously addressed this argument directly,we conclude that rule does not preclude a defendant from bringing a preemptive motion to deny certification.
rule c a addresses the timing of a district court class certification determination,and states time to issue at an early practicable time after a person sues or is sued as a class representative,the court must determine by order whether to certify the action as a class action.c a.nothing in the plain language of rule c a either vests plaintiffs with the exclusive right to put the class certification issue before the district court or prohibits a defendant from seeking early resolution of the class certification question.the only requirement is that the certification question be resolved a t an early practicable time.the plain language of rule c a alone defeats plaintiffs argument that there is some sort of per se rule that precludes defense motions to deny certification,and plaintiffs have produced no authority to the contrary.
in addition,contrary to plaintiffs assertion that the district court here charted troubling new territory by entertaining countrywide motion to deny certification,federal courts have repeatedly considered defendants motions to deny class certification.in rutledge electric hose rubber,we affirmed the district court order granting defendants motion to deny certification under rule,albeit without expressly addressing any challenge to the defendants ability to bring such a motion before plaintiffs moved for certification,cir.in cook county college teachers union,local byrd,the seventh circuit also concluded that it was proper for the district court to consider the defendants motions to deny certification where the plaintiffs had not yet moved to certify a class.see,cir one opposing a class action may move for an order determining that the action may not be maintained as a class suit,cert.denied,d see also parker time warner entm,cir reviewing a district court order granting defendant motion to deny class certification but vacating that order because the district court had not permitted plaintiffs to conduct limited discovery.
plaintiffs proposed rule is also contrary to the fact that district courts throughout the nation have considered defendants preemptive motions to deny certification.see,fedotov peter roach,d,stating that defendant motion for denial of class procedural preemptive strike against this purported class properly before this court chevron usa,vermilion parish sch,granting defendants motion to deny class certification,aff,cir bryant,denying on the merits defendant motion to deny class certification brought before start of discovery osborn serv.station dealers ass n,plaintiff briefing appears to incorrectly assume that defendants to purported class actions may only raise issues regarding the appropriateness of this procedure in response to class certification motions.brown milwaukee spring,while the plaintiff has the burden of establishing her right to maintain a class action,the defendants may test the propriety of the action by means of a motion for denial of class certification.
plaintiffs rely on three district court cases for their purported per se rule prohibiting defendants from moving to deny class certification prior to the plaintiffs filing of a motion to certify in re stores.wage and hour litigation,d baas dollar tree stores,no.c jsw,wl,unpublished and beauperthuy hour fitness usa,sc,wl,unpublished.these cases do not support plaintiffs proposed rule.
in in re stores,the district court did not have before it a rule motion to deny class,and unlike the present case,the district court was considering the defendant motions to dismiss and strike class allegations pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,when the defendant had not yet answered the complaint,discovery had not yet commenced,and no motion to certify a class had been filed.see d at.the district court exercised its discretion and denied the motions in order to allow plaintiffs time to conduct discovery prior to considering the propriety of the class allegations.id.at.however,it in no way set forth an absolute prohibition on defense motions to deny certification 
plaintiffs reliance on baas is similarly unfounded because that case involved a defendant motions to dismiss and strike class allegations on vagueness grounds and was decided in nearly the same procedural posture as in re stores.see baas,wl at distinguishing a rule motion and holding that defendant attempt to dismiss class allegations under rule was premature.as in in re stores,baas did not adopt the per se rule urged by plaintiffs here.
finally,the plaintiffs misread beauperthuy as supporting a per se prohibition on preemptive motions to deny class certification.in that case,the district court denied defendants motion under rule d to compel amendment of the pleadings to eliminate class allegations on the grounds that such a motion was procedurally inseparable from the question of class certification,and that the plaintiffs had not yet filed a motion to certify.beauperthuy,wl,at.the district court held only that it was procedurally improper to consider a motion to compel an amendment of the pleadings in a class action case where the question of certification was not yet before the court and discovery was ongoing.id.again,the district court did not announce the rule forwarded by plaintiffs here.
in short,plaintiffs have read into rule a per se prohibition against defendants filing of a motion to deny class certification where none exists.a defendant may move to deny class certification before a plaintiff files a motion to certify a class.accordingly,the district court did not err by considering countrywide motion.
having determined that countrywide filed its motion to deny class certification at a permissible point in the proceedings,we next consider whether the district court abused its discretion in granting countrywide motion before the pretrial motion cutoff and the discovery cutoff.the district court held that it was not obligated to wait for the pretrial motion deadline before considering the class certification issue,and plaintiffs had sufficient time to prepare for defendant motion despite the fact that the discovery cutoff was three weeks away.plaintiffs argue that the district court consideration of the motion was fundamentally unfair because they were deprived of the opportunity to present their argument based on a full record.
plaintiffs offer virtually no factual assertions in support of their claim that the district court abused its discretion by considering countrywide motion to deny certification before the december,pretrial motion deadline.they essentially argue that it was unfair for the district court to consider countrywide motion when it did.however,the operative scheduling order simply states that a ll other pretrial motions must be filed on or before december.as the district court noted in its order,the scheduling order neither provides plaintiffs an exclusive right nor a specifically designated period of time to address the issue of class certification.order at.in addition,plaintiffs have not offered any authority,and we have found none,for the proposition that a district court either abuses its discretion or errs as a matter of law by considering the issue of class certification before expiration of a pretrial motion deadline.plaintiffs argument is essentially a version of their argument that plaintiffs are entitled to complete control over the timing of a district court consideration of the class certification issue,an argument which we have already rejected.
we also conclude that plaintiffs were provided with adequate time in which to conduct discovery related to the question of class certification such that the district court did not abuse its discretion by considering countrywide motion.district courts have broad discretion to control the class certification process,and w hether or not discovery will be permitted lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.kamm cal.city dev,cir accord armstrong davis,cir.although a party seeking class certification is not always entitled to discovery on the class certification issue,we have stated that t he propriety of a class action can not be determined in some cases without discovery,kamm,at,and that the better and more advisable practice for a district court to follow is to afford the litigants an opportunity to present evidence as to whether a class action was maintainable.doninger pac.nw.bell,cir holding,however,that class certification was properly denied without discovery where plaintiffs could not make a prima facie showing of rule prerequisites or that discovery measures were likely to produce persuasive information substantiating the class action allegations accord mantolete bolger,cir.our cases stand for the unremarkable proposition that often the pleadings alone will not resolve the question of class certification and that some discovery will be warranted 
here,however,considerably more information was available to the district court when it ruled on the motion to deny certification than just the pleadings.although the district court considered countrywide motion roughly three weeks before the november discovery cutoff,plaintiffs had nearly ten months to conduct informal and formal discovery between the time plaintiffs filed their original class action complaint and their opposition to countrywide motion.tellingly,plaintiffs counsel and judge sabraw had the following exchange at the hearing on countrywide motion to deny class certification 
counsel the complaint was filed october.
the court okay.so tomorrow will be one year.
counsel yes.
the court and here there has has been in the federal court for about months.and discovery closes in two or three weeks 
counsel right.we would say,your honor,that we are anticipating being able to file a rule motion within about four weeks.
the court what more discovery would you do 
counsel we are not going to conduct any more discovery in terms of obtaining information from the defense or taking depositions and so forth,but we are compiling additional declarations from putative class members.
as i mentioned in the briefing,we provided a preview of those declarations,because we did want to be on defendants schedule forced into putting forth our rule motion in opposition to a procedurally improper motion to deny class certification.
several things are apparent from this colloquy.first,at the time of the hearing plaintiffs had conducted significant discovery and did not intend to propound any additional discovery seeking information from countrywide regarding the propriety of class certification.second,it is evident that plaintiffs had made a strategic choice to limit the amount of evidence it presented to the district court in opposition to countrywide motion they proffered their class certification arguments through their preview declarations.third,plaintiffs real complaint is not that they were deprived of adequate time in which to complete discovery,but that they did want to be on defendants schedule.but,again,this is just a variation on plaintiffs argument in favor of a per se rule.plaintiffs,in a strategic gamble,relied on their position that countrywide motion was procedurally argument we have avoid having the district court decide the motion on the merits.nothing in the record suggests that plaintiffs could not have more diligently prepared their certification argument in the months between the date countrywide filed its motion and the date plaintiffs opposition brief was due.
moreover,the record indicates that plaintiffs did not request a continuance or an extension of time in which to respond to countrywide motion.if plaintiffs truly were not prepared to present their position on class certification,it seems reasonable that they would have requested an extension or continuance as soon as possible after countrywide filed its motion to deny class certification 
we have decided that countrywide could properly file its motion to deny class certification before the close of discovery and before the pretrial motion deadline.accordingly,the district court consideration of the motion would only be improper if plaintiffs could show some procedural prejudice from the timing of the consideration.plaintiffs have failed to do so on the record presented,and,thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion.
next,we review the merits of the district court denial of class certification for an abuse of discretion.zinser,at.plaintiffs claim that the district court abused its discretion by not certifying a class in accordance with wang chinese daily news,which certified a rule b class on the basis of an employer uniform classification of a group of its employees as exempt.
under rule b,a class may be certified if the district court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.b.the predominance inquiry focuses on the relationship between the common and individual issues and tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.hanlon chrysler,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.rule b predominance and superiority requirements were added to cover cases in which a class action would achieve economies of time,effort,and expense,and promote uniformity of decision as to persons similarly situated,without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results.amchem,windsor,d quoting.b comm.notes to amendment.accordingly,a central concern of the rule b predominance test is whether adjudication of common issues will help achieve judicial economy.zinser,at citation and quotation marks omitted.
keeping the requirements and purpose of rule b in mind,our assessment of whether the district court abused its discretion also implicates the analytical framework within which courts review application of an exemption to an employee.here,the district court held that analysis of the outside salesperson exemption precluded certification because that analysis would require an individualized inquiry into the manner in which each hlc actually carried out his or her work,and that this burden was not lessened by the presence of other issues susceptible to common proof.see order at.
federal law and california law provide exemptions for outside salespersons.the california exemption from overtime and other wages applies to an employee who customarily and regularly works more than half the working time away from the employer place of business selling tangible or intangible items or obtaining orders or contracts for products,services,or use of facilities.regs.tit,c,m.under california law,a court evaluating the applicability of the outside salesperson exemption must conduct an individualized analysis of the way each employee actually spends his or her time,and not simply review the employer job description.ramirez yosemite water,cal th,d.this entails a inquiry.see,campbell pricewaterhousecoopers,llp.first,the court examines in an individualized fashion the work actually performed by the employee to determine how much of that work is exempt.id.second,the court determines whether the employee work was consistent with the employer expectation and whether those expectations were realistic accord sepulveda stores,aff in relevant part.cir.
under federal law,the flsa exemption found in a exempts employees whose primary duty is making sales or obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities for which a consideration will be paid by the client or customer,and w ho is customarily and regularly engaged away from the employer place or places of business in performing such primary duty.a similar to the california exemption,analysis of the flsa exemption is a inquiry.see,tumminello united states,the determination of whether an exemption applies to a given individual is a very exercise.
plaintiffs ask us to follow the wang decision and adopt a rule that class certification is warranted under rule b whenever an employer uniformly classifies a group of employees as exempt,notwithstanding the requirement that the district court conduct an individualized analysis of each employee actual work activity.see at see also wiegele fedex ground package,wl,relying on wang and certifying class of former fedex managers based on application of exemption.this is essentially the approach adopted by the district court in in re wells fargo home mortgage overtime pay litigation,d,which is also before us on appeal.
we decline to adopt such an approach set forth in greater length in our opinion in in re wells hold that a district court abuses its discretion in relying on an internal uniform exemption policy to the near exclusion of other factors relevant to the predominance inquiry.see in re wells fargo home mortgage overtime pay,slip.op.at.as we stated there,focusing on a uniform exemption policy alone does little to further the purpose of rule b predominance inquiry,which requires an assessment of the relationship between individual and common issues.id.instead of adopting what would essentially be a presumption in favor of class certification,we favor an approach that takes into consideration all factors that militate in favor of,or against,class certification.id.at.the overarching focus remains whether trial by class representa
