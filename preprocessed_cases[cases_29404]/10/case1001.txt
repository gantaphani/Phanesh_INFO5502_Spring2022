as relevant to this appeal,plaintiffs alleged that the favorable quarterly financial information reported in the narrative section of the prospectus was false and misleading in three material respects 
earnings were inflated per share by reversing in employee benefit accruals,contrary to generally accepted accounting principles gaap.
earnings were inflated another per share by reducing acxiom allowance for doubtful accounts even as total receivables skyrocketed.
acxiom failed to disclose that a new contract with its largest customer,allstate insurance,would result in lower pricing for acxiom services and reflected the company adverse competitive environment.
in its order granting defendants motion to dismiss,the district court separately analyzed these three alleged misstatements and concluded none was sufficient to state a claim.on appeal,the parties,too,have separately discussed whether each of the three was sufficient to support plaintiffs claim that the prospectus was materially misleading.we will address these disclosure issues seriatim,except to the extent their cumulative impact may become relevant.
a.the employee benefit reserves issue.plaintiffs complaint alleges that the recent quarterly earnings reported in the narrative section of the prospectus were materially misstated and presented in violation of gaap because,in calculating those earnings,acxiom improperly accounted for its reserve for employee benefits by reversing million previously accrued.broadly construed,this claim appears to assert two distinct theories that must be analyzed separately.
first,plaintiffs clearly allege that acxiom undisclosed decision to reverse million in employee benefit reserves violated gaap accounting principles.acxiom counters that this alleged accounting impropriety is immaterial as a matter of law because sec regulations do not require that a prospectus include financial statements for a recently completed fiscal quarter,and do not require that gaap principles be followed when reporting financial information in the narrative section of a prospectus.while not disputing those assertions,plaintiffs properly respond that,if any financial information is voluntarily included in a narrative section of a prospectus,it may not be presented in a materially misleading manner.see,b.
the sec regulations provide that financial statements are presumed misleading unless prepared in compliance with gaap principles.see a.that means investors can reasonably expect that financial information a company voluntarily includes in a prospectus,including financial forecasts or unaudited recent financial results,was prepared in accordance with gaap.thus,a complaint that sufficiently alleges an undisclosed departure from gaap affecting a material statement in a prospectus almost certainly states a claim,even if the material statement appeared in a narrative section of the prospectus.
however,in this case,after generally alleging that acxiom improper reserves were presented in violation of gaap,plaintiffs more specifically alleged that acxiom disclosed the million reserve adjustment in its form for that quarter filed with the sec on august,after the secondary offering.the form recited that it was prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission,and that the disclosures contained herein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.thus,plaintiffs own complaint discloses that the quarterly financial report,including the employee benefit reserves reversal,was prepared in accordance with gaap principles otherwise,it would not have been prepared pursuant to the sec regulations.as plaintiffs do not challenge the form in this regard,their complaint does not state a claim based upon with gaap.w hile notice pleading does not demand that a complaint expound the facts,a plaintiff who does so is bound by such exposition.bender suburban,cir see hemenway peabody coal,cir p laintiffs pleaded themselves out of court on the fraud theory.
second,although not clearly stated in the rambling complaint,plaintiffs appear to allege that,even if consistent with gaap principles,the reserves reversal was unwarranted in fact.plaintiffs further allege that this accounting adjustment was material because it caused acxiom reported quarterly earnings,per share,to be overstated by per share and thus permitted acxiom to meet analysts quarterly earnings expectations by means of accounting adjustments and manipulations.we disagree.
to satisfy the requirement that a misstatement be material,there must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.tsc industries,northway,d quotation omitted see basic levinson,d.a complaint that alleges only immaterial misrepresentations presents an insuperable bar to relief.parnes gateway,cir quotation omitted.though materiality is a question of fact,a court may determine as a matter of law,that the alleged misrepresentation is immaterial,if a reasonable investor could not have been swayed by the alleged misrepresentation.gateway,at.
here,the background portions of the complaint state,and the acxiom financial statements in the record on appeal confirm,that the reserve adjustment was the result of a september merger that required acxiom to merge separate employee benefit plans.a million adjustment to employee benefit reserves would not be unusual in these circumstances.even if arguably unwarranted,such an adjustment would not be a material in the narrative portion of a prospectus reporting quarterly earnings of million on revenues of million,so long as the adjustment was made in accordance with gaap principles.in gateway,we upheld a rule dismissal because a two percent overstatement of assets by a investment opportunity would not have significantly altered the total mix of information available to a reasonable investor.at.for the same reason,this theory was properly dismissed.
b.the allowance for doubtful accounts issue.plaintiffs allege that acxiom overstated the quarterly earnings reported in the prospectus by per share when it decreased its allowance for doubtful accounts from million to million despite a million increase in accounts receivables and an increase in its days sales outstanding the average number of days it takes to collect accounts receivables,which signaled the company was having problems collecting from customers.relying on gateway,the district court concluded that this alleged omission was not material as a matter of law because a reasonable investor would not have been put off by a decrease of this magnitude.at.we agree.
plaintiffs argue that the alleged doubtful accounts misstatement is material standing alone because,by inflating the most recent quarterly earnings by per share,it permitted acxiom to meet analysts expectations on the eve of the stock offering.we agree that earnings trends are important to potential investors in a growth company like acxiom therefore,misstating income so as to meet analysts expectations can be significant to a reasonable investor.see ganino citizens util,cir.but the allowance for doubtful accounts is a balance sheet account.the net increase or decrease in that account over the course of a quarterly,the upon which plaintiffs exclusively a combination of additions charged to costs and expenses minus net bad debts written off during the period.only the additions charged to costs and expenses affect earnings and reflect the company estimate of doubtful accounts resulting from sales for that accounting period.plaintiffs do not allege what those additions were for the quarter ending june,nor do they allege that those additions were insufficient based upon acxiom accounts receivable and days sales outstanding for that period,nor do they allege that acxiom made a adjustment to the account during that quarter that directly affected quarterly earnings.in fact,acxiom additions charged to costs and expenses totaled for that calendar quarter.in these circumstances,plaintiffs allegation that a net change of in the allowance account caused the earnings reported in the narrative portion of the prospectus to be materially misleading fails to state a claim.
c.the allstate contract issue.the sec regulations require disclosure of t he name of any customer and its relationship,if any,with the registrant or its subsidiaries if sales to the customer are equal to percent or more of the registrant consolidated revenues and the loss of such customer would have a material adverse effect on the registrant.c vii.in the prospectus,acxiom disclosed that its largest client,allstate,represented of its revenues in fiscal year.the prospectus also disclosed that m any of our clients typically operate under contracts and that approximately of our revenue was derived from contracts in fiscal.it did not disclose that on april,acxiom and allstate had entered into a new data management outsourcing agreement.however,a copy of the new allstate contract was attached to acxiom form for fiscal,which was filed with the sec on june,and incorporated by reference in the july prospectus.
plaintiffs complaint alleges that the prospectus was materially misleading because it failed to disclose that the new allstate contract would result in lower pricing for traditional services performed by acxiom and represented a negative trend for acxiom in that the price reductions were reflective of the adverse competitive environment in which acxiom was working.plaintiffs supported these allegations by quoting from acxiom august form 
services segment revenues grew when compared to the first quarter in the prior year.allstate,the company largest customer generated revenues of million,a decrease from the prior year,principally due to the revised pricing under the recently signed contract under which pricing has been unbundled which resulted in lower pricing for the traditional services performed by the company in support of the underwriting area.
and by quoting from the august barron article,which reported that o bservers say the allstate contract was proof acxiom is facing stiff new pricing pressure from competitors,and then detailed two pricing changes which make it clear that the company business with allstate wo be as profitable as it has been.
the district court concluded that acxiom disclosed all material facts about the allstate contract,noting that a company has no duty to disparage its own competitive positions in the market where it has provided accurate hard data from which analysts and investors can draw their own conclusions about the company conditions and the value of its stock.in re ultrafem.sec,d,citation omitted.we agree.a five percent decline resulting in gross revenues of million from allstate means that the decline was million,which is not a material decline under gateway for a company whose quarterly revenues totaled million and whose total revenues from that segment of its business increased.citing the barron article,plaintiffs argue that acxiom was required to describe the details of the allstate contract because it reflected a negative trend that acxiom reasonably should have expected to materially impact its future revenues and income.see a ii but one individually negotiated contract with a major customer does not establish or even effectively allege a competitive trend,particularly here,where the barron author attributed his information about increased competition to observers and,and acxiom disclosed that its business was highly competitive in both the prospectus and,in greater detail,its june form.
in these circumstances,we conclude that acxiom failure to describe the expected impact of the new allstate contract did not make the prospectus materially misleading.acxiom obviously believed that contracts in general,and the new allstate contract in particular,were in its best business interests.the contract had been in effect for three months and its impact on revenues and earnings was speculative at best.the prospectus made no affirmative representations concerning this contract and incorporated by reference acxiom recently filed form,where the entire contract appeared as an exhibit.while this type of incorporation by reference might not be sufficient to disclose an obviously material recent event or development,we should not lightly subject companies to liability for failing to describe or predict the possible impact of specific customer contracts.as the supreme court said in tsc industries,at.
some information is of such dubious significance that insistence on its disclosure may accomplish more harm than good n ot only may the corporation and its management be subjected to liability for insignificant omissions or misstatements,but also management fear of exposing itself to substantial liability may cause it simply to bury the shareholders in an
