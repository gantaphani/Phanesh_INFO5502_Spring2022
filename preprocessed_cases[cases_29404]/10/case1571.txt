facts and proceedings 
allstate insurance company employs several hundred auto field adjusters in california.auto field adjusters travel to sites such as body shops to inspect,and analyze the value of,damaged vehicles.in,allstate changed the classification of its auto field adjusters from salaried employees to hourly employees in response to litigation challenging their misclassification as employees exempt from the protection of overtime wage laws.jimenez allstate ins,no.la cv wl,jimenez.
auto field adjusters receive their daily work schedules of vehicle inspection appointments by logging onto allstate work force management system software loaded onto their work laptops.although the adjusters are hourly employees entitled to overtime if they work more than hours a day or hours a week,the work force management system software is not a time record keeping program,nor does allstate maintain any other time clock system an allstate executive testified in deposition is there any timekeeping system such as a time clock or a computer and system that auto adjusters punch in and punch out in order to keep track of the start and the end of their day no timekeeping,punch out system,no.is there any timekeeping system of any type,whether it a time clock,a computer system or a manual system,that records the actual start time and the actual end time of the auto adjuster workday no.rather than track the actual hours an adjuster works,the work force management system instead presumes each adjuster workday begins when the adjuster arrives at his first appointment of the day.as the allstate executive explained,their day begins at the first stop.
allstate presumption that an adjuster workday begins with the first appointment as set by the work force management system does not take into account any work the adjuster may have performed before the day first appointment.as the allstate executive explained in deposition,q.the workday upon which the system is based assumes that the workday begins at the first appointment,correct yes t he workday upon which the system is based does not take into account any work that may have been done before the first appointment is that right that correct.the system does take into account anything that somebody might have done prior to that first assignment.
belying allstate assumption of an hour workday,appellant submitted declarations from numerous adjusters stating they typically worked more than hours a day and hours a week after allstate reclassified them from salaried to hourly employees.among the overtime tasks those adjusters declared they performed outside their shifts were logging onto their work computers,downloading their assignments,making courtesy calls to auto repair shops and car owners to confirm appointments,checking their voice mail,and traveling to and from their first and last appointments of the day.for an adjuster to work overtime,allstate official company policy required the adjuster to get his supervisor prior approval.but the adjusters declarations stated the adjusters hesitated to request overtime because they did not want to be perceived as bad employees.
in,appellant christopher williams filed a class action complaint for himself and all others similarly situated.the complaint sought class certification for all allstate auto field adjusters working in california,a group of several hundred employees defined as all auto adjusters in california that perform field inspections using the workforce management system wfms with the title claim adjuster,senior claim adjuster,staff claim adjuster,claim service adjuster,senior claim service adjuster,staff claim service adjuster,appraiser,claim representative,claim specialist and claim consultant.the complaint alleged allstate had a policy and practice of not compensating adjusters for work performed before they arrived at their first vehicle inspection of the day and for work performed after completing the last inspection of the day.the complaint alleged various wage violation causes of action.
appellant moved for class certification.at the december class certification hearing,the trial court found evidence in the record supports a class of auto field adjusters with respect to claims that are performed inspection and inspection in connection with logging on and off the computer timekeeping system,including,but not limited to,setting voicemail messages and checking for schedule and travel changes.the court therefore certified an off the clock class,defined as allstate auto field adjusters from january,to the present,to the extent that allstate failed to pay for work for the following specific tasks performed prior to the first inspection of the day logging on and off computer systems,preparing and checking voicemail messages,checking for schedule and travel changes,obtaining directions to the first inspection if there is a travel change,and making courtesy calls.
half a year later in june,the united states supreme court handed down its decision in wal mart stores,dukes,d dukes.dukes involved class certification of million current and former female wal mart employees from stores who alleged wal mart denied them promotions or pay raises because of their gender.id.at.the supreme court noted that the million nationwide claimants were required to prove that thousands of store managers had the same discriminatory intent in preferring men over women for promotions and pay raises.the supreme court found the women could not pursue their claims as a class action because they lacked evidence that they did not receive promotions or pay raises for the same reason,namely their gender.in reversing class certification,dukes found that there was no unifying theory holding together literally millions of employment decisions.id.at.
in a trial court status conference in july one month after dukes,the parties and trial court discussed dukes.the trial court thereafter permitted allstate to file a motion based on dukes for decertification of the off the clock class.in its decertification motion,allstate emphasized two points from dukes.first,there must be some glue holding the class members claims together,such that common facts can resolve the claims for everyone in the class.and,second,a using statistical sampling is an improper means to try class claims,as it deprives a defendant of due process by precluding a defendant from proving its individual defenses against each class member.allstate told the trial court,in light of the supreme court decision in wal mart stores,dukes,supra,which the court admitted changed the relevant legal landscape for this case,and additional discovery since the class certification order,it is apparent that the close call on certification must be reversed.
the trial court agreed,and decertified the off the clock class as well as a corresponding unfair competition claim.relying on dukes,the trial court written order stated allstate decertification motion is granted because dukes,supra.has changed the law.the trial court concluded that after dukes,allstate is entitled to litigate its defenses to the claims of each individual class member.allstate defenses included purported evidence that not all adjusters worked off the clock,and for that portion of those adjusters who might have worked off the clock,their time was de minimis.see anderson clemens pottery.a few seconds or minutes of work beyond the scheduled working hours are mere trifles and may be disregarded.according to the trial court order,a trial in which allstate presents evidence of affirmative defenses to more than individuals would be unmanageable,making class certification inappropriate.
appellant filed in this court a petition for writ of mandate,which we summarily denied.appellant then filed a petition for review by our supreme court.our supreme court granted the petition and returned the matter to us with directions to issue an order to show cause why the relief sought in appellant petition should not be granted.we issued the order to show cause,received further briefing,and held argument.

dukes discussion of affirmative defenses does not support decertification dukes,sec.iii at 
the trial court based its decertification order on dukes,stating after dukes,allstate is entitled to litigate its defenses to the claims of each individual class member.according to the court,allstate entitlement in the wake of dukes to individually litigate its defenses against each adjuster off the clock claims made those claims unmanageable as a class action.those defenses included purported evidence that a particular adjuster did not work off the clock,or if he did,allstate did not know about it,and,any time worked off the clock was de minimis.
the trial court erred in concluding dukes required decertification.in dukes,a nationwide class of million current and former female employees from stores sued wal mart,alleging that the company engaged in a pattern or practice of gender discrimination in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of.the female plaintiffs were required to prove that thousands of store managers shared the same discriminatory animus toward women in denying them promotions and pay raises.the supreme court reversed the district court certification order on the grounds that the plaintiffs could not offer significant proof that wal mart operated under a general policy of discrimination.in reversing class certification,the court found that there was no unifying theory holding together literally millions of employment decisions that turned on the subjective intents of thousands of supervisors in thousands of stores to explain for each class member the crucial question why was i disfavored for a promotion or pay raise.italics original.dukes,supra.at see espinoza assocs.llc,distinguished dukes where claims were based on the countless subjective decisions made by wal mart local supervisors regarding compensation and promotions from worker overtime claims where workers alleged employer failed to pay minimum wages and overtime compensation as a result of certain policies and practices.see also ross rbs citizens,cir,judgment vacated and matter remanded for further reconsideration in light of comcast behrend,d distinguishing dukes in case involving class members who alleged they were unlawfully denied overtime because of the employer unofficial policy which was the glue holding together the class members based on the common question of whether an unlawful overtime policy prevented employees from collecting lawfully earned overtime compensation.
we agree with those courts that have found dukes distinguishable in comparable situations.because dukes involved federal class action law,our analysis starts briefly with rule of the federal rules of civil procedure frcp.subpart a of rule establishes four requirements for a class action,commonly identified with shorthand expressions as numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation.dukes,supra.at.subpart b of rule recognizes three types of class actions.a proposed class plaintiff must fall under the definition of one of those three types from subpart b in order to proceed as a class action.see frcp,rule b comcast behrend,supra.at wang chinese daily news,cir,wl,ellis costco wholesale,in addition to the threshold requirements of rule a,plaintiffs seeking class certification must also satisfy one of the prongs of rule b.one type of class action involves injunctive or declaratory relief that remedies the injury of all class members.rule b provides a class action may be maintained if rule a regarding numerosity is satisfied and if the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole frcp rule b.
the portion of dukes on which the trial court decertification order focused was dukes discussion of prosecution of a title vii gender discrimination claim under rule b.dukes noted that rule b does not apply when a injunction will not provide relief to the aggrieved plaintiffs.dukes explained,rule b applies only when a single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class.it does not authorize class certification when each individual class member would be entitled to a different injunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant.italics original.dukes,supra.at nor,dukes noted,does rule b apply where the primary relief sought is individualized monetary claims.see ries.bevs.usa llc,hornell brewing,ellis costco wholesale,supra,at.dukes held that money damages must be no more than an incidental component of the class claim when the class is proceeding under rule b.because the female employees in dukes were seeking back pay as their principal form of relief,dukes held we conclude that the female employees claims for backpay were improperly certified under rule b.our opinion in an earlier case expressed serious doubt about whether claims for monetary relief may be certified under rule b.we now hold that they may not,at least where as here the monetary relief is not incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief.dukes at.
despite the trial court turning to dukes analysis of the restrictions on,if not outright unavailability of,money damages under rule b to explain the trial court decertification order,appellant was not pursuing a b type of class action.appellant instead sought class certification under california class action statute,code of civil procedure section section is analogous to subpart a of rule,which establishes the four requirements of a class action.in re tobacco ii cases cal th,d.the trial court reliance on dukes analysis of subpart b of rule a class action seeking injunctive relief was thus misplaced because appellant class members here were seeking principally,if not exclusively,monetary damages,that the federal rules establish is a different type of class action.compare rule b with b and b dukes,supra.at monetary claims belong in rule b.more fundamentally,the concern expressed in dukes about the unmanageability of trying million claims which depended on proof of the subjective intents of thousands of individual supervisors is not present here.appellant asserts there is a companywide policy to deny overtime pay.the resolution of that issue does not involve the subjective intents of countless supervisors.
the supreme court second area of focus in part iii of dukes involved the statutory affirmative defenses in the statute title vii.because the affirmative defenses were statutory,dukes concluded a class proceeding could not deprive wal mart of its right to present those defenses.dukes,supra.at.as those affirmative defenses required individualized evidence,dukes disapproved a trial by formula of wal mart affirmative defenses because it prevented wal mart from offering its individualized evidence.id.at.under a trial by formula,the trial court will accept evidence from a statistically derived representative subset of several hundred wal mart female employees to determine the percentage who suffered gender discrimination and to calculate the average back pay of the women in that subset.the trial court will then conduct several mathematical operations involving the percentage,the average back pay,and the size of the entire class to calculate the entire class recovery.the details of that calculation are unimportant here other than to note that dukes rejected such an approach.id.at.the dukes court rejected this novel project,of trial by formula holding that wal mart was entitled to litigate its statutory defenses to the individual claims of each member seeking backpay.in re tft lcd flat panel antitrust litigation wl.
trial by formula is a method of calculating damages damage calculations have little,if any,relevance at the certification stage before the trial court and parties have reached the merits of the class claims.at the certification stage,the concern is whether class members have raised a justiciable question applicable to all class members.although allstate may have presented evidence that its official policies are lawful,this showing does not end the inquiry.jimenez,supra,wl.here,the question is whether allstate had a practice of not paying adjusters for time.ibid.the answer to that question will apply to the entire class of adjusters.if the answer to that question is yes which is the answer the trial court initially assumed when it first certified the off the clock class,and is the answer we must presume in reviewing decertification brinker,supra,cal th at,d,then,in dukes phrase,that answer is the glue that binds all the class members.dukes,supra.at a class requires the glue of a single answer for a question applicable to all class members.if some adjusters had more uncompensated time off the clock than other adjusters,that difference goes to damages.but differences in the amount of individual damages do not by themselves defeat class certification.stearns ticketmaster cir,yokoyama midland life ins.cir,contrast comcast behrend,supra.at under federal class action rules,differences in method of calculating damages arising from individualized damages may defeat certification of class of million subscribers.as a general rule if the defendant liability can be determined by facts common to all members of the class,a class will be certified even if the members must individually prove their damages.brinker at,d.indeed,in initially certifying the off the clock class,the trial court necessarily rejected allstate argument that the varying amounts of allegedly unpaid back pay defeated class certification.in opposing the original certification order,allstate noted it had submitted numerous declarations attesting to the fact that adjusters do not work off the clock.moreover testimony proffered by appellant varies greatly as to the type of tasks supposedly performed off the clock the frequency of this work and the length of time it took.indeed,appellant testimony about his alleged off the clock work is dramatically different from the experience of other adjusters.allstate argument notwithstanding,the court original certification order found common issues of law and fact predominate for the off the clock class,thereby implicitly rejecting allstate contention that varying damages defeated class certification.accord jimenez,supra,wl,class plaintiffs failure to show statistical sampling was a proper method of calculating individual damages did not defeat class certification with respect to liability because individualized calculation of damages does not defeat certification.
in fact,the federal district court in a companion proceeding against allstate involving allstate failure to pay overtime to adjusters other than auto field adjusters has rejected an argument similar to what allstate asserts here.in jimenez,supra,wl,allstate claims adjusters assigned to offices throughout the state filed a federal class action against allstate in which they alleged multiple labor violations,including unpaid overtime and wrongful denial of meal and rest periods.relevant to our case here,the jimenez plaintiffs alleged a policy of discouraging and limiting overtime.in response,allstate asserted two affirmative defenses precluded class certification.allstate asserted it did not have constructive or actual knowledge that plaintiff and other class members were working and the amount of unpaid overtime is de minimis.finding the affirmative defenses did not defeat class certification,the federal court explained that with respect to allstate de minimis defense,it can be addressed through representative testimony with respect to whether allstate had actual or constructive knowledge of the unpaid overtime,the standard of constructive knowledge is amenable to class treatment.thus,plaintiff need not demonstrate that every manager knew every time an employee worked instead,plaintiff can demonstrate that allstate should have known that its employees were regularly working as a result of its policies regarding the reporting of overtime,the recording of time worked by claims adjusters,its insistence on having its supervisory personnel monitor all requests for overtime,and the position of certain of its managerial personnel about the need to limit overtime for budgetary or other reasons.further,as discussed above,allstate will have an opportunity to raise these defenses with the representative witnesses.in sum,when compared to the manner of proof as to common questions,these defenses do not raise sufficiently individualized questions that either preclude certification or make a class process unfair.id.at.certifying the overtime class,the district court found the claims adjusters had shown the existence of the following common questions warranted class treatment i whether allstate had a common and widespread practice of not following its polic
