defendant appellant the bank of new york mellon bank appeals from the district court order remanding this case to state court after the bank removed the case pursuant to the class action fairness act cafa removal provision in b.because we conclude that the cafa securities exception,d,applies to this case,we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
plaintiff appellant eminence investors,eminence,originally brought suit against the bank in california state court in.almost two years later,eminence filed a first amended complaint complaint,adding class allegations on behalf of more than class members and requesting compensatory damages expected to exceed million for each of four causes of action.the bank is the successor to the indenture trustee under an indenture of trust indenture dated november,governing the administration of the jensen ranch public financing authority river ranch project revenue bonds,series a bonds issued by the jensen ranch public finance authority.the complaint alleges that eminence and other class members have a common interest as holders of the bonds against the bank as their fiduciary.the complaint includes causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and gross negligence as well as a request for injunctive relief.
within thirty days of the filing of the complaint,the bank removed the action to federal court.eminence then moved to remand the case to state court,arguing that removal was untimely and that the cafa securities exception applied.the district court ultimately agreed with eminence regarding the untimeliness of the removal under b and remanded the case to state court without reaching the securities exception issue.
normally,a n order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal.d.however,in cases that fall under cafa,a court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the state court from which it was removed.id.c.the bank relied exclusively on cafa jurisdiction when removing the case and no other source of jurisdiction is apparent from the record.any jurisdiction over this appeal is therefore predicated on the applicability of cafa.we do not have jurisdiction if the cafa securities exception applies to this case.
the bank argues that eminence waived the securities exception argument by omitting it from its opposition to the petition for permission to appeal.regardless of whether eminence has waived the argument,however,this court is bound to consider jurisdictional defects sua sponte.united states pac.transp,cir.
three categories of cases are expressly exempted from cafa removal.d.virtually identical language is used in d to describe the cases excluded from original jurisdiction under cafa.the third removal exception,which for the sake of simplicity we refer to as the securities exception,see greenwich fin.servs.distressed mortg.fund llc countrywide fin,cir,is the only one relevant to this appeal.we have not yet had occasion to construe the language of the securities exception.
under this exception,cafa removal does not apply to 
any class action that solely involves a claim that relates to the rights,duties including fiduciary duties,and obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to any security as defined under section a of the securities act of a and the regulations issued thereunder.
d.thus,the securities exception applies if all of the claims in the class action have a particular kind of relationship with a security.each claim must relate to certain rights,duties,or obligations those rights,duties,or obligations must be related to or created by or pursuant to a security and that security must meet the definition established in a and the regulations issued thereunder.
neither party disputes that the bonds fit within the relevant definition of security under the last part of the exception.nor does either party dispute that the issuance of the bonds gave rise to rights,duties,and obligations between the holders of the bonds,the borrower,and the indenture trustee.the disputed issue is whether all of the claims in the complaint relate to the rights,duties,and obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to the bonds.
eminence complaint asserts five causes of action against the bank.the first three causes of action are for breach of fiduciary duty,based respectively on nondisclosure,loyalty,and due care.all three allege that b y reason of the indenture,the bank,as fiduciary and agent for eminence,owed fiduciary duties to eminence,and that the bank set out to create and did in fact create a special relationship of trust and confidence,and thereby owed eminence a fiduciary duty.these causes of action allege that the bank breached its duties in various ways by failing to disclose certain information to eminence by taking certain actions that harmed the collateral for the deed of trust and ultimate security for the note,including selling other properties for less than market value and without guaranteeing access rights and by taking similar actions including failing to record the indenture in a timely manner.the third cause specifically alleges that the bank further owed professional duties under applicable state and federal laws,industry standards,and professional codes of ethics.
the fourth cause of action is for gross negligence,and the allegations closely follow the allegations made in the third cause of action,including allegations that the bank was under a duty to perform its work with due care and that the bank owed further professional duties.the fifth cause of action is entitled injunctive relief it appears to be a request for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction,rather than an independent cause for relief.
the duties the bank allegedly owed to eminence all stem from the current relationship between the bank and eminence based on their positions with respect to the bonds.although neither the bank nor eminence were parties to the original transaction,the bank is now the successor to the indenture trustee,and eminence holds some of the bonds.all of the duties allegedly breached by the bank,such as the fiduciary duties supporting the first three causes of action and the duties supporting the gross negligence cause of action,arise out of the bank position as indenture trustee and eminence corresponding position as holder of the bonds.
although it is true that eminence causes of action also rely on various sources of law including the state and federal laws,industry standards,and professional codes of ethics mentioned in the complaint that are not part of the bonds themselves or the indenture governing their administration,the same would also be true of any cause of action that relates to the duties created by a security,because the cause would at least rely on those provisions of contract law necessary to construe and apply the security.the causes of action stated in the complaint are based on alleged duties,and those alleged duties arise from the bonds and the indenture.in fact,eminence conceded at oral argument that if the indenture did not exist,eminence would have no cause of action against the bank.thus,we conclude that under any plausible interpretation of the statutory language,all of the causes of action in the complaint relate to the rights,duties,and obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to the bonds,so the securities exception must apply.
the bank argues that the securities exception should not apply because some of the allegations underlying the causes of action involve the transfer of the district property,which was completely unrelated to the bonds or the original transaction that created the bonds.however,the complaint makes clear that the district property transaction is relevant to eminence causes of action because the bank breached its fiduciary duties by authorizing the sale of the district lands to a private party to the financial detriment of the development property.thus,the district property allegations are only relevant to eminence causes of action against the bank because the bank allegedly owed eminence and ot
