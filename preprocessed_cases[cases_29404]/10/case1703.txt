plaintiff ronald mark appeals from a judgment of dismissal entered after the trial court sustained a demurrer to his first amended complaint without leave to amend.the complaint sought enforcement of an agreement between mark and defendant jeffrey spencer to divide fees awarded to them as cocounsel representing the plaintiffs in an earlier class action lawsuit.mark contends his failure to disclose the agreement to the court in the class action,as required by california rules of court,rule did not preclude him from bringing a separate action to enforce the agreement.
we conclude the trial court did not err in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.rule was designed to protect class members from potential conflicts of interest with their attorneys by requiring the full disclosure of all fee agreements in any application for dismissal or settlement of a class action.rule would be effectively nullified if attorneys could conceal a agreement from the court in seeking approval of a class action settlement and later enforce the agreement in a separate action.
as a separate and independent basis for upholding the trial court action,we conclude mark claims are barred by res judicata.mark was provided a fair opportunity to litigate the agreement before the court in the class action.because the class action court fully and finally determined the attorneys respective entitlement to fees,mark may not relitigate the issue here.we therefore affirm the judgment.

discussiona.mark failure to disclose the agreement in the capelouto action bars its enforcement here 
as mark recognizes,agreements create a potential conflict of interest between the client and the attorneys.one potential conflict concerns the amount of fees charged to the client.for example,a agreement,like the one here,which contemplates the attorneys will perform their reasonable share of the joint representation,and have equal duties and responsibilities in the litigation might prompt the attorney who performed less work on the case to pad the bills to create the appearance he or she had performed the requisite share of the work.
a second potential conflict concerns the attorneys tactical decisions in the litigation.for example,if one attorney subject to an agreement to split fees equally discovers he or she is spending far more time on the case than cocounsel,the attorney may push for an early settlement to stem the losses.conversely,an attorney spending less time on the case may wish to drag the litigation out,knowing he or she will eventually recover fees disproportionately larger than those actually earned.
in recognition of such conflicts,rules of professional conduct,rule a provides,in relevant part a member shall not divide a fee for legal services with a lawyer who is not a partner of,associate of,or shareholder with the member unless the client has consented in writing thereto after a full disclosure has been made in writing that a division of fees will be made and the terms of such division and the total fee charged by all lawyers is not increased solely by reason of the provision for division of fees and is not unconscionable as that term is defined in rule.

in chambers,the supreme court considered whether a party to an undisclosed agreement could later enforce the contract.there,two attorneys entered into a agreement to act a cocounsel in a sexual harassment case.under the agreement,lead counsel agreed to pay the other attorney of the percent contingency fee called for in the retainer agreement with the client.chambers,supra,cal th at,d.in violation of rules of professional conduct,rule,the attorneys never obtained the client approval of the agreement.during discovery in the sexual harassment case,the lead counsel fired his cocounsel,but reaffirmed the agreement.after the jury in the sexual harassment case awarded the client substantial compensatory and punitive damages,the lead counsel refused to honor the agreement.id.at,d.
the discharged attorney sued in a separate action to enforce the agreement.the supreme court affirmed summary judgment for the defendant on the breach of contract claim because the attorneys failed to obtain their client approval of the agreement.although rules of professional conduct,rule does not specify any penalty for its violation,the court determined that allowing an attorney t
