background 
plaintiff james briggs brings this suit under against the commissioner of the connecticut department of social services dss to enforce the food stamp act time limits for awarding food stamp benefits.e and provide that participating states shall give such benefits within days of application to eligible households,and within days of application to especially needy households that qualify for expedited benefits.plaintiff sued in the united states district court for the district of connecticut to enforce these time limits,and moved to certify a class of similarly situated plaintiffs.
the district court bryant,certified a class consisting of all past,current,and future connecticut food stamp applicants whose applications are not processed in a timely manner.the district court also found that there was credible evidence that there is ongoing,persistent systemic failure to comply with the strict unambiguous mandates imposed by the food stamp act,and entered a preliminary injunction requiring the dss to process food stamp applications within the statutory deadlines.briggs bremby,wl at.defendant now appeals,arguing a that the food stamp act does not give plaintiff a right to the timely receipt of food stamps and,therefore,that plaintiff can not seek to enforce these time limits under,and b that,in any event,federal regulations excuse the dss from abiding by the seeming statutory deadlines for providing food stamp benefits.

where allegations of error in a preliminary injunction involve questions of law,our review is de novo.am.express fin.advisors thorley,cir.
plaintiff can maintain a private lawsuit under to enforce the statutory time limits in e and 
the state plan of operation shall provide that the state agency shall thereafter promptly determine the eligibility of each applicant household by way of verification of income household size in any case such size is questionable,and such other eligibility factors as the secretary determines to be necessary so as to complete certification of and provide an allotment retroactive to the period of application to any eligible household not later than thirty days following its filing of an application.
the state plan of operation shall provide that the state agency shall a provide benefits no later than days after the date of application to any household which i i has gross income that is less than per month or ii is a destitute migrant or a seasonal farmworker household in accordance with the regulations governing such households in effect july,and ii has liquid resources that do not exceed.
in blessing freestone,d,the supreme court established a test for determining whether a federal law creates a right that can presumptively be enforced by private suit through congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence,and the statute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the states.id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the court has further clarified that it is rights,not the broader or vaguer benefits or interests,that may be enforced under,and that nothing short of an unambiguously conferred right will support a cause of action under.gonzaga university doe,d.if these requirements are met,then there is a rebuttable presumption that the statutory right can be enforced through.id.at.
the two statutory time limits at issue in this case clearly meet the second and third prongs of the blessing test.they establish a right that is neither vague nor amorphous both provisions require the allotment of food stamps within a definite number of days,and they impose binding obligations on the states both provisions use the mandatory shall.whether congress intended these provisions to benefit food stamp applicants,as the first blessing prong requires,justifies a bit more discussion.
plaintiff argues that the time limits were intended to benefit food stamp applicants by ensuring the prompt provision of food stamps.defendant contends instead that the time limits were meant only to guide the states in how to marshal their resources when administering food stamp programs.three supreme court decisions inform our analysis of whether these statutory provisions are sufficiently focused on benefitting the relevant plaintiffs to be individually enforceable under.
first,in wright city of roanoke redevelopment housing authority,d,the court held that a rent ceiling provision of the public housing act empowered tenants to sue under to collect for past overcharges.the relevant provision,imposed the following rent ceiling requirement on local housing authorities 
dwelling units assisted under this chapter shall be rented only to families who are lower income families at the time of their initial occupancy of such units.reviews of family income shall be made at least annually.a family shall pay as rent for a dwelling unit assisted under this chapter the highest of the following amounts,rounded to the nearest dollar 
per centum of the family monthly adjusted income 
per centum of the family monthly income or 
if the family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency and a part of such payments,adjusted in accordance with the family actual housing costs,is specifically designated by such agency to meet the family housing costs,the portion of such payments which is so designated.
wright,at internal quotation marks omitted.
this rent ceiling provision was part of a detailed statutory scheme that established requirements for state and local housing authorities.but despite the fact that the statute was directed at government agencies,the court in wright held that the rent ceiling provision was enacted to benefit tenants.see wright at.in drawing this conclusion,the court focused on the fact that the provision was calibrated to the economic needs of individual families,determining each family rent based on a percentage of their monthly income.according to the court,this constituted powerful evidence that the provision was intended to benefit the families,and not merely to direct the allocation of government resources.see id.at the rent ceiling provision could not be clearer tenants could be charged as rent no more and no less than percent of their income.this was a mandatory limitation focusing on the individual family and its income.the intent to benefit tenants is undeniable.
subsequently,in wilder virginia hospital association,d,the court found a private right of action under to enforce a reimbursement provision of the medicaid act.wilder involved a statutory provision,a a,that required state medicaid plans to provide reasonable and adequate rates of reimbursement for health care providers treating needy individuals.in relevant part,a a stated the following 
a state plan for medical assistance must provide for payment of the hospital services,nursing facility services,and services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded provided under the plan through the use of rates determined in accordance with methods and standards developed by the state which the state finds,and makes assurances satisfactory to the secretary,are reasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities in order to provide care and services in conformity with applicable state and federal laws,regulations,and quality and safety standards 
wilder,at emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted.
this provision was explicitly directed at government actors.it referred to requirements of the state plan and the procedures and policies developed by the state.nonetheless,the court found that its terms were individually enforceable through private lawsuits brought by health care providers under.the court did so in part because the language indicated a clear intent to benefit these providers.id.at there can be little doubt that health care providers are the intended beneficiaries of the reimbursement provision.the provision establishes a sy
