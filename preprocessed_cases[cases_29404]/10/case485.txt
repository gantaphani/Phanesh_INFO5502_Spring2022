opinion of the court 
thomas debenedictis appeals from the order of the district court for the district of new jersey dismissing,as,his securities class action claims pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure against merrill lynch,merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,merrill lynch group,fam distributors,merrill lynch investment managers,fund asset management,and princeton services,collectively merrill.debenedictis central claim is that merrill fund registration statements registration statements,which are comprised of the merrill lynch global growth fund.prospectus prospectus and a separate statement of additional information sai,misled investors by failing to disclose that class b shares were never a rational choice of investment for them and that merrill brokers received larger commissions on sales of such shares.debenedictis filed this action on january.
debenedictis argues that the district court erred in determining that the registration statements,certain news articles,and nasd press releases constituted storm warnings sufficient to trigger inquiry notice to debenedictis of his claims prior to january.we will affirm the decision of the district court because we conclude that each of debenedictis claims is.
debenedictis filed this action on january.he alleged in his complaint that he purchased class b shares through his broker at merrill in five funds between february and august.between january,and april,merrill offered four classes of mutual fund shares classes a,b,c,and d collectively,the merrill funds.
the prospectus described these shares as follows 
the fund offers four share classes,each with its own sales charge and expense structure,allowing you to invest in the way that best suits your needs.each share class represents an ownership interest in the same investment portfolio.when you choose your class of shares you should consider the size of your investment and how long you plan to hold your shares.your merrill lynch financial consultant can help you determine which share class is best suited to your personal financial goals.
for example,if you select class a or class d shares,you generally pay a sales charge at the time of purchase.if you buy class d shares,you also pay an ongoing account maintenance fee of.you may be eligible for a sales charge waiver.
if you select class b or class c shares,you will invest the full amount of your purchase price,but you will be subject to a distribution fee of and an account maintenance fee of.because these fees are paid out of the fund assets on an ongoing basis,over time these fees increase the cost of your investment and may cost you more than paying an initial sales charge.in addition,you may be subject to a deferred sales charge when you sell class b or class c shares.
the prospectus contained the following description of the costs involved in purchasing class b and class c shares 
if you select class b or class c shares,you do not pay an initial sales charge at the time of purchase.however,if you redeem your class b shares within four years after purchase or your class c shares within one year after purchase,you may be required to pay a deferred sales charge.you will also pay distribution fees of and account maintenance fees of each year under distribution plans that the fund has adopted under rule.because these fees are paid out of the fund assets on an ongoing basis,over time these fees increase the cost of your investment and may cost you more than paying an initial sales charge.the distributor uses the money that it receives from the deferred sales charges and the distribution fees to cover the costs of marketing,advertising and compensating the merrill lynch financial consultant or other securities dealer who assists you in purchasing fund shares.
the sai also contained a discussion of the fees involved in acquiring class b and class c shares 
investors choosing the deferred sales charge alternatives should consider class b shares if they intend to hold their shares for an extended period of time and class c shares if they are uncertain as to the length of time they intend to hold their assets in select pricing funds.
because no initial sales charges are deducted at the time of the purchase,class b and class c shares provide the benefit of putting all of the investor dollars to work from the time the investment is made.the deferred sales charge alternatives may be particularly appealing to investors that do not qualify for the reduction in initial sales charges.both class b and class c shares are subject to ongoing account maintenance fees and distribution fees however,the ongoing account maintenance and distribution fees potentially may be offset to the extent any return is realized on the additional funds initially invested in class b or class c shares.in addition,class b shares will be converted into class d shares of the fund after a conversion period of approximately eight years,and thereafter investors will be subject to lower ongoing fees.
the sai set forth the compensation payable to the financial consultants as follows 
merrill lynch compensates its financial consultants for selling class b and class c shares at the time of purchase from its own funds.proceeds from the cdsc and the distribution fee are paid to the distributor and are used in whole or in part by the distributor to defray the expenses of dealers including merrill lynch related to providing services to the fund in connection with the sale of the class b and class c shares the combination of the cdsc and the ongoing distribution fee facilitates the ability of the fund to sell the class b and class c shares without a sales charge being deducted at the time of purchase.see distribution plans below.imposition of the cdsc and the distribution fee on class b and class c shares is limited by the nasd sales charge rule.see limitations on the payment of deferred sales charges below.
the sai contained the following information concerning the compensation of merrill sales personnel 
investors should understand that the purpose and function of the initial sales charges with respect to the class a and class d shares are the same as those of the cdscs and distribution fees with respect to the class b and class c shares in that the sales charges and distribution fees applicable to each class provide for the financing of the distribution of the shares of the fund.the distribution related revenues paid with respect to a class will not be used to finance the distribution expenditures of another class.sales personnel may receive different compensation for selling different classes of shares.
the prospectus contained a table setting forth the fees and expenses for the different classes of shares 
this table shows the different fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold the different classes of shares of the fund.future expenses may be greater or less than those indicated below.
shareholder fees fees paid directly from your investment 
a class b shares automatically convert to class d shares about eight years after you buy them and will no longer be subject to distribution fees.
b some investors may qualify for reductions in the sales charge load.
c you may pay a deferred sales charge if you purchase million or more and you redeem within one year.
d the fund pays the manager a fee at the annual rate of of the average daily net assets of the fund not exceeding billion and of the average daily net assets in excess of billion.for the period october,commencement of operations to august,the manager received a fee equal to of the fund average daily net assets.
e the fund calls the service fee an account maintenance fee.account maintenance fee is the term used in this prospectus and all other fund materials.if you hold class b or class c shares for a long time,it may cost you more in distribution fees than the maximum sales charge that you would have paid if you had bought one of the other classes.
f the fund pays the transfer agent for each class a and class d shareholder account and for each class b and class c shareholder account and reimburses the transfer agent expenses.the fund pays a fee for certain accounts that participate in the merrill lynch mutual fund advisor program.the fund also pays a monthly closed account charge,which is assessed upon all accounts that close during the year.this fee begins the month following the month the account is closed and ends at the end of the calendar year.for the period october,commencement of operations to august,the fund paid the transfer agent fees totaling.the manager provides accounting services to the fund at its cost.for the period october,commencement of operations to august,the fund reimbursed the manager for these services.
g in addition,merrill lynch may charge clients a processing fee currently when a client buys or sells shares.
the prospectus also contained the following chart illustrating the cost of class b and class d shares for varying periods of time 
these examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds.
these examples assume that you invest in the fund for the time periods indicated,that your investment has a return each year,that you pay the sales charges,if any,that apply to the particular class and that the fund operating expenses remain the same.this assumption is not meant to indicate you will receive a annual rate of return.your annual return may be more or less than the used in this example.although your actual costs may be higher or lower,based on these assumptions your cost would be 
the sai set forth information regarding how the fee structure for each class affects its long term desirability.
investors not qualifying for reduced initial sales charges who expect to maintain their investment for an extended period of time also may elect to purchase class a or class d shares,because over time the accumulated ongoing account maintenance and distribution fees on class b or class c shares may exceed the initial sales charges and,in the case of class d shares,the account maintenance fee.
on january,debenedictis filed his initial complaint individually and on behalf of class members similarly situated.his theory of liability is two fold first,he alleged that merrill made materially misleading statements in its registration statements in order to induce him and members of the class to purchase class b shares that had higher expenses and lower yields than available alternative shares.second,debenedictis alleged that merrill failed to disclose that its brokers had a conflict of interest in connection with the sale of class b shares because they received a higher rate of compensation from the sale of class b shares than class a or class d shares.debenedictis filed an amended complaint on july.
on november,merrill filed a motion to dismiss debenedictis amended class action complaint pursuant to rule b.merrill argued that through the registration statements,news articles,and national association of securities dealers nasd press releases,debenedictis was on inquiry notice of the claims arising from the purchase of class b shares more than two years before this action was initially filed.merrill attached to its motion articles from usa today and time magazine that were not cited in the amended complaint.the district court took judicial notice of these articles.
the record before the trial court shows that usa today published an article on december,which reported that b rokers can get bigger commissions selling b shares for large though the funds higher annual fees hurt the investor returns in the long run.the article further informed its readers that b shares also typically mean lower performance in the long run.
on january,time magazine published an article entitled b shares get bad grades.it warned investors that i f a broker tries to persuade you to buy shares instead of class a,make sure it in your best interest,not just his.the sec sic is investigating whether certain brokers favor b shares because of fatter commissions.the article also stated that class b shares normally carry high and annual fees and generate lower returns than shares.
on july,the wall street journal published an article which stated in most cases,it better for the client economically,to buy shares when investing more than.
on april,the nasd published a news release announcing that it had censured and fined stifel,nicolaus for making unsuitable recommendations in selling b shares to customers in amounts over when it would have been cost effective for these customers to purchase class a shares.
on october,the nasd issued a news release in which it reported that it had charged the owner of park south securities,llc with multiple violations of securities laws by purchasing large volumes of class b mutual fund shares.it stated this conduct kept his customers from taking advantage of the lower sales charges available through different classes of funds.
in march,the nasd published a report that it had censured and fined dain rauscher,and gary franklin hayden,a registered representative,based on findings that hayden had 
recommended the purchase of class b shares of growth funds to public customers and omitted to inform the customers that they would have benefited sic from investing in class a shares because of the ability to receive discounts on sales charges of large purchases and the lower ongoing fees and expenses of the class a shares.
merrill also presented evidence that on august,nasd announced that it had disciplined a broker because he had made an unsuitable recommendation because the purchase of class b shares,instead of class a shares,resulted in significantly higher commissions.
the district court granted merrill motion to dismiss the amended complaint as untimely.it stated that it was persuaded that the registration statements,coupled with the news articles and nasd press releases,sufficed to trigger inquiry notice.the district court also determined that debenedictis failed to exercise the due diligence expected of reasonable investors of ordinary intelligence.it did not reach the merits of any of debenedictis claims.
debenedictis has filed a timely appeal.we have jurisdiction under.
in his brief before this court,debenedictis summarized his contentions as follows 
in holding the plaintiff claims were untimely as a matter of law,the district court erred by construing the concept of inquiry notice too broadly,as the registration statements and news items cited by the defendants were not sufficient to put a reasonable investor on inquiry notice outside the relevant limitations period.
first,the registration statements were insufficient to put a reasonable investor on inquiry notice because they did not disclose the conflict of interest that the commission structure for class b shares created.the registration statements also did not disclose the magnitude of the risk that investors such as plaintiff would pay excessive sales charges.
second,with the exception of a single article that cast the defendants in a positive light,the news items relied upon by defendants to support their limitations defense involved other brokerage firms and fund companies and were therefore insufficient to put plaintiff on notice of culpable conduct by the defendants in connection with their sale of the funds.
