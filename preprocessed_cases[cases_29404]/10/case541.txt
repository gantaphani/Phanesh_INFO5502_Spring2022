plaintiff appellant,nancy williams williams,is employed by defendant appellee,genex services,llc genex,as a field medical case manager fmcm.she brought this action against genex claiming that genex was required to pay her overtime under the fair labor standards act the flsa or the act,to,and the maryland wage and hour law mwhl,lab.empl.to,for the overtime hours she worked.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of genex.williams appeals,and we now affirm.
the flsa protects all covered workers from substandard wages and oppressive working hours.barrentine arkansas best freight,d see also a noting that the flsa protects the minimum standard of living necessary for health,efficiency,and general of workers.toward these ends,the flsa establishes the general rule that employers must pay overtime compensation to employees who work more than forty hours during a work week.a employees are entitled to overtime compensation according to the general rule unless their employer proves that one of the act many exemptions applies.see arnold ben kanowsky,d noting that the flsa exemptions are to be narrowly construed against the employers seeking to assert them and their application limited to those establishments plainly and unmistakably within their terms and spirit.genex asserts that williams is not entitled to overtime compensation under the general rule because she is employed in a bona fide professional capacity.a.
the flsa provides that any employee employed in a bona fide professional capacity is exempt from the general rule requiring overtime compensation.id.a.the responsibility for outlining the contours of this exemption lies with the secretary of labor the secretary.see id.permitting the secretary to define and delimit various terms in the flsa.the relevant department of labor dol regulations define employee employed in a bona fide professional capacity,as any employee who is c ompensated on a salary or fee basis at a rate of not less than per week,a,and whose primary duty is the performance of work,id.a,r equiring knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction,id.a i,or r equiring invention,imagination,originality or talent in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor,id.a ii 
the dol regulations define primary duty as the principal,main,major or most important duty that the employee performs.id.a.under a,
d etermination of an employee primary duty must be based on all the facts in a particular case,with the major emphasis on the character of the employee job as a whole.factors to consider when determining the primary duty of an employee include,but are not limited to,the relative importance of the exempt duties as compared with other types of duties the amount of time spent performing exempt work the employee relative freedom from direct supervision and the relationship between the employee salary and the wages paid to other employees for the kind of nonexempt work performed by the employee.
the dol regulations recognize that the amount of time spent performing exempt work can be a useful guide in determining whether exempt work is the primary duty of an employee 
e mployees who spend more than percent of their time performing exempt work will generally satisfy the primary duty requirement.time alone,however,is not the sole test,and nothing in this section requires that exempt employees spend more than percent of their time performing exempt work.employees who do not spend more than percent of their time performing exempt duties may nonetheless meet the primary duty requirement if the other factors support such a conclusion.
there is no dispute that williams earns more than per week.however,genex claims that williams primary duty is the performance of work requiring advanced knowledge,in a field of science or learning,that is customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction,and,thus,the exemption,referred to in the dol regulations as the l earned professional exemption,id,applies williams counters by arguing that she is not engaged in the performance of such work.
