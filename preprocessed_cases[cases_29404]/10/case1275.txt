patricia sanford appeals the district court order confirming an arbitration award in her action against memberworks,west corporation,and west telemarketing corporation for alleged violations of and related state law claims.preston and rita smith appeal the district court order denying their motion to intervene in the same action.the district court had jurisdiction under.this court has jurisdiction under.we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
in response to a television advertisement,sanford purchased a set of fitness tapes by phone from ncp marketing,through a call center operated by defendants west corporation and west telemarketing corporation collectively west.at the time,defendant memberworks,had an agreement with ncp under which ncp sales agent,west,would read customers a sales script for a free trial membership in the memberworks essentials program the script was identical or substantially similar to the following 
mr s,for purchasing today,we sending you a membership to essentials,a service designed to save you from leading stores such as express and florsheim,plus reward savings at victoria secret,tj maxx,pier one and target,plus additional savings on eyewear,beauty products,haircuts,and more after days,the service is extended to a full year for just a month,billed annually in advance to the credit card you using today.if you want to cancel,just call the number that appears in your kit in the first days and you wo be billed.so look for that kit in the mail,okay 
according to memberworks records,sanford was enrolled in the essentials program and was sent a membership kit with an agreement containing an arbitration clause sanford has no recollection of having been read a script,agreeing to the trial membership,or receiving a membership kit.when sanford did not cancel at the end of the trial membership,her credit card was billed for a membership.the following year,sanford was charged for renewal of the program,which sanford disputed and which memberworks then refunded.sanford claims this second charge is the first she heard of the essentials program 
on march,sanford filed a claim against memberworks and west for violating,which makes the mailing of unordered merchandise an unfair trade practice,along with state law claims for conversion,unjust enrichment,and fraud.the complaint sought class certification and a jury trial.memberworks then brought a motion which west joined to compel arbitration of sanford individual claim pursuant to the arbitration clause of the membership agreement,to stay the case pending arbitration or alternatively to dismiss for failure to state a claim,and to strike the class allegations.sanford disputed that she had entered a contract with memberworks and argued that the arbitration clause was therefore not binding upon her.
on july,the district court granted memberworks motion to compel arbitration.the court order acknowledged sanford contention that she was unaware that she had enrolled in the essentials program.but it explained that because sanford challenges the validity of the whole contract and not specifically the arbitration agreement,her claim is an issue for the arbitrator and not the court.the district court then denied memberworks request for a stay and denied the motion to strike as moot.
because west did not allege it was a party to any agreement with sanford,the court denied west joinder in the motion to compel arbitration.instead it dismissed the federal claim against west on the ground that west never mailed sanford any unordered merchandise,and it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims against that defendant.as a result,the court explained,the case was terminated as to west.the court further explained that if the arbitration were not completed within twelve months,the court would terminate the remainder of the case.
sanford then brought a petition to arbitrate her complaint before the american arbitration association,which appointed an arbitrator.in a preliminary ruling,the arbitrator ruled that he lacked jurisdiction to certify a class because he interpreted the district court order as compelling arbitration only of sanford individual claim,not the issue of class certification.sanford then moved the district court to reconsider the order compelling arbitration and to certify a class.the district court denied this motion on june,explaining that the july order compelled sanford to arbitrate only her individual claim and dismissed the class claims as moot.sanford then brought a second motion for reconsideration,relying upon the intervening decision green tree financial bazzle,d,which held that the issue of whether a contract permits class arbitration is a question for the arbitrator,not the court.the district court denied this motion as well,explaining that sanford has had the opportunity to request class arbitration of the arbitrator and lost.
on march,the arbitrator issued his final ruling.initially,he held that he lacked jurisdiction to decide sanford contention that no contract was formed between the parties.calling his situation curious,the arbitrator explained that the question of contract formation must be determined by the court before compelling arbitration under that contract.because the district court had compelled arbitration here,he reasoned,it must necessarily have found that a contract existed.the arbitrator jurisdiction stems from the district court order,so he determined he was powerless to revisit that ruling.
but when purporting to decide count i of sanford petition seeking restitution for mailing unordered merchandise in violation of section,the arbitrator then found no contract had been formed.the arbitrator held that even if the script was read to sanford,the basic requirements of offer and acceptance were not met.he therefore awarded sanford in damages plus in interest and in arbitration fees,offset by the reimbursement memberworks had recently paid sanford.the arbitrator found for memberworks on sanford other claims.
the smiths then filed a motion to intervene in the district court to serve as alternative class plaintiffs.shortly thereafter,memberworks moved the district court to confirm the arbitrator award.sanford moved to confirm the arbitrator decision that no contract was formed,but otherwise to vacate the award.on december,the district court denied sanford and the smiths motions,and granted memberworks motion to confirm the arbitration award.
ii.standards of review 
we review de novo a district court order compelling arbitration,its dismissal of the class claims as moot,and its dismissal of the claims against west.see circuit city stores,adams,cir gest bradbury,cir warshaw xoma,cir.our review of the arbitration award is more deferential we will vacate the award only if the arbitrator violated the federal arbitration act or if the award itself is completely irrational or exhibits manifest disregard of the law.coutee barington capital group,cir internal citation omitted.the denial of a motion to intervene as untimely is reviewed for abuse of discretion.smith marsh,cir.
iii.discussion 
before discussing the merits of sanford appeal,we must address defendants claim that sanford waived her right to challenge the july order.in separate motions to dismiss in part,memberworks and west assert that the july order compelling arbitration was an appealable final order under the federal arbitration act.therefore,they assert,sanford should have immediately appealed that order,and any appeal now is untimely under federal rule of appellate procedure 
we begin by noting that through the federal arbitration act,congress sought to move the parties to an arbitrable dispute out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as possible.bushley credit suisse first boston,cir internal citations omitted.to that end,the act generally promote s appeals from orders barring arbitration and limit s appeals from orders directing arbitration.see also b a n appeal may not be taken from an interlocutory order directing arbitration to proceed.defendants invoke an exception to this rule,a,which permits an immediate appeal of a final decision with respect to an arbitration.
the supreme court interpreted this statutory text in green tree financial randolph,d.randolph addressed the appealability of an order compelling arbitration and dismissing plaintiff underlying claims with prejudice.the court held that the statutory phrase final decision should be accorded the meaning that governs appealability under a decision is final if it ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing more for the court to do but execute the judgment.id.at.in that case,the district court ha d ordered the parties to proceed to arbitration,and dismissed all the claims before it.id.at.because the order disposed of the entire case on the merits and left no part of it pending before the district court,the court held that the order was final and therefore appealable.id.at.
we have addressed the divide between appealable and orders compelling arbitration in a trio of cases.in interactive flight technologies,swissair swiss air transport,cir,we held that an order granting defendant motion to compel arbitration and dismissing the action without prejudice constitutes an appealable final decision.by contrast,in dees billy,cir we found that an order compelling arbitration and staying the case was not immediately appealable.dees explained that this order was not final,despite the fact that the court ordered the case administratively closed,because the trial court here did not dismiss plaintiff claim.id.at.the district court had compelled arbitration of the plaintiff malpractice claim,but its failure to dismiss the claim meant that that currently before the trial court.id.at.similarly,in bushley,at,we found an order that compelled arbitration without ruling on defendant motion to stay or dismiss the claim is not final and appealable because the action was effectively stayed pending the conclusion of the arbitration.
applying these principles to the case at bar yields the inescapable conclusion that the july order was not a final decision with respect to an arbitration.while the order compelled sanford to arbitrate her claims against memberworks,the district court did not dismiss those claims.rather,the court stated that it would terminate the case if the arbitration is not completed within twelve months.in a later order,the district court made clear that no final judgment had been issued for purposes of permitting an appeal under section defendants point out that no live claims remained before the court,which later explained that it would only entertain motions relating to the arbitrator final award.but this posture is no different than that presented in dees,where the case was administratively closed pending the results of arbitration.dees,at.because sanford claims were not dismissed,they remain ed before the trial court,id.at,and at most could be described as effectively stayed pending the conclusion of the arbitration,bushley,at.
we therefore conclude that the july order was not a final decision with respect to the arbitration,and sanford appeal of that order now is timely.see am.ironworks erectors,am.const,cir an interlocutory order becomes appealable when final judgment is entered.
b.the order compelling arbitration 
it is axiomatic that a rbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.at t,commc workers of,d.as a result,when one party disputes the making of the arbitration agreement,the federal arbitration act requires that the court proceed summarily to the trial thereof before compelling arbitration under the agreement.we have interpreted this language to encompass not only challenges to the arbitration clause itself,but also challenges to the making of the contract containing the arbitration clause.three valleys mun.water dist.hutton,cir.issues regarding the validity or enforcement of a putative contract mandating arbitration should be referred to an arbitrator,but challenges to the existence of a contract as a whole must be determined by the court prior to ordering arbitration.id 
the parties here do not dispute that sanford challenged the existence of a contract with memberworks,and therefore under three valleys the district court was required to rule upon the contract formation issue before compelling arbitration.their quarrel regards whether the district court in fact did so.sanford claims that the district court misinterpreted three valleys and therefore inappropriately referred the contract formation issue to the arbitrator.memberworks responds that,while the district court did not explicitly find that a contract was formed,the july order should be understood as implicitly having decided this question.
memberworks asserts that the july order was premised on the finding of a contract due to the authorities upon which it relied to support its holding.citibank,wells fargo asia,d.the order correctly stated that it must determine whether a valid agreement to arbitrate exists and cited three valleys at one point,indicating that the court was familiar with the decision.therefore,memberworks argues,it would be unreasonable to construe the order as having referred the contract formation question to the arbitrator.
memberworks argument is unpersuasive.the order could not have implicitly decided the question of contract formation it explicitly refused to decide the question.the operative language from the order reads 
under the faa,the court is limited to determining whether a valid agreement to arbitrate exists,and,if it does,whether the agreement encompasses the dispute at issue.a party challenging the validity of the contract,as a whole,is a question for the arbitrator and not the court.prima paint flood conklin,d.the holding in prima paint extends to attempts to rescind contracts on other grounds.three valleys mun.water dist.hutton,cir.therefore,a plaintiff must challenge the arbitration agreement itself.
here,plaintiff contends that she was not aware that she was part of the membership program until she canceled in february.in essence,she challenges the validity of the contract and not specifically the arbitration agreement.accordingly,this is an issue for the arbitrator and not the court.quotation marks and citations omitted.
the order did not decide that the parties formed a contract.rather,it interpreted prima paint as mandating that the court decide all challenges to an arbitration clause but the arbitrator decide all challenges to the contract as a whole.we rejected this argument in three valleys,which limited prima paint to challenges seeking to avoid or rescind a to challenges going to the very existence of a contract that a party claims never to have agreed to.three valleys,at emphasis in original.the district court lone citation to three valleys thus misconstrues that case the order claims that three valleys extended prima paint,when in fact it limited prima paint by precluding its application to the very issue that sanford presented to the district court 
the order clearly stated that plaintiff conten tion that she was not aware that she was part of the membership program was a challenge to the validity of the whole contract and a ccordingly is an issue for the arbitrator and not the court.this holding is erroneous under three valleys.we must therefore vacate the july order compelling arbitration and remand the case to the district court to determine whether a contract was formed between sanford and memberworks.
class allegations 
sanford also claims that the july order erred in limiting arbitration to her individual claim and dismissing her class allegations as moot she relies primarily upon the supreme court intervening decision in green tree financial bazzle,d,which held that the question whether a contract permits class arbitration is an issue for the arbitrator to decide.we do not reach the merits of this argument.because we vacate the order compelling arbitration of sanford individual claim on other grounds,the class allegations are no longer moot.on remand,sanford shall be permitted to seek relief on a basis.see demando morris,cir reviving plaintiff motion for class certification whe
