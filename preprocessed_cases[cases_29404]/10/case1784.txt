california law permits public agencies such as petitioner california highway patrol chp to seek reimbursement of emergency response costs from any person causing an incident requiring an emergency response as a consequence of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs sometimes referred to as dui.in this writ proceeding we consider which costs a public agency may recover under the governing statute.
the trial court granted summary adjudication to real party in interest esteban allende,concluding that the chp may not recover expenses incurred to enforce the laws that prohibit driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs,including the cost of performing a field sobriety test and making an arrest.the trial court limited recovery to response costs for activities which it deemed unrelated to enforcement of the dui laws,such as directing traffic and ensuring public safety at the accident site,investigating the accident,preparing accident reports,and transporting disabled vehicles.the chp argues that the trial court applied too restrictive a standard,which would compel it to perform an artificial and unworkable allocation of officer response time into recoverable and nonrecoverable components.we agree with the chp and,accordingly,grant a peremptory writ of mandate.
factual and procedural background 
the relevant material facts are undisputed.esteban allende caused an accident while driving under the influence of alcohol.three chp officers responded to the scene.no one was injured and the accident caused what the chp described as minor damage to the two vehicles involved.allende concedes the proximate cause of the accident was the negligent operation of his vehicle.
the chp billed allende for its costs in responding to the accident.the chp claimed hours of officer time at a rate of per hour,itemized as hours for accident investigation,hours for vehicle storage,hours for in custody activities,and hours for traffic control.
the hours billed for accident investigation are described as officer response time,investigation,investigation,and writing reports,including an officer sworn statement form,a dui arrest report form,a vehicle accident report form std,and a traffic collision report form.the billed for vehicle storage includes time spent calling for a tow,waiting for the tow truck,filling out paperwork related to the tow,and otherwise processing the towing of allende vehicle.the three hours for in custody time include time spent on a field sobriety test and allende arrest as well as the transportation,chemical testing,and booking of allende.the for traffic control includes time spent directing traffic,placing flares,and otherwise controlling traffic at the scene of the accident.
allende paid toward the invoice.then he and another person who received a similar chp bill for emergency response expenses associated with a accident,michele grundhoeffer,filed a class action complaint against the chp.in the operative complaint,allende and grundhoeffer seek to certify several classes of persons who received bills from the chp for emergency response expenses in which some or all of the billed services allegedly are not emergency response services.allende and grundhoeffer contend the chp may bill only for goods and services rendered at the scene of an incident or for the salaries of police personnel going to and from the scene.according to the complaint,law enforcement costs incurred for the investigation,detention,arrest,and booking of individuals suspected of a dui offense do not qualify for reimbursement.in addition to seeking declaratory and injunctive relief,the complaint contains causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,restitution,and an equal protection claim that dui defendants are singled out to pay law enforcement costs without being afforded criminal procedural protections.
allende filed a motion for summary adjudication as to three of the causes of action for declaratory relief,seeking a determination that under section the chp may not charge for the cost of his arrest,the cost of services rendered away from the scene of the accident,or the cost of the dui investigation in order to obtain a definitive interpretation of the statutes in question,the chp waived its right to resolve class issues,including whether certification of a class is proper,prior to adjudication on the merits.the parties prepared a stipulated set of undisputed facts in order to permit the court to address the purely legal question of the proper interpretation of sections and.
the trial court granted summary adjudication on the first,second,third,and fourth causes of action,declaring the rights and obligations of the parties under sections and the trial court held that the chp may bill allende only for the expense of the chp emergency response to the accident on march,that arose directly because of the response to the incident.the chp can recover the salaries of the chp officers who have to spend time directly related to an incident.this will include matters such as responding to the scene of an accident,directing traffic and ensuring public safety at the site of the accident,investigating the accident,preparing reports about the accident including,but not limited to form std and form,and transporting any disabled vehicles.the chp may not,however,recover for officer time spent because a driver was driving the vehicle under the influence as prohibited by vehicle code or other vehicle code sections.this will include matters such as performing a field sobriety test,making an arrest,transporting the driver,booking the driver,administering chemical tests,and preparing reports about the potential violation of vehicle code or other vehicle code sections including,but not limited to form.
the court held that costs are not recoverable but that costs for traffic control,vehicle storage,and accident investigation are recoverable.a potential factual dispute arose concerning the allocation of time between recoverable and nonrecoverable components for accident investigation because the time spent preparing reports included preparation of the dui arrest report form,which is not a recoverable expense under the trial court analysis.however,allende conceded that for the purpose of the motion all costs associated with accident investigation could be treated as arising from response to the incident,and the court therefore held the salaries for the full three and a half hours of accident investigation to be recoverable.a triable issue of material fact would have existed but for allende concession,which the trial court stated was based on the factually improbable assumption that the officers spent no time preparing the dui arrest report.the trial court thus concluded the chp may recover of the allende was originally charged.
noting that the interpretation of sections and presents a controlling question of law as to which there are substantial grounds for a difference of opinion,the trial court invited interlocutory review of its ruling,citing code of civil procedure section.the court observed there are four similar cases pending in alameda county,as well as additional similar cases filed in other counties.
the chp thereafter filed in this court a petition for a writ of mandate challenging the trial court order.after we issued an order to show cause,the county of santa clara and the league of california cities submitted a request to file an amicus curiae brief county of santa clara contends the court analysis will not be complete unless we first address what constitutes an incident triggering a public agency right to seek reimbursement of costs under section.because the definition of incident bears upon those costs that are recoverable under the statute,we granted the request to file an amicus brief and afforded the parties an opportunity to respond.

section provides any person who is under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any drug,or the combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and any drug,whose negligent operation of a motor vehicle caused by that influence proximately causes any incident resulting in an appropriate emergency response,and any person whose intentionally wrongful conduct proximately causes any incident resulting in an appropriate emergency response,is liable for the expense of an emergency response by a public agency to the incident.

what qualifies as an incident under section 
the petition requires determination of whether the expense of an emergency response,as defined in section a,includes costs associated with functions performed to investigate and prosecute a violation of the dui laws,as distinct from public safety functions unrelated to potential criminal prosecution.however,before addressing which costs are recoverable,we must first determine what constitutes an incident under section,triggering a public agency right to seek reimbursement.amicus contends the trial court predicated its analysis on the flawed and unduly restrictive assumption that an incident is equivalent to an accident.according to county of santa clara,an arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs qualifies as an incident,regardless of whether the driver causes an accident 
as a general matter we do not consider new arguments raised on appeal by amicus curiae.younger state of california d.however,there are occasions when it is appropriate to do so.see white,city of huntington beach cal d.this is such an occasion.we agree with county of santa clara that the definition of incident is fundamental to the analysis of those costs that are recoverable under sections and a.if a public agency may recover its response costs associated with a dui arrest even when no accident results,such law enforcement costs necessarily would be recoverable when the driver intoxication causes an accident.the issue raised by county of santa clara is a purely legal issue of statutory interpretation and is not dependent upon the development of a factual record in the trial court.moreover,the positions taken by the parties and the trial court are based on assumptions about what constitutes an incident.accordingly,we address the definition of incident as used in section.we have afforded the parties an opportunity to brief the issue.
nowhere in the statute is the term incident defined.based on the plain language of section,however,incident necessarily means something more than the negligent operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant.section contains five elements that must be satisfied before costs may be imposed any person who is under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any drug,whose negligent operation of a motor vehicle caused by that influence proximately causes any incident resulting in an appropriate emergency response,is liable for the expense of an emergency response by a public agency to the incident.the negligent operation of a motor vehicle caused by drinking or drug use must proximately cause the incident requiring an emergency response.thus,the incident and the impaired driving that cause it are distinct events.any other reading would render the word incident superfluous,violating the principle of statutory construction that whenever possible,significance must be given to every word in pursuing the legislative purpose,and the court should avoid a construction that makes some words surplusage.see agnew state bd.of equalization cal th,d.
although an arrest is an event distinct from the negligent driving that prompts it,an arrest following a traffic stop by itself does not qualify as an incident.if the legislature had intended any police intervention involving a person driving under the influence to qualify for recovery of response costs,it could have provided simply that a person is liable for costs incurred by a public agency responding to that person operation of a vehicle while intoxicated.there would have been no need to add the requirement of an incident.moreover,regardless of how one defines incident,the term is followed by language limiting the incidents for which costs may be recovered to those resulting in an appropriate emergency response.it would be a highly strained interpretation to consider stopping a motorist for driving under the influence,without more,as an emergency within the meaning of section.indeed,the vehicle code defines emergency response situation in one context to mean instances in which necessary measures are needed in order to prevent injury or death to persons or to prevent,confine,or mitigate damage or destruction to property,subd.e.while the purpose underlying the prohibition of driving under the influence and the enforcement of that prohibition is of course public safety,that general objective hardly transforms every arrest for dui into an emergency.
county of santa clara contends that interpreting incident as accident would lead to absurd results,arguing that a person who scuffs a lamp post while parking would cause an incident but an intoxicated driver who gives rise to an emergency response by stalling on train tracks would not.but neither the parties nor the trial court have taken the position that an incident must involve an accident.the trial court acknowledged that an event such as abandoning a vehicle in a roadway and impeding or blocking the normal and reasonable movement of traffic may constitute an incident.the chp has chosen as a matter of policy to seek cost recovery only for traffic accidents,but its internal policy documents acknowledge that the statute allows reimbursement for costs associated with any dui incident,not simply accidents.moreover,we are not persuaded that absurd results will follow unless incident is defined to include simple traffic stops resulting in dui arrests.as the trial court recognized,an event not involving an accident may necessitate an emergency response.situations such as the abandonment of a vehicle on railroad tracks,unlike a traffic stop or an arrest at a dui checkpoint,may involve an emergency response to prevent harm to persons or property and require more of a peace officer time and attention than the typical enforcement of the dui laws.
to the extent there is ambiguity in the meaning of incident,we turn to legislative history for guidance.day city of fontana,supra,cal th at,d.the cost recovery statutes,codified in sections through were added to the government code in by senate bill reg.sess.stats,ch.as introduced,senate bill required the occurrence of a accident before a public agency could recover emergency response costs.the initial proposal would have limited cost recovery to situations involving an incident resulting in injury to or death to any person,including the driver,or damage to any property bill reg.sess.as introduced.the legislation was patterned after other laws allowing recovery of costs incurred in responding to fires started negligently or intentionally.see legis.counsel,bill reg.sess.as introduced.the senate subsequently amended senate bill address the admissibility in a subsequent criminal action of testimony in proceedings under the cost recovery it retained the requirement that an incident result in personal injury,death,or property damage in order to permit cost reimbursement.bill reg.sess.as amended.
the assembly judiciary committee next reviewed senate bill and questioned whether the limitation was too narrow what is the rationale for requiring injury or damage in order to trigger liability would it not be more appropriate for liability to arise whenever a public agency reasonably provides emergency services in response to such an incident,whether or not there is damage assem.com.on,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.in response to this concern,the assembly amended the legislation so that reimbursement could be sought for emergency response costs regardless of whether an incident resulted in property damage or personal injury.bill reg.sess.as amended june.the legislature ultimately passed this version of the bill.relying in part on this legislative history,county of santa clara argues that the legislature intended to expand the bill coverage to include arrests.we disagree.while the scope of the statute was expanded to cover more than accidents,there is nothing to indicate the legislature intended to include arrests following ordinary traffic stops.we have found no support in the legislative history for the proposition that an ordinary traffic stop constitutes an emergency response.
county of santa clara claims that when the legislature increased the cost recovery cap in section from to,the author of senate bill clarified that arrests are considered incidents.however,the document on which amicus bases this claim is not cognizable as legislative history.a s a general rule in order to be cognizable,legislative history must shed light on the collegial view of the legislature as a whole.kaufman broad communities,performance plastering,th,d.in the document in question,someone identified as the legislative analyst for the author of senate bill answers questions about the legislature intent in enacting the bill.among other things,the date,source,and purpose of this document are unclear.see id.at,d.based on the context of the discussion,the document appears to have been created after both the enactment of senate bill and the subsequent amendment increasing the cost recovery limit.legislative history,of course,reflects the understanding of the legislature as a whole at the time it enacts a statute.the views of an individual legislator or staffer concerning the interpretation of legislation may not properly be considered part of a statute legislative history,particularly when the views are offered after the statute has already been enacted.id.at,d.
county of santa clara also suggests the legislature has tacitly approved the practice of billing drunk drivers for costs associated with ordinary arrests,claiming the legislature was aware of the practice but left the statute unchanged in this respect when it amended other provisions in the statute.amicus cites newspaper articles from the late indicating that a number of cities were attempting to recover costs associated with dui arrests.the legislative failure to modify a consistent and longstanding administrative interpretation,which the legislature is presumed to know,may reflect legislative approval of the administrative interpretation.see yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d.while this principle may apply when a state agency is charged with administering a particular statutory scheme,it has dubious application when numerous cities and counties are charged with applying state law,particularly when they apply the law inconsistently.even assuming the legislature as a whole was aware of the practices described in the newspaper articles,those articles at most indicate that in the late certain cities chose to pursue reimbursement for dui arrests.the articles do not indicate how widespread or longstanding the practice was.we know,for example,that the chp has not applied the law in the same manner as the cities discussed in the articles.in short,there is no consistent and administrative interpretation of an incident and we decline to presume that in failing to further amend the statute the legislature approved of a particular interpretation followed by a select number of cities.
in response to county of santa clara amicus brief,allende supplied this court with a opinion letter from the legislative counsel addressing whether public agencies may recover costs incurred following dui arrests.opinions of the legislative counsel are not binding on the court,though they may be considered in ascertaining legislative intent.people united states currency th,d.the legislative counsel concluded that in studying the legislative history of these cost recovery statutes,the use of the word incident was used to mean the occurrence of an accident or an event involving more than simply an arrest.ops.cal.legis.counsel,emergency response.noting that the term incident is not defined,the legislative counsel turned to the definition of expense of an emergency response in section a.id.at.the legislative counsel determined that an incident entails more than an arrest because the types of expenses that may be claimed in section a are emergency service costs,suggesting the legislature did not intend the cost of ordinary arrests to be recoverable.ibid.
we agree with the legislative counsel analysis and conclude that,as used in section,an incident is any event that proximately causes an emergency response by a public agency.although an accident is not necessary to trigger the right to reimbursement,an ordinary arrest,even for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs,is not sufficient.
recoverable emergency response costs under section a.
the trial court ruled that the chp may recover costs directly related to the accident response but may not recover the cost of officer time enforcing the dui laws,in effect dividing emergency response costs into those incurred to protect public safety and those incurred to enforce the dui laws.the court premised its analysis on the distinction between an incident and the impaired driving that causes an incident,reasoning that section a excludes costs relating to enforcement of the dui laws because those expenses do not directly arise because of the response to the incident.the court took a narrow view of directly arising,concluding that even though a cost may be triggered by driving under the influence,it does not arise from an incident unless the cost is based on the incident itself.
the language of the statute and its legislative history do not support such a distinction.section a defines expense of an emergency response to mean reasonable costs incurred by a public agency in reasonably making an appropriate emergency response to the incident when the chp responds to an incident,its reasonable response includes,in addition to directing traffic and investigating the accident,conducting a field sobriety test,making an arrest if appropriate under the circumstances,preparing reports,and booking the driver as the chp points out,such tasks are not only reasonable but are necessary components of the chp response to an incident caused by an intoxicated driver.because the chp is the state agency with the most expertise in conducting accident investigations,it is in the best position to determine the appropriate components of an emergency response.its consistent and interpretation of what constitutes a reimbursable emergency response expense under section a is therefore entitled to deference.see yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th at,d.
while recoverable costs are restricted to those directly arising because of the response to the particular incident a,this limiting language does not exclude activities related to enforcing the dui laws.as just indicated,the role of officers at the scene of an incident necessarily includes law enforcement functions.the statute makes no distinction between these and public safety functions.there is no indication that any portion of salaries incurred because of an emergency response is unrecoverable.rather,reasonable costs are defined to include the costs of providing police,firefighting,rescue,and emergency medical services at the scene of the incident,as well as the salaries of the personnel responding to the incident.a,italics added.while the costs of the various services generally are limited to those incurred at the scene,the syntax of the statutory language as well as indicates that the salaries of the personnel responding to the incident are not so limited.to the extent the time is spent on activities directly arising from the response to the incident,the salary reasonably allocated to that time is subject to reimbursement.thus,for example,time spent preparing reports or transporting victims or the intoxicated driver from the scene of the incident is eligible for reimbursement.
allowing cost recovery for law enforcement expenses does not give the term incident a different meaning in sections and a,as allende suggests.while negligent operation of a vehicle by a drunk driver is not sufficient to qualify as an incident,it is an element of any incident qualifying for emergency response cost reimbursement.an incident is the triggering event that allows a public agency to recover its emergency response costs,but that term does not define which costs are recoverable.
allende argues that using an incident as a trigger for reimbursement of law enforcement costs will lead to absurd results,giving as an example a dui driver who hits a guardrail in the process of being stopped on suspicion of driving under the influence.such an incident,he asserts,would allow the chp to recover costs it would not have been allowed to recover if the driver had missed the guardrail.but an incident must result in an emergency response before reimbursement is permitted,and it is questionable whether such a minor mishap following an ordinary traffic stop would qualify in all events,we see nothing illogical in allowing the occurrence of an incident to trigger the right to recover costs not otherwise reimbursable following an ordinary dui arrest without incident.the legislature singled out drivers who cause incidents resulting in an emergency response to bear the cost of that response.it is entirely reasonable to require persons whose drunken or driving has escalated to the point of causing an incident to bear the expense of police activities that would not be chargeable to a driver following a simple traffic stop and dui arrest.
the legislative history supports an interpretation allowing recovery of expenses related to the enforcement of the dui laws.when the legislature was considering raising the liability limit in section from to in,the legislative analysis discussed a sample breakdown of expenses for responding to a major accident that included costs for blood and breath testing,an activity allende describes as a law enforcement function assem.com.on,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.that cost breakdown also included the salaries of two patrolmen for five hours,but there was nothing to suggest the patrolmen time was allocated between their response to the incident and the performance of their law enforcement responsibilities in connection with the incident.ibid.allende points to nothing in the legislative history that suggests the legislature intended law enforcement officers to divide their response time into dui response and accident response components 
the legislature did question which response expenses should be recoverable,but the discussion focused on whether a pro rata share of fixed costs or only incremental costs should qualify for reimbursement.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.in,when the legislature increased the liability limit from to,it also amended section a to add the sentence explicitly including within the definition of the expense of an emergency response the salaries of personnel responding to the incident.stats,ch,assem.com on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.before the amendment,it was understood that only overtime pay was recoverable as an emergency response cost because the statute did not authorize recovery of fixed costs.ops.cal.legis.counsel,may,emergency services assem.com on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.the legislative analysis of the amendment makes clear that the language permitting recovery of costs directly arising because of the response to the incident was intended to clarify that,with the exception of salaries,a public agency fixed costs do not qualify for reimbursement ibid.the use of directly arising in section a is intended to distinguish between fixed and incremental or marginal costs and not,as allende and the trial court conclude,between law enforcement and public safety costs.
both allende and the trial court rely on legislative history indicating that the purpose of the cost recovery statutes was to hold drunk drivers more fiscally accountable for the cost of responding to accidents which they cause.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as introduced.we do not agree that this legislative purpose reflects an intent to limit the recovery to expenses.the intention to hold drunk drivers more fiscally accountable for the cost of responding to accidents does not indicate what is or is not to be included in the cost of responding to an incident 
at oral argument,counsel for allende stressed the contention that permitting reimbursement of expenses could not have been intended by the legislature because those convicted of driving under the influence are already subject to fines and fees intended to reimburse expenses incurred in the criminal proceedings.see,fines and forfeitures.any theoretical overlap in the expenses which these provisions are intended to cover is minimal since section a does not include the principal costs of criminal enforcement,such as the costs of prosecution,judicial salaries and administration,and penal and probationary expenses.moreover,criminal fines are not imposed unless the driver is prosecuted and convicted.the legislative history of several provisions proposing to modify the maximum amount of cost reimbursement,including the amendments adopted in and,expressly acknowle
