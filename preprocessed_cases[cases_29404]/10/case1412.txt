this is an appeal under rule f,from the district court order certifying a national class of approximately million automobile insurance policyholders.plaintiffs complaint seeks treble damages under the federal antitrust laws for alleged premium overcharges.for the following reasons,we have determined that we have no jurisdiction in this matter and shall dismiss the appeal.
linda gilchrist,joanne zipperer and jackie valentine referred to collectively as gilchrist filed this action seeking to represent a group of individual policy holders who purchased automobile insurance from various insurance companies,including state farm,allstate,nationwide,and geico insurers.gilchrist alleges that defendants conspired in violation of federal antitrust laws to limit insurance coverage for certain external auto body repairs to the cost of less expensive parts not made by an original equipment manufacturer oem.
insurers moved to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the act,the act bars plaintiffs claim because it concerns the business of insurance,which,under the act,is not subject to the federal antitrust laws.in november of,the district court denied the motion,holding that the act does not bar gilchrist claim because her claim merely challenges the way in which the insurers perform their policies,which is not the business of insurance.
gilchrist then moved for class certification and the district court held an evidentiary hearing.in november of,the court certified a class consisting of some million of insurers policyholders pursuant to rule f,insurers petitioned for leave to appeal this order,which we granted.
after oral argument of this appeal,we became concerned that might indeed exclude gilchrist claim from federal antitrust jurisdiction.since we are powerless to enter a judgment in a matter over which we have no jurisdiction,university of south alabama american tobacco,cir,we are required,even sua sponte,to initiate an inquiry into our jurisdiction whenever we become concerned that it may not exist.arthur haley,cir rembert apfel,cir.accordingly,we notified the parties that they could file additional authority on this issue and that we would resolve it prior to any decision on the merits of the appeal.it is to this issue we now turn.

a.the business of insurance 
gilchrist argues that the act does not apply to her claim,relying on two supreme court cases holding that,while the act exempts the business of insurance,it does not exempt the business of insurers.group life health ins.royal drug,d pireno,at.she contends that her claim implicates the latter,rather than the former.she characterizes her claim as an attack on insurers arrangements with third parties,which,she alleges,require the use of parts in the repair of its policyholders vehicles.this practice,she argues,is a means of using cheaper repair parts to satisfy the insurer existing policy obligations.response to motion to dismiss.furthermore,gilchrist claims that insurers created and financed the certified auto parts association capa to promote inferior crash parts as acceptable substitutes for oem parts,thereby advancing the anticompetitive conspiracy.finally,she contends that insurers have benefitted from the conspiracy by reducing their repair costs and raising their profits above what they would experience in a competitive market.in sum,gilchrist contends that she is attacking the way in which insurers conduct their business.
insurers,on the other hand,characterize gilchrist claim as an attack on both their and the performance of their insurance at the heart of the business of insurance.
an activity is part of the business of insurance if it has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder risk,is an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured,and is limited to entities within the insurance industry.pireno,at.under this test,the supreme court has held conclusively that both and the performance of an insurance the adjustment of the business of insurance.royal drug,at.the fixing of insurance rates is the business of insurance united states of treasury fabe,d there can be no doubt that the actual performance of an insurance contract falls within the business of insurance as we understood that phrase in pireno and royal drug citing pireno,at.
of course,is the paradigmatic example of the conduct that congress intended to protect by the act.royal drug,at.because of the widespread view that it is very difficult to underwrite risks in an informed and responsible way without cooperation,the primary concern of both representatives of the insurance industry and the congress was the cooperative ratemaking efforts be exempt from the antitrust laws.similarly,the court has rejected the argument that performance of insurers contractual duties does not constitute the business of insurance.fabe,at.the court reasoned 
without performance of the terms of the insurance policy,there is no risk transfer at all.moreover,performance of an insurance contract also satisfies the remaining prongs of the pireno test it is central to the policy relationship between insurer and insured and is confined entirely to entities within the insurance industry.
and the performance of contractual obligations are fundamental to the business of insurance because they focus on the relationship between the insurance company and its policyholders.the supreme court has made clear that 
t he relationship between insurer and insured,the type of policy which could be issued,its reliability,interpretation,and were the core of the business of insurance.

thus the real question in this case is which party has more accurately characterized gilchrist claim.are insurers correct that the claim is clearly about and performance of the insurance contract or does gilchrist correctly describe her claim as attacking a conspiracy,entirely outside the process,in which insurers agreed to avoid oem parts and worked with third parties to disseminate false information about such parts in order to exclude competition from other insurers who would have provided repair policies 
in order to answer this question,we must eschew the parties characterizations of the claim and examine the allegations of the complaint.
the complaint makes the following allegations 
defendants have conspired among themselves,and with unnamed,to agree to provide their policyholders wherever possible inferior,imitation crash parts which do not restore their damaged vehicles to their original,condition,and are not of like kind and quality as parts originally provided by automobile manufacturers.
the effect of the conspiracy has been to raise and maintain insurance prices or premiums paid by policy holders above competitive levels for the actual repairs provided using inferior or imitation crash parts,and to reduce the quality of repair service to the class herein alleged.
insurers have agreed to provide and promote inferior,imitation crash parts for the restoration of the automobiles of the plaintiffs and other member of the class.
defendants have pursued this course of conduct despite their contractual obligation to restore insured vehicles to their condition and to use parts of like kind and quality as those originally employed by automobile manufacturers.
defendants conspiracy to reduce their repair costs and increase their profits by agreeing to provide inferior,imitation crash parts to class members,and to misreprese
