plaintiffs frank gattuso and ernest sigala brought an action on behalf of themselves and other employees of defendant shoppers,seeking indemnification under labor code section for expenses incurred in using their personal automobiles in the discharge of their employment duties.labor code section section provides in pertinent part a an employer shall indemnify his or her employee for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties,or of his or her obedience to the directions of the employer,even though unlawful,unless the employee,at the time of obeying the directions,believed them to be unlawful.
plaintiffs appeal from an order denying certification of this case as a class action and also from a prior order determining that section permits an employer to pay increased salaries or commissions instead of reimbursing the employee for actual automobile expenses incurred.we affirm both orders because we agree with the trial court interpretation of section and conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiffs motion for class certification.
background 
a marketing company,distributes weekly over million advertising publications in california,including the pennysaver and the california shopper.the company is comprised of three business units southern california,northern california,and the san diego or sutton unit.employs outside sales representatives osr as well as inside sales representatives isr to sell its products.the osr are required to drive their personal automobiles in the discharge of their duties.the isr sell many of the same products as the osr,but do so by telephone in the office rather than by visiting customers.gattuso is an osr and sigala is a former osr in southern california unit.
according to president,peter gorman,the osr are paid higher base salary and commission rates than the isr in order to compensate the osr for automobile expenses.for example,the isr in the santa ana area,supervised by deborah glenny,earn,on the average,per hour base salary and the osr earn to per hour base salary the isr earn lower commissions than the osr.michael paulsin,of finance,testified that the pay stubs of the osr do not break out separately the amount of compensation representing reimbursement for automobile expenses,but such reimbursement is included in the employee total gross wages.paulsin maintained that the increased compensation for the osr is more than adequate to compensate them for the use of their automobiles,but the company did not conduct any study to determine whether the increased compensation actually resulted in indemnification for all of the osr automobile expenses.
robert falk,of marketing for the southern california unit,testified that has to compete for osr with its competitors,so each of regional sales managers,with the approval of the regional,has authority to set the compensation for the osr he or she manages.
the osr in the three units may negotiate a compensation plan and create an individualized expense reimbursement system.for example,in the southern california unit,some osr are compensated solely by the commissions generated by the sales in their assigned territories.a few osr are compensated by the commissions generated by the sales of a team with whom they split their commission.and some osr earn a base salary plus commissions on the products they sell,and the base salary varies depending on the size of the osr territory and whether the territory is new or an expansion territory with many established customers.
gattuso and sigala filed a class action complaint against for indemnification under section for expenses incurred by the osr in connection with the use of their automobiles to perform their job duties.after answered the complaint,plaintiffs filed a proposed legal question for certification,whether section permits an employer to pay increased salaries or commissions instead of reimbursing the employee actual expenses incurred in the discharge of the employee duties.the trial court asked the parties to brief the following issue does labor code section permit an employer to pay increased wages or commissions instead of indemnifying actual expenses necessarily incurred in the discharge of an employee duties 
in its brief on the issue in the trial court,summarized the parties positions plaintiffs allege that has unlawfully failed to reimburse them,and the putative class,for the expense of using their automobiles in the course and scope of their employment as outside salespeople.they base their claim on labor code section denies that it has any such obligation and in the alternative alleges that it does,in fact,reimburse outside salespeople as a matter of policy for expenses in the form of additional compensation.plaintiffs,in turn,dispute that indemnification in the form of additional compensation is sufficient to comply with the requirements of section.
after extensive briefing of the issue and oral argument,the court issued an april,order regarding certified legal question rejecting argument that section does not require indemnification for the osr automobile expenses but accepting argument that section permits an employer to pay increased salaries or commissions instead of reimbursing the employee for actual expenses necessarily incurred in the discharge of the employee duties.the order provides in pertinent part although there does not appear to be a case on point,a plain reading of subdivision a,necessary expenditures or losses in the direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties would require that all employee expenses be reimbursed by the employer.the court,while not deferring to the division of labor standards enforcement dlse interpretive bulletin,agrees with the dlse interpretation that the plain language of section would require an employer to reimburse employees for expenses,mileage reimbursement.turning to the central issue,the court further finds that labor code section permits an employer to pay increased wages or commissions instead of indemnifying actual expenses necessarily incurred in the discharge of an employee duties.the court does not defer to the dlse in this regard but after an independent legal analysis,the court agrees with the dlse conclusion as articulated in dlse interpretive bulletin,that the rate of reimbursement can be that agreed to by the employer and employee or,if there is no such agreement,any reasonable amount.
plaintiffs then filed a motion for class certification seeking to certify a plaintiff class defined as all persons currently or formerly employed by who utilized their automobiles in the discharge of their duties and were not reimbursed for the expenses incurred thereby after january,to certify plaintiffs as the representatives of the class,and to appoint plaintiffs counsel as counsel for the class.at the time of the hearing,plaintiffs narrowed the class to the osr incurring expenses after january,and stated that there were about such potential class members.
in preparation for the motion,plaintiffs deposed paulsin,falk,and other executives employed by,as well as an osr from each of the offices throughout california which employs osr.plaintiffs summary of the depositions of gattuso,sigala,and other osr indicated that all of them incurred expenses related to the use of their automobiles in the performance of their job duties.osr including gattuso and sigala testified that they were not reimbursed for their expenses,four osr testified that they were reimbursed at the rate of per week,one osr testified that she was reimbursed at the rate of per week,and one osr testified that he was reimbursed at the rate of per month.
in opposition to the motion,argued that the class of osr lacked predominant common issues because the variety of compensation plans fractured the class into numerous subclasses,and the determination of whether any one osr had been indemnified for automobile expenses required an individualized and complicated inquiry.maintained that the circumstances of each osr were different because some osr drove miles per day while others drove as few as five miles per day.in addition,the inquiry would require a comparison between the osr actual earnings and what the osr would have earned under an isr compensation plan.the difference between the commissions earned under the osr compensation plan and the commissions earned by an isr generating the same revenue that is the differential is the amount intended to compensate osr for automobile and other expenses.the differential must then be compared to the osr actual automobile expenses or to the osr actual mileage to determine if the osr was reasonably compensated for automobile expenses.if the internal revenue service irs standard mileage rate which in was cents per mile is used as a proxy for actual automobile expenses,then the inquiry would require an analysis of whether the differential reasonably compensated the osr for the miles driven at the irs standard mileage rate.
submitted a chart calculating the differentials of of the osr deposed by plaintiffs.the differential analysis for the other osr could not be performed because could not locate records of the osr sales revenue.the differentials were based on commissions earned in or in the first quarter or the first two quarters of.of those osr,earned more in commissions as an osr than an isr producing the same revenue.of the seven osr whose commissions as osr were less than those of isr,six were on a base salary plus commission compensation plan and the chart did not include any base salaries,so a comparison could not be made with respect to these six osr.
also opposed the motion for class certification on the ground that gattuso and sigala were not typical of the class and had interests antagonistic to many members of the class.gattuso was on a sales team in an experimental sales arrangement different from almost all other osr.in addition,for almost all of the six years of his employment,gattuso had earned only a guarantee because he was unable to sell enough advertising products to generate commissions in excess of his guarantee.characterized sigala as a poor performer who had received a warning for poor performance shortly before he resigned his employment in january.submitted the declarations of about osr who stated that they would suffer detriment if plaintiffs prevailed in this lawsuit and if required osr to submit weekly expense reports.a few of the osr deposed by plaintiffs testified that they preferred existing system with respect to expense indemnification and some osr made derogatory comments about this lawsuit.
after oral argument,the court denied the motion for class certification,determining that the case was inappropriate for treatment as a class action because the requirements of common questions of law or fact and of superiority were lacking.the court determined that plaintiffs did not show common questions of fact and law because the claim for unpaid business expenses under section turns on the determination of two issues whether each individual outside sales representative has an agreement about the manner in which he is compensated for expenses,or whether the compensation paid to each individual sales representative is reasonable to compensate for business expenses incurred.the determination of whether there was a meeting of the minds and whether reimbursement was reasonable necessarily requires an individualized inquiry as to each outside sales representative.the requirement of commonality therefore is not met,and plaintiffs claims for unpaid business expenses can not be maintained as a class action.
the court further concluded that sigala was not an adequate class representative because of a disabling conflict between him and numerous absent class members who are more successful in their jobs than sigala and who could be harmed if was forced to reimburse its outside sales representatives using an expense report and expense check system.although gattuso was determined to be an adequate class representative,the court concluded that his claim was not typical of the putative class members because he was compensated differently from most other osr in that he was on a sales team which covered multiple sales territories and was compensated based on the sales of the entire team.the court determined,however,that plaintiffs established the requirements of ascertainability,numerosity,and adequacy of legal representation.
plaintiffs appeal,challenging the trial court underlying order interpreting section as well as the order denying class certification.the order denying class certification is appealable.linder thrifty oil cal th,d.and the underlying order interpreting section is reviewable on this appeal because the first order necessarily affects the order appealed from and substantially affects the rights of a party.code civ.
discussion 
order regarding certified legal question 
plaintiffs contend that because labor code section section prohibits waiver of the benefits of section,the trial court committed reversible error in holding that an employer and employee may have an agreement to waive labor code section.they also argue that section requires either reimbursement for actual expenses incurred by the employee or payment of a reasonable rate,and alleged agreement to pay increased salaries or commissions is tantamount to a waiver of section because the increased compensation is taxed as ordinary income and unrelated to actual expenses or miles traveled.we disagree with both contentions.
first,the trial court did not hold that an employer and employee may agree to waive the provisions of section.nothing in the order on the certified legal question or in the record of the january hearing on the matter indicates that the court so held.to support their interpretation of the record,plaintiffs refer to a stray comment made by the trial court during the may hearing on the motion for class certification.but the comment occurred in the context of a rather lengthy discussion between the court and the parties attorneys about the issues in the case,and it is clear from the context of the entire discussion that the trial court did not change its prior ruling or hold that the benefits of section could be waived.the stray comment can not be used to impeach the trial court written order interpreting section.jespersen th,d judge comments in oral argument may not be used to impeach the final order.
second,for reasons which we shall discuss,we determine that section permits an employer to pay increased salaries or commissions instead of reimbursing the employee for actual automobile expenses incurred or paying a reasonable mileage rate,and that such method of indemnification does not run afoul of the provision in section.

plaintiffs contend that paying increased compensation to its osr to indemnify them for expenses incurred in using their automobiles in the course of their jobs does not satisfy section.and plaintiffs argue that indemnification for expenses under section can not take the form of taxable,ordinary income unrelated to the expenses actually incurred.but on its face,the statute does not specify an
