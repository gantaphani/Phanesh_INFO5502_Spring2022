in this class action lawsuit alleging contractual breach and unfair business practices,general motors acceptance corporation gmac appeals from the part of the judgment finding a breach of contract and from the trial court orders denying its motions to vacate the judgment and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict no.gmac also appeals from an order awarding attorney fees and costs to the plaintiff class plaintiffs no.this action concerns gmac practice of buying property damage insurance when automobile loan borrowers fail to do so themselves.plaintiffs also appealed from the judgment,but have abandoned their appeal.
on appeal from the judgment and posttrial orders,gmac contends that the accelerated method it used to compute earned insurance premiums was objectively and commercially reasonable as a matter of law,and that plaintiffs failed to prove proximately caused damage.we disagree.in doing so,we examine the nature of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the context of discretionary contractual power,as well as the issue of proving individual damages in the context of a class action lawsuit.
on appeal from the attorney fee and cost order,gmac contends that plaintiffs were not prevailing parties under civil code section,that the trial court awarded excessive fees,and that the trial court erred in awarding costs.we disagree.in doing so,we discuss the section legal standard in the context of a class action,and we also conclude that gmac may not obtain the cost of a transcript it prepared for an unsuccessful appeal that it later used in a successful appeal.
accordingly,we affirm the judgment,the posttrial orders,and the attorney fee and cost order.
background 
gmac,a wholly owned subsidiary of general motors corporation,finances automobile purchases.a purchaser who buys an automobile on credit typically signs a conditional sales agreement granting the seller or its assignee a security interest in the automobile.
the standard conditional sales agreement accepted by gmac hereafter sales agreement or standard sales agreement requires the borrower to maintain physical damage insurance on the automobile during the term of the sales agreement.when a borrower fails to maintain such insurance,or when a lapse in insurance coverage is detected,gmac generally notifies the borrower and warns that it will purchase such insurance if the borrower does not this insurance is known as collateral protection insurance cpi.
gmac purchases cpi from motors insurance company mic,a wholly owned subsidiary with gmac as its only customer.in effect this makes gmac the insurance administrator.
gmac purchases cpi to cover the remaining term of the sales agreement.this is known as a policy.the borrower may pay the entire premium immediately,or add the premium to the sales agreement balance and pay it off over the remaining term of the agreement with an added finance charge.
nearly half of the cpi policies that go into effect are cancelled during their first year.nearly a third of purchased cpi policies do not go into effect at all because the borrower notifies gmac,within days of notification of gmac cpi purchase,that the borrower has insurance these policies are and the borrower is not charged for them the borrowers were excluded from the class.
when a cpi policy goes into effect and is cancelled before the end of its term,the borrower is refunded the unearned premium,or credited with the unearned premium if gmac has not yet received full payment.in calculating the unearned premium to be refunded or credited,gmac uses an accelerated method whereby more of the total premium is earned at the beginning of the policy period thus,a cpi policy cancelled halfway through its term would result in significantly less than half of the premium being refunded or credited.this method can be contrasted,for example,with another method commonly pro which a halfway cancellation would result in half the premium being refunded or credited,proportional over time.
the underlying suit was filed as a class action in early by various gmac borrowers for whom cpi had been purchased pursuant to the standard sales agreement.plaintiffs claimed that gmac charged exorbitantly for cpi by charging for certain coverages,expenses,policy lengths,and deductibles,and by calculating unearned premium refunds.plaintiffs asked for an injunction,restitution,declaratory relief and damages.the class was subsequently certified.
gmac filed a,seeking to collect amounts that members of the plaintiff class owed it under their standard sales agreements.the trial court denied gmac motion to certify a class,and gmac unsuccessfully petitioned this court for a writ of mandate.
trial began in may.a jury determined plaintiffs breach of contract claim.the rest of plaintiffs violation of the unfair competition law bus,unjust enrichment and declaratory deemed equitable in nature and the trial judge heard those simultaneously.
in a special verdict covering liability on the breach of contract claim,the jury found that gmac breached the standard sales agreement by the accelerated method it used to compute unearned premium refunds.the jury also found that gmac did not breach the standard sales agreement by charging for certain coverages,expenses,policy lengths,and deductibles regarding cpi.
in a special verdict on damages,the jury found that plaintiffs had suffered actual damages in the total amount of on the contract breach.
on the remaining equitable claims,the trial court found that gmac had engaged in two unfair business practices imposing finance charges on a cpi policy and inadequately disclosing to borrowers the method it used to calculate premium refunds or credits.the trial court issued an injunction enjoining gmac from engaging in these two practices.in a prior appeal no,we reversed this injunction order in an unpublished decision hereafter the injunction appeal.
in its judgment,the trial court added approximately million in prejudgment interest to the damage figure found by the jury,for a total judgment of.the court denied the plaintiffs equitable claims,and denied gmac any relief on its.the court also denied gmac motions to vacate the judgment and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.
in a postjudgment order,the trial court found plaintiffs to be the prevailing party and awarded them attorney fees of approximately million and costs of about.the court also denied gmac cost request of for a reporter transcript that was originally prepared for its unsuccessful reference appeal but was incorporated by reference in the injunction appeal.
discussion 
the judgment appeal no.the accelerated method for computing earned premiums and hence premium refunds 
under the standard sales agreement,when a borrower fails to maintain property damage insurance on the purchased automobile,gmac is authorized to obtain cpi.as we noted in our opinion in the injunction appeal,the standard sales agreement leaves the specific terms of the cpi policy to gmac reasonable discretion,including the method for computing premium refunds or credits upon cancellation.because the standard sales agreement does not expressly cover the method for calculating premium reimbursement but leaves that method to gmac discretion,the issue of whether gmac breached the standard sales agreement involves whether gmac breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.every contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its enforcement.rest d contracts.this covenant particularly applies where,as here,the contract gives one party a discretionary power affecting the rights of the other 
gmac concedes the trial court properly instructed the jurors on the implied covenant,telling them in part 
a contract may give one party a discretionary power affecting the rights of another party th is discretionary power must be exercised in accordance with reasonable standards 
in determining whether a party given a discretionary power has breached the implied promise of good faith and fair dealing,you may consider whether t he party conduct was objectively unreasonable.italics added.
the meaning of the implied promise of good faith and fair dealing depends on the express terms of the contract and the legitimate expectations of the parties arising from those terms.italics added.
gmac maintains that it did not breach the implied covenant because the accelerated method for computing earned premiums and hence any premium refunds is objectively reasonable as a matter of law.
gmac initially notes our statement in the injunction appeal opinion that gmac uses an accelerated earnings rate whereby more of the total premium is credited to the beginning of the policy period when the value of the insured automobile,and thus the risk of loss,is greater than at the end of the policy period.along similar lines,gmac quotes the trial court observation,in its statement of decision,that the evidence established a strong business justification for computing earned premiums by an accelerated method because the risk of physical damage is greater at the beginning of the policy term and diminishes throughout the course of the term.
for purposes of establishing the objective reasonableness of the accelerated method as a matter of law and thus overturning the jury verdict,gmac reads too much into our statement and that of the trial court.while these statements concede the reasonableness of the accelerated method in theory,they can not be stretched to concede the reasonableness,as a matter of law,of the particular accelerated method gmac used here.the accelerated method does not refer to just one method varying accelerated methods exist with varying accelerations.
one key measure of reasonableness,for example,is how well gmac accelerated method matched the premium earned to the risk insured.substantial evidence showed a mismatch in this,including evidence of cpi excessive profitability collection of premiums based on higher loan balances but paying the vast majority of claims based on much lower repair costs use of the pro method to compute premium refunds for cancelled cpi policies with a term of one year or less and purchase of policies with the entire premium added to the outstanding loan,even though nearly percent of cpi policies either never went into effect or were cancelled within the first year.
gmac also argues that it could not disappoint any legitimate expectations arising from the express terms of the standard sales agreement because that agreement did not mention any method for computing premium refunds furthermore,as noted in the injunction appeal opinion,the standard sales agreement permits gmac to unilaterally decide the method for computing such refunds.
this argument,however,suffers from problems,theoretical and practical.
theoretically,it comes close to dispensing with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.although the standard sales agreement does not expressly mention the method for computing premium refunds,the implied covenant is just that implied and it functions because something has not been expressly mentioned in a contract.of course,the implied covenant does not exist in a vacuum and is circumscribed by the purposes and express terms of a contract,and the jury was so instructed.the standard sales agreement does state expressly that if the borrower fails to maintain property damage insurance for the purchased car,gmac will procure such insurance and the borrower must pay the premiums for it.from this,a borrower can legitimately expect that an appropriate amount of the premiums will be refunded if the insurance is ended before its term.and although gmac can unilaterally decide the premium refund method,that decision,pursuant to the implied covenant,must be a reasonable one legitimate expectations naturally flow from this recognition 
practically speaking,the standard sales agreement states in part with respect to cpi 
insurance you agree to keep the vehicle insured in favor of us with a policy satisfactory to us,with comprehensive theft and collision coverage,insuring the vehicle against loss in amounts not less than the unpaid sums owed under this contract.if you fail to maintain such insurance,we may,at our option,procure such insurance and you agree to pay for the insurance and finance charges on the premiums from this provision,borrowers can legitimately expect that cpi will accord with their experience with customary property damage automobile insurance comprehensive and collision.gmac concedes the evidence indisputably showed that the pro method,also known as the actuarial method,is commonly used to compute premium refunds on automobile insurance policies for comprehensive theft and collision coverage.in fact,gmac used the pro method to compute premium refunds on its term cpi policies,policies issued for terms of a year or less.
moreover,gmac standard sales agreement specifies that the borrower agrees to pay for cpi according to the notice we send you.a legally required and publicly available statement on file with the michigan insurance bureau states with respect to gmac cpi that return premiums will be calculated on a pro rata basis when cancelling the policy individual certificate.and the individual cpi certificate sent to gmac customers states that premium refunds upon cancellation shall be computed under the customary cancellation table.
gmac can not argue that,given the standard sales agreement silence on the issue of the premium refund method,there can be no substantial evidence of any legitimate expectations regarding that method.the tables can be turned on such silence.in light of the evidence of the customary automobile insurance policy and the notices just described,a borrower legitimately can expect in the face of such silence that a pro refund method will be used.
nor can gmac rely on our injunction appeal opinion,which concluded that the cpi certificate notice was not an unfair business practice under business and professions code section.as we noted in that opinion,an unfair business practice claim under section is more akin to a tort than a contract claim,and requires a finding that the public is likely to be deceived in the injunction appeal,there was evidence showing that the term pro rata,by itself,means pro,so,as we concluded,the cpi certificate notice of under the customary cancellation tables must have meant something else in fact,these tables referenced two accelerated methods.by contrast,in this appeal,we are considering a contract claim that requires the less stringent finding of legitimate expectation based on the contractual terms and relationship.as we said in the injunction appeal,unlike the covenant of good faith,the question whether a particular business practice is unfair within the meaning of section is independent of any contractual relationship between the parties.
proving damages 
gmac contends the plaintiffs failed to prove that the contract breach involving the method for computing premium refunds proximately caused any damages.we disagree.
we first consider the issue of the fact of damages.the jury found that gmac breached the standard sales agreement through the accelerated method it used to compute premium refunds upon cpi cancellation.as made clear through the posture of plaintiffs case and the special verdicts on liability and damages,the jury found that gmac unreasonably overcharged for the cpi premiums by refunding too little of the premium upon cancellation this overcharging violated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the sales agreement.thus,the contract breach actually caused damages.
not so fast,argues gmac.plaintiffs failed to prove that the class had suffered any damages because the class as a whole owed gmac more for cpi than the amount of the alleged cpi overcharges claimed by the class as a whole.since the evidence,however,also showed that there was a significant number of class members who had paid off their cpi balances,the trial court directed that damages be bifurcated from liability and assessed individually by checking each class member cpi balance and the amount of cpi premiums each member had paid a collective approach would unfairly deprive those who had paid off their cpi balances,including overpayments on which gmac was liable,from recovering anything.
the trial court approach to the fact of damages was proper,and maintained the class action nature of the lawsuit.a class action can be maintained even if each class member must at some point individually show his or her eligibility for recovery or the amount of his or her damages,so long as each class member would not be required to litigate substantial and numerous factually unique questions to determine his or her individual right to recover 
here,the class had a standard sales agreement with gmac.the question of liability was amenable to class treatment.the question of damages required a check of each class member cpi account to determine if the member could actually recover monies because of the accelerated method for computing premium refunds.this check was done and the jury awarded a total amount of damages to be allocated to approximately out of class members.the remaining class members did not share in the damages awarded because they did not cancel cpi during the class period,or because they had cpi policies covering terms of one year or less with premium refunds governed by a pro method,or because they did not pay enough of their cpi account to gmac to have suffered any damages resulting from the smaller refund.as we noted in our injunction appeal opinion,when a cpi policy is cancelled before the end of its term,the borrower is either refunded the unearned premium or the amount is credited to his account if gmac has not yet received full payment.gmac notes in its brief that when the injunction appeal opinion overturned the trial court findings that gmac had engaged in unfair business practices,the plaintiffs claim for restitution and credits was undercut consequently,the final judgment contains no provision for restitution or credits.
where the fact of damages is certain,as here,the amount of damages need not be calculated with absolute certainty the law requires only that some reasonable basis of computation be used,and the result reached can be a reasonable approximation 
here,the jury was presented with a reasonable basis for computing damages resulting from use of gmac accelerated method for premium refunds the plaintiffs had their expert quantify the amount by which the refunds computed on a pro basis exceeded the refunds gmac had actually paid class members using the accelerated method.this approach was supported by evidence that comprehensive and collision automobile insurance premium refunds are commonly,if not customarily,computed on a pro basis,that gmac used this basis to compute premium refunds on cpi policies of one year or less,and that notices related to the standard sales agreement mentioned cancellation in pro rata terms.
that brings us to gmac final point on the issue of damages.gmac contends the trial court erred in excluding evidence that gmac cpi premiums were lower because of the additional funds engendered from the accelerated method.the trial court afforded gmac ample opportunity to present an offer of proof regarding this benefit.the best gmac could muster was evidence that two insurance carriers had filed premium rates for two cpi policies with the california department of insurance based on an accelerated method,and had apparently received a to percent discount for one policy on this basis,and a percent discount for the other.
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding this evidence.as with damages,there must be a reasonable basis for quantifying offsets gmac cpi policy was filed with the insurance authorities in michigan,not in california.it was speculative whether the michigan authorities would approve a higher premium for a cpi policy based on use of a pro refund method.the wide variability of the california discount a span of percent or a percent difference in one of the reduced their relevant punch.and gmac did not quantify any sort of discount factor for the accelerated method it used.
we conclude the judgment and posttrial orders should be affirmed.we turn to the appeal of the order awarding attorney fees and costs.
the attorney appeal no.
attorney fees 
pursuant to civil code section and an attorney fee provision in the standard sales agreement,the trial court awarded plaintiffs in attorney fees on their contract action.
gmac contends this order must be reversed because the trial court applied the wrong legal standard,the evidence is insufficient to support the order,and the amount awarded is excessive.we disagree.
legal standard 
civil code section,subdivision a,authorizes an award of attorney fees to a prevailing party i n any action on a contract to enforce that contract if the contract provides for an award of attorney fees.subdivision b of section states that the party prevailing on the contract shall be the party who recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract and shall be determined by the court.
if neither party achieves a complete victory on all the contract claims,as is the case here,it is within the discretion of the trial court to determine which party prevailed on the contract or whether,on balance,neither party prevailed sufficiently to justify an award of attorney fees.i n deciding whether there is a party prevailing on the contract,the trial court is to compare the relief awarded on the contract claim or claims with the parties demands on those same claims and their litigation objectives as disclosed by the pleadings,trial briefs,opening statements,and similar sources.i n determining litigation success,courts should respect substance rather than form,and to this extent should be guided by equitable considerations.
the section phrase greater relief on the contract does not necessarily mean greater monetary relief 
the trial court is given wide discretion in determining which party prevailed,and we will not overturn that determination absent a clear abuse of discretion.
gmac attack on the legal standard the trial court used is.first,gmac contends the trial court applied the net monetary recovery standard the plaintiffs had advocated rather than the correct comparative approach set forth by the state supreme court in hsu and scott.gmac is mistaken.
in its attorney fee order,the trial court stated 
pursuant to the standards set forth in hsu abbara cal th,d,plaintiffs are the prevailing party in the action on the contract.although plaintiffs did not obtain a complete victory,they recovered the greater relief as a result of the jury verdict.judgment was entered in favor of plaintiffs and against gmac in the sum of and gmac was dismissed.the court finds that,on balance,plaintiffs prevailed sufficiently on their breach of contract cause of action to justify an award of attorneys fees under civil code section.
in determining who was the prevailing party on the contract action,the trial court did not simply use the net monetary recovery standard advocated by plaintiffs.instead,the trial court used the standards set forth in hsu,the comparative approach,finding that on balance plaintiffs prevailed sufficiently on their breach of contract cause of action to have met the section prevailing party definition of having recovered the greater relief.unless the record is to the contrary,we must take the trial court at its word and assume it did its duty we will look at that record when we discuss gmac contention on substantial evidence.
the second prong of gmac argument that the trial court applied the wrong legal standard is that the trial court erroneously refused to assess prevailing party status on an individual basis.again,gmac is mistaken.
because only about of the class members were awarded damages including only one of the four named plaintiffs,gmac contends it prevailed on the multiple,independent contracts involving those who did not recover any damages.
as we discussed in section of the judgment appeal above,gmac has misperceived the nature of a class action.briefly,a class action can be maintained even if each class member must at some point individually show his or her eligibility for recovery or the amount of his or her damages,so long as these individual issues do not overwhelm the class issues liability was determined here on a basis because the class had a standard sales agreement with gmac.damages were awarded in a,amount after each class member cpi account was assessed individually.
nor does the present action involve multiple,independent contracts as gmac argues.gmac seeks to fall within the principle set forth in arntz contracting paul fire marine ins.in arntz,a general contractor and its surety sued one another on their separate contracts and different victors emerged for each contract the court stated,when an action involves multiple,independent contracts,each of which provides for attorney fees,the prevailing party for purposes of civil code section must be determined as to each contract regardless of who prevails in the overall action.
arntz does not apply here.it was not a class action.more importantly,the present action involves a standard sales agreement offered to a class of borrowers instead of the multiple,independent contracts exemplified in arntz.
nor is the federal appellate decision in wooldridge marlene industries helpful to gmac wooldridge was a class action sex discrimination suit that challenged an employer maternity leave policy,which forced pregnant employees to take prescribed leave periods the court agreed with the employer argument that attorney time spent litigating the individual damage claims of class members who did not receive damages could not be compensated since these persons were not prevailing parties within the meaning of the attorneys fees statute.
in whatever way wooldridge aligns with the nature of the class action as defined by the california courts,its facts are enough to distinguish it here.the attorney fee issue in wooldridge concerned the time spent litigating the individual damage claims of class members.wooldridge encompassed extensive litigation on those claims.the same can not be said here.in wooldridge,damage hearings were held and the individual employees were called to testify about their damage claims.numerous,substantial,and factually unique questions were directed at each employee 
in short,the trial court had it right when it commented with respect to the award of attorney fees and costs contrary to gmac assertions,this case has always maintained the character of a class action lawsuit and it is entirely appropriate to look at the results obtained by the class as a collective group.
substantial evidence 
gmac contends that use of the comparative approach can lead to only one reasonable conclusion gmac recovered the greater relief on the contract claims and is therefore the prevailing party under civil code section.we disagree.
gmac tallies a score by noting that it prevailed on all of plaintiffs contract claims,the alleged overcharges for certain cpi coverages,expenses,policy lengths,and deductibles,losing only on the claim involving its accelerated method for computing premium refunds upon cpi cancellation.plaintiffs concede the tally but dispute its significance.they counter that the breach was one of the two major claims that prompted the lawsuit,and constituted a significant victory given the high percentage of cpi policies that are cancelled before the end of their term.in any event,the plaintiffs in krueger bank of america were deemed to be a prevailing party for civil code section purposes even though they failed to prevail on virtually all causes of action stated in their complaint.the plaintiffs in krueger had been exonerated from any further liability on certain guarantees,and the court said t his was no hollow victory.plaintiffs judgment on the contract was no hollow victory either.
gmac cites to plaintiffs settlement and damage proposals,and concludes that plaintiffs recovered only a of what they sought.plaintiffs say this comparison involves apples and oranges because those proposals represented total alleged overcharges combining cash and account credits,while the judgment was only in cash and represented net amounts of excess payments,net of gmac substantial offsets,not total overcharges.
gmac discounts the dismissal of its,contending the dismissal was simply because the could not be pursued as a class action.the facts remain,however,that gmac took nothing on its,the had sought all outstanding amounts that class members owed under the standard sales agreement,and plaintiffs established a substantive breach of that agreement.
finally,gmac claims that plaintiffs did not achieve their other litigation objectives.plaintiffs,however,presented a declaration from an mic official stating two items of interest first,beginning february,the cpi certificate sent to gmac california cpi customers deleted the language that premiums would be earned pursuant to the customary pro rata table and specified that premiums would be earned in accordance with the applicable special cancellation table filed with and approved by the michigan insurance bureau and second,beginning june,all gmac california customers placed with cpi receive annual not policy terms,and premiums earned are calculated according to a pro table.these are weighty changes contained in a weighty piece of evidence.
under the comparative approach,we conclude there is substantial evidence to support a finding that plaintiffs obtained the greater relief on the contract action accordingly,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in this respect.
excessive fees 
gmac claims the trial court abused its discretion by awarding plaintiffs excessive fees.we disagree.
the trial court awarded plaintiffs in attorney fees.
the amount of an attorney fee to be awarded is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court.citation.the trial court is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in its court,and while its judgment is subject to our review,we will not disturb that determination unless we are convinced that it is clearly wrong.a challenge to the amount of the award is upheld only if that amount is so large or small that it shocks the conscience and suggests that passion and prejudice influenced the determination.
the million attorney fee award does not shock our conscience.this case has been ongoing since february.it is a class action involving class members.its trial complexity has been succinctly demonstrated by just the number of interlocutory trips to the appellate.the judge who presided at the trial made the attorney fee award,stating that a fter reviewing the record,is the reasonable amount of attorneys fees under the factors set forth in niederer ferreira d.those factors include the nature of the litigation its difficulty its importance amount of money involved skill required experience attention,time and skill given.the record supports the trial court conclusion that this case was vigorously litigated for more than six years.disputed matters were thoroughly researched,briefed,and argued by highly motivated and experienced attorneys.the complex and technical nature of this case,coupled with the intensity of the litigation,required attorneys on both sides to exercise the highest degree of skill and training.
gmac is concerned that the trial court awarded attorney fees for work on unsuccessful contract claims and on claims.
as for the unsuccessful contract claims,apportionment was unnecessary here.attorney fees need not be apportioned when incurred for representation on an issue common to both a cause of action in which fees are proper and one in which they are not allowed.here,all of the contract claims involved the same contract the standard sales agreement and the same contractual relationship the purchase of cpi the accelerated method of earning premiums was presented to the jury as part of that overall contractual relationship.l itigation may involve a series of attacks on an opponent case.the final ground of resolution may become clear only after a series of unsuccessful attacks.attorney fee c ompensation is ordinarily warranted even for those unsuccessful attacks,to the extent that those attacks led to a successful claim.
as for the claims,if an action asserts both contract and claims,section applies only to attorney fees incurred to litigate the contract claims the trial court did not award as attorney fees representing hour
