plaintiffs,a respiratory therapist and two nurses,allege that the catholic health system of long island,a collection of hospitals,healthcare providers,and related entities collectively,chs,failed to compensate them adequately for time worked during meal breaks,before and after scheduled shifts,and during required training sessions.they sued on behalf of a purported class of similarly situated employees collectively,the plaintiffs and take this appeal from orders of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york seybert,dismissing the claims asserted under the fair labor standards act flsa,the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,and the new york labor law nyll.
we affirm the dismissal of the flsa and rico claims for failure to state a claim.we also affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs nyll overtime claims,which have the same deficiencies as the flsa overtime claims.however,because the district court did not explain why plaintiffs nyll claims were dismissed with prejudice,we vacate that aspect of the judgment and remand for further consideration of the nyll claims.
background 
the original complaint,alleging violations of flsa and rico,was filed in march by daisy ricks,a healthcare employee,on behalf of similarly situated employees,against the long island health network,catholic health services of long island,and various related entities the first amended complaint,filed in june,substituted dennis lundy,patricia wolman,and kelly iwasiuk as lead plaintiffs,dropped some defendants,and added claims under nyll and state common law.the twelve causes of action pleaded were flsa,rico,nyll,implied contract,express contract,implied covenants,quantum meruit,unjust enrichment,fraud,negligent misrepresentation,conversion,and estoppel.this case is one of many similar class actions brought by the same law firm,thomas solomon llp,against numerous healthcare entities in the region.a dozen of them are currently on appeal before this court 
the flsa claims focused on alleged unpaid overtime.in relevant part,flsa overtime provision states that no employer shall employ any of his employees for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and times the regular rate at which he is employed.a 
it is alleged that chs used an automatic timekeeping system that deducted time from paychecks for meals and other breaks even though employees frequently were required to work through their breaks,and that chs failed to pay for time spent working before and after scheduled shifts,and for time spent attending training programs 
the procedural history of this case was prolonged by four attempts to amend the complaint,and various orders dismissing the claims,as recounted below.
a second amended complaint,filed in august,replaced some of the defendants that had been sued in error.on motion,the district court dismissed most of the claims,without prejudice.the flsa overtime claims were dismissed for failure to approximate the number of uncompensated overtime hours.the flsa claim for pay,for unpaid hours below the hour overtime threshold was dismissed with prejudice on the ground that flsa does not permit claims when the employment contract explicitly provides compensation for gap time worked.the rico claims were dismissed with prejudice for insufficient allegations of any pattern of racketeering activity.once the federal claims were dismissed,the state law claims were dismissed without prejudice.
the district court granted leave to replead the flsa overtime claims that were dismissed without prejudice,but cautioned that any future complaint should contain significantly more factual detail concerning who the named plaintiffs are,where they worked,in what capacity they worked,the types of schedules they typically or periodically worked,and any collective bargaining agreements they may have been subject to.special app.the district court said that it would not be impressed if the third amended complaint prattle d on for another paragraphs,solely for the sake of repeating various conclusory allegations many times over.id.at.
the third amended complaint,filed in january,was largely identical to the second with the addition of approximately ten paragraphs.when chs moved to dismiss,the court issued an order sua sponte urging supplemental briefing and a more definite statement.observing that plaintiffs had again failed to achieve sufficient specificity,the court added 
t he court does not believe that it would serve anyone interest to enter another dismissal without prejudice,which would be followed almost assuredly by another amended complaint and then a full round of rule b briefing.instead,the court considers it more appropriate to sua sponte direct plaintiffs to file a more definite statement,which it will then use to judge the sufficiency of the third amended complaint.
special app.the court expressed concern with the vagueness of the pleading,directed plaintiffs to stop hiding the ball,id.at,and listed specific information needed for a more definite statement.
plaintiffs failed to issue a more definite statement and instead filed a fourth amended complaint hereinafter,the complaint in may.the rico and estoppel claims were dropped,and the remaining causes of action were pleaded as before,supplemented with some more facts.
chs renewed motion to dismiss was largely granted in february,on the following grounds 
plaintiffs insufficiently pled the requisite relationship as to each named defendant,because lundy,wolman,and iwasiuk worked only at good samaritan hospital,and because the economic realities of the relationships among defendants did not constitute a single employment organization.the flsa claims against all defendants other than good samaritan were dismissed with prejudice 
the flsa claims against defendant james harden the ceo,president,and director of chs were dismissed with prejudice because the economic reality of his relationship with lundy,wolman,and iwasiuk did not amount to an relationship.
as to the claim that the automatic timekeeping deductions allegedly violated flsa as applied to plaintiffs even though they were not per se illegal,the plaintiffs failed to show that they were personally denied overtime by this system.
as to their flsa overtime allegations against good samaritan,plaintiffs were required to plead that they worked compensable hours in excess of hours per week,and that chs knew that plaintiffs were working overtime.only some of the categories of purportedly unpaid work meal breaks,time before and after scheduled shifts,and training constituted compensable hours.
work during meal breaks is compensable under flsa if predominantly for the employer benefit.special app.although plaintiffs alleged that their meal breaks were typically missed or interrupted,the complaint is void of any facts regarding the nature and frequency of these interruptions during the relevant time period or how often meal breaks were missed altogether as opposed to just interrupted.id.at.absent such specificity,there is no claim for compensable time.
time spent working before and after scheduled shifts is compensable if it is integral and indispensable to performance of the job and not de minimis.id.at.vague assertions that wolman and iwasiuk spent fifteen to thirty minutes before their shifts preparing their assignments did not state a claim for compensable time.id.at.on the other hand,lundy allegation that he had to arrive early to receive his assignment from the nurse working the prior shift and leave late to hand off assignments to the nurse taking over could be compensable.
time spent at training is not compensable if it is outside regular hours,if attendance is voluntary,if the training is not directly related to the job,and if the employee does not perform productive work during the training.see id.at.wolman and lundy allegations regarding monthly,mandatory staff meetings stated claims for compensable time.iwasiuk made no allegation of uncompensated trainings.
the potentially valid allegations of compensable time nevertheless did not allege that the compensable time exceeded hours,as required for a flsa overtime claim.wolman and iwasiuk sparse allegations could not support a claim for time in excess of hours.and plaintiffs conceded that lundy never actually worked more than hours in one week.the flsa claims against good samaritan were therefore dismissed without prejudice.
once the federal claims were dismissed,discretion was exercised against taking jurisdiction over the state law claims,thereby also dismissing them without prejudice.
having done all this,the district court granted plaintiffs limited leave to file a further complaint alleging only those claims that had been dismissed without prejudice,and again gave specific guidance as to the contours of such a complaint.special app.
in response to plaintiffs inquiry,the district court issued another order a month later,clarifying the scope of the february order dismissing the complaint.the court explained that it dismissed all claims against all defendants,except good samaritan,and that the flsa and nyll claims were dismissed with prejudice,while the remaining state law claims were not.see id.at.
plaintiffs mercifully elected to forgo another amended complaint,and instead filed their notice of appeal on april,indicating their intent to appeal the district court december order dismissing the second amended complaint,the may sua sponte order requesting supplemental briefing,the february order dismissing the fourth amended complaint,and the march order clarifying the scope of the dismissal.
discussion 
on appeal,plaintiffs challenge the dismissal of the overtime claims under flsa the claims under flsa and nyll the nyll claims with prejudice and the rico claims.
we review de novo dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true,and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.holmes grubman,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,d internal quotation marks omitted.
nevertheless,the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.id.threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,supported by mere conclusory statements,do not suffice.id.pleadings that are no more than conclusions are not entitled to the assumption of truth.id.at.
as to the overtime claims under flsa,plaintiffs argue that they sufficiently alleged i compensable work that was unpaid,ii uncompensated work in excess of hours in a given week,and iii status as employees of all the defendants.although the district court held plaintiffs complaint lacking on all three grounds,we affirm on the second ground the failure to allege uncompensated work in excess of hours in a given week because it entirely disposes of the flsa overtime claims.
section a of flsa requires that,for a workweek longer than forty hours,an employee who works in excess of forty hours shall be compensated for that excess work at a rate not less than one and times the regular rate at which he is employed,time and a half.a so,to survive a motion to dismiss,plaintiffs must allege sufficient factual matter to state a plausible claim that they worked compensable overtime in a workweek longer than hours.under federal rule of civil procedure a,a plausible claim contains factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.iqbal,at see also bell atl.twombly,d factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true even if doubtful in fact.internal citation omitted.
we have not previously considered the degree of specificity needed to state an overtime claim under flsa.federal courts have diverged somewhat on the question.see butler directsat usa,llc,d,recognizing that courts across the country have expressed differing views as to the level of factual detail necessary to plead a claim for overtime compensation under flsa.within this circuit,some courts have required an approximation of the total uncompensated hours worked during a given workweek in excess of hours.see,nichols mahoney,d,zhong august august,d.courts elsewhere have done without an estimate of overtime,and deemed sufficient an allegation that plaintiff worked some amount in excess of hours without compensation.see,butler,d at collecting cases.
we conclude that in order to state a plausible flsa overtime claim,a plaintiff must sufficiently allege hours of work in a given workweek as well as some uncompensated time in excess of the hours.see a requiring that,for a workweek longer than forty hours,an employee who works in excess of forty hours shall be compensated time and a half for the excess hours.
determining whether a plausible claim has been pled is a task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.iqbal,at.reviewing plaintiffs allegations,as the district court thoroughly did,we find no plausible claim that flsa was violated,because plaintiffs have not alleged a single workweek in which they worked at least hours and also worked uncompensated time in excess of hours.
wolman was typically scheduled to work three shifts per week,totaling hours.she occasionally worked an additional hour shift or worked a slightly longer shift,but how occasionally or how long,she does not say nor does she say that she was denied overtime pay in any such particular week.she alleges three types of uncompensated work minute meal breaks which were typically missed or interrupted uncompensated time before and after her scheduled shifts,typically resulting in an additional minutes per shift and trainings such as a monthly staff meeting,typically lasting minutes,and respiratory therapy training consisting of,on average,hours per year.id.
she has not alleged that she ever completely missed all three meal breaks in a week,or that she also worked a full minutes of uncompensated time around every shift but even if she did,she would have alleged a total hours and minutes worked.a monthly minute staff meeting,an installment of the ten yearly hours of training,or an additional or longer shift could theoretically put her over the hour mark in one or another unspecified week or weeks but her allegations supply nothing but fuel for speculation,not the plausible claim that is required.
iwasiuk typically worked four shifts per week,totaling hours.she claims that approximately twice a month,she worked five to six shifts instead of four shifts,totaling between and hours.id.like wolman,iwasiuk does not allege that she was denied overtime pay in a week where she worked these additional shifts.by way of uncompensated work,she alleges that her minute meal breaks were typically missed or interrupted and that she worked uncompensated time before her scheduled shifts,typically minutes,and after her scheduled shifts,often an additional two hours.id.maybe she missed all of her meal breaks,and always worked an additional minutes before and two hours after her shifts,and maybe some of these labors were performed in a week when she worked more than her four shifts.but this invited speculation does not amount to a plausible claim under flsa.
lundy worked between and hours per week,and plaintiffs conceded below and do not dispute on appeal that he never worked over hours in any given week.
we therefore affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs flsa overtime claims.we need not consider alternative grounds that were conscientiously explored by the district court,such as the lack of an relationship between the named plaintiffs and many of the defendants,and the insufficient allegations that additional minutes,such as meal breaks,were compensable as a matter of law.
a claim is one in which an employee has not worked hours in a given week but seeks recovery of unpaid time worked,or in which an employee has worked ov
