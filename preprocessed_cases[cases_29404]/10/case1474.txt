the question presented in this appeal concerns a district court authority to interpret or modify a consent,the settlement of a class action brought by over farmers charging the united states department of agriculture with racial discrimination in lending practices.due to class counsel failure bordering on legal malpractice,the district court called meet critical consent decree deadlines,the district court interpreted the decree to allow extension of such deadlines so long as justice requires.although we find that the district court exceeded its interpretive authority under the decree,we hold that class counsel conduct justifies modifying the decree under federal rule of civil procedure b.but because the order does not satisfy the tailor ing requirement for a rule b modification,see rufo inmates of the suffolk county jail,d,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
proceeding under the equal credit opportunity act,three farmers filed this class action against the united states department of agriculture alleging racial discrimination in the administration of federally funded credit and benefit programs.the class ultimately included similarly situated farmers from fifteen states.shortly before the farmers filed suit,the department released a report commissioned by dan glickman to address the agency civil rights problems,documented since the by numerous federal government s tudies,reports,and task forces.civil rights action team,usda,civil rights at the united states department of agriculture,available at.examining the painful history of its dealings with farmers,the department concluded that local credit and loan agencies responsible for administering department programs often discriminated against the farmers.id.at.according to the glickman report,department officials had effectively dismantled the office for civil rights very office charged with addressing discrimination complaints.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.o ften mak ing matters worse,the complaints processing system was a bureaucratic nightmare that processed complaints slowly,if at all,resulting in a huge backlog,while at the same time the agency proceed ed with farm where discrimination may have contributed to the farmers plight.id.at.minority farmers,the report concluded,lost significant amounts of land and potential farm income as a result of discrimination by usda programs.id.at.
after congress intervened to preserve the farmers claims by tolling the equal credit opportunity act statute of limitations,see pigford glickman,citing f,the parties entered into a consent decree.designed to ensur e that in their dealings with usda,all class members receive full and fair treatment that is the same as the treatment accorded to similarly situated white persons,the decree establishes procedures for resolving class members individual claims.consent decree at.specifically,the decree allows class members to choose between two claims procedures,known as tracks a and b.in recognition of the fact that most class members had little in the way of documentation or proof of either discriminatory treatment or damages suffered,track a awards to those farmers able to meet only a minimal burden of proof.pigford,at.track mechanism at issue no cap on damages,but requires farmers who choose this track,after limited discovery consisting essentially of an exchange of lists of witnesses and exhibits and depositions of the opposing side witnesses,to prove their claims by a preponderance of the evidence in before an arbitrator.id.at.set forth in paragraph of the decree,track b establishes strict time frames the arbitrator sends a hearing notice within days of receiving a track b claim and holds a hearing no more than days later at least days before the hearing,the department and claimant file and serve on each other witness lists,summaries of direct testimony,and copies of all exhibits discovery ends no later than days before the hearing and no fewer than days before the hearing,both sides list witnesses they intend to crossexamine and file summaries of all legal and factual issues.consent decree a e.track a and b decisions are final,except that the losing side may petition for review by a monitor.id.a v,b v,i,b iii.
following notice to the class and a hearing,the district court approved the consent decree as fair,adequate,and reasonable,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.pigford,at.according to the district court,the decree represents an historical first step toward righting the wrongs visited upon thousands of farmers for decades by the usda.pigford glickman,d.our opinion affirming the district court approval of the decree noted its importance for both the farmers and the government the united states is likely to provide an estimated billion in debt relief and monetary payments in consideration for the dismissal of the class s complaint.pigford glickman.ultimately,claims were accepted for under track a and under track 
the decree provided for class counsel to receive an advance payment of million in fees to cover decree implementation.consent decree b.the decree entitled counsel to seek additional fees under the equal credit opportunity act,d,for their work in connection with filing the action and implementing the decree,consent decree a.one year into the implementation process,the district court took the extraordinary step of awarding a second advance this time for million.order of the united states district court for the district of columbia at.the department and class counsel eventually settled all fee claims for million.attorneys and firms sharing the fees were alexander pires,of conlon,frantz,phelan,pires leavy philip fracas,of tattle,tabor heron jb.chestnut,of chestnut,sanders,sanders pettily roe framer,of langshan,frazer,sweet freese hubbard saunders iv,of the terney firm othello cross,of cross,kearney mckissic gerard lear,of speiser krause and william smith.
several months after class counsel received their second fee advance and just two weeks prior to the deadline for filing petitions for monitor review for the vast majority of claimants in both tracks,class counsel filed an emergency motion seeking an extension of time.order of the united states district court for the district of columbia at.counsel revealed that they had filed only a small fraction of the total petitions requested by the farmers.concerned that counsel failings not be visited on their clients,id.at,and relying on explicit assurances by counsel as to the work load they could realistically shoulder into the future,pigford veneman,d,the district court permitted counsel to file pro forma petitions by the original deadline and then to either file supporting materials or to withdraw the petitions at the rate of at least petitions per month,see order of the united states district court for the district of columbia at.
a few months later,the district court observed a very disturbing trend class counsel had failed to meet their monthly quota even once.pigford,d at.worse still,counsel had drastically cut their staff,bring ing class counsel ability to represent the farmers into serious question.id.a larmed by class counsel consistent failure to meet decree timelines,the district court noted counsel remarkable admission that they never had a realistic expectation of meeting or deadlines for the monitor review process.order of the united states district court for the district of columbia at.the court described counsel performance as dismal border ing on legal malpractice and wonder ed whether class counsel would have been in such a predicament had they not filed three new sister class actions against the department.id.at nn.
the district court eventually imposed a series of escalating daily fines on class counsel for untimely monitor review filings.pigford veneman,d.instead of simply submitting materials in support of their clients petitions in a more timely fashion,however,counsel drastically increased the rate at which they withdrew petitions for monitor to once again leading the district court to question class counsel fidelity to their clients.pigford veneman,d.
class counsel failure to cope with their responsibilities extended to the track b process.consider the case of earl kitchen,a farmer from arkansas who filed a track b claim.kitchen was initially represented by jesse kearney,a member of one of the firms sharing in the fee award,cross,kearney mckissic.during the course of representing kitchen,kearney obtained extensions of several paragraph deadlines either with consent or over the department objection.around the time the department agreed to pay class counsel million,kearney missed the deadline already extended by mutual consent to submit written direct testimony.kearney failure could have drastic consequences,for absent submission of testimony,kitchen claim will be extinguished.appellees br.at see also consent decree g putting the burden of proof on the claimant.
in the meantime,the district court,deeply concerned about the decree viability,asked the american bar association committee on pro bono and public services to assemble a team of pro bono lawyers to assist class counsel on an emergency basis.order of the united states district court for the district of columbia at.in response,lawyers from the pro bono committee and the firms of arnold porter and crowell moring recruited some of washington largest law firms covington burling sidley,austin,brown wood steptoe johnson swidler,berlin,shereff friedman and wilmer,cutler,and pickering.the district court,recognizing the competing demands on class counsel arising out of their representation of multiple claimants in both tracks and at various stages of the claims resolution process,hoped that this added assistance would lift the heavy burden of track b litigation from the shoulders of class counsel,enabling them to focus on the petition for monitor review process.pigford,d at.
pro bono counsel took over the representation of earl kitchen and asked the department to extend the time for filing written direct testimony.the department refused.as a result and because class counsel had apparently missed deadlines in other track b cases,pro bono counsel filed a motion to endow,asking the district court to interpret and if necessary,to modify the consent decree,so that arbitrators have discretion to extend deadlines when strict compliance with the original scheduling framework would defeat the decree overarching remedial purposes.pls.mot.to endow at.granting the motion,the district court found it implicit in the decree terms that arbitrators have such discretion.pigford veneman,d.
the department appeals.at its request,we entered a stay pending appeal.
district courts possess two types of authority over consent decrees.first,they may interpret and enforce a decree to the extent authorized either by the decree or by the related order.see bd.of trustees of hotel rest.employees local madison hotel,observing that a district court retains enforcement jurisdiction over a settlement if litigants so provide in their stipulation of dismissal or the dismissal order incorporates the settlement terms.second,they may modify a decree pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.see rufo,at.at holding that the rule b standard for modifying judgments applies to consent decrees.these two sources of authority reflect a consent decree hybrid character,having qualities of both contracts and court orders.see id.at.at explaining that a consent decree is contractual in nature but also an agreement that the parties desire and expect will be reflected in,and be enforceable as,a judicial decree.
the farmers based their motion to endow on both sources of authority.in granting the motion,the district court explained that it was exercising its authority to enforce and to interpret an approved consent decree.pigford,d at.although the court thus never addressed the question of its rule b authority,the farmers maintain that we may affirm the order on either ground.we consider each in turn.
interpretation and enforcement 
reasoning that the decree explicitly allows for its construction in a liberal manner,and that paragraph delegate s the district court authority over track b claims to arbitrators,the district court found it implicit in the terms of the consent decree that arbitrators have essentially the same authority over track b hearings that a trial judge would have over a trial or related proceedings,including discretion to allow for revision of certain deadlines,even after the deadlines have passed,so long as justice requires the revisions and provided that the burden on the defendant is not so great as to outweigh the interest of the claimant in fully presenting his or her claim.id.at.the department argues that the consent decree gives the district court no such authority.according to the department,the district court only authority either to interpret or enforce the consent decree comes from paragraph,which concern s alleged violation s of any provision of th e decree,and directs t he person seeking enforcement of a provision of th e decree to attempt to resolve any problems without court intervention and then to seek enforcement through contempt proceedings.consent decree see also id.retaining the court authority to enforce the decree through contempt proceedings.since the farmers neither alleged a violation nor invoked the procedures for seeking enforcement,the department contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion to endow.defending the district court order and relying on our statement in beckett air line pilots ass that it is a principle that a trial court retains jurisdiction to enforce its consent decrees,the farmers argue that the order was properly grounded on jurisdiction ancillary to that explicitly conferred by paragraph,appellees br.at.pursuant to this ancillary jurisdiction,the farmers contend,the district court properly enforce d the decree overarching remedial purposes.id.at.the farmers also argue that quite apart from paragraph,the district court had inherent authority to interpret the decree.id.at.
we agree with the department.in kokkonen guardian life insurance of america,the supreme court held that a district court lacked ancillary jurisdiction to enforce a consent decree because neither the decree nor the order dismissing the case expressly retained jurisdiction to do so,d.although kokkonen differs from the situation consent decree in this case does retain certain enforcement decision teaches that district courts enjoy no ancillary jurisdiction to enforce consent decrees,but are instead constrained by the terms of the decree and related order.see id.at.at explaining that if the dismissal order had retained jurisdiction or incorporated the settlement,then a breach of the agreement would be a violation of the order,and ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the agreement would therefore exist.accordingly,an enforcement clause limited by its plain language,as is paragraph,to situations involving decree violations confers no ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the decree overarching purposes.indeed,when the district court approved the decree,it observed that the parties added the enforcement provision because the original version appeared to prevent the court from exercising jurisdiction in the event that the usda did not comply with its terms,pigford,at,bolstering our view that the enforcement provision means what it says.
beckett does not warrant a different result.not only did the beckett decree preserve the district court jurisdiction over the case to enforce the terms of the decree,at,but the party seeking enforcement in the farmers that the other party had violated the decree terms,id.at.
equally unpersuasive is the farmers argument that we need not worry about paragraph limitations because the district court possesses inherent interpretive power over the decree whether or not for explicit enforcement purposes.appellees br.at.for one thing,we see no way the district court interpretive authority can be unhinged from its enforcement authority.if the district court lacks paragraph enforcement authority because the farmers alleged no violation,then the farmers gain nothing from an interpretation that arbitrators may adjust paragraph deadlines.furthermore,none of the ap
