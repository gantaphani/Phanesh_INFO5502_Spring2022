is an unnamed member of a putative class who successfully objects to class certification and approval of a proposed classwide settlement agreement entitled to an award of attorney fees under either code of civil procedure section which codifies the private attorney general doctrine articulated in serrano priest cal d,serrano iii or general equitable principles as to the first part of the question,because the objector is not the functional equivalent of a private attorney general pursuing an action to enforce an important public right,he or she is not entitled to fees under section.
as to the second part,an objector who persuades the court not to approve a settlement may be entitled to attorney fees under the equitable common fund or substantial benefit doctrines,provided the objector subsequently demonstrates he or she has actually benefited the class that is,the ultimate class recovery exceeded that which would have been achieved in the absence of the objector efforts.an objector who simply defeats class certification,however,even if he or she thereby confers some concrete benefit on absent members of the putative class,can not be awarded attorney fees under equitable principles because there is no one before the court from whom such fees can properly be recovered.
factual and procedural background 
the proposition lawsuit on behalf of the general public 
on june,consumer cause,filed this lawsuit on behalf of itself and the general public against whole foods market california,whole foods,alleging violations of the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of health,et,commonly known as proposition.consumer cause alleged that whole foods had violated proposition by selling firewood and certain progesterone creams without the clear consumer warning labels that must be displayed on products that contain detectable amounts of chemicals known to cause cancer or birth defects the complaint,filed pursuant to california unfair competition law bus,et,sought an injunction,restitution and attorney fees whole foods denied all allegations of liability and filed a for equitable contribution,indemnity and declaratory relief against old durham wood,and kokoro,llc,the manufacturers of the products at issue.
the proposed classwide settlement 
after a successful mediation whole foods,old durham,kokoro and consumer cause agreed to settle the lawsuit.consumer cause would seek leave to amend its complaint to allege it was pursuing claims on behalf of all persons similarly situated,in addition to being brought by consumer cause in a representative capacity on behalf of the general public.whole foods and old durham acknowledged they had made adjustments to the marketing and display of products to satisfy consumer cause.kokoro was recognized as exempt from the requirements of proposition,and common cause agreed that whole foods and old durham were currently in compliance with all health and safety code requirements.counsel for consumer cause was to be paid in attorney fees.in return,consumer cause and all class members who did not of the settlement would generally release,in the broadest possible terms,all claims against whole foods,old durham and kokoro for health and safety code violations.
pursuant to the terms of the proposed settlement,consumer cause requested and was provisionally granted leave to file a third amended complaint,this time as a putative class action,identifying the class as the general public and naming whole foods,old durham and kokoro as direct defendants.like its predecessor,the proposed third amended complaint sought injunctive relief and attorney fees but no damages or restitution.thereafter,the parties filed a stipulated joint motion seeking preliminary approval of the settlement and certification of the class for purposes of settlement.
preliminary approval of the class action 
at the hearing for preliminary approval for class certification and settlement,the trial court expressed serious reservations about the breadth of the proposed class and the fairness of the settlement.nonetheless,based on supplemental briefing by whole foods,the court granted preliminary approval of a class identified as all members of the general public within the state of california,including consumers who between june,and the present,through acquisition,purchase,storage consumption or other reasonable foreseeable use of consumer products may have been exposed to products of defendant whole foods,old durham kokoro or their representative manufacturers,suppliers,or distributors,known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive harm.the court ordered publication of notice of the proposed settlement to putative class members and scheduled a hearing to consider both the fairness of the settlement and final approval of the class action.
objections to class certification and the proposed settlement 
nicholas giampietro,an unnamed member of the putative class,filed objections to class certification and proposed settlement on behalf of himself and all absent class members.giampietro,through his experienced class action counsel,argued that final class certification should be denied because the putative class was overly broad consumer cause,which had not been directly damaged as a result of the unlawful conduct,was not an adequate class representative and notice to absent class members did not satisfy minimum due process standards.in addition,because consumer cause complaint sought only injunctive relief and attorney fees,giampietro asserted the identified class did not substantially benefit from use of the class action procedure and it was therefore more appropriate for the action to proceed as an individual action on behalf of the public.
giampietro also argued the settlement was unfair and the release vastly overbroad.although the complaint was rooted in a violation of proposition,the 
release,as having been made as the broadest possible release,covered any and all claims against the defendants for unfair business practices under business and professions code section.in addition,giampietro presented evidence whole foods and old durham were still not in compliance with proposition they had not posted the requisite warnings.
denial of class certification and final approval of the settlement 
at the hearing on the fairness of the settlement,the trial court expressly found giampietro focused objections and argument persuasive and,relying on giampietro stated objections as the bases for its ruling,denied the motion for class certification and final settlement approval.
consumer cause dismissal of the action 
following rejection of the proposed settlement,whole foods filed a motion for summary judgment directed to the second amended complaint,arguing it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because it had not been served with notice,as required by the governing regulations implementing proposition and that in the absence of such notice consumer cause could not prove whole foods knowingly or intentionally violated either health and safety code section or business and professions code section.before the hearing on the motion,consumer cause filed a request for dismissal of the entire action without prejudice.dismissal was entered on march.
giampietro motion for attorney fees and costs 
on april,giampietro filed a motion for an award of attorney fees and costs.giampietro asserted that,by providing an adversarial context to the court review of the proposed class action and settlement and persuading the court to deny class certification and final approval of the settlement,he had vindicated important rights for the benefit of the provisionally certified class,entitling him to attorney fees under section and general equitable principles.the trial court denied the motion,explaining it had no authority to award attorney fees under section because giampietro was not a party in the action,and there was no basis for a fee award under equitable principles.giampietro subsequent motion to intervene in the action was denied.
giampietro filed a timely appeal from both the order denying his motion for attorney fees and the order denying his motion to intervene for purposes of establishing his right to attorney fees.
contentions 
giampietro contends the court erred in concluding it had no authority to award attorney fees under either the private attorney general doctrine codified in section or the equitable substantial benefit and adversarial context doctrines.
discussion 
giampietro has standing to appeal 
at the threshold we reject whole foods contention giampietro lacks standing to appeal the court order denying his motion for attorney fees because he was not a named party in consumer cause lawsuit.a class member who appears at a fairness hearing and objects to a settlement affecting that class member has standing to appeal an adverse decision notwithstanding the fact that the member did not formally intervene in the action.rebney wells fargo bank d.trotsky los angeles fed.sav.loan d.member of affected class whose objections to settlement were overruled is aggrieved party with standing to appeal wershba apple computer,th,d in context of a class settlement,objecting is the procedural equivalent of intervening see also devlin scardelletti,d under federal law unnamed class members who object in timely manner to approval of class action settlement at fairness hearing have standing to appeal without first intervening.
whole foods asserts that,because giampietro objections to class certification and settlement were effectively sustained,he is not aggrieved by the trial court order.see county of alameda carleson cal d,only an aggrieved party has standing to appeal eggert pac.states cal d,see also any party aggrieved may appeal in cases prescribed in this title.although whole foods is correct giampietro was not adversely affected by the order denying its motion for final approval of the settlement,he was plainly aggrieved by the subsequent order denying his request for attorney fees and has standing to appeal that order.see brun bailey th,d nonparty has standing to appeal trial court denial of motion for protective order to direct payment of expert witness fee.
the trial court did not err in concluding giampietro was ineligible for attorney fees under the equitable substantial benefit doctrine 
governing law 
under the general american rule,codified in section,a prevailing litigant is not entitled to an award of attorney fees in the absence of statutory or contractual provisions.trope katz cal th,d.the supreme court,however,has relied on its inherent equitable authority to develop several additional exceptions to the american rule.trope,at,d.two of those exceptions are the common fund doctrine and the substantial benefit doctrine.serrano iii,supra,cal d at,serrano unruh cal d,cziraki thunder cats,th,d.
the common fund doctrine,frequently applied in class actions when the efforts of the attorney for the named class representatives produce monetary benefits for the entire class,is rooted in the historic power of equity to permit the trustee of a fund or property,or a party preserving or recovering a fund for the benefit of others in addition to himself,to recover his costs,including his attorneys fees,from the fund or property itself or directly from the other parties enjoying the benefit.alyeska pipeline wilderness society,d serrano iii,supra,cal d at.the doctrine is based on the commonsense notion that the one who expends attorneys fees in winning a suit which creates a fund from which others derive benefits may require those passive beneficiaries to bear a fair share of the litigation costs.quinn state of california cal d.an award of fees under the equitable common fund doctrine is analogous to an action in quantum meruit the individual seeking compensation has,by his actions,benefited another and seeks payment for the value of the service performed.serrano unruh,supra,cal d at.an essential prerequisite to the application of the equitable common fund principle is the existence of a fund from which attorney fees may be paid.serrano iii,supra,cal d at.
the substantial benefit doctrine is an extension of the common fund doctrine.it applies when no common fund has been created,but a concrete and significant benefit,although nonmonetary in nature,has nonetheless been conferred on an ascertainable class.serrano unruh,supra,cal d at.we recently recognized application of the substantial benefit doctrine in shareholder derivative cases,when the action produces a substantial benefit for the corporation on whose behalf the action was prosecuted.cziraki thunder cats,supra,th at,d see also fletcher industries,d.corporation benefiting from derivative action must pay shareholder attorney fees under substantial benefit doctrine.
while there is no direct authority in california applying the substantial benefit doctrine to award attorney fees to an objector who successfully opposes settlement of a class action,a number of federal courts have endorsed use of the doctrine to award attorney fees to an objector whose actions substantially benefit class members.see,reynolds beneficial nat.bank cir reynolds attorney fees may be appropriate under substantial benefit doctrine when efforts of objector produce improvement in settlement shaw toshiba america information systems,d,attorney fees appropriately awarded to objector who succeeded in doubling length of time available for class members to redeem coupons,thereby conferring substantial benefit on class in re domestic air transp.antitrust litigation,when objections produced a beneficial effect upon the progress of the litigation,an award of fees is appropriate,quoting frankenstein mccrory,petrovic amoco oil cir,petrovic no entitlement to attorney fee award when objectors did little to increase amount of settlement for benefit of class.
the leitmotiv of all these opinions is that the objector must establish his or her efforts produced a concrete benefit for the class,allowing it to recover more or otherwise be in an improved position than it would have in the absence of the objectors efforts.reynolds,supra,at.for example,when the objector causes a settlement to be disapproved,resulting in a subsequent,more beneficial settlement for the class,the objector is entitled to fees from the common settlement fund.see,shaw toshiba america information systems,supra,d at.on the other hand,if,following disapproval of a proposed settlement,the defendant prevails on the merits or a subsequent settlement provides a smaller recovery for the class than the original,the objector has achieved nothing for the class.under those circumstances an attorney fee award is properly denied.similarly,if the objectors position and arguments are simply cumulative,the trial court may properly deny fees on the ground the objector has added nothing of value,even if the objections are sustained.reynolds,at where other parties had vigorously argued against proposed reversion in settlement,objectors added nothing to settlement and attorney fees under substantial benefit doctrine properly denied petrovic,supra,at.
giampietro did not confer a substantial benefit on a class of beneficiaries subject to court order 
giampietro argues a significant benefit was conferred on the absent putative class members because,due to his counsel efforts,those individuals are not subject to a release of all claims against whole foods,as provided in the proposed settlement agreement.giampietro argument suffers from two flaws.first,the proposed settlement contained an provision,permitting any member of the putative class who wished to preserve his or her right to assert violations of the health and safety code or unfair competition law against the defendants to do so.disapproval of the proposed settlement was unnecessary to accomplish this preservation and vindication of statutory rights intended to protect the health and safety of consumers second,even assuming the right to assert statutory claims against whole foods and the other defendants was preserved,giampietro did not establish there was any value to those potential claims.indeed,although the proposed general release swept more broadly than the claims asserted by consumer cause in the litigation itself,the voluntary dismissal of the lawsuit once whole foods moved for summary judgment suggests the core claims lacked substantial merit.
more importantly,even if we were to assume giampietro efforts in preventing class certification and approval of the proposed settlement conferred a benefit on an identifiable class,the members of the putative class consisting of the general public in no longer before the court.yet neither consumer cause nor whole foods nor old durham nor kokoro,the parties to the action,is alleged to have benefited from the objector successful efforts to persuade the trial court to jettison the parties mediated resolution of the lawsuit and deny class certification.we are thus faced with a request by an unnamed putative class objector to have his attorney fees paid by a party for whom the objector efforts yielded no benefit.there is simply no basis in the quantum meruit principle underlying these equitable exceptions to the american rule that would permit such an outcome.understandably,giampietro does not propose that the absent putative class members somehow be assessed for their fair share of his attorney fees.
apparently recognizing this obstacle to payment of his fees,giampietro urges he is entitled to an award of fees whether or not his actions conferred a concrete benefit because he provided an adversarial context to the litigation,assisting the trial court in fulfilling its obligation to protect absent class members from an unwarranted class action and an unfair settlement.in advancing this argument,giampietro relies on language in some of the federal cases recognizing that individuals who come forward with objections to a proposed class settlement can provide a valuable service to the litigation it is desirable to have as broad a range of participants in the fairness hearing as possible because of the risk of collusion over attorneys fees and the terms of settlement generally.this participation is encouraged by permitting lawyers who contribute materially to the proceeding to obtain a fee.reynolds,supra,at see also bell atlantic bolger cir,objectors play an important role by giving courts access to information on the settlement merits in a context in which class and defense counsel can be expected to spotlight the proposal strengths and slight its defects.yet,as circuit judge richard posner recognized in reynolds,the case principally relied on by giampietro,adversarial context,by itself,is not enough to justify an award of fees the principles of restitution underlying equitable fee awards require,however,that the objectors produce an improvement in the settlement worth more than the fee they are seeking otherwise they have rendered no benefit to the class.reynolds,at,italics added.in other words,providing assistance to the court in its effort to protect class members from unfair settlements,while laudable,alone is not a sufficient basis for recovery of attorney fees.the objector efforts must also produce significant benefit to the class of passive beneficiaries from whom it seeks payment of its fees.
giampietro has not,and can not,show that his efforts resulted in any substantial benefit to the absent members of the putative class.even if he could,equity does not demand payment of his fees by those who were not the beneficiaries,passive or otherwise,of his efforts.accordingly,the trial court did not err in denying giampietro request for attorney fees under the equitable substantial benefit doctrine.
giampietro is not entitled to attorney fees under section 
governing law 
enacted in,section codifies a third equitable exception to the american rule,the private attorney general doctrine articulated in seranno iii,supra,cal d.see serrano unruh,supra,cal d at,fn,codifies private attorney general doctrine for awarding fees.the fundamental objective of the doctrine is to encourage suits effectuating a strong public policy by awarding substantial attorney fees to those who successfully bring such suits and thereby benefit a broad class of citizens.woodland hills residents,city council cal d,bruno bell d.the doctrine rests upon the recognition that privately initiated lawsuits are often essential to the effectuation of the fundamental public policies embodied in constitutional or statutory provisions,and that,without some mechanism authorizing the award of attorney fees,private actions to enforce such important public policies will as a practical matter frequently be infeasible.graham daimlerchrysler cal th,d,daimlerchrysler.
to qualify for an attorney fee award under section,the party seeking attorney fees must show he or she is a successful party in an action brought to enforce an important right affecting the public interest a significant benefit pecuniary or nonpecuniary has been conferred on the general public or a broad class of persons and the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement transcends the litigant personal interest in the controversy.city of hawaiian gardens city of long beach th,d.
whole foods contends giampietro fails to satisfy the first requirement because he was never a party to the action.giampietro,on the other hand,insists an unnamed member of a putative class who successfully objects to class certification and a proposed classwide settlement agreement must be deemed a successful party as that term is used in whether or not the objector has formally intervened in the action.see daimlerchrysler,supra,cal th at,d,advocating a broad,pragmatic view of what constitutes a successful party under section see also wershba apple computer,supra,th at,d objecting to classwide settlement is procedural equivalent of intervening.
the debate whether formal intervention is required before an objector to class certification may obtain attorney fees under section is misdirected.even if giampietro had been permitted to intervene in the action,his efforts,confined to defeating class certification and the proposed classwide settlement of a proposition lawsuit regarding the absence of warning labels on firewood and progesterone cream sold by whole foods,do not qualify him for attorney fees as a successful party in an action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest.see nelson county of los angeles th,d purpose of private attorney general doctrine is to provide some incentive for the plaintiff who acts as a true private attorney general,prosecuting a lawsuit that enforces an important public right.
giampietro did not act as the functional equivalent of a private attorney general pursuing an action resulting in the enforcement of an important public right 
relying on daimlerchrysler,supra,cal th at pages,d,in which the supreme court reaffirmed california acceptance of the catalyst theory,which permits recovery of attorney fees under section if the plaintiff has realized its litigation objectives even if no final judgment is obtained,giampietro argues he effectively became the successful party in the action when the trial court sustained his objections,denied final certification of the putative class and disapproved the proposed class settlement.giampietro asserts predicating his right to recover attorney fees on whether he actually prosecuted an action would unduly elevate procedure over substance and observes it is the nature of the relief sought,not the label or procedural device by which the action is brought,that is determinative of the right to seek fees under section.in re head cal d,prisoners who successfully challenged department of corrections furlough program were entitled to fees under,even though action was brought in nature of habeas corpus rather than civil mandate proceeding.
although giampietro unquestionably realized the objectives of defeating class certification and the proposed classwide settlement,it is the objective of the lawsuit that is critical to recovering fees under section,not the success of an ancillary part of the action.by its terms,section authorizes attorney fees if the action results in the enforcement of an important public right affecting the public interest.likewise,the purpose of section authorization of a fee award is to give private citizens an incentive to bring lawsuits enforcing important pu
