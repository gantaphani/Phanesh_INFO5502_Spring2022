in these consolidated class actions,the plaintiffs,current or former pharmaceutical sales representatives employed by defendant novartis pharmaceuticals corporation novartis,appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,paul crotty,judge,denying their claims under the fair labor standards act of flsa or the act,et,and state law,for overtime pay with respect to time worked in excess of hours per week.the district court granted novartis motion for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiffs are outside salesmen administrative employees who are exempted from the flsa overtime pay requirements.on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the district court did not properly apply the exemption standards set out in regulations promulgated under the flsa by the united states secretary of labor the secretary,see.the secretary,appearing as amicus curiae,endorses that contention.for the reasons that follow,we agree with plaintiffs and the secretary we thus vacate the judgment of the district court.
background 
novartis researches,manufactures,markets,and sells pharmaceuticals.the plaintiffs are some persons who were employed by novartis at various times between march,and april,as sales representatives reps in california or new york,and who are parties to class actions in the united states district courts for the central district of california or the southern district of new york,respectively,along with reps employed by novartis in other states during that period who have opted to join these actions.the actions were consolidated in the southern district of new york by the judicial pan el on litigation for coordinated pretrial proceedings pursuant to.plaintiffs alleged principally that under the flsa and state law,they were entitled to overtime pay at the rate of one and times their normal compensation for time worked in excess of hours per week.the following facts are not in dispute.
novartis use of pharmaceutical sales representatives 
to market its pharmaceuticals,novartis has a team of brand managers who,cognizant of limitations imposed by the united states food and drug administration fda,devise descriptions of the essential features of each novartis drug.marketing managers assist in the production of written promotional materials.novartis has regional managers who are involved in hiring,firing,and business planning decisions,including working on marketing strategy with the marketing team.reporting to the regional managers are district managers who supervise the 
under federal regulations,novartis is prohibited from selling its prescription drugs directly to patients.instead,novartis typically sells its products to wholesalers,which sell them to individual pharmacies.physicians write prescriptions that permit patients to purchase those products from pharmacies.novartis employs some reps nationwide and assigns them to make what novartis characterizes as sales calls on physicians.
reps do not sell the novartis products to physicians.although novartis advertises openings for reps as sales positions,the reps duties do not include the exchange of good s or services,contracting to sell any good or service,consigning for the sale of any good or service,or obtaining orders or contracts for the use of facilities.plaintiffs rule statement of undisputed material facts in support of their motion for summary judgment defendant novartis pharmaceuticals corporation responses to plaintiffs rule statement of undisputed material facts in support of their motion for summary judgment.rather,in visits typically lasting no longer than five minutes,the reps provide physicians with information about the benefits of particular novartis pharmaceuticals and encourage the physicians to prescribe those products.reps give physicians reprints of clinical studies reporting findings about the novartis products.reps also inform doctors as to whether novartis products are among those for which insurers will pay,resulting in little or no cost to patients.the reps give the physicians samples of drugs these samples are not sold,and no money is exchanged.indeed,selling drug samples is a federal crime.see c,b b.the goal of the reps is to get physicians to say they will prescribe novartis products for their patients.
to enable the reps to reach that goal,novartis puts them through a training program for several weeks.the training is extensive,ranging from instruction on the medical benefits of each novartis the way in which reps should present favorable scientific matters of technique as detailed as how they should hold their pens when showing novartis written material to physicians.
in the training program,a rep is taught how to question physicians to determine why they may be hesitant about prescribing novartis products and then to offer arguments to overcome their reluctance.novartis instructs the reps on four social styles that a given individual may have in interacting with others and teaches the reps how to tailor their presentations to a physician particular social style.novartis has also hired consultants to observe its most successful reps and incorporate their techniques into the training program.
novartis sets the number of times per trimester a rep must call on each physician and how often specific drugs should be promoted.for each product in each trimester,novartis has a principal marketing core message developed by the novartis brand managers,which reps are instructed to convey to physicians on each call.novartis gives the reps written promotional materials developed by its brand and marketing managers,including posters,brochures,and laminated cards,to use on sales calls.the reps do not play any part in formulating the core message or the written materials nor do they play any part in devising novartis advertising.during training,reps are required to engage in,using scripts to practice delivering the core message and parrying objections from physicians.
although the novartis training material encourages the reps to tailor their pitches to an individual physician,they are not allowed to deviate from the core message.they are not allowed to use any written materials other than those provided by novartis.one rep testified that reps were expected to act like robots because of the limitations on what they could say during sales calls.if a physician asks a rep a medical question for which novartis has not prepared an answer,the rep is required to refer the doctor to novartis medical department.
the reps report to their district managers by telephone at least every week or two,and sometimes report or confer daily.in addition,once or twice a month,the district managers accompany the reps on their visits to physicians.during these,the managers observe the reps meetings and critique their performance.reps receive negative reviews if they deliver the novartis core message in a way that violates limitations or novartis policies.
as the reps do not make sales,they are trained to end their meetings with physicians with a closing in which they may ask,doctor,will you prescribe this product for your patients who suffer from the appropriate medical conditions they may also ask,doctor,do i have your commitment to prescribe it one novartis district manager described this type of colloquy as a persuasive sale but acknowledged that there was no way to know whether any physician actually followed through on such a commitment.one rep stated that a physician might answer affirmatively just to get the rep out the door.
as to physicians who refuse to entertain office visits from reps,novartis instructs the reps to use other techniques to make contact,such as showing up at hospitals early in the morning before medical rounds.reps also organize meals and other programs for physicians where speakers promote novartis products.for such programs,novartis maintains a list of cooperating doctors,from which reps must book speakers.reps manage the budgets for these events,but do so within limits set by novartis managers novartis sets a minimum number of such events that it expects each rep to hold.
novartis does not know how many prescriptions individual physicians write for its products.it subscribes to several services that provide it with information as to when prescriptions for novartis products are filled at pharmacies that report such information to the services this information identifies the prescribing physicians.because the data are gathered from pharmacies,however,these reports represent only the number of prescriptions the reporting pharmacies filled,not all the prescriptions actually written.further,because some pharmacies do not report sales to these services,novartis has data for only about of all filled prescriptions.novartis extrapolates from the reported sales in order to estimate the sales at pharmacies,and it believes those estimates generate a fairly accurate picture of how many prescriptions are being filled at pharmacies however,the latter prescriptions can not be traced to particular physicians.
notwithstanding the absence of actual information as to the numbers of prescriptions for novartis drugs written by particular physicians,the reps,whose base wages are at least a week,receive up to a quarter of their compensation as bonuses based on their performance with physicians.given the limits of its ability to monitor physicians actual prescriptions,novartis sets goals for the number of prescriptions it hopes to have filled in a particular territory,and it pays a rep a bonus when the number of filled prescriptions attributable to physicians in the rep territory exceeds the goal novartis has set.some novartis reps earn more than a year.in,novartis reps total compensation averaged.
the flsa provides that many employees must be paid one and times their regular rate of compensation for time worked in excess of hours a week,see a,but provides that certain categories of workers are excluded from this requirement,see id.novartis reps are expected to be in the field from to on work days they eat lunch with physicians or while driving to or from their physician visits and they attend the mandatory dinner programs,which sometimes prevent them from returning home before or notwithstanding a standard week of five such days plus the occasional evening work,novartis does not give its reps overtime pay.as is the practice throughout the pharmaceuticals industry,novartis treats its reps as exempt from the overtime pay requirement in the flsa,as well as from comparable requirements.
b.the decision of the district court 
in the consolidated proceedings,novartis moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaints on the ground that plaintiffs were outside salesm e n administrative employees,a,and thus exempt from the overtime pay provisions of flsa and state labor laws.novartis also argued that those reps who earned more than a year were exempt under entitled highly compensated employees.plaintiffs for partial summary judgment ruling that they are not in an exempt category.
ruling that it need not determine whether any reps were exempt as highly compensated employees,the district court denied plaintiffs motion and granted novartis motion on the ground that the reps are not entitled to overtime compensation because they are exempt from coverage as outside salespersons under the flsa and state laws,and even if they are not outside salespersons,they are administrative employees and are still exempt.in re novartis wage hour litigation,d,novartis i.
with respect to the contention that the reps were exempt as outside sales employees,see a,the district court reasoned that the reps met the spirit and the letter of that exemption.it stated that excluding reps from the exemption merely because they may not sell in a technical sense,novartis i,d at citing jewel tea williams,cir,would ignore the act spirit,purpose,and goals.novartis i,d at.the court stated that 
jewel tea teaches that outside salespersons are exempt from the overtime requirement not because they sell,as that term is technically defined,but rather because they generate commissions for themselves through their work and work with minimal supervision,making adherence to an compensation scheme impractical.
novartis i,d at emphasis added.the court also found that reps do make sales for novartis npc,stating as follows 
legally,reps can not sell npc drugs directly to physicians further,physicians have an ethical obligation to prescribe only drugs suitable for their patients medical needs,meaning that they can not make a binding commitment to a rep to prescribe certain npc products nevertheless,the physicians called upon by reps ultimately control the purchase of npc products by writing prescriptions a bsent a prescription from a doctor,the patient of npc drugs are not able to obtain those drugs.npc spends in excess of million annually to have its reps meet on a frequent and repeat basis with these physicians to seek their commitments to prescribe npc products.in other words,reps make sales in the sense that sales are made in the pharmaceutical industry.
id.at emphases added.
rejecting plaintiffs contention that the reps do not make sales because sales of pharmaceuticals are made only to wholesale distributors,then by distributors to pharmacies,and finally by pharmacies to patients,the district court stated that 
t he court can not ignore reality.distributors are not the of npc products.if physicians did not prescribe npc products,patients would be unable to buy them and distributors would have no incentive to make purchases from npc.the purchase cycle commences with a prescription from physicians,who are therefore the appropriate target of the reps sales efforts.when the physician writes a prescription for the npc product,then a sale can take place.
with respect to the exemption for administrative employees,see a,the district court concluded that the reps also fell within that category,stating that they earn in excess of a week,they engage in work that is directly related to the management or general business operations of npc and they exercise discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.novartis i,d at.the district court concluded that reps are engaged in work related to the management or general business operations of novartis because reps are not engaged in the production of novartis pharmaceuticals and because the reps are critical to dissemination of information about novartis products 
reps meet with physicians and provide them with information about npc drugs in an attempt to persuade the physicians to write prescriptions for those drugs.the reps success in obtaining prescriptions is critical to npc business.the sizeable incentive payments made to reps for generating prescriptions,as well as the more than million paid to the reps,buttress the conclusion that obtaining prescriptions for its drugs is critical to npc success.there is no other rational explanation for the commitment of this level of financial resources to npc sales effort.
id.at.the court concluded that reps exercise discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance because 
reps are expected to use initiative to increase the number of prescriptions written for their,this involves building a good rapport with the physicians and their staffs.within the confines of the core messages created by npc,reps must decide how best to present their information and must determine what type of close is most appropriate in a given situation.this,of course,depends on how much time the physician will allow the rep,the physician patient base and prescribing history,and numerous other factors.reps set their daily call schedules and are expected to use their entertainment budgets to host informational events for the physicians on their target lists.in carrying out these activities,they are quite clearly attempting to increase prescriptions for their matter of considerable significance for npc.
id.at.the district court was unpersuaded that novartis training and expectations rendered reps robots or automatons who did not exercise significant discretion 
these labels are not facts,but merely arguments designed to avoid the overtime exemptions.they do not begin to answer why or how a robot or an automaton could or should earn an average salary of per year.nor do they explain why npc would employ reps at a cost in excess of half a billion dollars per year.they are an attempt to avoid the consequences of what reps do every to call on physicians and,after assessing how much time is available for the call,choosing the best possible approach to convince the physician to prescribe npc drugs the next time an appropriate patient opportunity presents itself.npc pays a good salary and material incentives to encourage this behavior.reps are given drug samples,printed materials,and core messages.they are dispatched to the offices of physicians in an attempt to convince those physicians to prescribe npc products.it defies logic to accept that,in such a situation,reps are expected to do nothing but chant slogans and mouth platitudes.at the bare minimum,reps must be capable of tailoring their presentation to a given how best to convey the core message in a manner that will have the desired effect on the physician.such a decision involves making an independent judgment,free of direct oversight,even if npc has provided reps with guidelines for conveying certain information in a certain manner.thus,while the exact nature of the discretion and independent judgment exercised by reps may be in dispute,on the present facts,npc reps have discretion and exercise independent judgment.
accordingly,having found both the outside salesman and administrative employee exemptions applicable,the district court granted novartis motion for summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs claims under the flsa.in addition,finding that the new york overtime pay exemptions were defined and applied in the same manner as those in the flsa,see novartis i,d at,and that california law,although differing slightly in the ways it defined the exemption,was essentially the same as the flsa and new york law,id.at,the court granted summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs claims.
this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,the reps contend principally that the district court erred in concluding that they are outside sales employees,given that the t he undisputed evidence in this case shows that the reps do not obtain orders,form contracts,or engage in any type of sale as that term is defined by the flsa plaintiffs brief on appeal at,and in concluding that reps are administrative employees given that t hey lack discretion and independent judgment within the meaning of the administrative exemption id.at.novartis defends the district court conclusions,arguing that reps make sales in the only practical sense applicable to the pharmaceuticals industry novartis brief on appeal at,and that,in so doing,the reps exercise discretion and independent judgment see id.at.
the secretary of labor,participating in this appeal as an amicus curiae in support of the reps,points out that department of labor dol or department regulations promulgated under the flsa a provide,in pertinent part,that an outside salesman is one who,inter alia,has the primary duty of making sales,and b provide that an exempt administrative employee is one who,inter alia,exercises discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.the secretary contends that because the reps do not make sales or obtain orders and do not exercise discretion and independent judgment,they are not within the outside salesman or the administrative employee categories that are exempted from the flsa overtime pay requirements.novartis argues that the secretary interpretations are contrary to the regulations themselves.the united states chamber of commerce has filed a brief as amicus curiae in support of novartis,citing gonzales oregon,and arguing that the secretary interpretations are not entitled to deference,on the theory that the regulations merely parrot the flsa language and that the secretary is thus interpreting only the words of congress,not those of the regulations.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the secretary regulations define and delimit the terms used in the statute that under those regulations as interpreted by the secretary,the reps are not outside salesmen or administrative employees and that the secretary interpretations are entitled to controlling deference,auer robbins.
a.the flsa overtime pay requirement 
congress enacted the flsa in to combat labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health,efficiency,and general of workers.flsa a,a.section a of the flsa provides,in pertinent part,that 
no employer shall employ any of his employees who in any workweek is employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce,for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and times the regular rate at which he is employed.
a emphases added.to the extent pertinent to this appeal,flsa a exempts from that overtime pay requirement 
any employee employed in a bona fide administrative capacity or in the capacity of outside salesman as such terms are defined and delimited from time to time by regulations of the secretary.
a emphases added.the flsa definitions section provides that 
s ale or sell includes any sale,exchange,contract to sell,consignment for sale,shipment for sale,or other disposition.
the overtime requirements of the flsa were meant to apply financial pressure to spread employment to avoid the extra wage and to assure workers additional pay to compensate them for the burden of a workweek beyond the hours fixed in the act.davis morgan chase,cir quoting overnight motor transportation missel,superseded by statute,pay act of,ch,stat.because the flsa is a remedial law,reiseck universal communications of miami,f d,cir,exemptions to the overtime pay requirement are narrowly construed against the employers seeking to assert them and their application limited to those establishments plainly and unmistakably within their terms and spirit.bilyou dutchess beer distributors,cir quoting arnold ben kanowsky.the burden of proving that employees fall within such an exemption is on the employer.see,bilyou dutchess beer distributors,at.
we review de novo a district court grant or denial of summary judgment,viewing the record in the light most favorable to the party against whom summary judgment is sought.see,dillon morano,cir.whether the duties of a job qualify an employee for a flsa exemption is a question of law,which we review de novo.see,icicle seafoods,worthington,zheng.liberty apparel,cir.
b.the outside salesman exemption 
pursuant to her statutory mandate to define and delimit the terms outside salesman and administrative employee,u.a,the secretary has promulgated several regulations.regulations issued in provide,inter alia,that a job title alone is insufficient to establish the exempt status of an employee,rather,that status may be determined only on the basis of the employee salary and duties,id.with respect to outside salesman,the regulations provide as follows 
a the term employee employed in the capacity of outside salesman in section a of the act shall mean any employee 
whose primary duty is 
i making sales within the meaning of section k of the act,or 
ii obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities for which a consideration will be paid by the client or customer and 
who is customarily and regularly engaged away from the employer place or places of business in performing such primary duty.
b in determining the primary duty of an outside sales employee,work performed incidental to and in conjunction with the employee own outside sales or solicitations,including incidental deliveries and collections,shall be regarded as exempt outside sales work.other work that furthers the employee sales efforts also shall be regarded as exempt work including,for example,writing sales reports,updating or revising the employee sales or display catalogue,planning itineraries and attending sales conferences.
id.emphases added.elaborating on the meaning of sales of commodities,as contrasted with sales of services or the use of facilities,the regulations provide that 
s ales within the meaning of section k of the act include the transfer of title to tangible property,and in certain cases,of tangible and valuable evidences of intangible property.section k of the act states that sale or sell includes any sale,exchange,contract to sell,consignment for sale,shipment for sale,or other disposition.
b emphasis added.
the regulations go on to describe the circumstances in which an employee efforts to promot e a product do not constitute sales within the meaning of the regulations 
a promotion work is one type of activity often performed by persons who make sales,which may or may not be exempt outside sales work,depending upon the circumstances under which it is performed.promotional work that is actually performed incidental to and in conjunction with an employee own outside sales or solicitations is exempt work.on the other hand,promotional work that is incidental to sales made,or to be made,by someone else is not exempt outside sales work 
b a manufacturer representative,for example,may perform various types of promotional activities such as putting up displays and posters,removing damaged or spoiled stock from the merchant shelves or rearranging the merchandise.such an employee can be considered an exempt outside sales employee if the employee primary duty is making sales or contracts.promotion activities directed toward consummation of the employee own sales are exempt.promotional activities designed to stimulate sales that will be made by someone else are not exempt outside sales work.
id.a b emphases added.
as described in the preamble to the dol regulations,these rules had their origins in regulations adopted after dol hearings conducted in the resulting in a stein report and a weiss report,see defining and delimiting the exemptions for executive,administrative,professional,outside sales and computer employees,final rule or final rule.the final rule preamble preamble discussed whether an outside employee promotional activities qualify him as a salesman and emphasized that no one could be considered a salesman within these regulations unless he in some sense made a sale.
addressing concerns expressed by such groups as the grocery manufacturers association,the national association of manufacturers,and the chamber of commerce for the emphasis on an employee own sales,given the technological advances that enable a customer to place its own order directly with a supplier,the dol agreed that a determination of whether an employee is exempt as an outside salesman should not depend on whether it is the sales employee or the customer who types the order into a computer system and hits the return button.final rule at.but while the preamble stated that the dol agree d that technological changes in how orders are taken and processed should not preclude the outside salesman exemption for employees who in some sense make the sales,id.at,it emphasized that 
the department does not intend to change any of the essential elements required for the outside sales exemption,including the requirement that the outside sales employee primary duty must be to make sales or to obtain orders or contracts for services.an employer can not meet this requirement unless it demonstrates objectively that the employee,in some sense,has made sales.see stein report at outside sales exemption does not apply to an employee who does not in some sense make a sale emphasis added.extending the outside sales exemption to include all promotion work,whether or not connected to an employee own sales,would contradict this primary duty test.
final rule at first two emphases ours.the preamble also elaborated on the standard 
employees have a primary duty of making sales if they obtain a commitment to buy from the customer and are credited with the sale.see weiss report at in borderline cases the test is whether the person is actually engaged in activities directed toward the consummation of his own sales,at least to the extent of obtaining a commitment to buy from the person to whom he is selling.if his efforts are directed toward stimulating the sales of his company generally rather than the consummation of his own specific sales his activities are not exempt.
final rule at emphases ours.
we note that the distinction between obtaining commitments to buy and promoting sales by other persons has been respected in areas other than the pharmaceutical industry.see,gregory first title of america,cir employee who obtained commitments to buy her employer title insurance service and was credited with those sales,and all of whose efforts were directed towards the consummation of her own sales and not towards stimulating sales for the employer in general,was an outside sales employee within the meaning of the flsa and the regulations clements serco,cir civilian military recruiters who did not obtain commitments from recruits were not outside salesmen within the meaning of,wirtz keystone readers service,cir student salesmen were not outside sales employees where their promotional activities were incidental to sales made by others.
we think it clear that the above regulations,defining the term sale as involving a transfer of title,and defining and delimiting the term outside salesman in connection with an employee efforts to promote the employer products,do far more than merely parrot the language of the flsa.the secretary interpretations of her regulations are thus entitled to controlling deference unless those interpretations are plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer,at quoting robertson methow valley citizens council,other internal quotation marks omitted.
we find no such inconsistency and see no such error.although novartis contends that the position taken by the secretary as amicus on this appeal is contrary to the regulations,we disagree.the basic premise of the regulations explaining who may properly be considered an exempt outside salesman a term for which the flsa explicitly relies on the secretary to promulgate defining and delimiting that an employee is not an outside salesman unless he does in some sense make the sales,final rule at.and although that phrase on which novartis relies heavily see,novartis brief on appeal at,does not appear in any of the regulations that explicate the term outside salesman,the regulations quoted above make it clear that a person who merely promotes a product that will be sold by another person does not,in any sense intended by the regulations,make the sale.the position taken by the secretary on this appeal is that when an employee promotes to a physician a pharmaceutical that may thereafter be purchased by a patient from a pharmacy if the can not lawfully give a binding commitment to do it,the employee does not in any sense make the sale.thus,the interpretation of the regulations given by the secretary in her position as amicus on this appeal is entirely consistent with the regulations.
nor can we conclude that the regulations constitute an erroneous interpretation of the flsa definition of sale to include any sale,exchange,contract to sell,consignment for sale,shipment for sale,or other disposition,k.although the phrase other disposition is a that could have an expansive connotation,we see no error in the regulations requirement that any such other disposition be in some sense a sale.such an ejusdem interpretation is consistent with the interpretive canon that exemptions to remedial statutes such as the flsa are to be read narrowly,see arnold,at see generally phillips,walling,and is neither erroneous nor unreasonable,see,chevron natural resources defense council.we accordingly owe the secretary interpretation deference,and we turn to the question of its applicability to the present cases.
there is no genuine dispute over the sales path generally traversed by novartis pharmaceuticals.as described in part above,novartis sells its drugs to wholesalers the wholesalers then sell them to pharmacies and the pharmacies ultimately sell the drugs to patients who have prescriptions for them.the reps promote the drugs to the physicians the reps do not speak to the wholesalers or to the pha
