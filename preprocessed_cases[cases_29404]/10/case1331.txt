chrysler corporation chrysler appeals sanctions and attorneys fees awarded by the district court.chrysler has twice attempted to remove plaintiffs class actions from california state court to federal court.after chrysler second attempt,the district court held that several of chrysler arguments were frivolous,and awarded sanctions and fees.we believe that removal was improper,but we hold that chrysler arguments,taken as a whole,were not frivolous.we reverse the district court award of sanctions,but we affirm the district court award of attorneys fees.
background 
this appeal involves three class actions against chrysler.the complaints in all three actions alleged that chrysler used a finishing process known as electrocoat marketed under various trade names,including uniprime,hbec,and ecoat to paint vehicles it manufactured between and.plaintiffs alleged that the electrocoat process produced a poor bond between the primer and the exterior paint on the vehicles,and that the exterior paint is prone to peel off,especially after prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light.they further alleged that chrysler knew about the problem,but neither disclosed the defect to its customers nor properly honored warranty claims.all three of the complaints alleged causes of action for breach of express warranty,violation of california song beverly warranty act,and unfair competition and business practices.two of the complaints also alleged a cause of action for breach of contract.all three complaints alleged facts sufficient to establish complete diversity of citizenship but none alleged that the amount in controversy exceeded.
in early,chrysler removed all of the actions to federal court based on diversity.plaintiffs moved to remand the actions to state court.chrysler opposed remand and moved for an order granting limited discovery of facts relevant to the amount in controversy.the district court denied chrysler discovery motion and remanded.in remanding,the district court stated that if chrysler could establish facts through state court discovery showing an amount in controversy in excess of,it could properly return to federal court.the district court warned,however,that sanctions might be appropriate if chrysler again attempted to remove improperly because chrysler legal arguments had been repeatedly rejected by other district courts.
chrysler sought a writ of mandamus from this court that would have required the district court to reconsider its remand order and its denial of limited discovery.we denied the writ in an unpublished order.after remand,plaintiffs consolidated their actions and filed a single first amended complaint.this complaint alleged that t he amount in controversy as to the plaintiffs and each class member does not exceed,including interest and any pro rata award of attorneys fees and costs,and damages,and that the amount in controversy averaged less than per plaintiff.it repeated the causes of action alleged in the first complaint,and added a claim under california consumer legal remedies act,which provides for punitive damages.see cal.a.
chrysler requested discovery in state court relevant to the amount in controversy required for diversity jurisdiction in federal court.it also asked plaintiffs either to waive their requests for punitive damages and attorneys fees or to stipulate that they did not seek any recovery in excess of for any plaintiff.plaintiffs did not comply with these requests,and the state court did not compel them to do so.believing that it faced a deadline for removal of the case under b,chrysler filed a second notice of removal on march,one day before the deadline would take effect chrysler again asserted that the plaintiffs action satisfied the requirement.
plaintiffs moved for remand,for sanctions under rule,and for attorneys fees under c.the district court granted all three motions.it held not only that chrysler had failed once again to establish diversity jurisdiction,but also that several of its arguments were clearly frivolous in light of this court july order and the decisions of other courts in the ninth circuit.the district court imposed rule sanctions of and ordered chrysler to pay attorneys fees for the time spent by plaintiffs in opposing chrysler second attempted removal an amount later determined to be.chrysler timely appealed.
ii.appellate jurisdiction 
we first consider our appellate jurisdiction.the removal statute directs district courts to remand any case removed from a state court i f at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.c.it goes on to provide,an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.id.d see also things remembered,petrarca,d.section d prevents chrysler from directly challenging the district court remand order on appeal.but chrysler can challenge the district court decision to impose sanctions and to award attorneys fees see.
we have held that a party sanctioned for a frivolous removal can not appeal the sanction on the ground that removal was proper reversal on that ground alone would constitute direct review of the remand order,which is precluded by d.see lemos fencl,cir.but,as we held in lemos,a party can appeal an award of sanctions or fees on the ground that the removal was neither frivolous nor filed for an improper purpose.a ruling on the propriety of an award of sanctions or fees is not the same thing as a direct ruling on the propriety of a remand.id.at see also peabody maud van cortland hill schroll trust,cir.we have said that in evaluating the propriety of an award of attorneys fees,we must give some consideration to the merits of a remand order,and that this kind of evaluation does not violate the command of d.see moore permanente med.group,cir.more recently,we have held that review of a fee award under c must include a de novo examination of whether the remand order was legally correct.balcorta twentieth film,cir.accordingly,in reviewing the district court award of sanctions and attorneys fees,we must address the merits of chrysler arguments in favor of removal.
iii.diversity jurisdiction in the district court 
the sole dispute in the district court was whether plaintiffs consolidated class action satisfied the requirement of.a defendant attempting to remove a diversity case must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the requirement is satisfied.see singer state farm mut.auto.ins,cir sanchez monumental life ins,cir.
chrysler makes two arguments to support its conclusion that the requirement was satisfied in the district court.chrysler first argument relies on supplemental jurisdiction.chrysler argues that the district court had original jurisdiction over the claims of individual plaintiffs who satisfied the requirement,and supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of the remaining class members who did not.chrysler second argument is that the plaintiffs seek monetary compensation that is the common and undivided interest of the class members,and that the proper amount to consider for purposes of jurisdictional requirements is not each plaintiff pro rata share,but rather the aggregated sum of those shares.
for the reasons that follow,we disagree with both arguments.we agree with some aspects of chrysler supplemental jurisdiction argument,but we disagree with others considered as a whole,the argument fails.we disagree with the entirety of chrysler aggregation argument.we consider the arguments in turn.
supplemental jurisdiction 
supplemental jurisdiction based on claims of individual named plaintiffs 
chrysler argued twice before the district court that there was federal subject matter jurisdiction over the entire class action,including the claims of the unnamed class members,because the individual named plaintiffs each had claims worth more than.chrysler argued that confers supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of unnamed class members when there is subject matter jurisdiction over the claims of the named plaintiffs.although the supreme court held in zahn international paper,d,that each member of a class must satisfy the requirement,chrysler argued that,enacted after zahn,overrules that case.the district court disagreed.it recognized that other circuits had adopted chrysler reasoning,but aligned itself with what it described as the chorus of courts that had reaffirmed zahn after the passage of.
of the circuit courts that have reached the issue,the fifth and the seventh have agreed with chrysler.see in re abbott laboratories,cir,stromberg metal works,press mechanical,cir agreeing with abbott laboratories in a rule joinder case see also in re brand name prescription drugs antitrust,cir following stromberg metal works in a rule class action.the third,eighth,and the tenth have agreed with the district court.see meritcare paul mercury ins,cir trimble asarco,cir leonhardt western sugar,cir.the supreme court granted certiorari in abbott laboratories,but after the recusal of one justice it affirmed without opinion by an equally divided court.see,d.for the reasons that follow,we agree with the fifth and seventh circuits in abbott laboratories and stromberg metal works,and hold that zahn is overruled by.
a.the plain meaning of 
section was enacted as part of the judicial improvement act of,seventeen years after the supreme court decision in zahn.in relevant part,it provides 
a except as provided in subsection b,in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.
b in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section of this title,the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection a over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under rule,or of the federal rules of civil procedure,or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under rule of such rules,or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under rule of such rules,when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section.
the first two courts of appeals to consider the effect of on fifth and seventh no doubt about the plain meaning of this text.the fifth circuit in abbott laboratories stated its conclusion succinctly t he statute first section vests federal courts with the power to hear supplemental claims generally,subject to limited exceptions set forth in the statute second section.class actions are not among the enumerated exceptions u nder a district court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over members of a class,although they did not meet the requirement,as did the class representatives.id.at.the seventh circuit agreed,writing that the result in abbott laboratories has strong support from the statutory text.stromberg metal works,at.our own analysis convinces us that abbott laboratories properly understood the plain meaning of the text of,and correctly held that the claims of unnamed class members in a diversity class action need not satisfy the requirement.
the tenth and eighth circuits have argued that the text of has a plain meaning,but they reached the opposite conclusion about what that plain meaning is.in leonhardt,the lead case,the tenth circuit made two textual arguments to support its conclusion.because of the importance of the plain meaning of,we analyze those two arguments in detail.
the meaning of original jurisdiction in a 
leonhardt first argument is that a does not confer supplemental jurisdiction over unnamed class members whose claims do not satisfy the requirement because the term original jurisdiction in subsection a has a different meaning in diversity cases than in federal question cases leonhardt notes that under subsection a there is only supplemental jurisdiction over claims that are related to claims in a civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction emphasis added.leonhardt then argues that the existence of original jurisdiction under subsection a in a diversity case is determined by applying the basic diversity statute,to all the claims in the complaint.if confers jurisdiction over all those claims,there is original jurisdiction within the meaning of subsection a.however,if confers jurisdiction over only some but not all of those claims,there is no original jurisdiction.if there is no original jurisdiction,there can be no supplemental jurisdiction either,for there is no jurisdiction to which supplemental jurisdiction can attach.
in the words of leonhardt,
in our view,a literal and textually faithful reading of a leads to the opposite conclusion from that of the fifth and seventh circuits.section a specifically addresses any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction.emphasis added.it then provides for supplemental jurisdiction over transactionally related claims.section is what confers original jurisdiction over diversity cases and it expressly requires that the matter in controversy exceed the sum or value of.while does not expressly refer to class actions,the supreme court has noted that periodic congressional amendment of the diversity statute to alter only the amount in controversy evidences congressional agreement with the court holding that matter in controversy does not encompass the aggregration of separate and distinct claims.snyder harris,at.thus,congress in a expressly excepted claims brought under and its definition of matter in controversy.see pfander section a appears to assume that the existing rules of original jurisdiction will continue to apply and that the grant of supplemental jurisdiction will come into play only after the plaintiff has submitted claims in a complaint that properly invoke such original jurisdiction.
at.see also trimble,at we agree with and adopt the reasoning of the tenth circuit in leonhardt.
for leonhardt to be right,the term original jurisdiction in subsection a must mean something different in diversity and federal question cases.everyone agrees that in a federal question case there need not be subject matter jurisdiction over all the claims in the complaint for there to be original jurisdiction within the meaning of subsection a.rather,there is original jurisdiction if there is subject matter jurisdiction over one claim in the complaint.if there is subject matter jurisdiction over that one claim,there is supplemental jurisdiction over all the other claims that are transactionally related.
an example will clarify the point.if a plaintiff files a complaint with two transactionally related claims against a single defendant,one based on federal law and one based on state law,there is original jurisdiction under subsection a because there is subject matter jurisdiction over the claim.because there is original jurisdiction,there is supplemental jurisdiction over the claim.the example just described is,of course,united mine workers gibbs,d,the paradigm case of pendent now supplemental jurisdiction.if leonhardt definition of original jurisdiction were applied to federal question cases,would overrule gibbs.since no one,including the leonhardt panel,argues that has that consequence,the question is whether original jurisdiction in subsection a has a different meaning in diversity cases from its unquestioned meaning in federal question cases.for several reasons,we believe that original jurisdiction means the same thing in both kinds of cases.
first,there is nothing in the text of subsection a to suggest,even remotely,that there is such a difference in meaning.specifically,nothing in the text suggests that in a diversity case but not in a federal question case the term original jurisdiction in subsection a requires subject matter jurisdiction over all the claims in a complaint.
second,even though subsection b applies only to diversity cases,original jurisdiction in that section is used in the sense concededly applicable to federal question cases in subsection a.the meaning of original jurisdiction in subsection b is apparent from the fact that subsection b excludes from supplemental jurisdiction claims made by a plaintiff against a defendant joined under rule.a plaintiff will ordinarily join all rule defendants in the complaint rather than waiting to join them by a later or amended pleading.the exclusion of joined claims against defendants from the supplemental jurisdiction granted by subsection a indicates that such claims are covered by supplemental jurisdiction,for there would otherwise be no reason for subsection b to except them from supplemental jurisdiction.
in order for such joined claims to have been covered by supplemental jurisdiction,original jurisdiction under subsection a must be determined by looking to see if there was subject matter jurisdiction over any one claim in the complaint,rather than over all of the claims in the complaint.if original jurisdiction under subsection a were determined by looking at all the claims in the complaint,there would have been no jurisdiction under and hence no original jurisdiction in the first place because there was a lack of complete diversity when all the claims were considered together.see strawbridge curtiss,cranch.the exclusion by subsection b of claims by parties joined under rule from supplemental jurisdiction would thus be superfluous.
third,we are reinforced in our reading of the term original jurisdiction by a precursor to.a proposed supplemental jurisdiction statute in a working paper of the federal court study committee provided as follows 
a except as provided in subsections b and c or in another provision of this title,in any civil action on a claim for which jurisdiction is provided,the district court shall have jurisdiction over all other claims arising out of the same transaction or occurrence,including claims that require the joinder of additional parties.
b in civil actions under of this title,jurisdiction shall not extend to claims by the plaintiff against parties joined under rules and of the federal rules of civil procedure,or to claims by parties who intervene under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,provided,that the court may hear such claims if necessary to prevent substantial prejudice to a party or.
federal courts study committee,working papers and subcommittee reports,july,at hereinafter working paper.the proposed statute has the same basic analytic structure as the actual statute.subsection a broadly confers supplemental jurisdiction,and subsection b takes away some of that jurisdiction in diversity cases.the proposed statute uses the single term jurisdiction to include both original jurisdiction and supplemental jurisdiction,but we believe that this does not affect our analysis.the authors of the working paper explicitly stated what the effect of their proposed statute would be o ur proposal would overrule the supreme court decision in zahn international paper from a policy standpoint,this decision makes little sense,and we therefore recommend that congress overrule it.id.at.we recognize that the federal courts study committee disagreed with this policy recommendation,but we do not rely on the working paper as evidence of what the study committee wanted to do.rather,we cite it because the text of the proposed statute is strikingly similar to the text of,and because the study committee explicitly stated that the text would overrule zahn.
finally,even if leonhardt reading of original jurisdiction in subsection a were right,its ultimate holding would still be wrong.a class action complaint is filed only by a named plaintiff or plaintiffs.although such an action is often referred to as a class action when it is filed,it is,at the time of filing,only a class action.it does not become a class action until certified by the district court.the certification decision is not made at the time of filing,but,rather,a s soon as practicable after the commencement of an action.c emphasis added.and as rule tells us,a civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.therefore,if there is complete diversity and a sufficient amount in controversy for the named plaintiff or plaintiffs in the complaint,there is original jurisdiction under subsection a over the class action,even as leonhardt would read the term.
the meaning of the last phrase of b 
leonhardt second argument is that the last phrase of subsection b indicates that was not intended to overrule zahn.for the convenience of the reader,we quote b again,and italicize the phrase in question 
in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section of this title,the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection a over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under rule,or of the federal rules of civil procedure,or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under rule of such rules,or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under rule of such rules,when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section.
leonhardt does not analyze the precise meaning of the phrase on which it relies.the entirety of leonhardt discussion consists of the following 
that very language evidences a concern for preserving the historical and rules of diversity.the fact that b prohibits the addition of claims and parties which would destroy diversity supports our interpretation of a as also fully respecting the rules of diversity in cases invoking the original jurisdiction of the federal courts.
at emphasis in original.we agree with leonhardt general statement that the phrase evidences a concern for preserving the historical and rules of diversity,but we disagree with leonhardt as to the specific meaning of the phrase.
the text of has the following analytic structure first,subsection a broadly confers supplemental jurisdiction,subject to certain exceptions second,the first part of subsection b sets out exceptions to subsection a and third,the last phrase of subsection b limits the reach of those exceptions.we believe that the last phrase of subsection b means that there is supplemental jurisdiction over a claim otherwise excepted from supplemental jurisdiction by subsection b if,as understood before the passage of,would have authorized jurisdiction over that claim.
such claims do exist.for example,subsection b excepts from supplemental jurisdiction a claim by a plaintiff against a defendant who has been impleaded under rule.to that extent,it codifies the result of owen equipment erection kroger,d.but without its last phrase,subsection b would also except from supplemental jurisdiction a claim asserted by the plaintiff against the defendant when that claim is a compulsory counterclaim to a claim by the defendant against the plaintiff.the claim by the defendant against the plaintiff is clearly within the supplemental jurisdiction conferred by subsection a,and it would be both unfair and inefficient to forbid the plaintiff compulsory counterclaim to that claim.the question does not arise often,but there was circuit law before the passage of holding that such a compulsory counterclaim was permitted under pursuant to what was then known as ancillary jurisdiction.see revere copper and brass aetna cas.sur,cir.
in contrast to the general reading in leonhardt,our reading gives specific meaning to the last phrase of b,for it preserves a small slice of supplemental jurisdiction that would otherwise have been lost.moreover,our reading is entirely consistent with our conclusion that overrules zahn.as we read the phrase,it preserves ancillary now supplemental jurisdiction that existed under prior to the passage of and does nothing to prevent the expansion of such jurisdiction accomplished by the rest of.
b.the legislative history of 
for the reasons outlined above,we conclude that the text of is clear,and that it confers supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of class members in a diversity class action when named plaintiffs have claims with an amount in controversy in excess of.after concluding that the text of the statute is unambiguous,we would normally not examine its legislative history.c ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.when the words of a statute are unambiguous,then judicial inquiry is complete.bank germain,d quoting rubin united states,d.see also city of chicago envt l defense fund,d i t is the statute,and not the committee report,which is the authoritative expression of the law.
however,this is an unusual case.four courts have held that the text of is clear,but they have split evenly on what that text means.the fifth and seventh circuits,in abbott laboratories and stromberg metal works,have held that the text clearly overrules zahn.the tenth and the eighth circuits,in leonhardt and trimble,have held that the text clearly preserves zahn.a fifth court,the third circuit in meritcare paul mercury ins,has held that the text is ambiguous,and has relied on legislative history to hold that it preserves zahn.
all three courts holding that preserves zahn analyzed the legislative history of the statute.the tenth and eighth circuits did so as a means of supporting their holdings,even though they found the text unambiguous.the third circuit did so as a means of ascertaining the meaning of the text,but noted that it would have done so even if it had found the text unambiguous 
although there is much to be said for leonhardt view that the text does not displace zahn ruling,we conclude that there is sufficient ambiguity in the statute to make resort to legislative history appropriate even were we to conclude that section is unambiguous,as abbott laboratories read s it,we would nevertheless turn to the legislative history because it is one of those rare cases in which the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters.
meritcare,at quoting united states sherman,cir.
we agree with the third,eighth and tenth circuits to this degree the legislative history provides a substantial basis to believe that the omission of claims by rule plaintiffs from subsection b of,and the resulting overruling of zahn,was an oversight.for example,one of the senate sponsors of the judicial reform act of repeatedly described as noncontroversial and quite modest those portions of the act that amended.see cong.rec.s,statement of grassley.this is an unlikely characterization for a provision that would open the federal courts to a significant number of additional diversity class actions.further,the house judiciary committee report on the bill stated that was not intended to affect the jurisdictional requirements of in class actions,as those requirements were interpreted prior to finley.at.that sentence ended with a footnote citing zahn,strongly suggesting that the proposed statute was intended to preserve the outcome in that case.finally,the three law professors who helped draft published an article soon after its enactment declaring that zahn remain ed good decisional law.thomas mengler,stephen burbank,and thomas rowe,congress accepts supreme court invitation to codify supplemental jurisdiction,judicature.
we do not believe that this is enough to overcome the plain meaning of the text.legislative history can justify a judicial departure from a clear text if congress makes an obvious clerical error,particularly if the error results in an absurd or result.see green bock laundry machine,d scalia,concurring we are confronted here with a statute which,if interpreted literally,produces an absurd,and perhaps unconstitutional,result i think it entirely appropriate to consult all public materials,including the background of the statute and the legislative history of its adoption.but that is not the case here.even courts that have read to preserve zahn agree that overruling it would not be an absurd result.see,russ state farm mut.auto.ins,o verruling zahn would not be absurd arguably,it would be sensible.moreover,as shown in our discussion of the working paper of the federal courts study committee,some of those involved in drafting both knew that the language chosen for would overrule zahn and approved of that result on policy grounds.
the legislative history therefore does not persuade us that we should refuse to follow what we believe is the clear meaning of the text of.we understand that our holding may be thought to say to congress,as judge pollak put it in russ,we know what you meant to say,but you did quite say it.so the message from us in the judicial branch to you in the legislative branch is gotcha and better luck next time.at.we sympathize with judge pollak position,but we do not feel ourselves at liberty to hold that zahn survives.if courts could ignore the plain meaning of statutory texts because their legislative histories showed that some or even many of those who drafted and voted for the texts did not understand what they were doing,the plain meaning of many statutes,not only,would be in jeopardy.
jurisdiction based on claims of unnamed class members 
the preceding section explains our agreement with chrysler argument that there is supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of unnamed class members when the claim of an individual named plaintiff satisfies the requirement.we now address chrysler additional argument that there is such supplemental jurisdiction when the claim of an unnamed class member satisfies the requirement.for the reasons that follow,we reject this argument.
in its opposition to the second remand in this case,chrysler argued that an individual plaintiff request for rescission should be valued for purposes of amount in controversy at the full original price of the vehicles in question,and that as a result,the claim of any class member owning more than three vehicles was likely to exceed.chrysler then attached a declaration indicating that,according to its sales records,more than sixty potential class members in california owned more than nine chrysler vehicles manufactured by the electrocoat process.but even if chrysler is correct that several unnamed class members have claims for amounts in excess of,their claims do not provide a basis for diversity jurisdiction.
as discussed above,subsection a of provides that a federal district court has supplemental jurisdiction over claims that are related to claims in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction.original jurisdiction in subsection a refers to jurisdiction established by looking for any claim in the complaint over which there is subject matter jurisdiction.but original jurisdiction does not refer to jurisdiction over claims not not yet the complaint.as also discussed above,a class action,when filed,includes only the claims of the named plaintiff or plaintiffs.the claims of unnamed class members are added to the action later,when the action is certified as a class under rule.there thus can not be original jurisdiction within the meaning of subsection a over the claims of unnamed class members and there is therefore no supplemental jurisdiction either.
examining only the claims of named class plaintiffs for purposes of the requirement in diversity class actions mirrors the treatment of the complete diversity requirement.in both instances,subject matter jurisdiction depends only on the named plaintiffs.see supreme tribe of cauble.in re agent orange prod.liab,cir.we also note that practical considerations support this result.if the claim of an unnamed class member could support removal of the entire action,a removing defendant might be entitled to discovery not merely from named,but also from unnamed,class members.further,including the claims of unnamed class members is an impractical and uncertain method of determining federal jurisdiction,tortola restaurants,because those members are free to opt out of the class,and because a denial of class certification would prevent the court from taking jurisdiction over the claims of the unnamed class members.either of these two events would deprive the district court of jurisdiction over the entire class action,and could occur well into the litigation,after the expenditure of substantial time and effort by the parties and the district court.see id.
finally,there is no reported decision that supports chrysler argument that the claims of unnamed class members can serve as a basis for diversity jurisdiction.even those courts that have held that overrules zahn state that diversity jurisdiction in class actions must be based on a claim of a named plaintiff.see in re brand name prescription drugs antitrust,at at least one named plaintiff must satisfy the jurisdictional minimum.emphasis added see also tortola restaurants.at amundson assocs.art studio,national council on compensation ins,sanderson,thompson,ratledge zimny awacs.secondary authorities agree.see,james moore et,moore federal practice c at ed hereinafter moore e ven if reverses zahn the statute does not permit supplemental jurisdiction over a class action in which unnamed class members meet the requirement,but the named plaintiff does not.emphasis in original.
attorneys fees as a basis for amount in controversy for named plaintiffs 
chrysler does not contend that any of the named plaintiffs in this case has an individual claim for damages that exceeds.chrysler does contend,however,that the entirety of any award of attorneys fees should be allocated to the named plaintiffs,and that this amount will exceed per named plaintiff.we have no doubt that attorneys fees would exceed per named plaintiff in this case if removal to federal court were upheld and class certification were granted.but we do not agree with chrysler that under california law an award of attorneys fees in this class action would be allocated solely to the named plaintiffs.
this circuit specifically rejected chrysler argument almost twenty years ago,in goldberg cpc int l,cir.we articulated a single reason for our holding in goldberg allocating attorneys fees solely to the named plaintiffs would seriously undermine the rule expressed by the supreme court in zahn.id.at.however,because we hold today that has overruled zahn,we must take another look at goldberg.
abbott laboratories provides a useful starting place.there,the fifth circuit held that the named plaintiffs claims satisfied the requirement because the attorneys fees were allocated solely to the named plaintiffs,or representative parties,under louisiana law.abbott laboratories at civ.proc.in so holding,the fifth circuit concluded that goldberg 
sheds little light on the distinct policy choices behind louisiana decision regarding rights of recovery by class members.that a state chooses a set of rules that result in an award in excess of the jurisdictional requirement frustrates no policy of zahn.simply put,under the law of louisiana the class representatives were entitled to fees.their rights of recovery were not created by a judge summing the discrete rights of class members.
in the case now before us,plaintiffs amended their complaints after the first remand to include claims under.that section states,in relevant part 
upon motion,a court may award attorneys fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if a a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons,b the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate,and c such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery,if any.
emphasis added.in its opposition to the second remand,chrysler argued that the district court should attribute the attorneys fees only to the named plaintiffs.we disagree.section states only that attorneys fees go to a successful party.in this respect,it is different from the louisiana statute at issue in abbott laboratories,which states 
the court may allow the representative parties their reasonable expenses of litigation,including attorney fees,when as a result of the class action a fund is made available,or a recovery or compromise is had which is beneficial,to the class.
civ.proc.emphasis added.
california courts have stated that awards are a bounty for plaintiffs who successfully litigate in the public interest,see,galante vineyards monterey peninsula water mgmt,th,d,but they have not held that this bounty goes only to named plaintiffs in a class action.we therefore hold that,under this california law at least,attorneys fees are not awarded solely to the named plaintiffs in a class action,and that they therefore can not be allocated solely to those plaintiffs for purposes of amount in controversy.see spielman genzyme,cir refusing to allocate attorneys fees in class action solely to the class representatives based on language in massachusetts statute awarding attorneys fees to petitioner in a class action h d tire and pitney bowes,cir same result for connecticut statute awarding attorneys fees to plaintiff in a class action cohen office depot,cir same result for florida statutes awarding fees to prevailing party or a ny person prevailing darden ford consumer fin,cir same result for georgia statute awarding fees to any person who is injured.
we agree with chrysler argument that provides supplemental jurisdiction over the jurisdictionally insufficient claims of unnamed class members if the named plaintiffs in the action have claims that satisfy the requirement.in that respect,we disagree with the district court.but because we hold that cal.civ.proc.code requires any attorneys fees awarded in this action to be divided among all members of the class,we do not agree that the named plaintiffs in this case satisfy the requirement.since this is the sole argument advanced by chrysler to show that the claims of the named plaintiffs satisfy the requirement,the district court did not err in finding that there was no supplemental jurisdiction under.
aggregation of claims 
in addition to arguing that authorizes subject federal jurisdiction,chrysler also argues that,for some claims in this case,the amount in controversy should be determined based on the aggregated value of those claims to all the class members.in particular,chrysler argues that plaintiffs claims for disgorgement and for punitive damages should be aggregated for purposes of the requirement.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
aggregation in general 
the rule against aggregating the claims of multiple plaintiffs for purposes of determining the amount in controversy dates back at least to.see oliver alexander,pet.more recently,in,the supreme court held that two plaintiffs could not aggregate their claims arising out of distinct promissory notes payable to each plaintiff by the defendant.see troy bank whitehead.in the court words,w hen two or more plaintiffs,having separate and distinct demands,unite for convenience and economy in a single suit,it is essential that the demand of each be of the requisite jurisdictional amount.id.at.the court in troy bank also recognized an exception to the rule that was nearly as old as the rule itself.w hen several plaintiffs unite to enforce a single title or right,in which they have a common and undivided interest,it is enough if their interests collectively equal the jurisdictional amount.id.at.citing shields thomas,how.based on the exception,the court held in troy bank that the two plaintiffs could aggregate their claims based on a vendor lien that they owned jointly.see troy bank,at.see also clark paul gray.pinel pinel.
in snyder harris,d,the supreme court rejected an argument that recent amendments to rule had changed the rule to allow aggregation in class actions.it reiterated that aggregation to meet the requirement was permissible only in cases in which a single plaintiff seeks to aggregate two or more of his own claims against a single defendant and in cases in which two or more plaintiffs unite to enforce a single title or right in which they have a common and undivided interest.id.at.it noted that the limitation on aggregation in class actions stemmed not from rule but from the court interpretation of the phrase matter in controversy in the basic diversity statute.see id.at.see also zahn,at.
our circuit has considered the rule and the common interest exception in a number of cases.see,eagle american,cir allowing aggregation of shareholders claims for breach of fiduciary duty snow ford motor,cir ban on aggregation applies to injunctive as well as compensatory relief united states southern pac.transp,cir denying aggregation of claims against railroad because rights to exclude trespassers arose from the status of each plaintiff as an individual potrero hill cmty.action comm.housing,cir refusing to aggregate claims of tenants in a housing project because their claims arose only from the status of each as individual lessee handy general motors,cir refusing to aggregate actions for excess depreciation due to automobile manufacturing defects skokomish indian tribe france,cir allowing aggregation of quiet title actions by tribe against numerous defendants.
the distinction between separate and distinct claims which can not be aggregated,and common and undivided claims which can,is not always.see morrison allstate indemnity,cir noting criticism of distinction as arcane and confusing charles wright et,federal practice and procedure,at ed describing aggregation rules as being in a very unsatisfactory state moore b at calling distinction elusive.but we think it clear in this case that plaintiffs claims for disgorgement and punitive damages do not implicate a common and undivided interest,and therefore may not be aggregated for purposes of amount in controversy.
aggregation of disgorgement claims 
aggregation is appropriate only where a defendant owes an obligation to the group of plaintiffs as a group and not to the individuals severally.morrison,at citing eagle,at.this understanding of aggregation is implicit in the two decisions in our circuit in which we have allowed aggregation.in the first,eagle american,we held that the claims of a corporation shareholders for breach of fiduciary duty could be aggregated as a common and undivided interest because shareholders can not normally bring suit individually,but must instead institute a derivative suit on behalf of the corporation as a whole.see at.in the second,skokomish indian tribe france,we allowed an indian tribe to aggregate its quiet title actions against multiple defendants in order to satisfy the requirement that then existed for federal question jurisdiction under.because the land at issue was contiguous and had been given to the tribe in a single treaty,and all the defendants derived title from a single source,we held that aggregation was proper.see at.
eagle and skokomish indian tribe are paradigm aggregation cases,each involving a single indivisible res and concerning matters that can not be adjudicated without implicating the rights of everyone involved with the res.gilman bhc,cir quoting bishop general motors.in contrast to the claims in eagle and skokomish indian tribe,plaintiffs disgorgement claims in this case are each cognizable,calculable,and correctable individually.they rest on the common legal theory that chrysler should give up the profit from its use of allegedly defective electrocoat finish profit that can be separated into discrete and quantifiable sums attributable to each vehicle sold.indeed,the amended complaint contends with some specificity that chrysler made an additional profit of between and per vehicle by using the electrocoat technique.that sum can be traced to particular transactions involving individual plaintiffs,each of whom can sue chrysler for disgorgement of this profit.see gilman,at refusing to aggregate disgorgement claims that could be adjudicated on an individual basis sellers,cir refusing to aggregate where each plaintiff sought a fixed sum potrero hill,at refusing to aggregate claims of tenants in a housing project because their claims derived from individual leases.
recovery by one plaintiff in this case would not,as a legal matter,either preclude or reduce recovery by another.see asociacion nacional de pescadores a pequena escala o artesanales de colombia anpac dow quimica de colombia,cir denying aggregation where one plaintiff recovery is neither dependent upon,nor necessarily reduced by,another.combining plaintiffs relatively small individual disgorgement claims into a class action may well be necessary or advantageous as a matter of litigation economics,but that does not mean that chrysler has an undivided obligation to the class within the meaning of the aggregation rule.contrast berman narragansett racing ass n,cir aggregating claims to money owed by racetracks pursuant to contract naming as beneficiary the group of owners whose horses win purses.if the aggregation rule were otherwise,the requirement would be satisfied in all but class actions in which individual litigation is difficult or impossible as a practical matter.
chrysler argues alternatively that any disgorgement would create a common fund that would satisfy the requirements of the aggregation exception.this argument mistakes the nature of the common fund,which is an artifact of litigation,not an intrinsic characteristic of the claims.we agree with the second circuit view that s uch a fund is created to facilitate the litigation process in virtually every class action,and has nothing necessarily to do with whether the plaintiffs shared a interest in the subject of the litigation.gilman,at.
punitive damages 
it is well established that punitive damages are part of the amount in controversy in a civil action.see bell preferred life assur.society.goldberg,at.chrysler goes beyond that familiar proposition,however,and argues that punitive damages may be aggregated in a class action so that the totality of punitive damages,rather than the share,constitutes the amount in controversy.
when chrysler made this argument in its opposition to the first remand,the district court rejected it because none of the plaintiffs legal claims supported an award of punitive damages under california law.after the first remand,plaintiffs amended their complaint to add a claim under california consumer legal remedies act,which would support an award of punitive damages.see cal.plaintiffs did not explicitly request punitive damages,but the potential for such damages may still be considered for purposes of amount in controversy.see bell,at.when chrysler opposed the second remand,it asked the district court to reconsider its refusal to aggregate punitive damages in light of the amended complaint.the district court refused,citing several district court opinions from our circuit holding that punitive damages in class action claims can not be aggregated for purposes of amount in controversy.see,haisch allstate ins,borgeson midland,smiley citibank.we agree with the district court.
it is true that punitive damages are different in some respects from compensatory damages,but they do not represent a common and undivided interest of the class.punitive damages do not compensate plaintiffs for harm suffered.rather,they punish the defendant for the wrongful conduct that has already occurred,and they deter the current defendant and potential defendants from engaging in similar conduct in the future.see witkin,summary of california law,torts at ed.because punitive damages do not compensate for harm,plaintiffs can not calculate with precision the amount of any potential punitive damage award attributable to each class member.moreover,the amount of the punitive damage award may well be influenced by the presence of a large class of plaintiffs,each of whom was wronged by the defendant in the same way.
class members share an interest in a punitive damage award only because they have joined together for the purpose of litigation.this shared interest has nothing to do with to jointly held a single title or right in which each possessed a common and undivided interest.gilman,at.it is undisputed that the plaintiffs in this case could sue chrysler individually on all the causes of action alleged in the current complaint.if they did so,nothing would preclude them from seeking and recovering punitive damages individually.this potential for multiple liability directly refutes the argument that there is some unitary res to which the plaintiffs jointly claim a right.see
