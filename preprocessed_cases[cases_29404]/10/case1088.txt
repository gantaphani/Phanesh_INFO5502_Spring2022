this case asks us to decide whether a settlement agreement reached before class certification between plaintiffs and defendants is fair,reasonable,and adequate.we agree with the district court that the settlement merits approval,and we affirm.
coverall north america,coverall is a janitorial franchising company operating in california.plaintiffs brought a class action suit against coverall in alleging that coverall misclassified its california franchisees as independent contractors,thereby avoiding the protections afforded by california labor laws to franchisees and coverall breached its franchise agreements,and committed fraudulent and unfair practices,by removing customer accounts from franchisees without cause so that it could resell those accounts to other franchisees.in august,after about two years of significant litigation,the parties agreed on a settlement.the sole objector,amrit singh,filed an objection to the proposed settlement on november,and although the objection was not timely,the district court accepted the filing in the interest of determining the issues on the merits.after a fairness hearing on november,the district court approved the settlement agreement on february,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e.
the settlement agreement is expansive,but the most contested provisions include the following coverall pledges to assign customer accounts to current franchisees,with the assignments remaining conditional until franchisees have paid their franchise fees in full former franchise owners will receive each and will receive a purchase credit toward a new coverall franchise and new franchisees will have a day right to rescind their franchise agreements,and upon rescission will receive all the of money they have paid during that period under the franchise agreement except for the background investigation fee.the settlement agreement also outlines other changes to the franchise agreements and coverall operating procedures.beyond the agreement generally,singh contests the award of in attorneys fees to plaintiffs attorneys.as of the fairness hearing on november,two class members had opted out of the agreement and singh is the only objector.

when a class action settlement agreement is submitted for approval,t he initial decision to approve or reject a settlement proposal is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.officers for justice civil serv.comm n,cir.the district court judge must determine whether the settlement is fundamentally fair,adequate and reasonable.id.
we start with fees.although the parties have agreed on the award of attorneys fees,the district court has an independent obligation to ensure that the award,like the settlement itself,is reasonable.bluetooth,at.however,we recognize that in the settlement context fees are a subject of compromise.staton,at.we have made clear that since the proper amount of fees is often open to dispute and the parties are compromising precisely to avoid litigation,the district court need not inquire into the reasonableness of the fees at even the high end with precisely the same level of scrutiny as when the fee amount is litigated.id.
we note at the outset that two different methods may be used for calculating a reasonable attorneys fee depending on the circumstances.bluetooth,at.the lodestar method is most appropriate where the relief sought is primarily injunctive in nature,and a statute authorizes the award of fees to ensure compensation for counsel undertaking socially beneficial litigation.see also hanlon chrysler,cir.that is precisely the situation we face here,because the settlement provisions that plaintiffs have sought and agreed upon are mostly injunctive in nature and a fee shifting statute exists,california business and professions code.we conclude that the district court correctly used the lodestar method in gauging the fairness of the attorneys fee award.
the district court also correctly calculated the lodestar amount and reasonably concluded that the agreed upon award,was appropriate.in its analysis,the district court noted that the case had been contentiously litigated for over two years,and that the report submitted by plaintiffs counsel showing that over hours had been billed by six attorneys,a paralegal,and a law clerk was fair and accurate.using that number,the district court calculated that the lodestar amount reached almost million.at a third of the lodestar amount,the district court soundly concluded that the attorneys fee award of was reasonable.
moreover,the district court prudently the award amount against the alternative method.we have encouraged courts to guard against an unreasonable result by their calculations against a second method.bluetooth,at.generally,courts use a benchmark figure of to gauge the reasonableness of an award under the method,which is most appropriate in common fund settlement cases.id.at in re mercury interactive.sec,cir six mexican workers.citrus growers,cir.here,the district court correctly noted that the value of the settlement,and particularly its injunctive terms,was disputed.while singh figure of is clearly incorrect because it gives no value to the injunctive terms of the settlement,plaintiffs may certainly be overstating the value of the settlement at million.the district court reasonably surmised that even if the value of the settlement was million only a part of the amount claimed by plaintiffs the attorneys fee award would still be within the normal bounds of reasonableness.the district court was within its discretion to find the attorneys fee award to be fair,reasonable,and adequate because it was both significantly below the lodestar amount and represented an unobjectionable percentage of recovery once the value of injunctive relief was considered.
singh main argument against the reasonableness of the attorneys fee award is that the actual value of the settlement,which he characterizes as primarily the amount of the cash payments,is so low that the award is unreasonable.singh correctly notes that the benefit obtained for the class is important in determining whether to adjust the lodestar amount and by how much,hanlon,at,but any such adjustment is equitable and squarely at the discretion of the district court,hensley eckerhart,d,and singh presents no evidence that the district court abused its discretion in declining further adjustment from the lodestar amount.moreover,the district court acted within its proper discretion when it found that the settlement contains significant benefits for plaintiffs beyond the cash recovery,and thus that the award,at about a third of the lodestar amount,was reasonable.
turning to the settlement as a whole,federal rule of civil procedure e requires the district court to determine whether a proposed settlement is fundamentally fair.hanlon,at.as a general rule,a district court must consider the following factors when examining the fairness of a proposed settlement 
the strength of the plaintiffs case the risk,expense,complexity,and likely duration of further litigation the risk of maintaining class action status throughout the trial the amount offered in settlement the extent of discovery completed and the stage of the proceedings the experience and views of counsel the presence of a governmental participant and the reaction of the class members to the proposed settlement.churchill,cir torrisi tucson power,cir.in its analysis under the churchill factors,the district court noted that the risks of moving forward with litigation were significant,both in terms of the likelihood of success and cost.plaintiffs expressed justified concern that the class members could be forced into individual arbitration after the supreme court decision in at t mobility llc concepcion,d,and conflicting case law supports those concerns.
the district court also agreed with plaintiffs that california employment law would likely make obtaining class certification particularly difficult.following the supreme court decision in stores,dukes,d,there was a real prospect that california test for employee classification would have proven fatal to any eventual class certification in this case.as an additional risk,the district court found that the poor financial health of coverall seriously increased the chance that plaintiffs would be left with nothing if they continued to litigate their claims.rounding out its analysis,the district court noted that no governmental entity had weighed in on the matter,that plaintiffs attorneys had significant experience and had demonstrated skill and diligence throughout the litigation,and that only two class members had opted out of the agreement.
further,the district court reasonably found that the settlement would yield significant benefits for plaintiffs given the risks and costs of continuing litigation.the district court found that,beyond the cash for former franchisees,assignment of customer accounts and pledges for programmatic changes are significant victories.the district court elaborated that once franchises are assigned,franchisees will own a valuable business they can choose to sell or continue to operate.viewed together,the district court determined that the churchill factors supported the conclusion that the settlement was fair,reasonable,and adequate.
singh claims that the district court was under a special obligation to make clear,findings regarding the value of the terms of the settlement,by which he seems to contend that the district court should have assigned a monetary value to the terms of the settlement.but we have never required a district court to assign a monetary value to purely injunctive relief.to the contrary,we have stated that courts can not judge with confidence the value of the terms of a settlement agreement,especially one in which,as here,the settlement provides for injunctive relief.staton,at.monetary valuation of injunctive relief is difficult and imprecise as such,we put a good deal of stock in the product of an,negotiated resolution,and have never prescribed a particular formula by which that outcome must be tested.rodriguez,at internal citations omitted.the district court has no obligation to make explicit monetary valuations of injunctive remedies,and it did not abuse its discretion in applying the churchill factors to this case.
singh also argues that the district court abused its discretion in not exercising heightened review given the alleged presence of warning signs indicating collusion.although we must be particularly vigilant in the certification context,when there are typically more opportunities for attorney collusion,hanlon,at,we will rarely overturn an approval of a compromised settlement unless the terms of the agreement contain convincing indications that the incentives favoring pursuit of rather than the class interests in fact influenced the outcome of the negotiations and that the district court was wrong in concluding otherwise,staton,at.
in bluetooth,we outlined three settlement arrangements that could indicate collusion because they may improperly favor counsel at the expense of the plaintiffs.at.these are 
when counsel receive a disproportionate distribution of the settlement,or when the class receives no monetary distribution but class counsel are amply rewarded when the parties negotiate a clear sailing arrangement providing for the payment of attorneys fees separate and apart from class funds and when the parties arrange for fees not awarded to revert to defendants rather than be added to the class fund.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.although the district court did not explicitly outline these warning signs,contrary to singh assertion,it did specifically address two of the three.the district court found the third sign,the presence of a reversion clause,to not be a preferable result,but balanced it with the overall benefits of the settlement to plaintiffs and the fact that the cash payment represented a small amount of those benefits.
the district court analysis,balancing the reversion clause against the overall strength of the settlement,was adequate.the first warning sign was not present because the district court correctly concluded that the attorneys fee award was entirely reasonable.this conclusion has broad implications for the district court obligation to ensure that the settlement is not the product of collusion among the negotiating parties.id.internal quotation marks,citation,and alteration omitted.because collusion is the product of attorneys pursuing their to the detriment of the class interests,one would expect primarily to find collusion where attorneys disproportionately benefitted from the settlement.id.at see staton,at if fees are unreasonably high,the likelihood is that the defendant obtained an economically beneficial concession with regard to the merits provisions of the settlement.a settlement may still be the product of collusion when attorneys fees are reasonable.but when,as in this case,the fee award is clearly reasonable as viewed through the appropriate application of either the lodestar or methods,the chance of collusion narrows to a slim possibility.in these cases,it is sufficient that a district court recognizes and balances potentially collusive provisions,such as the reversion to defendants of unclaimed funds,against the other terms of the settlement agreement.see bluetooth,at but these factors did not obviate the need to examine the fee provision in light of the rest of the agreement.staton,at i t will be rare that we will reverse a district court approval unless the fees and relief provisions clearly suggest the possibility that class interests gave way to.hanlon,at i t is the settlement taken as a whole,rather than the individual component parts,that must be examined for overall fairness.
plaintiffs faced real dangers in proceeding on their case in light of menacing precedents from the united states supreme court.at the same time,the class gained significant benefits from the settlement,and plaintiffs lawyers received fees that are overall reasonable.the district court correctly examined the settlement agreement and did not abuse its discretion in finding the agreement to be fair,reasonable,and adequate.
the district court decision to grant discovery is reviewed for abuse of discretion.hallett morgan,cir.as a threshold matter,singh has standing to appeal the settlement deposition requirement because the district court ordered that objectors comply with the relevant settlement provision,and he was later required to sit for a deposition as the sole objector.
the district court also did not abuse its discretion in approving the settlement term that objectors be available for depositions.federal rule of civil procedure a allows a party to conduct depositions,and courts commonly require objectors to make themselves available for deposition given the power held by objectors.see,in re netflix privacy,finding that objectors have voluntarily inserted themselves into this action,and as such,depositions are relevant and proper in re tft lcd flat panel antitrust,no.m,wl,holding objectors in contempt for refusing to be deposed in re cathode ray tube crt antitrust.the district court considered the totality of the circumstances when it concluded that a deposition of singh was appropriate,including the deposition utility to the court and the scant possibility that singh would be harassed or intimidated by giving a deposition,and the district court was well within its discretion in so concluding.
finally,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it approved the settlement agreement consistent with the class action fairness act cafa notice requirement described in b and d.cafa requires that defendants in a class action suit send notice to all relevant state and federal authorities where class members reside.b.a court may not issue an order giving final approval of a proposed settlement until days have passed since the relevant authorities were served with notice.d.when violations of the b notice requirement occur,a class member may refuse to comply with and may choose not to be bound by a settlement agreement or consent decree.e.rather than asking to be exempt from the settlement agreement,singh demands relief beyond the scope of the rejection of the entire settlement agreement.because singh requests no relief tied to,he can not show that a favorable decision will provide redress,and thus he lacks standing on this claim.see knisley network,cir.and even if singh had standing to pursue this claim,it is without merit because the class was clearly limited to individuals in the state of california,and coverall properly notified the attorney general of california.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the settlement agreement and its attorneys fee award to be fair,reasonable,and adequate.the district court also appropriately exercised its discretion in ordering that singh be available for a deposition 
with reluctance,i dissent from the majority decision affirming the district court approval of the proposed class action settlement.the record below is bereft of crucial information information without which the district court could not fully review either the adequacy of the settlement or the reasonableness of the fee award.in particular,the record is silent as to two essential matters the portion of the class eligible to receive the chief benefit of the settlement,the assignment of customer accounts to current franchisees and the value of the monetary relief to the class and whether there is a justification for imposing a claims process with a reverter of unclaimed funds back to the defendant.the case should be remanded for fuller development of the record.i also believe this case affords this court an opportunity to provide additional guidance to the district courts in their assessment of proposed class action settlements.
i am well aware that there are good reasons for a district judge to afford deference to a settlement reached by agreement between the parties.see lane facebook,cir noting that one factor for a court to consider in determining the fairness of a class action settlement is the experience and views of counsel.the parties know more about the case and the factors that lead to settlement than the trial judge does often there are facts beyond the record such as the finances or future business plans of the defendant or infirmities with the plaintiff ability to prosecute the case which can have a substantial and legitimate influence on settlement negotiations.i also recognize that there are good reasons for an appellate court to defer to the trial judge approval of a settlement.see hanlon chrysler,cir stating that o ur review of the district court decision to approve a class action settlement is extremely limited.the trial judge generally is in a better position to ferret out the relevant factors and to discern the subtle dynamics of the litigation warranting approval of a negotiated settlement.see id.stating that the decision to approve or reject a settlement is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge because he is exposed to the litigants,and their strategies,positions and proof.
nevertheless,the district court has an important and meaningful role to play in the settlement of a putative class action.in particular,the district judge has a fiduciary duty to safeguard the interests of the absent and putative class members.see,sullivan db,cir stating that trial judges bear the important responsibility of protecting absent class members,and must be assur ed that the settlement represents adequate compensation for the release of the class claims maywalt parker parsley petroleum,cir noting that the district court has a fiduciary responsibility to ensure that the settlement is fair and not a product of collusion,and that the class members interests were represented adequately internal quotation marks omitted.that duty is especially important when the interests of the class and its counsel negotiating on its behalf are not aligned.see reynolds benefit bank,cir stating that the problem that class counsel may,in derogation of their professional and fiduciary obligations,place their pecuniary ahead of that of the class requires district judges to exercise the highest degree of vigilance in scrutinizing proposed settlements of class actions.moreover,where the settlement agreement is negotiated prior to final class certification,there is an even greater potential for a breach of fiduciary duty owed the class during settlement.in re bluetooth headset products liability litigation,cir.thus,in this case,an even higher level of scrutiny than that ordinarily required under rule e is warranted.id.
the terms and structure of the proposed settlement herein warrant meaningful scrutiny.its approval must be supported by the record.unfortunately,though the district judge plainly took this duty seriously,i believe the requisite scrutiny was not possible given the deficiencies in the record.the district court task was compounded by the lack of clarity in this circuit law on particular issues discussed below.
although the majority addresses the reasonableness of the fee award before addressing the reasonableness of the settlement substantive terms,review ordinarily begins with the adequacy of the settlement itself.see bluetooth,at.therefore,i address the adequacy of the settlement first.
under federal rule of civil procedure e,a class action may be settled only with the approval of the district court,and a district court approval must be accompanied by a finding that the settlement is fair,reasonable,and adequate.lane,at.here,a higher standard of fairness is required because the settlement took place before formal class certification.see id.at.
a district court must consider a number of factors in determining whether a proposed settlement is fair and adequate these include 
the strength of the plaintiffs case the risk,expense,complexity,and likely duration of further litigation the risk of maintaining class action status throughout the trial the amount offered in settlement the extent of discovery completed and the stage of the proceedings the experience and views of counsel the presence of a governmental participant and the reaction of the class members to the proposed settlement.
id.see churchill,cir.
in the case at bar,the district court adequately considered many of the factors,including the risk of further litigation.it properly found,for example,that there was a risk class claims could have been forced into individual arbitration pursuant to at t mobility concepcion,d.there was also a risk in obtaining class certification in light of wal mart stores,dukes,d.many of the other factors supported approval.
however,in my view,the district court order although thorough in most respects did not adequately assess a critical factor the amount offered in settlement.although lane does not expressly order the importance of the assessment factors,inescapably,the core of any settlement is the amount offered in settlement.in this regard,the district court order did not determine whether the most significant terms of the settlement were real or largely illusory.see in re dry max pampers,cir stating that t he relief that this settlement provides to unnamed class members is illusory and therefore finding the settlement unfair dennis kellogg,cir stating that dollar value of the cy pres fund should not be fictitious.
under the settlement,there were two classes that would receive benefits current franchisees and former franchisees.current franchisees obtained certain equitable relief most notably,the assignment of customer accounts which would confer upon the franchisees economic value that could not summarily be taken away.as for former franchisees,each was entitled to in cash and a credit of in effect,a coupon which could be used to purchase a new coverall franchise.for the reasons discussed below,both aspects of the settlement are problematic,and a fuller record is required in order to properly assess the fairness,reasonableness,and adequacy of the settlement.
current franchisees assignment of customer accounts 
for current franchisees,the primary benefit of the settlement was the assignment of customer accounts.the centrality of this benefit is clear a major claim asserted by plaintiffs in this action was a breach of contract based on coverall churning of customers accounts.churning involves taking a customer account away from a franchise owner for a pretextual reason in order to resell the customer account to a different franchise owner.if accounts were assigned to franchise owners,that would prevent the practice of churning.
the importance of the assignment provision is underscored by the district court order as well as the parties briefs presented to this court.the district court stated in its order that t he settlement agreement provides separate benefits for current and former franchisees.principally,coverall pledges to assign customer accounts to current franchisees.er emphasis added see also er stating that assignment of customer accounts and pledges for programmatic changes are significant victories.similarly,in plaintiffs appellate brief,the first benefit highlighted is the assignment of accounts,with plaintiffs touting that t he value of the assignment is estimated to be worth to million per year in california alone.pls.resp.br.at.defendants did the same in their own appellate brief.see defs.resp.br.at.
because the assignment was the primary benefit of the settlement for current franchisees,the district court had a duty to ensure that this benefit had real value.notably,the burden of proving that the assignment had real value lay with the settling parties it was not singh burden to disprove it.see in re dry max pampers,at t o the extent the parties here argue that the settlement was fair because the refund program has actual value for consumers,it was the parties burden to prove the fact,rather than the objector burden to disprove it.
as to whether the assignment provision of the settlement would actually benefit current franchisees,that posed a troubling question because,under the proposed settlement,the assignment is conditional.see er.that is,until a current or new franchise owner pays for a customer account in full,the full franchise fee,including any financed portion,there is no actual assignment,and customer accounts can continue to be taken away pursuant to the old just or good cause standard but the record contains no information as to how many or what percentage of franchise owners have paid their fees in full.in particular,there is no information about how many franchise owners still owe money on their franchise fees and if so,how much how long it takes an average franchise owner to pay off a franchise fee and whether franchise owners typically leave before they are able to pay off their franchise fees in full this is significant because singh,the objector,asserted in argument before this court that a substantial number of franchisees finance their franchise fees.see also pls.op.br.at claiming that,t ypically,coverall workers make a down payment toward the franchise fee which ranges from approximately to and then finance the remaining portion of the fee by borrowing it from coverall for a two or period at interest adding that,w hen workers lose accounts and want to obtain more work,they may do so by then paying fees for additional business,and these fees must also be paid off before any assignment.on the current record,we do not know whether,or of the class will or will likely receive the benefit of the assignment of accounts.
moreover,even if a significant portion of current franchisees were actually able to pay off their franchise fees and thus get an assignment,the parties claim that the value of the assignment was million is still problematic.the parties asserted this value because the gross billing of customer contracts in california in the year was million.see pls.resp.br.at.but under the settlement agreement,certain customer accounts are deemed not assignable.see er providing that certain accounts,including national accounts,customer prepared contracts that preclude assignment,and local multiple location customer contracts are not assignable.there does not appear to be any information in the record as to how many customer contracts fall within this category,or their worth.thus,the claimed million value of the assignment may well be inflated.the district court order did not address this issue.
furthermore,although the district court acknowledged that the assignment of accounts may not have the full million value claimed by the parties because of the conditional nature of the assignment,see er indeed,it is unclear whether the assignment of all accounts to franchisees will reach the million plaintiffs claim,especially because assignments are only conditional until franchises are paid for in full,it did not estimate indeed,had no basis in the record to estimate what portion of the class would actually benefit from the assignment.the district court could only state that,once franchisees are assigned,franchisees will own a value business they can choose to sell or continue to operate.er the majority correctly states that the district court ordinarily need not necessarily place a specific monetary value on injunctive relief.see,staton boeing,cir stating that courts can not judge with confidence the value of the terms of a settlement agreement in which the settlement provides for injunctive relief.still,given the importance of the amount offered in settlement in assessing the fairness and adequacy of a class settlement,valuation of benefits should be examined with great care.dennis,at finding the settlement valuation unacceptably vague and possibly misleading and noting that t he issue of the valuation must be examined with great care to eliminate the possibility that it serves only the of the attorneys and the parties,and not the class,by assigning a dollar number to the fund that is fictitious.in any event,while it is true that equitable relief sometimes is not capable of quantitative valuation for example,where equitable relief is directed to dignitary interests such as privacy rights,where that relief has some calculable monetary value and is central to the relief obtained,some meaningful effort should be made to determine the amount offered in settlement.h,advisory committee notes stating that s ettlements involving nonmonetary provisions for class members also deserve careful scrutiny to ensure that these provisions have actual value to the class.
in the case at bar,the assignment of accounts is capable of quantitative valuation,even if that value can not be precisely determined.see,staton,at noting that value of benefits from injunctive relief may be included in common fund calculation where value can be accurately ascertained,in a prior case,there was clearly a measurable benefit of one replacement latch for each minivan owned,and thus the court could,with some degree of accuracy,value the benefits conferred indeed,as noted above,the parties themselves valued the assignment at approximately million see pls.resp.br.at see also er providing that coverall represents that,in,the gross billing of the customer contracts in the state of california was approximately million.the factor that is missing from the calculus and missing from the record is the number or percentage of current franchisees who actually will or,at least,will likely receive the benefit.
absent anything in the record which would shed light on this crucial variable,the district court was not in a position to conclude that the settlement was fair,reasonable,and adequate.although w e review the district court approval of a settlement for abuse of discretion,radcliffe experian info,cir,and,under such review,w e are not permitted to substitute our notions of fairness for those of the district court and the parties to the agreement,class plaintiffs seattle,cir,a district court approval can not be affirmed where its findings of fact were without support in the record.radcliffe,at.here,the record was not sufficiently developed on what should be a central factor in assessing the fairness,reasonableness,and adequacy of the class settlement the amount offered in settlement.lane,at.
former franchisees monetary relief 
with respect to the monetary portion of the settlement,former franchisees are each entitled to in cash and a credit of towards a purchase of a new coverall franchise.there were approximately former franchisees in the class.therefore,defendants would,in theory,pay a maximum of to former franchises.
the monetary terms of the settlement,however,are suspect.although the class fund was identified as a potential,neither side expected defendants would actually pay anywhere close to this sum under the structure of the proposed settlement.this is because,under the settlement,would be made only to those class members who submitted claims,and any unclaimed funds would revert back to defendants rather than being redistributed to claiming class members or distributed to a cy pres beneficiary.
as district courts have pointed out,in a reversionary common fund or a settlement,the defendant is likely to bear only a fraction of the liability to which it agrees.in re tjx.retail sec.breach,d,emphasis added see also sylvester cigna,d,stating that parties evidence indicated that claims made settlements regularly yield response rates of percent or less adding that the parties expectations of a low response rate gives the reverter clause real value for defendants.researchers and commentators have also confirmed that,while results vary from case to case depending on a number of factors,it is common that only a fraction of the class in class action settlements actually submit claims.see,max helveston,promoting justice through public interest advocacy in class actions,buff,noting that there are a variety of different explanations for low claims rates,the difficulty of notifying class members,the overly complex and technical notifications that class members receive,the effort required to pursue a claim,the lack of interest of class members in the types of relief available,and the failure of fund designers to design claim procedures in ways that take into account cognitive biases but adding that,at the end of the day,class members in large class action suits typically file claims at rates that are much lower than one would expect mayer brown llp,do class actions benefit class members,available at.last visited,stating that extremely small rates in several cases are consistent with the few other reports of claim rates in class action settlements that have come to light.
that is precisely,and predictably,what happened here.with respect to the cash payment,only out of former franchisees actually submitted claims.this amounts to a response rate of about,for a total of out of.as for the coupon,of the former franchisees,only made a claim for the coupon a response rate of about.thus,instead of a true of with respect to coupons,defendants would be obligated to pay or credit at most,and this assumes that all former franchisees will actually use the coupon once received.
at the end of the day,the purported settlement value of for former franchisees covering both the payout and the coupon amounted to,at most,a true value of only or a response rate of approximately and likely even less because some of the coupons claimed probably will not be used.the unclaimed funds did not benefit the class as they would revert back to defendants.
this result was entirely predictable once the parties stipulated to a claims process.this then begs the question why the parties chose to require a claims process in the first place.while there are situations in which a claims process is unavoidable such as a consumer class action where there is no readily accessible record of purchases to identify class members and their contact information,in this case,it is not obvious why a claims process was necessary.compare in re wells fargo loan processor overtime pay,no.c emc,dist.lexis,at,explaining why there is a valid and substantial justification for the claims process.as noted in a federal judicial center publication,a claims process is not necessary in all cases 
in too many cases,the parties may negotiate a claims process which serves as a choke on the total amount paid to class members.when the defendant already holds information that would allow at least some claims to be paid automatically,those claims should be paid directly without requiring claim forms.
de leon bank of,cv orl,dist.lexis,at,quoting the version of the judges class action notice and claims process checklist and plain language guide produced by the federal judicial center.
here,the necessity of a claims process is not apparent from the record.there was a set sum to be paid to each former franchisee,so a claims process was not needed in order for the parties to determine the appropriate amount of damages for each former franchisee.no proof of claim was needed to identify class members because defendants already had within their possession information identifying the former franchisees.and presumably defendants had the last best address for each former franchisee how else could they send the claim forms to the franchisees the record fails to indicate why it was not feasible to send checks and coupons directly to class members rather than requiring a claims process.see de leon,dist.lexis,at finding a claim form procedure unreasonable because,inter alia,defendant had databases that enabled it to identify approximately cardholders who were assessed late fees on timely payments made see also mayer brown llp,do class actions benefit class members noting that automatic distribution settlements are possible where class members whose eligibility and alleged damages could be ascertained and calculated such as participants in erisa class actions.
the decision to use coupons or credit as a benefit for former franchisees towards the price of a new franchise also raises questions about the adequacy of the settlement.as noted in the manual for complex litigation,coupons are often illusory monetary benefits.see manual for complex,at noting that a judge should be wary of a proposed settlement that grant s class members illusory nonmonetary benefits,such as discount coupons for more of defendants products,while granting substantial monetary attorney fee awards.the illusory value of the coupon is particularly acute here each former franchisee was entitled to a coupon to be used towards purchase for a new coverall franchise,but a franchise costs at least and can be as high as.see er.it was unlikely that many of the coupons would ever be claimed or used.it is not surprising that only of former franchisees filed a claim for the coupon.
finally,even if the claims process were justified,that does nothing to justify the reverter of any unclaimed funds to defendants.the parties could have agreed as many settlements have to a second distribution of residual funds to those former franchisees who did submit claims a distribution to a cy pres beneficiary.see,garner state farm mut.auto.ins,no.cv cw emc,dist.lexis,at,noting that,under the settlement,uncashed settlement checks and unspent portions of the administrative cost reserve will be redistributed to the class or given to a cy pres beneficiary.at least this would have guaranteed a meaningful and substantial payment to the class.
in sum,the monetary benefits to the former franchisees was vastly overstated and largely illusory,thus raising significant questions that deserve a meaningful degree of scrutiny by the district court.in re consolidated,no.c raj,dist.lexis,at,stating that,where class counsel points to an illusory million benefit as justification for its own fee award,without acknowledging that counsel expected the benefit to be dramatically smaller,it illustrates the danger of deferring to counsel view of a settlement that misaligns the interests of class members and class counsel.this is particularly troubling given that plaintiffs counsel was guaran
