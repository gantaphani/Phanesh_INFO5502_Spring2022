this case arises out of a class action suit filed by approximately exxon dealers who alleged that exxon breached its dealer agreements by overcharging them for fuel purchases.following a second trial,a jury returned a special verdict in favor of the dealers.after entering a final judgment for the class representatives and denying the dealers motion for the entry of a judgment,the district court certified the following two questions for interlocutory appeal whether it properly exercised supplemental jurisdiction over class members whose claims did not meet the jurisdictional minimum amount in controversy requirement and whether an aggregate compensatory and prejudgment interest award could be entered for the class before the claims administration process.additionally,the court urged us to consider all of the legal issues raised by both parties relating to the disposition of the case.thus,we also consider whether exxon is entitled to participate in the claims administration process whether exxon may assert claims against the dealers whether the district court abused its discretion by certifying the class whether the court erred when it admitted extrinsic evidence to supplement the dealer sales agreements dealer agreements whether the dealers claims were barred by the statutes of limitations and whether the court abused its discretion by allowing the dealers expert witness to testify at trial.we find no reversible error and accordingly affirm.
background 
this suit was filed by a class of approximately current and former exxon dealers in states who alleged that in connection with a marketing program known as the discount for cash dfc program,exxon systematically and intentionally overcharged them for the wholesale purchase of motor fuel between march,and august.as a result of the overcharges,the dealers alleged that exxon breached its obligations to them under the dealer agreements.
under the dfc program,exxon encouraged its dealers to implement a pricing system under which retail customers who paid cash for gasoline would pay a few cents less than customers who paid with credit cards.in an effort to maximize dealer participation in the program,exxon began charging dealers a processing fee on sales of gasoline to consumers who paid by credit card,but promised to offset the charge by reducing the wholesale price that each dealer paid for gasoline.exxon kept this promise for approximately six months and reduced the wholesale price by cents per gallon.in march of,however,it stopped providing the offset without informing the dealers.the dealers allege that by removing the offset without informing them,exxon was able to overcharge them for gasoline during the class period.
upon discovering that the offset was no longer being provided,the dealers filed suit in may of,and the case originally was tried to a hung jury in september of.it was retried in january of,resulting in a unanimous jury verdict in favor of the dealers.the jury found that exxon breached its contractual obligations to the dealers and fraudulently concealed that breach.following the return of the jury verdict,exxon filed posttrial motions for judgment as a matter of law a new trial.the district court denied those motions,concluding that the evidence presented at trial was more than sufficient to support the verdict.the court further determined that,as a matter of law,the dealers were entitled to recover prejudgment interest in addition to their compensatory damages.nevertheless,the court denied the dealers motion for the entry of a final judgment for the class,concluding that it had no authority to enter an aggregate judgment because the jury had not awarded aggregate damages.instead,the district court entered a final judgment for the class representatives and created an ad hoc claims process through which exxon could contest each of the remaining class members claims for compensatory damages.
because the district court believed that its order involve d a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation,it certified the case for interlocutory review pursuant to b,asking us to resolve the following questions whether it properly exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of class members who did not meet the jurisdictional minimum amount in controversy and whether it was proper to enter judgment for the class representatives,but not for the class as a whole.
discussion 
supplemental jurisdiction 
the first question certified for interlocutory review by the district court was whether it had supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of all of the class members,including those who failed to meet the minimum amount in controversy requirement of a.w hether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over this action is subject to de novo review.darden ford consumer fin,cir.
the district court question forces us to address whether,the supplemental jurisdiction statute,overrules the united states supreme court decision in zahn international paper,d,that e ach plaintiff in a rule b class action must satisfy the jurisdictional amount,and any plaintiff who does not must be dismissed from the case.
whether overrules zahn has been the subject of considerable debate among our sister circuits,which have split on the issue.see rosmer pfizer,cir holding that confers supplemental jurisdiction in diversity class actions,so long as one named plaintiff satisfies the minimum amount in controversy requirement,cert.dismissed,d gibson chrysler,cir holding the same,cert.denied,d stromberg metal works,press,cir holding that authorizes a district court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a party that does not satisfy the minimum amount in controversy in re abbott,cir holding that as long as the class representatives meet the amount in controversy requirement,a district court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the members of the class who do not.but see trimble asarco,cir holding that zahn remains viable and that each member of a class must meet the requisite jurisdictional amount in controversy meritcare paul mercury ins,cir finding the text of ambiguous and relying upon legislative history to hold that preserves zahn leonhardt sugar,cir holding that unambiguously preserves zahn.upon our own review,we agree with our sister circuits that have held that the language of clearly and unambiguously overrules zahn and allows a district court entertaining a diversity class action to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over class members whose claims do not meet the jurisdictional minimum amount in controversy requirement 
in addressing this question,we begin by examining the text of the statute to determine whether its meaning is clear.harry marchant,cir en banc.in construing a statute we must begin,and often should end as well,with the language of the statute itself.merritt dillard paper,cir.this is so because we must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.id.quoting.bank germain,d.
section a provides,
except as provided in subsections b and c or as expressly provided otherwise by federal statute,in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.
a.section b continues,
in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section of this title,the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection a over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under rule,or of the federal rules of civil procedure,or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under rule of such rules,or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under rule of such rules,when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section.
we believe that it is clear from the plain language of the statute that a is a general grant of supplemental jurisdiction,which is then narrowed for diversity cases by b in considering whether the district court exercise of supplemental jurisdiction over the dealers claims was proper,we therefore first must determine whether the dealers satisfied the requirements of a.the parties agree that the district court had original jurisdiction over the class representatives claims,because they satisfied the jurisdictional minimum amount in controversy requirement section a therefore authorized the court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over those claims that were so closely related to the original claims that they form ed part of the same case or controversy.id.a.because the dealers claims arose from the same agreements and contractual obligations as the class representatives claims,the requirements of a were satisfied.
thus,the district court was entitled to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the dealers claims pursuant to a unless those claims fell within one of the exceptions listed in subsection b,which explicitly prevents courts from exercising supplemental jurisdiction over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under rule,or of the federal rules of civil procedure.id.b.notably,federal rule of civil procedure,which pertains to class actions,is not one of the enumerated exceptions.exxon argues that because a requires that the district court have original jurisdiction over each member of the class,it would have been redundant for congress to enumerate rule as a specific exclusion from supplemental jurisdiction in b sic.we disagree.the fact that congress created explicit exceptions to a broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction but did not include rule among them leads us to conclude that it did not intend to prevent district courts from exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of class members.indeed,it is a rule of statutory construction in this circuit that where a statute explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general grant of power,courts should be reluctant to imply additional exceptions in the absence of a clear legislative intent to the contrary.united states ex rel.williams nec,cir.because we do not believe that the text of the statute expresses any legislative intent to prevent district courts from exercising supplemental jurisdiction in diversity class actions,we decline to rewrite the statute to insert rule into b list of exceptions.rosmer,at see also harris garner,cir en banc we will not do to the statutory language what congress did not do with it,because the role of the judicial branch is to apply statutory language,not to rewrite it,cert.denied,d.
thus,we find that clearly and unambiguously provides district courts with the authority in diversity class actions to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of class members who do not meet the minimum amount in controversy as long as the district court has original jurisdiction over the claims of at least one of the class representatives.we therefore conclude that overrules zahn.
ii.entry of judgment 
we now turn to the second issue certified for interlocutory the district court should have entered an aggregate judgment for the dealers based upon the jury verdict finding exxon liable to the dealers because we do not believe that an aggregate final judgment was warranted in this case,we also must address the following issues raised in the dealers whether the district court erred by determining that exxon is permitted to participate in the claims process and whether it is proper to allow exxon to assert claims during the claims process.
aggregate judgment 
the dealers argue that once the jury returned a verdict in their favor,the district court should have entered a final judgment awarding aggregate damages to the class although they acknowledge that the jury did not award aggregate damages,the dealers argue that the court could have calculated the total amount of damages on its own and entered a judgment reflecting that amount.assuming arguendo that the district court had the authority to calculate the dealers damages and enter an aggregate judgment,we do not believe that it would have been appropriate for the court to exercise that authority in this case 
as an initial matter,we note that our consideration of whether an aggregate final judgment is appropriate in this case is complicated by the lack of case law pertaining to this issue.therefore,like the district court,we find ourselves without much guidance from other courts.upon our own review,however,we agree with the district court that this is not the ideal case for the entry of an aggregate final judgment,because several significant obstacles prevent the entry of such a judgment.moreover,we do not believe that an aggregate judgment would benefit the class greatly or result in a more expedient disposition of each dealer claim.
although we believe that exxon liability to the dealers was decided properly on a basis,we agree with the district court that the determination of the amount that each dealer was overcharged during the class period must take place on an individual basis,taking into account the amount of compensatory damages to which each dealer is entitled.such individualized proof of claims would be necessary regardless of whether an aggregate judgment was entered,and the considerations that must be taken into account to calculate the correct amount of damages during the claims process reveal the obstacles to entering an aggregate judgment for the class.these obstacles include accounting for those dealers who either have opted out of the class or not submitted claims accounting for those dealers whose claims were barred by the ohio statute of limitations the difficulty of awarding prejudgment interest on a basis when the applicable amount of interest varies from state to state and determining whether the dealers claims are subject to further reduction by claims asserted by exxon 
in light of these obstacles,we believe that the district court decision not to enter an aggregate judgment was proper,because the judgment would not have expedited or simplified the claims process.indeed,it appears that the entry of an aggregate judgment would complicate the claims process further,and we believe that the only real effect of entering an aggregate judgment in this case would have been to set aside a large pool of money,which would have accumulated interest while the claims process took place even if the funds were deposited immediately into an escrow account,the dealers would not benefit greatly from having the money set aside,because they would not be entitled to receive their individual shares of compensatory damages until after their claims had been proven.
we thus find no compelling justification for the entry of an aggregate final judgment in this case,and the dealers have pointed us to no authority suggesting that the entry of such a judgment was required therefore,we conclude that,under the facts of this case,the district court refusal to enter an aggregate final judgment for the class did not constitute reversible error.
exxon right to participate in the claims process 
the district court determined that exxon had a right to participate in the claims administration process,because it was a real party in interest and would have to pay the damages due as a result of the verdict and claims process.in light of that process,it determined that exxon would be permitted to file objections to each dealer claim contesting whether the dealer actually was a dealer during the class period whether the dealer claim was subject to a statute of limitations defense or barred by a release whether the amount of compensatory damages and prejudgment interest to which each dealer was entitled was calculated properly and whether the dealer claim was subject to reduction by one of exxon claims.
the dealers argue that exxon had no right to participate in the claims process,because the determination of liability already had been made and the only remaining issue in this case was how to distribute the damages.in so arguing,the dealers rely primarily upon the supreme court decision in boeing van gemert,d,in which the court held that boeing did not have a present interest in the damage fund that was to be distributed to a class of investors.we,however,believe that boeing is inapposite to this case.
in boeing,an investor class action suit,boeing did not appeal the district court entry of a judgment for the class.id.at.rather,its appeal was narrowly tailored to the issue of whether attorney fees could be awarded from the portion of the judgment fund that remained unclaimed at the conclusion of the claims process.id.at.the supreme court determined that t he judgment on the merits stripped boeing of any present interest in the fund and thus concluded that boeing had no interest in the litigation between the class and its attorneys regarding attorney fees.id.at.the court,however,acknowledged that boeing did have an interest,arising from its colorable claim for the return of excess money,in whether attorney fees could be assessed against the entire fund rather than against the portion actually claimed.id.
thus,we believe that the dealers reliance upon boeing is misplaced.contrary to the dealers assertions,that decision does not suggest that a defendant has no interest at all in the postverdict resolution of class claims rather,it suggests that a defendant has no interest in how the class members apportion and distribute a damage fund among themselves.see also six mexican workers.citrus growers,cir where the only question is how to distribute the damages,the interests affected are not the defendant but rather those of the silent class members.in this case,however,no damage fund has been created and there are several issues that must be resolved during the claims process.as one commentator noted in addressing individual issues among class members,
if the only issue is to determine the amount of damages which class members are entitled to receive and this determination can be accomplished almost mechanically,simple proofs similar to those used for summary judgment are often appropriate,especially when individual claims are small or relatively modest 
on the other hand,when large claims are involved,one would expect that they would be more hotly contested by the defendants and more vigorously asserted by the claimants.the economic stakes being more substantial in large claims,fairness dictates that the procedures should allow for a more formal adversary proceeding.
alba conte herbert newberg,newberg on class actions,at ed.because exxon has certain defenses to each dealer claim,we believe that an adversarial claims process is warranted in this case.we therefore conclude that exxon still has a present interest in the claims process,and due process requires that it be allowed to participate in that process.
exxon right to assert claims 
having determined that exxon has a right to participate in the claims process,we must address the dealers argument that the district court erred when it determined that exxon could assert claims against the dealers during the claims process,because its claims were untimely raised.
several federal courts have determined that the appropriate time for a class action defendant to raise affirmative defenses and claims is during the damages phase of the action.see aamco automatic transmissions,tayloe,determining that the defendant counterclaims could be effectively presented when individual claims for damages are presented serpa jolly king,wl cal once liability is established and claims for damages filed,then and only then,may the defendants raise specific and detailed counterclaims to offset the damage claims.donson stores,am.bakeries,if liability is established,other issues,including damages and counterclaims,can be handled on a class member basis.we agree with the reasoning of those courts and therefore find that exxon was not required to assert its claims in its answer thus,the district court did not err in holding that exxon can raise those claims during the claims administration process.
iii.exxon remaining claims 
having answered the two certified questions,we now address the following additional issues raised by exxon whether the class should have been certified whether the district court should have permitted the jury to consider extrinsic evidence pertaining to the dealer agreements whether the dealers claims were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations and whether the district court should have admitted the testimony of the dealers expert witness.
class certification 
exxon argues that the district court erroneously certified and tried this case as a class action pursuant to rule b.exxon maintains that as a result of this improper certification,each dealer claim and exxon affirmative defenses were resolved on the basis of a single set of facts,ignoring the unique factual and legal issues relevant to the claims of each individual class member.
we review the district court grant of class certification for an abuse of discretion.andrews am,cir.a class action may be maintained only when it satisfies all the requirements of.a and at least one of the alternative requirements of rule b.rutstein avis,cir internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied sub nom.zeirei agudath isr.bookstore,d.the district court certified this class under rule b,which requires that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.b.
t o determine whether common questions predominate,we are called upon to examine the cause of action asserted in the complaint on behalf of the putative class.rutstein,at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.the common issues among the class in this case were whether the dfc program imposed an obligation on exxon to reduce wholesale prices whether exxon breached that obligation when it failed to continue providing the offset to the dealers and whether exxon fraudulently concealed that breach.if these issues were subject to generalized proof and predominated over the individual issues raised by exxon affirmative defenses,class certification was proper.see in re vitamins antitrust,i n general,predominance is met when there exists generalized evidence which proves or disproves an element on a simultaneous,basis,since such proof obviates the need to examine each class members individual position internal quotation marks omitted.
contrary to exxon argument,we do not believe that this case is one where initial determinations,such as the issue of liability vel non,turn upon highly individualized facts.rutstein,at internal quotation marks omitted.exxon primary argument in support of its contention that the class should not have been certified is that there were individual issues inherent in each dealer breach of contract claim and its own affirmative defenses.we find that exxon argument that each breach of contract claim raised an individual issue is without merit.because all of the dealer agreements were materially similar and exxon purported to reduce the price of wholesale gas for all dealers,the duty of good faith was an obligation that it owed to the dealers as a whole.whether it breached that obligation was a question common to the class and the issue of liability was appropriately determined on a basis.
thus,the real question for the district court was whether the common issue of liability predominated over the individual issues raised by exxon affirmative defenses,which pertained primarily to the issue of damages rather than liability.in similar situations,numerous courts have recognized that the presence of individualized damages issues does not prevent a finding that the common issues in the case predominate.see in re visa antitrust,cir common issues may predominate when liability can be determined on a basis,even when there are some individualized damage issues,cert.denied sub nom.visa stores,d bertulli indep.ass of cont l pilots,cir although calculating damages will require some individualized determinations,it appears that virtually every issue prior to damages is a common issue tayloe,at i n the event of a finding of liability,damages might have to be established on an individual basis.this fact alone,however,does not preclude class action treatment.we agree.based upon the facts of this case,we believe that exxon liability to the class for breach of the dealer agreements predominated over the individual issues relating to damages.thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion in certifying the class.
extrinsic evidence 
exxon argues that the district court impermissibly allowed the jury to consider extrinsic evidence in determining whether exxon breached its obligations under the dealer agreements.
what a contract provision means,or whether it is ambiguous,are questions of law,which we review de novo.reynolds roberts,cir.generally,parol evidence is admissible to prove the elements of an agreement only where a writing is ambiguous on its face or fails to contain the elements of a complete contract,invs.agencies bah.panelfab int l,cir.under the uniform commercial code ucc,however,extrinsic evidence of the parties course of dealing or usage of trade or course of performance may be used to explain or supplement the writing.a.the ucc therefore rejects the common law rule that parol evidence is admissible only where the terms of a contract are ambiguous.see id,cmt.c see also columbia nitrogen royster,cir recognizing that the ucc changed the common law rule that extrinsic evidence may not be received to explain or supplement a written contract unless the court finds the writing is ambiguous.
in this case,the district court determined that because exxon was accused of breaching its contractual duty of good faith in setting its wholesale prices,evidence pertaining to exxon adoption and implementation of the dfc program,the unilateral amendment of its dealers credit card agreements,its official public explanation of its performance obligation and its claimed history of meeting its performance obligations to its dealers was relevant evidence of the manner in which exxon set its prices during the period in which the dfc program was in effect.allapattah,exxon,d.the court thus believed that such evidence would assist the jury in determining whether exxon breached its duty under the dealer agreements.we agree and conclude that the district court correctly determined that the dealers could use extrinsic evidence to explain the nature of exxon good faith obligation to the dealers 
statutes of limitations 
exxon contends that the district court erred when it found that,with the exception of the ohio dealers,none of the dealers claims were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations exxon posits that most jurisdictions required that a breach of contract action be brought within four years of the breach and that most of the dealers claims occurring prior to may of were barred,because the dealers did not file suit until may of.the dealers,however,allege that the statutes of limitations were tolled,because exxon fraudulently concealed its breach.
the district court determined that whether exxon fraudulently concealed its breach was a question of fact for the jury.after the jury returned its verdict,in which it found that exxon fraudulently concealed its breach,exxon filed a motion for a judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,a motion for a new trial based in part upon its contention that the dealers did not prove the elements of fraudulent concealment.the court,however,found that the dealers presented clear and convincing evidence that exxon fraudulently concealed its breach and denied the motion.
a district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law is reviewed by this court de novo.brough imperial sterling,cir.the motion should be granted only if there was no legally sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to find in favor of the nonmoving party.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
after a careful review of the record,we believe that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support the jury finding that exxon fraudulently concealed its breach of the dealer agreements.the dealers presented evidence that each year,at annual meetings between exxon executives and dealer representatives,the executives told the dealers that the dfc offset still was being provided even though the executives knew otherwise.although these statements were not made to each individual dealer,they were made to the dealer representatives who in turn were asked to report to their constituent dealers what was discussed at the meetings.exxon argues that the dealers presented no evidence at trial that the representatives actually did report back to their constituent dealers,but two exxon executives testified that the minutes of each annual meeting were sent to each dealer representative with the intention that they then be mailed to each individual dealer.this evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that the exxon executives statements regarding the dfc program were disseminated among the dealers and that the dealers relied upon those representations.
because we find that there was a legally sufficient basis for finding that exxon fraudulently concealed its breach,thereby tolling the statutes of limitations,we conclude that exxon was not entitled to a judgment as a matter of law or a new trial upon that basis 
expert testimony 
exxon argues that the district court erred in admitting the testimony of raymond fishe,the dealers expert witness,because he had no specialized knowledge of pricing systems in the petroleum industry and his methodology was flawed.
we review a trial court evidentiary rulings on the admission of expert witness testimony for abuse of discretion.toole baxter healthcare,cir.the district court conducted an extensive hearing pursuant to daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d.after the hearing,at which the court heard testimony from both parties expert witnesses,it entered a lengthy order determining that both parties expert witnesses were qualified to testify the methodologies of both experts were sufficiently reliable and the experts would assist the jury in understanding the issues at trial.based upon these determinations,the court concluded that each expert met the requirements of daubert and federal rule of evidence.
given the district court exhaustive effort in determining that fishe methodology was reliable,we do not believe that it abused its discretion in allowing him to testify at trial where exxon was able to him fully and refute his testimony through the use of its own expert witness.
conclusion 
thus,we join with the fifth,seventh,ninth,and fourth circuits in ruling that authorizes the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction in a diversity class action over claims that do not meet the minimum amount in controversy requirement,overruling the supreme court holding in zahn.it therefore was appropriate for the district court to exercise jurisdiction over the claims of those class members whose claims did not meet the minimum amount in controversy requirement.we further find that the district court did not err in denying the dealers motion for entry of an aggregate final judgment and devising an appropriate procedure for the administration of each dealer claim.with respect to each of the remaining issues raised by the parties,we find no reversible error.accordingly,we affirm.
a detailed summary of the facts underlying the dealers suit is set forth in allapattah services,exxon,d.
we have raised this question before,but never answered it.in cohen office depot,cir,we declined to address the plaintiff argument that overrules zahn,because no member of the class ha d an individual claim that satisfie d the requisite amount in controversy.shortly thereafter,in morrison allstate indemnity,cir,we concluded that it was premature to address the question,because the named plaintiffs had not had an opportunity to establish that their claims met the jurisdictional minimum amount in controversy.we therefore remanded the case with instructions that the district cou
