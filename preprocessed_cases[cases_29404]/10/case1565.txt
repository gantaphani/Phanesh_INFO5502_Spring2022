petitioner roman luckey brought a putative class action against real parties in interest cotton on usa,and cotton on clothing pty collectively cotton on for violations of the federal fair and accurate credit transactions act facta.prior to class certification,luckey and cotton on mediated their dispute and reached a class settlement agreement.pursuant to the settlement agreement,luckey and cotton on stipulated to the appointment of a temporary judge for the purpose of ruling on the motions for preliminary and final approval of the settlement.this stipulation was presented to respondent superior court of california,county of los angeles superior court,which declined to appoint the temporary judge,on the basis that counsel for luckey had no authority to sign the stipulation on behalf of the absent putative class members.luckey filed a petition for writ of mandate,challenging this ruling.we conclude that the california constitution,the california rules of court,and public policy concerns all preclude the appointment of a temporary judge for purposes of approving the settlement of a class action.when the class has not yet been certified,the putative class representative has no authority to consent to a temporary judge on behalf of the absent putative class members we therefore deny the writ petition.
factual and procedural background 
allegations of the complaint 
on may,luckey filed the instant action in superior court the operative complaint is the first amended complaint,filed september.under facta,it is prohibited for a person accepting credit or debit cards for the transaction of business to print more than the last digits of the card number or the expiration date on an electronically printed receipt provided to the cardholder at the point of the transaction.g.any person who willfully fails to comply with this requirement is liable to the consumer for actual damages of not less than and not more than,as well as punitive damages and reasonable attorney fees.a.luckey alleged that,on april,he made a credit card purchase at a cotton on store,and received an electronically printed receipt that showed the first four and last four digits of his credit card number as well as the card expiration date.luckey alleged,on information and belief,that cotton on stores across the county similarly electronically print eight digits of purchasers credit card numbers and expiration dates upon their receipts.luckey alleged that cotton on knew or should have known of the facta requirements.the operative complaint alleged causes of action for violation of facta,negligence,and declaratory relief.
luckey sought to proceed in a class action,defining the putative class as all individuals who purchased merchandise using a personal credit card or personal debit card at any retail store operated by defendant within the united states during the class period who subclass a were issued an electronically printed receipt that reflected more than the last five digits of the card subclass b were issued an electronically printed receipt that reflected the card expiration date luckey sought,on behalf of the class,damages of between and for each receipt which violated facta with separate damages for each violation,punitive damages,and reasonable attorney fees.luckey also sought an order declaring that cotton on credit and debit card receipt practices violate facta and an order enjoining cotton on from continuing to do so.
we take judicial notice of the superior court docket sheet.no responsive pleading was filed.the only other documents filed in this case consisted of stipulations for continuance of the initial status conference,and the stipulation for appointment of a temporary judge which is at issue in this writ proceeding.luckey represents that,from the time the complaint was filed,the parties engaged in informal discovery and exchanged information in preparation for a mediation held on october.
the settlement 
the mediation was held before a retired superior court judge.a settlement was reached at the mediation,and memorialized in a written settlement agreement it is a class settlement,defining the settlement class as all individuals who purchased merchandise using a personal credit card or personal debit card at any retail store operated by cotton on within the united states since may,who were issued an electronically printed receipt that reflected more than the last five digits of the card were issued an electronically printed receipt that reflected the card expiration date.it excludes persons who validly opt out of the class.
under the terms of the settlement,the class is to receive compensation in the form of merchandise credits,although the term is something of a misnomer.the compensation consists of a credit on a transaction at or exceeding at one of cotton on retail stores,during one week the credits will apply to every transaction in excess of,exclusive of tax,during this seven day period.only one credit will be provided per transaction or per customer.in other words,each person buying something in excess of at cotton on,during the designated week,will receive a discount regardless of whether that person is a member of the class.moreover,each such shopper will receive a single discount,regardless of how many facta violations cotton on may have committed against that person.we refer to this compensation as the off sale.notice is to be provided to the class by means of notice to be provided to all cotton on customers in the united states for whom cotton on possesses a valid address.notice would also be given on cotton on website and near each of its retail stores cash registers.class members would be given an opportunity to opt out of the class by means of a written request for exclusion.if class members sought to object to the settlement,they could do so by means of filing signed,written objection s.the notice to be sent to the class,attached as an exhibit to the settlement agreement,provided that objecting class members could attend the final fairness hearing and request to be heard,but explained,if you submit a written objection,you do not have to come to court to talk about it.as long as you submitted your written objection on time,the court will consider it.
cotton on agreed to fund the settlement in the amount of.of that amount,the parties agreed that luckey counsel could seek an award of attorney fees and costs in an amount of.the parties also agreed that luckey himself could receive a payment of as class representative,and that would be allocated to the administrative costs of the settlement.
in short,luckey and cotton on agreed to settle cotton on liability to the nationwide class in exchange for paid to luckey whereas each class member would receive,at most,a merchandise credit for one of that amount paid to luckey counsel for work which,to that point,consisted of filing a complaint and amended complaint,and preparing for and attending a mediation and a off sale of which cotton on would send notice to its customer list.the parties also agreed to a stipulated injunction enjoining cotton on from including on its receipts either the cards expiration dates or more than the last five digits of the cards numbers,although the settlement agreement provides no time frame for when cotton on would comply with this requirement.pursuant to the settlement agreement,cotton on would be released from any liability to the class for the facta violations alleged in luckey complaint.
in the settlement agreement,the parties agreed to stipulate,for the purposes of settlement only,to provisional certification of the class.the parties also agreed to stipulate to the appointment of a temporary judge for purposes of ruling on the motions for preliminary approval and final approval to facilitate the expeditious resolution of these motions 
the stipulation for appointment of a temporary judge 
pursuant to the settlement agreement,the parties stipulated for appointment of a temporary judge to hear the matter until final determination thereof.specifically,the parties intended to submit to the temporary judge the issues related to preliminary and final approval of the class action settlement.the same retired judge who had served as the mediator in this matter was identified by the parties as the proposed temporary judge the temporary judge would be privately compensated by the parties 
the stipulation was presented to the supervising judge of the civil division,as required by the superior court of los angeles county,local rules,rule a.on june,the court issued a minute order declining to approve the stipulation.the court analysis explained that,although luckey counsel could stipulate to the appointment of the temporary judge on behalf of luckey,the submitted papers do not demonstrate that the named plaintiffs or the attorneys are authorized to speak for all class members.without the stipulation of all putative class members,the case could not be transferred to a temporary judge 
the instant writ proceeding 
on january,luckey filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the trial court order denying approval of the stipulation.on february,real party in interest cotton on filed a statement of.we issued an order to show cause and requested a response from the superior court.the response was filed and luckey filed a reply,arguing,among other things,that the superior court lacked standing to file a brief in response to the writ petition 
contentions of the parties 
preliminarily,we address,and reject,luckey contention that respondent superior court lacked authority to file a response in this matter.we then turn to the main issue raised by this writ petition whether,in a putative class action,settled prior to certification,counsel for the named plaintiff has the authority to enter into a stipulation,on behalf of the class,for the matters relating to settlement approval to be heard before a temporary judge.we conclude that counsel does not have this authority,and therefore deny the petition.
discussion 
class action settlement approval procedures 
before we can address any of the issues raised by this writ proceeding,a discussion of the relevant class action procedures is helpful.
section of the code of civil procedure authorizes class suits in california when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court.the burden is on the party seeking certification to establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members.citation.citation.global minerals metals superior court th.the community of interest requirement for class certification embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.ibid.a proponent of class certification must also demonstrate that the proposed class is manageable.ibid.
in moving for class certification,t he parties should endeavor to resolve any uncontroverted issues by written stipulation before the hearing.if all class issues are resolved by stipulation of the named parties and approved by the court before the hearing,no hearing on class certification is necessary.cal.rules of court,rule e.
as a general rule,settlement of a class action requires the approval of the court after a hearing.cal.rules of court,rule a.this is in order to prevent fraud,collusion or unfairness to the class.dunk ford motor th.the court must determine the settlement is fair,adequate,and reasonable.citations.the purpose of the requirement is the protection of those class members,including the named plaintiffs,whose rights may not have been given due regard by the negotiating parties.citation.id.at,fn.omitted.
california rules of court,rule sets forth the procedure to be followed when a class action is provisionally settled prior to class certification.in that case,certification and settlement approval occur simultaneously.first,a party to the settlement moves for preliminary approval of the settlement.cal.rules of court,rule c.after the hearing,the court makes an order approving or denying certification of a provisional settlement class.cal.rules of court,rule d.if the court grants preliminary approval,it must set a final approval hearing,and provide for notice to be given to the class.cal.rules of court,rule e.the notice must contain an explanation of the proposed settlement and procedures for class members to follow in filing written objections to it and in arranging to appear at the settlement hearing and state any objections to the proposed settlement.cal.rules of court,rule f.at the final approval hearing,the court must conduct an inquiry into the fairness of the proposed settlement.cal.rules of court,rule g.if the court approves the settlement agreement,it enters judgment accordingly.cal.rules of court,rule h.
because a court evaluating certification of a class action which settled prior to certification is considering certification only in the context of settlement,the court evaluation of the certification issues is somewhat different from its consideration of certification issues when the class action has not yet settled.in some ways,the court review of certification of a class is lessened as no trial is anticipated in a class case,the case management issues inherent in the ascertainable class determination need not be confronted.global minerals metals superior court,supra,th at.however,other certification issues,those designed to protect absentees by blocking unwarranted or overbroad class definitions require heightened scrutiny in the class context for a court asked to certify a settlement class will lack the opportunity,present when a case is litigated,to adjust the class,informed by the proceedings as they unfold.amchem products,windsor.
moreover,class action settlements should be scrutinized more carefully if there has been no adversary certification.dunk ford motor,supra,th at,fn,italics added see also eleven owners for fair franchising southland th.this reflects concerns that the absent class members,whose rights may not have been considered by the negotiating parties,be adequately protected against fraud and collusion.wershba apple computer,th.t hese concerns are satisfied by a careful fairness review of the settlement by the trial court.ibid.
as we are concerned in this case with the process of the fairness determination,and not the fairness determination itself,we need not address the factors to be considered in such a determination ultimately,in the final analysis it is the court that bears the responsibility to ensure that the recovery represents a reasonable compromise,given the magnitude and apparent merit of the claims being released,discounted by the risks and expenses of attempting to establish and collect on those claims by pursuing the litigation.the court has a fiduciary responsibility as guardians of the rights of the absentee class members when deciding whether to approve a settlement agreement.citation.munoz bci coca cola bottling of los angeles,supra,th at,fn.
the superior court properly filed a responsive brief 
we now turn to luckey challenge to the superior court appearance in this writ proceeding.luckey contends that the superior court lacks standing to file a responsive brief.
the superior court is a party in an original mandate proceeding before this court superior court is named as the respondent.as such,proof of service must be served upon it,and it is authorized by statute to file points and authorities in opposition.citation.james superior court th.this notwithstanding,california case law provides that a trial court may not initiate writ proceedings and may appear to defend itself in a writ proceeding only in a limited number of circumstances.ibid.such limitations are imposed for two reasons first,the trial court is generally a neutral party and must remain impartial and second,it is generally the real party in interest,not the court,that has the beneficial interest in the litigation and is therefore the aggrieved party.id.at.
the mere fact that the real party in interest does not oppose a writ petition is not,standing alone,sufficient to justify the trial court in assuming an advocacy position in the court of appeal.ng superior court th,disapproved on another ground in curle superior court cal th.lower courts may appear to defend their actions on appeal when the real party in interest does not appear and the issue involved directly impacts the operations and procedures of the court,or potentially imposes financial obligations which would directly affect the court operations.ibid.additionally,a trial court can be permitted to appear on appeal when,due to unique circumstances,the real party in interest can not meaningfully oppose the petition.james superior court,supra,at real party in interest could not oppose the petition because the proceedings in question were confidential.when a potentially adverse act occurred and no party other than the superior court can adequately defend or explain the act,the superior court appearance is essential for meaningful appellate review.ibid.
in this case,luckey suggests that the superior court lacked standing to oppose his writ petition because the superior court has presented no evidence that the issues presented impact the operations or procedures of the court or that the decision will impose any financial obligations on the court operations.the argument is puzzling given the arguments luckey makes in support of his petition.first,luckey argues that he is,in fact,challenging a procedure of the court,not merely an isolated ruling luckey represents that the superior court previously routinely issued orders appointing temporary judges to preside over class action matters,but,in or around november,the court stopped approving those stipulations and began denying them.second,luckey argues at length,although without evidentiary basis,that the court financial obligations are,in fact,at issue.luckey argues that lengthy delays are now the reality in class action litigation,and that parties should be permitted to avoid these delays by the use of temporary judges a procedure which,according to luckey,would alleviate space for other litigants at superior court.indeed,luckey represents that the superior court previously appointed temporary judges to serve in class action matters in part due to congested and backlogged dockets.as the superior court procedures and financial obligations are at issue,the superior court has a right to appear.
moreover,due to the unique procedural circumstances of the case,the superior court is the only party in a position to defend the ruling below.at the heart of this case is a class action settlement reached by the named plaintiff and the defendant.a determination will have to be made as to whether that settlement is fair and reasonable to the absent class members we are called upon to determine whether a temporary judge can make that determination.while the named plaintiff and the defendant may agree that a temporary judge is appropriate,absent class members may not agree.the superior court denied approval of the stipulation for this very reason the court was concerned that there was no agreement by the absent class members.but,by the very nature of the procedural history of this case the class has not yet been certified no absent class member has notice of this writ petition and can appear to defend his or her right to have the reasonableness of the settlement agreement determined by a trial court judge.as such,the superior court is the only party who can appear and represent the interest of the absent class members its appearance is therefore essential for meaningful appellate review.
finally,if we are mistaken in the above analysis and the superior court lacks standing to appear,we will simply consider the superior court brief as an amicus brief.entente design,superior court th,fn.zilog,superior court th,fn.
the trial court did not err in denying approval of the stipulation to a temporary judge 
the main issue presented by this writ petition is whether the trial court erred in denying approval of the stipulation to a temporary judge in this settlement class action.specifically,the named plaintiff and the defendant sought to stipulate to a temporary judge for resolution of the certification and settlement approval issues which would be considered at the preliminary and final approval hearings.the trial court denied approval on the basis that the absent class members had not joined in the stipulation.in order to review the propriety of this order,we will consider the constitutional provision providing for the use of temporary judges the applicable rules of court and public policy concerns.we will conclude that each of these sources of authority supports the trial court ruling.
a.the constitution 
the judicial power of the state is vested in the supreme court,courts of appeal,superior courts,municipal courts,and justice courts.citations.the california constitution provides that the governor appoints superior court judges when there are vacancies,but that after appointment,on completion of the term,superior court judges must sit for nonpartisan election.citations.it also provides for qualifications citation,a term citation,and limited grounds for removal citation.in re horton cal d.since,our constitution has contemplated the use of court commissioners to perform chamber business citations,now referred to as subordinate judicial duties.citations.in addition,since,our constitution has permitted a cause to be tried in the superior court by a temporary judge.citations.id.at.
california constitution,article vi,section provides,on stipulation of the parties litigant the court may order a cause to be tried by a temporary judge who is a member of the state bar,sworn and empowered to act until final determination of the cause.the delegation of judicial power is constitutionally limited and can only be effected by a stipulation of the parties litigant.citation.in the absence of the parties consent,the constitution only allows the delegation of the performance of subordinate judicial duties,which do not include deciding questions of law.citation.kim superior court th.absent a valid stipulation,a temporary judge has no jurisdiction to act and any actions purportedly taken are therefore void.del real city of riverside th.
in this case,counsel for luckey attempted to enter into the stipulation for a temporary judge on behalf of the entire putative class.this case,therefore,raises the issue whether absent class members in a class are considered parties litigant,within the meaning of california constitution,article vi,section,who must stipulate to the temporary judge in order for such a stipulation to be effective.
a similar issue was considered by our supreme court in estate of kent cal d,which decided the issue of whether individuals and entities heirs,devisees,and creditors in a probate action who had been given notice but failed to appear were required to join in a stipulation to a temporary judge in order for that stipulation to be effective.the court first considered which individuals and entities are considered parties in a probate proceeding id.at and then considered the further meaning of parties litigant id.at.
the court first concluded that,in a probate matter,many individuals and entities must be given notice,and have the right to appear and become parties in the action.if,however,they fail to appear in the action,they can not be considered parties.id.at.as to the issue of parties litigant,the court stated under the customary rules of constitutional interpretation each word should be given some value.in the constitutional provision the word litigant qualifies the word parties and the two words must be given some value beyond the one word parties.obviously the phrase parties litigant means the parties who are taking part in the litigation,those who have appeared therein.there are many causes at law and in equity where the rights of parties are determined although the parties themselves do not conduct the litigation.these actions,where contested,proceed under the direction of parties to the controversy who have appeared who are parties litigant.at the same time the proceeding determines the rights of other parties in interest but not litigant.among such cases are receiverships,representative suits,actions by and against trustees,and,assuming that nonappearing heirs and devisees and creditors are parties,then the several proceedings in probate.estate of kent,supra,cal d at.active parties to the litigation may bind passive parties by stipulation.id.at.
the law is clear,however,that in order for passive parties to be bound,they must have had notice and chosen not to appear or otherwise litigate.it has repeatedly been held that the term parties litigant means the parties who are taking part in the litigation,those who have appeared therein.citation.a party who has notice of a proceeding but fails to appear or otherwise take part loses the status of party litigant.citation.reisman shahverdian d.party litigant status can be lost by a party who fails to appear at trial despite receipt of proper notice.id.at.
an application of the estate of kent analysis to the instant case is complicated by the fact that,in a class action context,whether class members are considered parties is not a question easily answered.in earley superior court th,we explained that a bsent class members may be parties for certain purposes,but for other purposes they are not.id.at,fn.what is clear,however,is that absent class members in a class those who have received notice and elected not to appear or opt out are not parties litigant.in such a situation,the court has made a finding that the named plaintiff can adequately represent the absent class members,and the absent class members,by declining to intervene or opt out,have impliedly consented to be represented by the named plaintiff.a class action is a representative action in which the class representatives assume a fiduciary responsibility to prosecute the action on behalf of the absent parties.citation.the representative parties not only make the decision to bring the case in the first place,but even after class certification and notice,they are the ones responsible for trying the case,appearing in court,and working with class counsel on behalf of absent members.id.at.
we,however,do not have such a circumstance before us in this case.no class has been certified no notice has been given absent class members no absent class members have been given the opportunity to appear.after the members of the class have been properly notified of the action,they are required to decide whether to remain members of the class represented by plaintiffs counsel and become bound by a favorable or unfavorable judgment in the action,whether to intervene in the action through counsel of their own choosing,or whether to opt out of the action and pursue their own independent remedies,such as negotiation with defendants,initiation of their own action,or intervention in some other action.citations.carter city of los angeles th.none of this has yet occurred in the instant action.some members of the putative class,upon receiving notice,may choose to intervene in the action and become parties litigant.other members of the putative class,upon receiving notice,may choose to opt out.at this stage of the proceeding,it is simply unknown which members of the putative class will choose to become parties litigant,which members will choose to opt out,and which members will choose to be absent class members bound by the actions taken by class counsel.any identification of the parties litigant in this case is,therefore,premature.when notice has not yet been given to the putative class members,it can not be determined who will be the parties litigant.
thus,we conclude that,while luckey and cotton on were the only parties litigant at the time of the stipulation to the temporary judge,they were also the only parties who could be bound by such a stipulation.as the conceded purpose of the stipulation was to bind all putative class members to the stipulation and they could not be bound until they had been given notice and an opportunity to appear,the stipulation was ineffective.the state constitution provides that,for a stipulation to a temporary judge to be effective,that stipulation must be made by the parties litigant.in a class action,the parties litigant have not yet been identified thus,no such stipulation can be effectively made 
b.the applicable rules of court 
our consideration of the applicable rules of court leads us to the same conclusion.california rules of court,rule b governs requests to intervene in matters pending before temporary judges.it states,in pertinent part,a motion for leave to file a complaint for intervention in a case pending before a temporary judge requested by the parties must be filed with the court and served on all parties and the temporary judge.the motion must be heard by the trial court judge to whom the case is assigned or,if the case has not been assigned,by the presiding judge or his or her designee.if intervention is allowed,the case must be returned to the trial court docket unless all parties stipulate to proceed before the temporary judge.in other words,when a party seeks to intervene in a matter pending before a temporary judge,that party right to intervene must be determined by the trial court,not the temporary judge.furthermore,if intervention is permitted,the case must be returned to trial court unless the intervenor also agrees to the temporary judge.
as we have discussed above,a class member receiving notice of a class action can choose to intervene in the action.moreover,i n the context of a class settlement,objecting is the procedural equivalent of intervening.wershba apple computer,supra,th at.as such,in the context of a class settlement,if a class member seeks to object,the class member has the right to have his or her objection heard before the trial judge,unless that class member specifically stipulates to the temporary judge hearing the matter.as class member objections to the settlement are heard at the final approval hearing,it would be a useless act for a named plaintiff and class action defendant to stipulate to a temporary judge to preside over the final approval hearing at least until such time as it has been determined that there will be no class member objections 
indeed,because the presence of intervenors requires a matter before a temporary judge to be returned to the trial court,the superior court has established a local rule indicating that when parties stipulate to a temporary judge,the parties and their attorneys represent that they are the only parties to the case,and no new parties will be added.super.county,local rules,rule g.in a class action,no party could honestly make such a representation,as it is unknown which,if any,class members will chose to intervene once the class is certified and notice is given to the class members 
therefore,california rules of court,rule b and superior court,local rules,rule g both lead to the conclusion that,in a class,there can be no stipulation to a temporary judge which can bind the absent class members 
public policy concerns 
finally,we consider the impact of public policy concerns.first,we examine the public policy issues raised by the unique context of a settlement class.second,we consider policy arguments regarding due process protections.third,we consider policy arguments regarding the constitutional right to choose a temporary judge.fourth and finally,we discuss luckey argument regarding the policy in favor of allowing parties to resolve their disputes as they wish.
first,we again note the procedural posture of the case at the time of the stipulation.luckey and cotton on had reached a settlement of the putative class action.they sought appointment of a temporary judge to preside over the preliminary and final approval hearings,at which class certification issues and the fairness of the settlement would be considered.in the context of settlement,both of these determinations require the trial court to exercise heightened scrutiny to protect the interests of absent class members.in its certification inquiry,the court is required to ensure that the class definition is not unwarranted or overbroad.in its fairness inquiry,the court must be vigilant against fraud and collusion.the court is,in short,acting in a fiduciary capacity as guardian of the rights of absentee class members.luckey would have the court delegate this fiduciary responsibility to a temporary judge of luckey selection,purely on luckey agreement that this is acceptable.but the trial court should not be required to yield its fiduciary responsibility to any member of the state bar so quickly.we do not,by this opinion,mean to impugn the qualifications or good faith of the parties chosen temporary judge in this case.however,just because the parties may have chosen a qualified temporary judge in the instant action does not mean that a trial court should be required to cease protecting the interests of absent class members on nothing more than the mere request of the named plaintiff.
second,luckey argues that,if the stipulation to the temporary judge is approved,the class members will suffer no deprivation of their due process rights because all statutes,rules of court,rules of judicial ethics,and case law remain applicable to the proceedings before a temporary judge.yet this argument proves too much if there is no deprivation of rights worked by proceeding before a temporary judge,parties could be ordered to proceed before a temporary judge in the absence of a stipulation,and,indeed,against their will.this is clearly not the case our constitution requires a stipulation before a matter can be heard before a temporary judge because the parties have a right to have their dispute heard before a duly appointed judge.absent class members can not be deprived of their constitutional right to have their class rights determined by a duly appointed judge without,at the very least,a certification order,notice,and the opportunity to appear 
third,luckey argues that absent the relief requested herein,petitioners will be deprived of their constitutional right to have their case resolved by a privately compensated judge.on the contrary,if luckey and cotton on wish to resolve their dispute by a privately compensated temporary judge,they are free to do so.however,if they wish to resolve the dispute between the entire putative class and cotton on,they can not do so in the absence of a certification order and notice to the class it is the putative class that is at risk of losing its constitutional right,not luckey.
fourth,luckey argues that,based on neary regents of university of california cal th neary,the policy of california courts is to respect the parties decisions regarding how they would like their litigation to proceed.it is true that,as a general rule,t he courts exist for litigants.litigants do not exist for courts.id.at.therefore,when the parties seek to resolve their disputes amicably,the courts should respect the parties choice and assist them in settlement.ibid.this does not mean,however,that when the named parties seek to agree to a temporary judge on behalf of a settlement class,the courts must approve the agreement.unlike neary,this is not an ordinary civil action.consumer advocacy group,kintetsu enterprises of america th,distinguishing the policy in neary in a proposition case,because the public interest is implicated in the latter.the interests of unnamed class members are present in this case,and the courts can not permit their respect for the litigants rights to agree on how to resolve their dispute to outweigh the court responsibility to protect the rights of absent class members.
disposition 
the writ petition is denied.
this is not to say that,following class certification,the class representative has authority to consent to a temporary judge on behalf of absent class members.that issue is not before this court,and we express no opinion on it.see also,fns.and,post.
luckey defines the class period as beginning five years prior to the date of the filing of the complaint.as the complaint was filed may,the class period would begin in may.facta provides something of a safe harbor ending june,any person who printed a credit card expiration date on a receipt provided to a consumer cardholder prior to june,but who otherwise complied with facta,is not considered to be in willful noncompliance by reason of printing the expiration date.d.luckey alleges that the safe harbor does not apply even to the transactions at issue prior to june,as cotton on allegedly printed both expiration dates and eight digits of the credit card numbers on its receipts throughout the class period.
the copy of the settlement agreement provided as part of the record in the instant writ petition is not executed.luckey represents,with the purported consent of counsel for cotton on,that it is the final version of the settlement agreement with all terms agreed upon and finalized,although not fully executed.
the parties have not yet agreed upon the particular week apparently,they want to select a week which will be far enough in the future that the settlement will receive final approval before the week occurs.
this is represented to be people.
as luckey did not allege any actual damages,if he successfully prosecuted the facta action to completion,he would be entitled to,at the very most,in statutory damages,unless he could establish a right to punitive damages.
we note that,while the off credit would apply to any and all merchandise,including merchandise already offered at a discounted sale price or other promotional price,there is nothing in the settlement agreement indicating that the off sale must be in addition to,and not in lieu of,any other sale cotton on would normally schedule.
we asked the parties to brief whether there are any ethical issues raised by having the same individual who mediated a settlement agreement act as a temporary judge in the matter.as we shall discuss,we have substantial concerns regarding the propriety of such an arrangement see fn,post,although this is not the basis for our holding in this matter.
there is some ambiguity as to which party would compensate the temporary judge.the parties stipulation provides that the temporary judge shall be paid a flat fee of plus case management fees.it further provides that the compensation of the temporary judge shall be part of taxable costs herein,and shall be split equally into two payments between plaintiffs and defendants.however,the stipulation also provides that plaintiffs shall bear and pay all taxable costs herein for the compensation to the t emporary j udge thereafter,the same document provides that t he compensation of the t emporary j udge shall be allocated by the t emporary j udge as a part of the judgment herein.
the court order stated,if the named parties so desire,they may file a noticed motion seeking to have this court to sign the stipulation,with appropriate citation to any authorities in conflict with the court analysis.the parties did not do so.
cotton on filed a continued statement of to the writ petition.
luckey notes that class certification may be resolved by stipulation of the named parties.we emphasize that,pursuant to california rules of court,rule e,a stipulation regarding class certification must be approved by the court in order to foreclose a hearing on certification.
the trial court has broad discretion to determine whether the settlement is fair.citation.it should consider relevant factors,such as the strength of plaintiffs case,the risk,expense,complexity and likely duration of further litigation,the risk of maintaining class action status through trial,the amount offered in settlement,the extent of discovery completed and the stage of the proceedings,the experience and views of counsel,the presence of a governmental participant,and the reaction of the class members to the proposed settlement.citation.the list of factors is not exhaustive and should be tailored to each case.due regard should be given to what is otherwise a private consensual agreement between the parties.dunk ford motor,supra,th at.the dunk court concluded that a presumption of fairness arises where the settlement is reached through arm length bargaining investigation and discovery are sufficient to allow the court and counsel to act intelligently counsel is experienced in similar litigation and the percentage of objectors is small.id.at.later authority
