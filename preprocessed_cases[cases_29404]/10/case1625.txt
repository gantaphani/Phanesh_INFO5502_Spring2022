introduction 
this is a class action brought by plaintiff and appellant luis gutierrez on behalf of himself and all other persons who were represented by defendants and respondents thomas girardi and his law firm girardi keese collectively g k in a previous lawsuit by employees of lockheed corporation lockheed against lockheed and other defendants lockheed action.gutierrez appeals from a judgment following an order granting g k motion for summary judgment.
over a period of about years,g k negotiated settlements with most of the defendants in the lockheed action on behalf of gutierrez and other plaintiffs in that action.gutierrez received a series of payments as his share of the settlement proceeds.subsequently,three of the defendants in the lockheed action filed a motion for summary judgment against gutierrez on the ground that his action was barred by the statute of limitations.the motion was granted and judgment was entered in the lockheed action against gutierrez with respect to the defendants.
the gravamen of gutierrez allegations in this action is that g k misappropriated part of the settlement funds paid by the settling defendants for the benefit of gutierrez and other class members.gutierrez asserts causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and money had and received against g 
the trial court granted g k motion for summary judgment on the grounds that gutierrez could not prove the elements of causation and damages in both of his causes of action because his claims against the settling defendants in the lockheed action would have been barred by the statute of limitations had the settling defendants asserted them.in other words,the trial court concluded that because the statute of limitations objectively barred gutierrez causes of action in the lockheed action,as a matter of law he could not prevail in his causes of action against g k.this was error.
in many cases when a client sues his or her attorney for wrongdoing in connection with litigation for breach of fiduciary duty or professional negligence,the merits of the underlying case must be adjudicated.this is because in order to prove the element of causation the client must show that he or she objectively would have obtained a better result in the underlying case in the absence of the attorney breach or negligence.the trial court thus must conduct a trial within a trial of the underlying case.
in this case,by contrast,a trial within a trial is not necessary.this is because the merits of the lockheed action need not be decided in order to determine whether g k alleged misappropriation of the settlement proceeds caused gutierrez damages.g k allegedly misappropriated the settlement proceeds after the settlement agreements were executed.at that point,as to the settling defendants,the case was over.the settling defendants could no longer raise any defenses,including their statute of limitations defense.therefore,if the misappropriation allegations against g k are true,g k conduct caused gutierrez to incur damages regardless of whether the settling defendants could have raised a statute of limitations defense prior to settling the case.
the trial court judgment was based on the erroneous assumption that the settling defendants statute of limitations defense barred gutierrez claim against g k.we reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
gutierrez workers compensation claim 
gutierrez worked for lockheed for over years beginning in.on march,gutierrez filed a workers compensation claim.it alleged that gutierrez suffered injury to his entire body including psyche from stress strain with toxic exposure while working as a flight line mechanic at lockheed.
lockheed action 
on october,gutierrez and numerous other lockheed employees in los angeles county filed a complaint against lockheed and other corporate defendants.the complaint alleged that the plaintiffs sustained personal injuries from their exposure to toxic chemicals while working at lockheed facilities it further alleged that the defendants manufactured,formulated,supplied,distributed or sold the toxic chemicals that caused the plaintiffs injuries.the complaint set forth fraudulent concealment,strict liability and negligence causes of action.
when the complaint in the lockheed action was filed,the attorney for the plaintiffs was timothy larson.at some point during the lockheed action g k became counsel for gutierrez and the other plaintiffs.according to gutierrez,g k did not have a fee agreement with gutierrez in connection with the lockheed action.
between approximately and,the plaintiffs reached general settlements with various defendants the settling defendants in the lockheed action.the settlements totaled approximately million.g k received the settlement funds and controlled all disbursements.from october to february,gutierrez received settlement checks from g k totaling.
on april,three defendants in the lockheed action the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment against gutierrez.that motion argued the statute of limitations barred gutierrez action.
on june,the trial court granted the defendants motion.the court found that gutierrez had inquiry knowledge of his claims against the defendants when he filed his workers compensation claim against lockheed more than a year before the commencement of the lockheed action.accordingly,the court ruled that the statute of limitations barred gutierrez personal injury claims against the defendants and that said defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
gutierrez allegations in this action 
on october,gutierrez commenced this action by filing a complaint against g gutierrez filed a first amended complaint on february,which is the operative pleading in this case.
the first amended complaint states that this is a class action brought by gutierrez on behalf of himself and all other persons who were represented by g k in the lockheed action.it sets forth causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and money had and received.
the first amended complaint does not allege that the amount of the settlement obtained by g k was inadequate.rather,it alleges that g k breached its fiduciary duty and committed other wrongful acts with respect to the handling and distribution of the settlement funds generated in the lockheed action that were owing to gutierrez and other class members by,inter alia,d isbursing withholding from distribution to gutierrez and class members as costs amounts items not properly chargeable as costs d isbursing utilizing gutierrez and class members funds for g k own individual interests without plaintiffs knowledge or consent failing and refusing to promptly disburse to gutierrez and other class members their proportional share of the settlements failing to maintain gutierrez and other class members funds in trust accounts and m anaging gutierrez and class members funds in a way to maximize profits for g k at the expense of said plaintiffs.in total,the first amended complaint alleges,g k received money believed to be in excess of million that was intended to be used for the benefit of gutierrez and other class members.
g k motion for summary judgment 
on september,g k filed a motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication.g k argued that gutierrez could not prove that he sustained damages proximately caused by g k conduct in the lockheed action because gutierrez underlying claims against the settling defendants were time barred.
g k also argued that the doctrine of unclean hands barred gutierrez claims against g k.this argument was based on g k contentions that gutierrez falsely asserted in his workers compensation claim and in the lockheed action that he suffered injuries from exposure to toxic chemicals while working at lockheed,and that gutierrez failed to disclose his claims against g k to the bankruptcy court in his personal bankruptcy case.
on january,the trial court granted g k motion for summary judgment.the court found that gutierrez could not establish the elements of causation or damages because the statute of limitations barred his claims against the settling defendants.in granting the motion,the court relied primarily on slovensky.friedman th slovensky,which we shall discuss in detail post.the court also expressly stated that it did not address the substantive merits of gutierrez underlying claims in the lockheed action or g k unclean hands defense 
on june,the trial court entered judgment in favor of g k and against gutierrez.this appeal followed.
discussion 
a motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.a defendant moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that one or more elements of the cause of action in question can not be established or that there is a complete defense thereto.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,aguilar code civ,subds.o,p.the moving defendant also bears the initial burden of producing evidence to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact.aguilar,at.if the defendant meets his or her burden of production,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to produce evidence showing the existence of a triable issue of material fact.ibid.

g k did not meet its burden of showing that gutierrez can not establish his breach of fiduciary duty cause of action 
the first cause of action in gutierrez first amended complaint is breach of fiduciary duty.the elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty are existence of a fiduciary duty breach of the fiduciary duty and damage proximately caused by the breach.stanley richmond th.
g k concedes that it represented gutierrez in the lockheed action.g k thus owed a fiduciary duty to gutierrez,which included a duty of loyalty.cal pak delivery,united parcel service,th.
with respect to the element of breach,g k argues that gutierrez can not prove g k misappropriated settlement funds because at his deposition,gutierrez testified that there was no written fee agreement between g k and gutierrez.thus,g k contends,gutierrez will never be able to prove that the amount g k allocated towards fees and costs varied with the terms of his fee agreement.
we reject this argument.if there was no written contract between gutierrez and g k,then the agreement between the parties was voidable at gutierrez option,and g k was only entitled to collect a reasonable fee.bus,subd.b,subd.c.further,as a fiduciary,g k was not allowed to deduct unwarranted costs from the settlement proceeds and was required to comply with its ethical obligations regarding client trust accounts.g k thus did not have a carte blanche with respect to attorney fees and costs it deducted from the settlement proceeds merely because there allegedly was no written fee agreement.
moreover,g k did not produce any evidence indicating it did not misappropriate settlement funds as gutierrez alleges.for example,g k did not produce evidence regarding the terms of the agreement s,if any,between g k and its clients in the lockheed action,including gutierrez,the costs and attorney fees deducted by g k from the settlement proceeds,or its calculation of the distribution of settlement funds to the plaintiffs,including gutierrez.g k therefore did not meet its burden of showing that gutierrez can not establish the element of breach.
g k contends that the trial court could not assume that the allegations in gutierrez first amended complaint regarding the element of breach were true because gutierrez did not produce any evidence regarding this element.we agree with g k that a party can not rely on the allegations of his or her own pleadings to make an evidentiary showing in support of or in opposition to a motion for summary judgment.college hosptial superior court cal th,fn.g k,however,did not meet its initial burden of production or its burden of persuasion with respect to the element of breach.gutierrez thus was not required to produce any evidence regarding this element.where,as here,a defendant moving for summary judgment has failed to controvert factual allegations in the complaint,the trial court must deem the allegations true for purposes of the motion.slovensky,supra,th at.
assuming the factual allegations in the first amended complaint are true,the element of breach is satisfied.although the allegations regarding breach are somewhat vague,the first amended complaint essentially alleges that g k misappropriated the settlement funds paid by the settling defendants.if these allegations are true,g k breached its fiduciary duty to gutierrez.see mcknight state bar cal d,misappropriation of client funds breaches the high duty of loyalty owed to the client 
causation and damages 
g k produced evidence that it contends shows gutierrez can not establish the elements of causation and damages,namely evidence indicating that the statute of limitations barred gutierrez causes of action in the lockheed action.to prevail on its motion for summary judgment,g k must show that even if it misappropriated the settlement proceeds in violation of its fiduciary duty,gutierrez can not establish the elements of causation or damages.this g k failed to do.
the unstated assumption in g k argument is that the trial court was required to adjudicate the likelihood that gutierrez would prevail in the underlying case the lockheed action in order to determine whether gutierrez satisfied the elements of causation and damages in his breach of fiduciary duty cause of action against g k.this assumption ostensibly arises out of extensive case law regarding suits by clients against their litigation attorneys,most notably professional malpractice cases.
in a typical professional negligence case against a litigation attorney,a determination of the merits of the underlying lawsuit must be made in order to adjudicate the elements of causation and damages.blanks seyfarth shaw llp th,blanks.the plaintiff is required to prove that but for the defendant misconduct,the plaintiff would have obtained a more favorable judgment or settlement in the action in which the malpractice allegedly occurred.ibid,quoting viner sweet cal th.this method of presenting a legal malpractice lawsuit is commonly called a trial within a trial.it may be complicated,but it avoids speculative and conjectural claims.blanks,at.
the method does not recreate what a particular judge or fact finder would have done.rather,the jury task is to determine what a reasonable judge or fact finder would have done citation.even though should and would are used interchangeably by the courts,the standard remains an objective one.the trier of facts determines what should have been,not what the result would have been,or could have been,or might have been,had the matter been before a particular judge or jury.mattco forge,arthur young th,accord blanks,supra,th at.
the method has been expanded to breach of fiduciary duty cases and was applicable in the two main cases relied on by g k slovensky and loube loube th loube.in slovensky,after settling a toxic mold personal injury action against the owner of an apartment complex,the plaintiff sued her former attorneys for legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty.slovensky,supra,th at.the plaintiff alleged that the defendants negligently failed to obtain an adequate recovery and that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty by misrepresenting and concealing material facts in the course of the litigation.ibid.the statute of limitations on plaintiffs causes of action in the underlying action,however,had run before she consulted the defendants.id.at.
