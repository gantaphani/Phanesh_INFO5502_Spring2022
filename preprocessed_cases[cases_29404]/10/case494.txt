factual background and procedural history 
this litigation arose out of a class action in state court against pba for fraud and consumer protection violations.nationwide had previously issued pba an insurance policy the policy under which nationwide agreed to indemnify and defend pba against various legal claims.nationwide notified pba that the policy did not cover pba for the class action allegations,and nationwide refused to defend or indemnify pba.judgment was entered against pba in the underlying class action.pba filed for bankruptcy,and sikirica,as trustee for pba,sued nationwide in state court for breach of contract and bad faith in failing to defend and indemnify pba.nationwide removed the action to federal court.the district court denied sikirica motion to remand.nationwide moved for judgment on the pleadings.the district court,granting judgment in favor of nationwide,held the bad faith claim was barred by the statute of limitations,and the policy did not cover intentional and fraudulent conduct.sikirica now appeals.
the underlying events occurred in,when victoria cinski went to pba to have her hair colored by a pba student.she signed a release purporting to absolve pba of all liability in exchange for services at a reduced price.the beauty culture act.stat.ann,prohibits cosmetology schools from charging more than the cost of materials when students render the services.cinski was charged,but the cost of the materials was only.she also suffered serious injuries from the hair coloring.

the trial court severed cinski individual claims from the class action claims.nationwide defended pba in the individual action,but denied coverage and defense for the class action in a letter to pba dated february,

please be advised that the firm of reale,fossee and ferry will continue to represent pittsburgh beauty academy under the same reservation outlined in our letter of january,for the remaining allegations pertaining to the individual action of victoria lynn cinski.
the individual action went to trial in.the trial court dismissed cinski utpcpl claim,but allowed the personal injury claims to go to trial she prevailed.on appeal,the pennsylvania superior court reinstated the utpcpl claim because pba overcharged cinski and deliberately misled her as to the reduced price.the superior court held that,the trial court should have awarded appellant under the act for her direct damages from appellee deliberate misrepresentation,but found no fraud,as appellant has not shown proof of reliance or fraud,and the misrepresentation is sic cinski pittsburgh beauty.
the class action subsequently proceeded to trial on three claims alleging fraudulent misrepresentation,unjust enrichment,and violations of the utpcpl.a verdict was entered for the class,and the court awarded to each class member with attorneys fees and costs,a total judgment of approximately.sikirica appealed to the pennsylvania superior court.on march,the superior court affirmed because its prior ruling in cinski individual action,if not the law of the case,is at least res judicata or collateral estoppel as to pba issues in the class action.cinski pittsburgh beauty.
on april,sikirica,as trustee,initiated a state court action against nationwide by writ of summons for its failure to defend and indemnify pba in the class action.the complaint,filed and served on july,set forth six claims.count i alleged bad faith insurance practices under.ann.for nationwide refusal to defend and indemnify pba.counts ii through vi alleged breach of contract for failure to defend and indemnify under five sections of the policy the comprehensive general liability section the personal injury and advertising section the professional liability section the contractual liability section and the comprehensive crime coverage section.
nationwide removed to federal court on july.sikirica,arguing there was no diversity jurisdiction and nationwide did not timely remove,moved for remand to the state court.the district court,ruling that nationwide timely removed within the time period for removal that accrued when sikirica filed the complaint,denied the motion nationwide filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings under.c the district court,adopting the magistrate judge report and recommendation,granted the motion the court found the bad faith claim was barred by the statute of limitations.on the breach of contract claims,the court found nationwide had no duty to defend because the class action complaint alleged only intentional conduct and the policy did not cover intentional misconduct.

iii.discussion 
sikirica motion to remand for untimely removal 
sikirica contends nationwide did not remove to federal court within days of its receipt of service of process as required by b.this argument requires us to determine when the period for removal began.
sikirica demanded in a letter to nationwide dated april.the writ of summons informing nationwide of the parties citizenship was served on nationwide on april.sikirica argues these two documents together constitute sufficient notice of diversity jurisdiction to trigger the period upon service of the writ of summons.if so,removal was untimely because nationwide did not file a petition for removal until july,more than days after the writ of summons was served.
the district court,relying on foster mutual fire,marine inland insurance,cir,held that the letter together with the writ of summons did not constitute notice of diversity jurisdiction.the district court found nationwide did not receive notice of diversity jurisdiction until the complaint was filed and served on july.because the action was removed on july,less than days later,the court held removal was timely and denied sikirica motion to remand.
the question is whether the period under b began when nationwide received the writ of summons or the complaint.section b contains two paragraphs governing when the period begins.the first paragraph provides 
the notice of removal of a civil action or proceeding shall be filed within thirty days after the receipt by the defendant,through service or otherwise,of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief upon which such action or proceeding is based,or within thirty days after the service of summons upon the defendant if such initial pleading has then been filed in court and is not required to be served on the defendant,whichever period is shorter.
b emphasis added.the second paragraph applies only if the initial pleading does not set forth the grounds for removal 
if the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable,a notice of removal may be filed within thirty days after receipt by the defendant,through service or otherwise,of a copy of an amended pleading,motion,order or other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable,except that a case may not be removed on the basis of jurisdiction conferred by section of this title more than year after commencement of the action.
id.emphasis added.
sikirica contends the phrase other paper in the second paragraph encompasses informal correspondence between the parties,such as the demand letter he sent to nationwide on april.the complaint stated grounds for diversity jurisdiction,so the second paragraph does not apply if the complaint is the initial pleading.the other paper language of the second paragraph would apply only if the writ of summons could be considered the initial pleading.
in foster,this court considered the meaning of initial pleading in the context of the first paragraph of section b.foster,at.the plaintiff in foster filed a praecipe for writ of summons in the commonwealth court of pennsylvania and served the writ of summons on the defendant.id.the complaint was filed and served on the defendant several months later,and the defendant filed a notice of removal within days of receiving the complaint.id.this court held that b requires defendants to file their notices of removal within thirty days after receiving a writ of summons,praecipe,or complaint which in themselves provide adequate notice of federal jurisdiction as noted above.id.at emphasis added.foster also rejected the notion that correspondence,together with the summons,could provide notice because anything considered a pleading must be something of the type filed with a court.id.the district court in this case held that under foster the defendant did not have notice until the complaint was received because the writ of summons alone did not establish federal jurisdiction,and cinski demand letter was not a pleading of the type filed with a court.
the continuing authority of foster has been placed in doubt by murphy,michetti pipe stringing,d.in murphy,the supreme court considered whether a complaint sent by facsimile,but not formally served on the defendant,could provide notice of removability under the first paragraph of b.id.at.the plaintiff argued the removal period started when the complaint was faxed because the statute provides that the period starts after the receipt by the defendant,through service or otherwise,of a copy of the initial pleading.b emphasis added.the court rejected this contention,and held that a named defendant time to remove is triggered by simultaneous service of the summons and complaint,or receipt of the complaint,through service or otherwise,after and apart from service of the summons,but not by mere receipt of the complaint unattended by any formal service.murphy,at.by contrast,foster held the period begins when the defendant receives a writ of summons,praecipe,or complaint which in themselves provide notice of federal jurisdiction,foster,at emphasis added,whereas the literal wording of murphy requires the filing or receipt of a complaint before the period begins.
not all courts have interpreted murphy to require the filing or receipt of a complaint before the period begins.see whitaker am.telecasting,cir sprague aba,d.in whitaker,a plaintiff in new york state court served the defendants with copies of a summons with notice,but no complaint.he served the complaint more than two months later,and the defendants removed to federal court soon after.whitaker,at.plaintiff,arguing removal was untimely,moved for remand.id.at.the district court concluded removal was timely because murphy had interpreted the initial pleading language of b to mean complaint and the defendants had removed within days of receipt of the complaint.id.
the court of appeals for the second circuit rejected the district court interpretation of murphy.id.at.the second circuit read murphy solely as an interpretation of the service or otherwise language of section b,not as an interpretation of initial pleading.id.at.the court stated that murphy used the term complaint in place of initial pleading in its analysis of section b merely because the initial pleading served in murphy was a complaint id.looking to the plain language of section b,the court reasoned that initial pleading does not necessarily mean complaint,so the statute does not require the receipt of a complaint to trigger the removal period.id.at.the court concluded that a summons with notice may serve as an initial pleading under section b.id.at.the court then declined to remand the case to state court because the summons did not state the citizenship of the parties,and therefore failed to provide notice of federal diversity jurisdiction the period was not actually triggered by receipt of the summons,but receipt of the complaint,so removal was timely.id.at.
a summons may not serve as an initial pleading under murphy.first,the supreme court use of the term complaint to mean initial pleading in murphy was not merely an inadvertent accommodation of the facts.the court,addressing the situation where a complaint is received after service of the summons,explicitly held that the time to remove is triggered by receipt of the complaint,through service or otherwise,after and apart from service of the summons murphy,at.emphasis added.if the court had intended that a summons could be the initial pleading,its holding would not have distinguished between receipt of the complaint and service of the summons.
second,murphy cited the legislative history of section b in which congress stated its intent to eliminate the situation wherein a defendant who has not received the complaint must decide whether to remove before he knows what the suit is about.id.at.the second circuit,noting that new york law requires the summons to state the nature of the action and the relief sought reasoned that a writ of summons satisfies this purpose.whitaker,at.in pennsylvania,there is generally no such requirement.see.civ.the model form for a general writ of summons under pennsylvania law merely contains the plaintiff name,the defendant name,and notice that an action has been commenced,with the county,the date,the name of the prothonotary or clerk,and the deputy.id.this is insufficient to notify the defendant what the action is about.the writ of summons in this case contained no information about the nature of the action.see app.at.
finally,murphy noted that congress amended the statute partly to provide for uniform operation across the nation.murphy,at.we would impede this purpose by adopting the whitaker rule in the third circuit,since defendants in pennsylvania could be required to decide whether to remove without seeing the complaint or knowing the nature of the cause of action,whereas defendants in delaware and new jersey would always have such notice.
we therefore hold that murphy implicitly overruled foster,and a writ of summons alone can no longer be the initial pleading that triggers the period for removal under the first paragraph of b 
although murphy only interpreted the phrase initial pleading in the first paragraph,both paragraphs of section b use the phrase initial pleading,and much of the other language is also identical.statutes must be construed as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme,one in which the operative words have a consistent meaning throughout.gustafson alloyd,d.since the initial pleading language is identical,the supreme court interpretation of initial pleading to mean complaint in the first paragraph of section b must also apply to the second paragraph.
the initial pleading here was the complaint,not the summons,but the complaint provided notice of the grounds for federal diversity jurisdiction,so the second paragraph of section b does not apply sikirica reliance on other papers is unfounded.nationwide did not receive notice of federal diversity jurisdiction before the complaint was filed on july.the action was timely removed on july,less than days later the district court denial of the motion to remand was not in error.
statute of limitations for sikirica bad faith claim 
the district court held sikirica claim for bad faith under.was barred by the statute of limitations.the court applied a limitations period that began to run on february,when nationwide informed pba by letter of its refusal to defend and indemnify pba in the class action.sikirica contends the limitations period did not accrue until the pennsylvania superior court denied pba appeals on march.the writ of summons for this action issued on april,more than eleven years after nationwide initial denial of coverage,but less than two years after the class action judgment against pba was final.
section does not include a limitations period,and the pennsylvania supreme court has not ruled on the issue.without an opinion from the state highest court,a federal court must predict how that court would rule.see packard provident bank,cir.in doing so,the federal court may consider lower state court precedents to be more predictive than conflicting federal court precedents.id.at.
in haugh allstate insurance,cir,this court predicted the pennsylvania supreme court would apply the tort statute of limitations in actions under section,rather than the contract limitations period or the limitations period of,because a bad faith claim sounds in tort.haugh,at.a majority of the lower state courts have also ruled that a limitations period applies.see ash cont l ins.although the outcome of this case does not turn on whether the limitations period is two,four or six years,we apply the limitations period as predicted by haugh.
when the statute of limitations begins to run is an issue of first impression sikirica contends the refusal to defend and the refusal to indemnify are two independent events in determining the accrual of the statute of limitations in a statutory bad faith claim.relying on moffat metropolitan casualty insurance,sikirica argues the statute of limitations in an action seeking the cost of defense accrues when the defense has been completed,and a bad faith claim for refusal to indemnify accrues when judgment in the underlying action is final 
the plaintiff in moffat alleged breach of contract,not bad faith.the federal district court in moffat did not have the benefit of state court rulings on this issue,because no bad faith tort claim existed under pennsylvania law in.see.mut.cas.ins.
the district court,rejecting sikirica argument,relied on adamski allstate insurance,in which the pennsylvania superior court held a claim for bad faith under.ann.accrued when the insurer first provided definite notice of a refusal to indemnify or defend.see also haugh,at simon wrecking aiu ins,d statute of limitations started running at the point of initial clear denial ash cont l ins,starting limitations period at initial denial of coverage.in general,the statute of limitations begins to run when a right to institute and maintain suit arises.crouse cyclops.a bad faith claim arises upon a frivolous or unfounded refusal to pay proceeds of policy.adamski,at quoting black law dictionary ed.see also rottmund cont l assurance.adamski held the statute accrued when the insurer denied liability because this was when the refusal to pay first occurred.adamski,at.
in an argument similar to sikirica,the plaintiff in adamski had contended the insurer committed numerous separate and distinct acts of bad faith refusal to defend or indemnify,denial of liability protection without first seeking declaratory judgment,failure to settle,lack of an adequate basis for denying protection,and failure to conduct a diligent investigation.id.at.adamski rejected this argument and held that each of these alleged acts was related to the initial denial of coverage,not a separate act of bad faith.id.at.see also mcgrath fed.ins,no,wl at,alleged continued bad faith acts arise from original denial of coverage wazlawick allstate ins,no,wl at,denial of coverage is not a continuing act of bad faith.we reject sikirica argument to the contrary.
sikirica attempts to distinguish adamski because it required a clear and unequivocal refusal to defend or indemnify,and nationwide only refused to defend or indemnify pba against the class action allegations.nationwide letter of denial unambiguously informed pba of its refusal to defend,indemnify or protect it against the class action allegations of the complaint.these claims were clearly delineated in nationwide letter as the class action allegations beginning with paragraph and extending through paragraph h.app.at.nationwide provided clear notice of its denial of coverage and refusal to defend the class action allegations in its letter of february.
the writ of summons for this action issued more than two years after nationwide letter of denial.applying the adamski rule,sikirica bad faith claim is barred by the statute of limitations.
sikirica breach of contract claims 
sikirica alleges a breach of contract arising out of nationwide refusal to defend and indemnify pba.the district court found the policy did not cover the intentional conduct alleged in the class action allegations of the complaint.sikirica argues nationwide had a duty to defend and indemnify pba under four sections of the policy the comprehensive general liability section the professional liability section the contractual liability section and the comprehensive crime coverage section 
under pennsylvania law,an insurer has a duty to defend if the complaint filed by the injured party potentially comes within the policy coverage.pacific indem.linn,cir.the duty to defend is a distinct obligation,different from and broader than the duty to indemnify.erie ins.exch.muff,atl.mut.ins.brotech,aff,cir.because the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify,there is no duty to indemnify if there is no duty to defend.see mut.benefit ins.haver,erie ins.exch.claypoole.after determining the scope of coverage under a policy,the court must examine the complaint in the underlying action to determine whether it triggers coverage.accident ins.of am.allen.if the complaint avers facts that might support recovery under the policy,coverage is triggered and the insurer has a duty to defend.id.both the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify flow from a determination that the complaint triggers coverage.id.
the comprehensive general liability section 
sikirica alleges nationwide had a duty to defend and indemnify pba under the comprehensive general liability section of the policy.this section states,in relevant par
