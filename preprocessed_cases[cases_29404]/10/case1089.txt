several san francisco police officers the plaintiffs or the officers over the age of forty performed well enough on an examination in to qualify for consideration for promotion to assistant inspector.they allege that a new policy of the san francisco police department sfpd abandoning the examination as a basis for certain assignments worked a disparate impact based on age.the plaintiffs sought certification of a class composed of all sfpd officers over forty who had qualified on the examination.
the district court denied certification for want of commonality.we permitted the officers to appeal the denial of class certification under federal rule of civil procedure f,and now reverse,holding improper the district court reliance on merits issues unrelated to the pertinent commonality inquiry.
nearly three and a half decades ago,the civil service commission of the city and county of san francisco city entered into a consent decree to settle allegations of employment discrimination in the sfpd on the basis of race,sex,and national origin,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et.
in late,the district court terminated that consent decree.by stipulation of the parties,however,the district court retained jurisdiction over issues related to a recently administered promotional examination the q assistant inspector examination for promotion to the investigations bureau which the parties agreed would be governed by the terms of the consent decree.on the same day,the district court issued an order outlining promotion procedures for officers who had sat for the q assistant inspector examination.that order required a minimum of assistant inspector appointments from the list of police officers who had passed the examination,arranged in order of exam performance q list.the first promotions were to be made in rank order of performance.subsequent appointments,the court ordered,will be made from a sliding band that will start at rank.the band width is points.the district court authorized the city to review various secondary criteria when making selections within that sliding band.between and,the city selected police officers from the q list for promotion to assistant inspector.
in,the chief of police announced a change in promotion policy to improve operational flexibility and rationalize the promotional progression,the sfpd would no longer promote assistant inspectors to the investigations bureau from the q list.instead,the sfpd would administer a new q sergeants examination and assign some newly promoted sergeants,selected on the basis of their performance on the new exam,to the investigations bureau.those sergeants assigned to the investigations bureau would have duties previously assigned to assistant inspectors.
the city administered the q sergeants examination in and created a list of eligible officers q list the following year.soon thereafter,the sfpd began promoting sergeants from the recently compiled q list,many of whom were given investigative duties.assistant chief morris tabak agreed,in a deposition taken in this case,that he knew of no reason that those appointments could not have been made from the q list that resulted from the exam.
the officers initially filed this action in late,alleging that sfpd decision to use the q list instead of the q list for investigative assignments both constituted a pattern or practice of discrimination and generated a disparate impact on older officers in violation of the age discrimination in employment act adea.they also alleged parallel violations of california fair employment and housing act feha,cal.gov t code.
the officers subsequently sought certification of a class under their feha disparate impact claim.the district court denied the motion for certification,explaining that the officers failed to satisfy the requirements of both federal rules of civil procedure a and b.
after denial of certification,the officers filed a second amended complaint alleging only a disparate impact theory of liability,again under both the adea and feha.several months later,the officers renewed their motion for class certification of the feha claim proposing as the class to be certified sfpd officers who were aged forty and older as of each of the dates of the challenged appointments in,and and who could have been appointed to investigative positions had the city properly made appointments from the q list.the putative class defined an officer who could have been appointed,as an officer within the point selection band at the time sfpd assigned a sergeant to investigative work.the officers further proposed the creation of separate subclasses for those who could have been appointed at each date.certification was sought under rule b.as the common question required for certification.a,the officers asserted a common question of fact w hether the city employment practice of appointing sergeants exclusively from the q list to investigative positions traditionally performed by assistant inspectors and refusing to make any of the appointments from the active q list,had a disparate impact on qualified applicants for the investigative positions who were aged forty or above at the time of those appointments,in violation of feha.
the district court denied the renewed motion for class certification for want of commonality.having disposed of the motion on that ground,the district court expressly declined to rule on the officers argument that the putative class satisfied the requirement of rule b,which requires both that common questions predominate over any questions affecting only individual members of the class and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.
the officers timely sought permission to appeal under rule f,which authorizes discretionary review of an interlocutory order granting or denying class certification.see.f see also chamberlan ford motor,cir per curiam describing the standards we employ to guide our discretionary authorization of appeals under rule f.this court granted permission for the appeal,and the officers timely perfected it.see fed.d.
federal rule of civil procedure a conditions class certification on demonstrating that members of the proposed class share common questions of law or fact.such commonality is one of four threshold requirements contained in rule a the other three are numerosity,typicality,and adequacy of representation see,amchem,windsor,d.together,these requirements seek to limit the class claims to those fairly encompassed by the named plaintiff claims.wal mart stores,dukes,d quoting.of sw.falcon,d internal quotation marks omitted.
wal mart instructed that,although rule a refers to common questions of law or fact in the plural,e ven a single common question will do.id.at alterations in original quoting id.at ginsburg,dissenting.we have since clarified that rule a requires a single significant question of law or fact.abdullah sec,cir emphasis in original quoting mazza am.honda motor,cir.
rule a is not a mere pleading standard,so establishing commonality sometimes requires affirmative evidence,which the courts must subject to rigorous analysis.wal mart.at quoting falcon,at.such rigor often will entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff underlying claim.id.while some evaluation of the merits frequently can not be helped in evaluating commonality,that likelihood of overlap with the merits is no license to engage in merits inquiries at the certification stage.amgen.ret.plans trust funds,d.instead,as the supreme court clarified last year,m erits questions may be considered to the extent but only to the extent that they are relevant to determining whether the rule prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.id.at emphasis added.w hether class members could actually prevail on the merits of their claims is not a proper inquiry in determining the preliminary question whether common questions exist.ellis costco wholesale,cir.
further,a common contention need not be one that will be answered,on the merits,in favor of the class.amgen.at.instead,it only must be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.wal mart.at emphases added.to hold otherwise would turn class certification into a on the merits,ellis,at,when the purpose of class certification is merely to select the metho d best suited to adjudication of the controversy fairly and efficiently,amgen.at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.
amgen,published over a year after the district court decision here,illustrates well the application of the principle that demonstrating commonality does not require proof that the putative class will prevail on whatever common questions it identifies.in amgen,a class alleged securities fraud under b of the securities exchange act of,stat,as amended,b,and securities and exchange commission rule,b.at.to succeed on the merits,plaintiffs alleging securities fraud under rule must prove a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant scienter a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission economic loss and loss causation.id.at quoting matrixx initiatives,siracusano,d internal quotation marks omitted.the doctrine permits certain rule plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable presumption of reliance on material misrepresentations aired to the general public,when those misrepresentations concern securities traded in an efficient market.id.to invoke the presumption,plaintiffs must demonstrate that the alleged misrepresentations were publicly known,that the stock traded in an efficient market,that the relevant transaction took place between the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed,erica john fund,halliburton,d quoting basic levinson,d,and that the misrepresentations were material,amgen.at.
amgen held that where a class of investors seeks to rely on the presumption,proof of materiality is unnecessary to certify a class under rule b.id.at.the reasoning,in part,was that t he alleged misrepresentations and omissions,whether material or immaterial,would be so equally for all investors composing the class.id.at.if the factfinder ultimately held those representations immaterial,that determination would not amount to some fatal dissimilarity among class members that would make use of the device inefficient or unfair.instead,it would generate a fatal similarity failure of proof as to an element of the plaintiffs cause of action.id.at emphases added alteration omitted quoting richard nagareda,class certification in the age of aggregate proof,internal quotation marks omitted.by its very nature,such a similarity,whether fatal or not to the merits of the materiality issue,is a common question.although proof of materiality was an essential predicate of the theory,id.at,the court held it properly addressed at trial or in a ruling on a motion,id.at.
notably,amgen concerned satisfaction of rule b,which requires not merely a common question but also find ing that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.it held proof of a factor that would ultimately be essential to success on the class claims not merely unnecessary to demonstrate commonality,but also unnecessary to demonstrate that such commonality predominates.rule b imposes a far more demanding standard than a.amchem,at.it was the less demanding standard of rule a that was the basis of the district court denial of certification here.
the principle that courts must consider merits issues only as necessary to determine a pertinent rule factor,and not otherwise,has special force at the appellate level where,as here,we review a class certification determination under rule f.under rule f,the limitation on consideration of the merits to the relevant class certification questions is of jurisdictional significance.rule f permits discretionary,interlocutory appeals from an order granting or denying certification.f.interlocutory appeals are,of course,the exception rather than the rule.chamberlan,at.absent rule f or some other applicable exception,our jurisdiction would be constrained by the general rule that a party is entitled to a single appeal,to be deferred until final judgment has been entered.mohawk,carpenter,d quoting digital equip.desktop direct,d see also.as the exception to the final judgment rule created by rule f applies only to class certification decisions,merits inquiries unrelated to certification exceed our limited rule f jurisdiction,as well as the needs of rule a b.in contrast,were this an appeal from a final judgment after a class was certified or not certified and the merits then determined,we would have the option of addressing the merits and,if we decided to hold against the plaintiffs,not addressing the class certification question.we must police the bounds of our jurisdiction vigorously here as elsewhere,see,crowley bannister,cir,and so may not ourselves venture into merits issues unnecessary to the rule issue before us.
with that background,we reach the only question properly before us whether the district court denial of the officers motion for class certification was an abuse of discretion.see ellis,at.an error of law,reliance on an improper factor,omission of a substantial factor,or a clear error of judgment in weighing the correct mix of factors qualifies as an abuse of discretion.bateman am.multi cinema,cir quoting in re wells fargo mortg.overtime pay,cir.we conclude that the district court erred in denying class certification because of its legal error of evaluating merits questions,rather than focusing on whether the questions presented,whether meritorious or not,were common to the members of the putative class.by doing so,the district court made an error of law and relied on improper factors,thereby abusing its discretion.
to assess whether the putative class members share a common question,the answer to which will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the class members claims,we must identify the elements of the class members.wal mart.at.the requisite prima facie case for a age discrimination claim under california feha is parallel to that under the adea.see katz regents of the of,cir see also clark claremont,th,d.under both statutes,a plaintiff must demonstrate the occurrence of certain outwardly neutral employment practices,and a significantly adverse or disproportionate impact on persons of a particular age produced by the employer facially neutral acts or practices.katz,at alteration in original quoting palmer united states,cir.this formulation requires a plaintiff to isolat e and identify the specific employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities.smith city of jackson,d emphasis in original quoting wards cove packing atonio,d.the plaintiff must also demonstrate a causal connection between those specific employment practices and the asserted impact on those of a particular age.see,lewis city of chicago,d katz,at 
here,the officers have identified a single,uniform policy that,allegedly,generated all the disparate impact of which they complain the sfpd decision to make investigative assignments using the q list instead of the q list.each member of the putative class was on the q list.each suffered the effects of its elimination,whatever those were.
identifying a specific practice is not a trivial burden in age discrimination cases alleging disparate impact.meacham,at.indeed,the first supreme court case to recognize the viability of a theory under the adea rejected the claim on the merits for failure to identify the specific practice being challenged,among other shortcomings.smith,at.requiring plaintiffs to name a specific employment practice has bite,meacham,at,both on the merits and for purposes of determining whether there is a common question in a disparate impact case.here,the putative class is challenging a single employment practice making investigative assignments from the q list instead of the q list.
