plaintiff george louie seeks damages against defendant bfs retail and commercial operations,llc bfrc for alleged violation of california disabled persons act,et dpa,because the countertops in bfrc business establishments were allegedly too high to allow wheelchair access.the trial court entered judgment of dismissal upon bfrc demurrer,concluding res judicata barred this lawsuit based on a consent decree in a class action lawsuit against bfrc in the united states district court in florida,which alleged bfrc facilities denied equal access to disabled persons in violation of the federal ada et.we shall conclude that,because the florida federal case was resolved by a consent decree expressly reserving any damage claims,res judicata does not bar this claim for damages.we shall therefore reverse the judgment of dismissal 
background 
the pleading at issue in this appeal is plaintiff first amended complaint for damages,filed may,which asserted one cause of action for violation of sections and fn,ante.according to the allegations which we accept as true for purposes of reviewing the ruling on demurrer 
bfrc owns and operates tire and automotive retail and service centers at seven specified addresses in sacramento,carmichael,north highlands,citrus heights,rancho cordova,and roseville.plaintiff,who resides in west sacramento,is an amputee who has required the use of a wheelchair as his primary means of mobility outside of his home.in the year preceding the filing of this action,plaintiff patronized defendant facilities at least times.during said visits to the facilities while using his wheelchair,plaintiff was unable to use bfrc service counters because their countertops were too high for him to be of any use and were therefore inaccessible to him and any person who is.providing counters would have been easy and inexpensive.
the prayer of the complaint asked for damages,attorney fees and costs,and all other relief that the court may deem proper.
bfrc demurred on the ground the lawsuit was barred by res judicata pursuant to a prior class action lawsuit against bfrc in the united states district court in florida,which resulted in a final judgment and consent decree covering bfrc stores nationwide,including california.bfrc requested and was granted judicial notice of court documents in the federal disability association,bfs retail and commercial operations,llc.although the federal complaint was not part of our record on appeal,we have obtained the federal complaint and after having given notice to the parties we now take judicial notice of it.
plaintiff here asserts without evidence at this demurrer stage that he was not given notice of the federal case.for purposes of this appeal,it does not matter whether or not plaintiff was aware of the federal case while it was pending.
among the documents of which the trial court took judicial notice,is a joint motion for order granting preliminary approval of proposed consent decree for conditionally certifying the settlement class for directing notice to the class and for scheduling fairness hearing with supporting memorandum of law.the joint motion,signed by bfrc attorney,repeatedly said the consent decree would not release any claim for damages.thus,in summarizing the proposed settlement,the joint motion said,the release,by the defined settlement class shall include a release of all claims asserted in the lawsuit,past present,and all causes of action,actions,complaints or liabilities of every kind for injunctive relief,declaratory relief and attorneys fees,whether based on title iii of the ada or state or local law,rule or regulation.the release does not include claims for individual damages,that otherwise might be available under state law or local ordinance.italics added.additionally,the joint motion,in arguing that the proposed form of notice to absent class members was adequate due to impracticability of individual notice,said there are no individual damage claims affected by this settlement.
the proposed form of notice was posting notice in bfrc stores publication in a national newspaper,today mailing notice to prominent disability groups including two in in los angeles and one in berkeley attempting to post notice on at least five internet locations frequented by the disabled and via notice,directing inquiries to the website of plaintiff counsel.the notice to disability groups said the proposed consent decree will ensure that bfrc stores are accessible to persons with disabilities as required by the ada and local accessibility laws.the notice also said,all class members will be bound by the consent decree provisions if the court gave final approval,and anyone who objected to the settlement,a copy of which was available on a website,had to send a written statement of reasons for objecting.
the florida federal court october,final judgment approving class certification and proposed amended consent decree and dismissing action with prejudice expressly stated that the proposed form of notice sufficed because no damages were sought and the court was certifying the class under federal rules of civil procedure,rule b undesignated rule references are to the federal rules of civil procedure,which allows a class action without notice to class members if prerequisites are satisfied and the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole the federal court said,the proposed amended consent decree meets rule b strictures because the relief sought in this action is purely injunctive and declaratory p laintiff and plaintiff class are seeking purely injunctive relief to remedy bfrc alleged with title iii which is a federal civil rights statute.the federal court judgment stated in a footnote the proposed amended consent decree reflects the deletion of damage claims that the parties voluntarily excised from the proposed consent decree in august,after discussions with all of the then objectors.the federal court observed the only objections came from a group of agencies who complained about the use of tolerances for new construction and alterations.
the federal court in florida,after finding the settlement fair and reasonable,ordered and adjudged that the settlement class was certified,the proposed consent decree was approved and adopted as the order of the court,and the federal court retained jurisdiction pursuant to the terms of the consent decree for enforcement purposes and determination of fees and costs.
the consent decree approved by the federal court limited itself to injunctive relief,declaratory relief,and attorney fees,stating 
release and discharge.effective on the date of final approval,plaintiff,on behalf of itself and all members of the settlement class,and their spouses or partners,executors,representatives,heirs,successors and assigns,in consideration of the relief set forth herein,the sufficiency of which is expressly acknowledged,fully and finally releases and forever discharges bfrc and the independent dealers covered by this decree and each of their respective agents.nothing herein limits the enforcement of settlement class members rights through administrative or law enforcement agencies.
released claims.the released claims are all claims asserted by named plaintiff the settlement class in the lawsuit or which could be asserted by them during the term of this decree,any and all past present claims,rights,demands,charges,complaints,actions,causes of action,obligations,or liabilities of any and every kind,known or unknown,for injunctive or declaratory relief or attorneys fees,based upon title iii of the ada and its promulgated rules and regulations relating to or concerning access for persons with mobility disabilities and dexterity disabilities at the bfrc retail tire and service stores covered by this decree.released claims also include claims regarding accessibility enhancements and the elements of bfrc retail tire and service stores affected thereby that arise during the term of this decree.to the extent permitted by law,the final entry of this decree will be fully binding and effective for purposes of res judicata and collateral estoppel upon bfrc,plaintiff and the settlement class with respect to title iii of the ada and its promulgated rules and regulations concerning access for persons with mobility disabilities and dexterity disabilities covered by title iii of the ada at bfrc retail tire and service stores.nothing in this section,however,will prevent class counsel from enforcing this decree.italics added.
in further support of the demurrer in the current case,bfrc requested and was granted judicial notice of documents reflecting plaintiff first tried to litigate this case in federal court in california,without success.thus,on october,plaintiff filed a complaint in the eastern district of bfs retail and commercial operations,cal,no.civ wbs kjm,wl.lexis louie seeking to prosecute as a class action a complaint for damages and injunctive relief against bfrc for alleged failure to provide full and equal access to individuals with disabilities in violation of the ada,the unruh civil rights act and the dpa.on february,the eastern district of california dismissed the ada claim with prejudice,on the ground of res judicata in that it was barred by the federal court case in florida.the eastern district observed,plaintiff appropriately acknowledges his membership in the aforementioned settlement class fn.omitted and thus concedes that the consent decree bars his ada claim.see pl.mem.in opp to def.mot.to dismiss plaintiff concedes that his claim for violation of the ada is subsumed into the class action consent judgment to which defendant refers in its motion to dismiss.with the sole federal claim dismissed,the eastern district declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.accordingly,the eastern district dismissed without prejudice plaintiff state law claims.
plaintiff then filed the current complaint in state court,limited to one count seeking damages for alleged violation of the dpa.
in state court,plaintiff opposed the demurrer.
the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,on the ground of res judicata.the court observed plaintiff conceded in federal court in california that his ada claim was barred because he was a member of the class in florida.the court said sections and of the dpa fn,ante integrate the ada and section c provides a violation of the ada is also a violation of.thus plaintiff claims here are barred by the res judicata effect of the consent decree and final judgment of the florida federal district court on the ada claims.in response to plaintiff argument that res judicata was inapplicable because the florida case was limited to relief,whereas plaintiff now seeks statutory damages,the trial court said,plaintiff confuses rights and remedies and misapplies the primary rights doctrine.where two actions involve the same harm to the plaintiff and the same wrong by the defendant,the same primary right is at stake.thus res judicata bars the later action eichman fotomat d.the primary right here is plaintiff right to full and equal access to defendant public accommodations.plaintiff mistakenly focuses on the remedy when the focus properly belongs on the right.the fact that a second action may seek different remedies or is based on a different theory is not determinative.it is the right or obligation sought to be established or enforced,not the remedy or relief sought which determines the nature and substance of the cause of action.citations.
the court continued,plaintiff also argues that he was not part of the settlement class,was not adequately represented,and was not provided with adequate notice.he is clearly a member of the class and it is not necessary that he be named individually.citation.the consent decree provides that it will be fully binding upon bfrc and the settlement class.the settlement class includes those persons with mobility disabilities.plaintiff has alleged he is in a wheel chair notice was given by several means and the florida court specifically found that it exceeded due process requirements.the florida court held two fairness hearings and considered objections submitted by interested parties.the state court added that plaintiff had not offered any amendment that could avoid dismissal.
plaintiff appeals from the ensuing judgment of dismissal by the california state court.

ii.res judicata does not bar this action 
the parties devote much of their appellate briefs to arguing about primary right theory,privity,and due process notice to absent class members.bfrc in its respondent brief focuses on the rule that the primary right,rather than the remedy,determines res judicata effect.however,we need not address all these points because,as we shall explain,the resolution of this appeal turns on the circumstance that the federal case in florida ended with a consent decree in which bfrc agreed to reserve any damage claims for later litigation.this circumstance renders res judicata inapplicable to the damage claims now asserted under california dpa.
the united states supreme court has recognized that,state courts are generally free to develop their own rules for protecting against the piecemeal resolution of disputes,as long as they do not interfere with fundamental federal rights.richards jefferson county,d.however,where a prior federal judgment was based on federal question jurisdiction,the preclusive effect of the prior judgment of a federal court is determined by federal law.limbach hooven allison,d butcher truck ins.exchange th,d.where a prior federal judgment was based on diversity jurisdiction,the preclusive effect is subject to federal common the law of the state in which the federal court the state law is compatible with federal interests.semtek int l lockheed martin,d burdette carrier th,d.federal question jurisdiction is pursuant to title of the united states code,section,which provides that district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.diversity jurisdiction under title of the united states code,section,gives district courts original jurisdiction of civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeded and is between citizens of different states.
here,the complaint from the federal case in florida was not part of the record on appeal,and the record did not disclose the basis of jurisdiction for the complaint filed in florida.on our own motion,we have obtained and,with appropriate notice to the parties,take judicial notice of the complaint filed in the united states district court,southern district of disability association,bfs retail and commercial operations,llc,supra.that federal complaint was based on federal question jurisdiction,not diversity jurisdiction.
thus,we look to the preclusive effect under federal law,though we observe federal law is consistent with california law in this case 
under federal and california law,res judicata generally precludes parties or their privies from litigating in a second lawsuit issues that were or could have been litigated in a prior suit.rivet regions bank,d case brought in louisiana state court was improperly removed to federal court,where basis for removal was defendants assertion that action was precluded by prior federal court orders mycogen monsanto,supra,cal th,d.
under both california and federal law,res judicata bars a subsequent suit if the same cause of action has been previously adjudicated in a suit between the same parties.montana united states,d.it is also settled that a settlement pursuant to a final consent decree in a class action will operate to bar subsequent suits by class members.citations.a judgment entered by consent or stipulation,is as conclusive a bar as a judgment rendered after trial.citations.johnson american airlines,d.johnson,citing inter alia dosier miami valley broadcasting cir.
a consent decree is a court decree that all parties agree to.black law dict.ed.federal law recognizes that an attorney has power to bind his or her client.stone bank of commerce.california recognizes that a consent decree entered by consent of an attorney is binding upon the client.holmes rogers cal.thus,the florida consent decree entered by consent of bfrc attorney binds bfrc,and bfrc does not argue to the contrary.
under federal and california law,a judgment in a class action is binding on class members in any subsequent litigation,though the ability to bind absent class members depends on compliance with due process regarding notice and adequate representation.richards jefferson county,supra,at.alabama state court violated due process by concluding challengers to county tax were bound,under state law as to res judicata,by prior adjudication to which challengers had not been parties cooper federal reserve bank of richmond,d johnson,supra,d at.newberg on class actions ed,see also,consumer advocacy group,exxonmobil th,d discussing privity in context of plaintiffs purporting to act as enforcers of the public interest.
where a federal court,in a case brought under the ada and state disability laws,does not resolve any issue of the state disability laws,the federal courts will dismiss the state claims without prejudice to their being filed in state court,even where the state disability statutes incorporate the ada.thus,in wander kaus cir wander,a plaintiff filed a lawsuit in federal court,alleging the defendants structural barriers discriminated against the disabled in violation of title iii of the ada and the california dpa.id.at.the dpa claim was premised on the ada violation.the plaintiff sought injunctive relief under the ada and damages under the dpa.damages are not available to a private plaintiff suing under the ada the remedy is limited to injunctive relief.a remedies available to private plaintiff,under ada subchapter regarding public accommodations and services operated by private entities,are remedies set forth in,a,civil rights statute authorizing civil action for injunctive relief wander,supra,at org.for advancement of minorities brick oven restaurant d.the ada states it does not limit remedies available under state law.b.
in wander,the defendants transfer of the property to new owners rendered moot the ada claim for injunctive relief,leaving only the dpa claim for damages.the defendants moved to dismiss the ada claim as moot and to dismiss the state law claim without prejudice under the discretionary supplemental jurisdiction statute,title of the united states code,section c,which provides that district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim if it has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.the federal district court granted the motion.the plaintiff appealed,challenging the district court ruling that the mere fact that a previous violation of federal law would also give rise to a state law claim was inadequate to vest the district court with federal question jurisdiction over the state law claim.wander,supra,at.the ninth circuit affirmed,holding there is no jurisdiction over a lawsuit for damages brought under california dpa,even though the california statute makes a violation of the federal ada a violation of state law.congress intended that there be no federal cause of action for damages for a violation of title iii of the ada.to exercise jurisdiction in these circumstances would circumvent the intent of congress.jurisdiction is not created merely because a violation of federal law is an element of a state law claim.id.at.
as observed in wander,the same conclusion was reached in other cases,pickern best timber cove lodge marina resort d,which dismissed the state law claims despite recognizing that litigation of a new suit in state court may create some inconvenience to the plaintiff.id.at.
in most cases,when federal and state law claims are joined in a federal court action and the federal claims are dismissed,the pendent state claims are dismissed without prejudice to filing them in state court,in order to avoid n eedless decisions of state law as a matter of comity and to promote justice between the parties.united mine workers gibbs,d,limited and criticized on other grounds,daimlerchrysler cuno,d schneider trw,cir.
additionally,we observe the common sense statement in a plurality opinion of the united states supreme court with no dissent on this point,with no apparent need for citation of authority,agreeing with the court of appeals that res judicata did not bar claims in a federal district court in georgia based on a prior judgment of a south carolina district court,because the federal court in south carolina expressly left open the option for the claims to be pursued at a later time.united states seckinger,fn,d.seckinger was cited for this point in superior motels,rinn motor hotels,d at page.special master findings made in determining whether to lift stay on state court proceedings after appointment of federal receiver were not entitled to preclusive effect in state unlawful detainer action burns.at page in disposing of lawsuit,court may reserve right of party to bring second suit arising from same subject matter,questioned on other grounds in vineland chem.at page.
here,the federal court was not required to decide whether to dismiss the claims,because those claims were reserved by the consent of the parties reserving any issue of damages.indeed,the consent decree introduction described the lawsuit without any reference whatsoever to state law.it mentioned only the ada.
there was express language in the florida judgment reserving any issue of damages,and indeed the federal court in florida relied upon this reservation to lessen the standard for notice to class members.thus,the federal court october,final judgment approving class certification and proposed amended consent decree and dismissing action with prejudice stated in a footnote the proposed amended consent decree reflects the deletion of damage claims that the parties voluntarily excised from the proposed consent decree in august,after discussions with all of the then objectors.the judgment further stated that since the issue of damages had been voluntarily excised and the case was limited to relief,the court was certifying the class under rule b,which allows a class action to proceed if prerequisites are satisfied and the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.the federal court said,the proposed amended consent decree meets rule b strictures because the relief sought in this action is purely injunctive and declaratory.p laintiff and plaintiff class are seeking purely injunctive relief to remedy bfrc alleged with title iii which is a federal civil rights statute.
the federal court in florida went on to say that,while rule b class actions do not require notice to absent class members,the parties suggested various forms of notice publishing notice in usa today,posting the proposed consent decree on the attorney website,posting notice at each of bfrc store locations,and sending notice to disability organizations.the federal court concluded that,since the case was a rule b case,these forms of notice exceeded the requirements of due process.the federal court cited eisen carlisle jacquelin,d,which required,in a
