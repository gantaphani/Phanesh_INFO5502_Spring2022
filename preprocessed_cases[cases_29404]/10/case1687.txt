lawyers with an apparently weaker case attempted to intervene in an apparently stronger class action case.the trial court denied the motion to intervene and overruled objections to the proposed settlement.
in the apparently stronger case,a class of uninsured patients sued sutter health,alleging that it improperly denied them the discounts it granted insured patients.after much pretrial skirmishing and massive discovery,a retired judge coleman fannin mediated a settlement representing nearly a complete victory for the plaintiffs,including attorney fees.
michael stowers had filed a separate suit,eventually purporting to represent a class of accident victims unfairly billed by sutter health.although liability has not been determined,the record provides objectively sound reasons why sutter health could conclude that stowers had a weak case,if any.therefore,sutter health did not choose to negotiate any settlement with him or his purported class.
when the uninsured case was about to settle,stowers moved to intervene,and he and three purported uninsured class members,appellants rachel svenson,javier barnhart and joseph eustis,objected to the proposed settlement.although stowers is not a class member,for convenience we refer to all appellants collectively as stowers.
the trial court denied the motion to intervene and approved the settlement.stowers filed a timely appeal.
the order denying intervention is appealable socialist workers.committee brown d,fn,and challenges to the settlement are properly reviewed on appeal from the judgment incorporating the settlement chavez netflix,th,d chavez.
stowers has not been harmed by the settlement in fact,the trial court ordered all discovery in the uninsured case to be provided to him,to help his case.it appears that the purpose of his motion to intervene and objection to the settlement may have been to cause sutter health to negotiate a settlement of this apparently weaker case.
we conclude the trial court properly denied the motion to intervene and properly overruled the objections to the settlement.accordingly,we shall affirm.
factual and procedural background 
stowers has failed to provide all relevant documents in the record on appeal.to the extent the record is incomplete,we construe it against him.see mountain lion coalition fish game com.d,fn.
on september,a class action was filed,alleging that it was unfair for a hospital system to reap the tax and other benefits due to its charitable status,while providing few charitable services,and in particular while granting discounts to insured patients but dunning uninsured and generally impoverished patients for the sticker price of treatment.pollack sutter health,alameda.the suit sought relief under consumer protection statutes and subsidiary equitable and contractual theories.that case was coordinated with a similar suit whitehead sutter health,san francisco,and they were jointly restyled sutter health uninsured pricing cases,and transferred to sacramento county as judicial council coordinated proceeding no.jc.we call this the uninsured class case.
stowers had filed his first complaint on october,stowers sutter health,sacto,also referred to as stowers nco financial systems,and it was coordinated with the uninsured class case on october.according to his third amended complaint,in june stowers was hurt in a car accident,was treated at the sutter roseville medical center,and was billed.he alleged insured patients are given discounts,but uninsured patients,including accident victims,are dunned for the full sticker price.he described a class of uninsured patients from october,to date whose treatment was the result of being injured in an accident,who were charged unfair rates for such treatment.we call this the accident class case.
substantial procedural skirmishing ensued in the uninsured class case,including complex pretrial issues,massive discovery,and sutter health filing of a protective against the class plaintiffs to collect on their unpaid bills.
on june,the uninsured class plaintiffs moved for preliminary settlement approval.in a declaration,their counsel outlined the extensive course of the litigation,as well as several weeks of mediation supervised by the honorable coleman fannin,a retired judge.
the proposed settlement ends price discrimination against the uninsured.class members would receive refunds or discounts,and those with outstanding collection judgments would be able to get them reduced.for the class period beginning september,the parties estimated the retrospective relief at about million.not only would sutter health affiliates end price discrimination prospectively for all uninsured patients regardless of income,it would limit its collection practices,and provide free financial counseling and flexible payment terms,and expand its charitable care program.based on a lodestar of nearly million,the settlement provided for attorney fees of million dollars.
on july,stowers opposed the settlement,alleging the parties were secretly cutting him out of the deal,and the settlement was unfair in ways we detail later,but generally because he believed better terms were possible.
part of sutter health reply included a similar settlement agreement in a separate case styled tenet healthcare cases ii,judicial council coordinated proceeding,which had been approved by los angeles superior court judge wendell mortimer,it,too,provided that uninsured patients would not be charged more than insured patients,would receive financial counseling and flexible payment terms,and provided limits on collection efforts and retrospective relief.a third similar settlement had been preliminarily approved by san francisco superior court judge richard kramer,in dancer catholic healthcare west,judicial council coordinated proceeding.on appeal reference is made to a similar settlement of a fourth case franklin scripps health,san diego.no.because that information was not before the trial court when it made its ruling,we decline to consider it on appeal.see golfland entertainment centers,superior court th,fn,d.
on august,judge abbott granted preliminary settlement approval,ruling stowers lacked standing to object 
stowers is a plaintiff in a separate lawsuit coordinated with this proceeding and does not qualify as a member of the proposed settlement class in the sutter health cases.the proposed class consists of uninsured individuals that received treatment at a sutter facility after september.stowers alleges he was treated before that date and proposed a class consisting of uninsured persons who received treatment after october.
although omission of stowers and those similarly situated from the settlement may result in additional litigation or subsequent resolution on different terms,the proposal involves a resolution on behalf of a substantial majority of the plaintiffs,except those who may opt out of the settlement.those opting out of the settlement could litigate their claims in the coordinated action along with stowers.
judge abbott overruled the objection that the settlement did not provide fair discounts,in part because the extent of overcharging is a fact that is in significant dispute in this litigation.the settlement terms present a reasonable compromise based upon disputed facts.to streamline future proceedings,judge abbott ordered that stowers be given all discovery,except for personal information about settling parties and discovery to which objection was lodged and sustained by the court.
on october,stowers objected to the final settlement,alleging the retrospective relief was unfairly low,amounting to an average discount of percent,which in his view is grossly unfair and should not be allowed and the prospective relief is even more egregious than the retrospective relief because there was no cap on future cost increases.he cited a sacramento bee article about the case published on august,and argued sutter health was agreeing to a feeble settlement for publicity in a clever manipulation to maintain the status quo without real relief.in the referenced article a sutter health representative reportedly indicated that very little money will actually change hands.instead,sutter will likely write off significant sums owed by the patients.
stowers also challenged the proposed attorney fees because they were not adequately documented.
stowers also complained the settlement was reached in secret negotiations between some of the parties to the coordinated actions,and to the exclusion of others and this would cause unnecessary litigation.he attached nearly pages of discovery and other documents without clearly explaining their relevance.
appellant svenson represented by stowers counsel separately opposed the final settlement,claiming that as applied to her case it would not grant adequate relief she had been billed,the bill had been reduced to,but according to an attached review by peregrin medical review,it should have been.using the definitions in the proposed settlement agreement,svenson would still be responsible for of the or which was twice as large as it should be.she also challenged the adequacy of the documentation of attorney fees.
although counsel declaration states the peregrin medical review is a true and correct copy of the document,there was no explanation of what peregrin medical review is,and nothing to show that whoever prepared the document has any expertise in evaluating medical bills.the document does contain the following statement 
this bill has been reviewed in compliance with the usual,customary and reasonable charges by postal zip codes for procedures performed update ama physicians current procedural terminology cpt descriptions highest cost awp of drugs plus a handling fee and markup.
there is nothing to show who reviewed the bill other than the name peregrin medical review or the basis of expertise of the reviewer or the company.in short,the document had no foundation,subd.a expert is someone with special knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education on the relevant subject.
appellant eustis represented by stowers counsel objected,essentially echoing svenson objections.sutter challenged his standing on the ground that he was insured and his insurer paid his bill.
we note here that appellant barnhart objected at the hearing his primary claim was that he had received unnecessary treatment,unfairly driving up his bill.
on october,concurrently with his objections to the settlement,stowers moved to intervene,claiming it was unfair and an inefficient use of judicial resources to exclude his action from the settlement.
sutter health opposed the motion on the ground it was a second attempt to hijack the settlement that the settling parties have worked so hard to reach indeed,stowers motion to intervene is little more than a disguised motion for reconsideration of the court order rejecting his july,opposition to motion for settlement class certification.the entire body of the motion to intervene is an exact reproduction of the arguments stowers presented in his july opposition.sutter health argued that stowers was not a member of the settling class because he was treated at a sutter hospital well outside of the class period.further,sutter has no interest in settling with stowers because his claims are extraordinarily weak,particularly in contrast to the claims of the settling plaintiffs.
the perceived weakness of stowers case stemmed from the following circumstances.we do not purport to adjudicate these facts,but based on the declarations and deposition excerpts in the record,sutter health could rationally accept them as true and if so viewed they would rationally support sutter health lack of interest in settling with stowers the insurer of the car that caused the accident gave stowers two checks,one for the amount of his hospital bill and one for an additional.sutter never billed stowers.stowers was a minor,so sutter billed his father,but his father is not a plaintiff in stowers suit.
sutter health also opposed the motion on the grounds that stowers had not filed a complaint in intervention,and he could not maintain two actions against sutter health.
the class plaintiffs separately opposed the motion to intervene,echoing sutter opposition and adding the claim that stowers motion was untimely.separately,they filed a motion supporting the requested amount of attorney fees,showing the hours spent by various lawyers.however,time sheets,that is,statements of hours performed by task and by day,were not provided by most of the attorneys,only summaries of total hours spent and the hourly rate.
sutter health then filed a memorandum supporting approval of the final settlement,which functioned in part as a reply to stowers opposition.out of class members,only objections were filed,and some of those were filed by people who were not class members.only members opted out of the class.the settlement was reached through arms length negotiations after extensive discovery by able counsel on both sides.in essence,both prospectively and retrospectively uninsured patients at all sutter health facilities will receive the same pricing as insured patients,with discounts averaging percent,depending on the hospital involved,and the program will be monitored for three years.thus,for those objectors who expressed concern about whether sutter might raise its prices in the future,the issue is not sutter prices but the extent of the discounts provided to the uninsured.under the settlement agreement,those discounts must continue to be based on the discounts each hospital is providing to insurance companies.further,a prompt pay discount of percent would be available on top of the other discounts for those who pay their discounted bill within days.
stowers opposition neglected to mention a key provision in the settlement sutter health will provide free care to anybody whose family income is less than of the federal poverty line,and substantially discounted care medicare reimbursement plus twenty percent to patients whose family income is less than of the federal poverty line.u ninsured patients whose family income is less than for a family of four can qualify for discounts beyond those provided for by the settlement.another provision not mentioned by stowers caps the amount an uninsured person has to pay at percent of annual family income.
on december,judge abbot made his rulings.
judge abbott found the attorney fees were reasonable because they were no more than of the common benefit,which has an estimated value of million.as a to test the reasonableness of this amount,judge abbott found that the lodestar was reasonable and consistent with the litigation,the hourly rates were fair,and the multiplier of is fair and reasonable.
judge abbott disregarded standing and other challenges to the objectors and rejected their complaints on the merits,finding the settlement was fair.the order recites in detail the factors considered by judge abbott,including the litigation and extensive motion practice,extensive negotiations over the course of approximately four months.other factors relied on by judge abbott were significant and extensive arm length negotiations between and among counsel for the parties,with the assistance of an experienced mediator a former california judge,the substantial relief provided by the settlement,the avoidance of costs,delay and risks presented by continued prosecution of the case,and the minimal opposition by the class members.
judge abbott denied the motion to intervene for several independently sufficient reasons stowers failed to submit a proposed complaint stowers already had a pending complaint against sutter health,and he can not maintain two complaints on the same cause of action at the same time his rights are not impaired by the settlement expanding the class to include stowers class would interfere with the rights of the parties in the sutter pricing action to conduct their lawsuit on their own terms and the motion was untimely because stowers knew of the settlement in july but did not move to intervene until october.
on february,stowers and svenson,eustis and barnhart filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
approval of the settlement 
stowers contends the settlement should not have been approved for three reasons it violates state law the discount is unfair as a matter of law,and the attorney fees were undocumented and excessive.
before separately addressing these three discrete claims,we note that stowers ignores the appropriate legal factors pertaining to approval of settlements and ignores the standard of review this court must apply.
we review an order approving a settlement as follows 
the trial court has broad discretion to determine whether the settlement is fair.citation.it should consider relevant factors,such as the strength of plaintiffs case,the risk,expense,complexity and likely duration of further litigation,the risk of maintaining class action status through trial,the amount offered in settlement,the extent of discovery completed and the stage of the proceedings,the experience and views of counsel,the presence of a governmental participant,and the reaction of the class members to the proposed settlement.citation.the list of factors is not exhaustive and should be tailored to each case.due regard should be given to what is otherwise a private consensual agreement between the parties.the inquiry must be limited to the extent necessary to reach a reasoned judgment that the agreement is not the product of fraud or overreaching by,or collusion between,the negotiating parties,and that the settlement,taken as a whole,is fair,reasonable and adequate to all concerned.dunk ford motor th,d.
assuming the burden is on the proponents of the settlement,a presumption of fairness exists where the settlement is reached through arm length bargaining investigation and discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and the court to act intelligently counsel is experienced in similar litigation and the percentage of objectors is small.id.at,d.
judge abbott explicitly considered the relevant criteria,and the record supports his conclusion that the proposed settlement was reasonable.the settlement followed extensive discovery and was entered into by experienced counsel after much pretrial skirmishing.out of over class members,objected and opted out.the settlement was crafted over many weeks under the supervision of a retired judge acting as a mediator.the settlement is a victory for the plaintiffs,resulting in about million in retrospective relief and an end to price discrimination against the uninsured,changes in collection practices,and charitable care at reduced rates or free depending on a given patient income relative to the federal poverty line,with a catastrophic cap by which no uninsured patient will pay more than percent of annual income.although not explicitly referenced in the order approving the settlement,judge abbott was presented with evidence that similar settlement terms had been reached in two similar cases.
the utter failure to address relevant factors considered by the trial court justifies the conclusion that stowers has forfeited his challenge instead of a fair and sincere effort to show that the trial court was wrong,appellant brief is a mere challenge to respondents to prove that the court was right an appellant is not permitted to evade or shift his responsibility in this manner.estate of palmer d.further,as we explain in detail,the statement of facts is improperly skewed.see foreman clark fallon cal d.
now we turn to stowers specific claims.
violation of state law 
effective january,after the settlement,a statute took effect which overlaps with some of the provisions of the settlement.stowers claims the settlement is unlawful because it conflicts with that new law.
putting aside the fact that this issue was not raised in the trial court but see beyer tahoe sands resort th,d party can not ordinarily change theories on appeal,we reject stowers ad hominem claim that the settlement was rushed to take effect in order to evade the new law.the record does not support this claim.
we next observe,as class plaintiffs point out,that a settlement must be evaluated in light of the law applicable at the time of settlement.dawson pastrick cir,to allow changes or clarifications in the law to upset a settlement would be contrary to the established policy of encouraging settlements and frequently would allow a party to back out of a position shepherd park citizens general cinema beverages,it would be a positive disincentive to settlements if litigants knew an accord were vulnerable to ordinary changes in the law.stowers assumes we have the power and duty to reexamine the settlement in light of the new law,but does not explain why this is so.
further,sutter health points out that in addition to provisions of the settlement that are superior to the new law,the settlement itself provides 
nothing in this agreement shall require sutter to take any action,or to refrain from taking any action,that would violate in any way the provisions of any statute,regulation or other law of any kind,including any statute,regulation or law that becomes effective after the effective date.
in such event,sutter health would seek court approval for a modification to the settlement in order to conform to the new law.thus,if any member of the class believes sutter health is violating some law,she or he is free to compel compliance with this provision.
nonetheless,we briefly address stowers claim,because portions of it are replicated in other parts of the briefs.
health and safety code section was enacted in and slightly amended in.subdivision d now provides 
each hospital shall limit expected payment for services it provides to any patient at or below percent of the federal poverty level,as defined in subdivision b of section,eligible under its discount payment policy to the amount of payment the hospital would expect,in good faith,to receive for providing services from medicare,healthy families,or any other health program of health benefits in which the hospital participates,whichever is greater.if the hospital provides a service for which there is no established payment by medicare or any other program of health benefits in which the hospital participates,the hospital shall establish an appropriate discounted payment.stats,ch.
legally,we see no reason why this statute would apply to the retrospective relief provided by the settlement.stowers claims that because the settlement requires recalculation of past bills,that recalculation must take place in accordance with the current law.we disagree.
a statute is presumed not to operate retrospectively.evangelatos superior court cal d,california of corrections state personnel bd.th,d.the recalculation of bills pursuant to the settlement is a voluntary change in the existing contractual rights of the parties,but applying a statute to change the amount of the bills would impair contractual obligations.see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.constitutional law.we construe statutes to avoid constitutional doubt.palermo stockton theatres,cal d,walton city of red bluff th,d.therefore,we do not read the statute as having a retrospective effect.stowers does not make any reasoned claim that the statutory language supports his view.accordingly,we see no ambiguity in the statute and deny sutter health motion for judicial notice of certain legislative materials.see kaufman broad communities,performance plastering,th,d.
factually,stowers claim that the settlement violates the new statute rests on inaccurate or irrelevant portions of the record on appeal.because he reiterates these facts at other points in his briefs,we address them in some detail here.
first,stowers claims sutter cost to charge ratio for all payers was.but the cost of services was not the issue in the lawsuit,it was the disparity in billing between insured and uninsured patients.further the page in the record cited by stowers in support of this claim is ambiguous,at best it is to the deposition of a jeffery sprague,who was most knowledgeable about sutter health charging and collection practices.the deposition page cited begins in the middle of a discussion about a question on a previous page which is not in the record.here is the excerpt,which follows a discussion between counsel about medicare as opposed to overall payers
