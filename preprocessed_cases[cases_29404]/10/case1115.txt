in at t mobility concepcion,the supreme court held that section of the federal arbitration act faa preempts the state of california rule rendering unenforceable as unconscionable arbitration provisions in consumer contracts that waive collective or class action proceedings,see discover bank superior court,cal the discover bank rule,reasoning that r equiring the availability of classwide arbitration interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration and thus creates a scheme inconsistent with the faa.concepcion.at.this putative consumer class action,filed before concepcion was decided,but pending in the district court when concepcion issued,charges satellite television provider directv and electronic retailer best buy with violations of california unfair competition law ucl and consumer legal remedies act clra.we must decide whether concepcion applies to the unique arbitration clause in the customer service agreement between directv and individuals who believed they purchased directv equipment from best buy stores and,if so,whether best buy,which is not a party to that agreement,is entitled to the benefit of the arbitration clause.the district court compelled arbitration of all claims against directv and best buy.we affirm as to directv,but reverse as to best buy 
a summary of the alleged scheme to deceive consumers is necessary to understand the relationship between best buy and directv and the claims against them.plaintiffs allege that defendants present certain directv service equipment,such as receivers and digital video recorders,as though they were for sale at best buy stores when in fact the defendants consider the transaction to be a lease rather than an outright purchase.plaintiffs claim that even after the defendants began offering the equipment in question only for lease,customers continued to receive receipts at best buy stores that suggested the equipment had been purchased most notably because the word sale was printed in bold,capitalized letters at the top of the receipts.even after language on the receipt was changed to include references to a lease,plaintiffs allege that the new language was buried in fine print that most consumers would not notice or understand plaintiffs claim that the defendants crafted oppressive and unfair lease terms,including unexpected and unreasonable fees.
when a consumer becomes a directv customer,he or she receives a customer agreement that governs the relationship between directv and its subscribers.section of the customer agreement,entitled resolving disputes,provides that all disputes between directv and its customers will be resolved only by binding arbitration.subsection c ii of the customer agreement provides neither you nor we shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in arbitration by or against other individuals or entities,or arbitrate any claim as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity.however,the customer agreement also sets forth a jettison clause if,however,the law of your state would find this agreement to dispense with class arbitration procedures unenforceable,then this entire section is unenforceable.the subsequent section,section miscellaneous,contains a subsection b,which reads 
the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement shall be governed by the rules and regulations of the federal communications commission,other applicable federal laws,and the laws of the state and local area where service is provided to you.this agreement is subject to modification if required by such laws.notwithstanding the foregoing,section shall be governed by the federal arbitration act.
directv has long maintained that the customer agreement means that plaintiffs claims must be resolved through arbitration.in march,it moved the district court to compel arbitration.directv argued that the law of named plaintiffs john murphy and greg masters residences georgia and montana,respectively applies and permits enforcement of the class arbitration ban plaintiffs contended that california law,which at the time included the discover bank rule,governed the enforceability of the customer agreement class waiver.concluding that california law applied,the district court declined to compel arbitration.we affirmed the district court choice of law ruling.see masters.directv,wl,at cir,unpublished.
because the discover bank rule rendered directv class arbitration ban unenforceable,section jettison clause was triggered,permitting litigation in the district court to continue for almost a year and a half.then,the united states supreme court decided concepcion,prompting directv to successfully move the district court to reconsider its prior order.piggybacking on directv customer agreement,best buy also successfully moved to compel arbitration.plaintiffs timely appealed.we review the orders compelling arbitration de novo.kramer toyota motor,cir bushley credit suisse first,cir the district court decision to grant or deny a motion to compel arbitration is reviewed de novo.
with limited exceptions,the federal arbitration act faa governs the enforceability of arbitration agreements in contracts involving interstate commerce.kramer,at.under the faa 
a written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction,or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof,or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract,transaction,or refusal,shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.
as the supreme court has noted,faa is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,accord concepcion.at.however,fundamentally an arbitration agreement is contractual in nature.rent a center,west,jackson,observing that the faa reflects the fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract.thus,the faa places arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts,and requires courts to enforce them according to their terms.id.internal citation omitted.
applying concepcion retroactively to the arbitration provision,the district court held that the class action waiver is not unconscionable,and therefore,the arbitration provision is enforceable.we agree 
plaintiffs argue that section of directv customer agreement,which requires binding arbitration,is unenforceable due to the jettison clause set forth in subsection c.they maintain that as of april,and april,the effective dates of the customer agreements to which plaintiffs are parties,the law of california would have found this agreement to dispense with class arbitration procedures unenforceable,rendering the entire section unenforceable.before,the discover bank rule had not yet been overruled by the supreme court,so plaintiffs cling to the notion that the rule still governs the interpretation of their arbitration agreement today.this argument misapprehends the doctrine of preemption and the rationale of the supreme court ruling in concepcion.
importantly,the faa meant what the court in concepcion says it means that the customer agreement class waiver is enforceable even prior to when the discover bank rule was nominally in effect.that is because the supreme court construction of a statute is an authoritative statement of what the statute meant before as well as after the decision of the case giving rise to that construction.rivers roadway express,see also morales izquierdo dhs,cir w hen a court interprets a statute,even an ambiguous one,and even when that interpretation conflicts with the court own prior interpretation,the new interpretation is treated as the statute meaning.thus,of the faa has always preempted states from invalidating arbitration agreements that disallow class procedures.the parties agreement that state law would govern the enforceability of the arbitration requirement was not an agreement to rely on state law that creates a scheme inconsistent with the faa.concepcion.at.
section of the faa,which under concepcion requires the enforcement of arbitration agreements that ban class procedures,is the law of california and of every other state.the customer agreement reference to state law does not signify the inapplicability of federal law,for a fundamental principle in our system of complex national polity mandates that the constitution,laws,and treaties of the united states are as much a part of the law of every state as its own local laws and constitution.fid.fed.sav.loan ass de la cuesta,quoting hauenstein lynham,see also brown investors mortg,cir the fact that the parties chose to apply the laws of washington,rather than the laws of another state,does not mean the parties decided that federal law should not apply.
it follows that,under the doctrine of preemption,the discover bank rule is not,and indeed never was,california law.simply put,state law is nullified to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.de la cuesta,at emphasis added.thus,plaintiffs contention that the parties intended for state law to govern the enforceability of directv arbitration clause,even if the state law in question contravened federal law,is nonsensical a contract can not be unenforceable under state law if federal law requires its enforcement,because federal law is the supreme law of the land,any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.const.art.vi,cl.section of the customer agreement provides only that the arbitration agreement will be unenforceable if the law of your state disallows class waivers,which california law does not and could not under the faa as interpreted in concepcion.
plaintiffs cite no cases to the contrary.for instance,plaintiffs rely heavily on american airlines,wolens,for the proposition that parties may enter a contract whose terms diverge from the requirements of federal law.in wolens,the supreme court held that the federal airline deregulation act,which displaces state laws regulating airline rates,routes,and services,see id.at,preempted claims brought under state consumer protection laws that served in effect as a means to guide and police the marketing practices of the airlines,id.at.however,the court held that the act does not shelter airlines from suits alleging no violation of obligations,but seeking recovery solely for the airline alleged breach of its own,undertakings.id.plaintiffs read this language broadly,arguing that when a party to a contract promises to follow the substance of state law,it is bound to do so even if federal law would otherwise preempt it.but wolens stands only for the proposition that contracting parties can enforce the substantive terms of a private agreement even if they exceed the requirements of federal law.wolens does not hold that contract language referencing state law transforms otherwise preempted state doctrines into enforceable private obligations in fact,it implies that the opposite is true.see id.at this distinction between what the state dictates and what the airline itself undertakes confines courts,in actions,to the parties bargain,with no enlargement or enhancement based on state laws or policies external to the agreement.
nor does plaintiffs position find support in the supreme court decision in volt information sciences,board of trustees of the leland stanford junior university.while volt does indicate that the terms of an arbitration agreement may be enforced even if they require procedures not contemplated by the faa,the unique posture of volt is a far cry from this case.in volt,the california court of appeal had held that,by incorporating state law into an arbitration agreement,the parties agreed to be bound by a california rule authorizing courts to stay arbitration pending resolution of related litigation involving third parties.id.at.the court only reviewed the california court of appeal construction of the contract provision to the extent necessary to determine whether it was contrary to federal law,and concluded that it was not.see id.at.the court held that,assuming the clause meant what the court of appeal found it to mean,that the arbitration agreement incorporated california procedural rules,id.at,the california rule at issue was not preempted by the faa.id.at.
the court in volt emphasized that the interpretation of private contracts is ordinarily a question of state law,which this court does not sit to review.id.at.as justice brennan dissent noted,the court declined to review the california court of appeal holding that the contract at issue would be governed solely by the law of the state of california,to the exclusion of federal law.id.at brennan,dissenting.thus,the volt majority had no occasion to consider whether the state court construction of the contract at issue was correct.here,plaintiffs contract interpretation arguments are squarely presented,and our reasons for rejecting them largely mirror the analysis of the volt dissenters.see id.at t he literal language of the contract the law of the place gives no indication of any intention to apply only state law and exclude other law that would normally be applicable to something taking place at that location.by settled principles of federal supremacy,the law of any place in the united states includes federal law.but even the california court of appeal nonprecedential analysis in volt is distinguishable because it proceeded from the premise that,i n the face of such a choice of laws provision,california law applies unless preempted by the faa.bd.of trustees of leland stanford.volt info,depublished emphasis added quoting garden grove cmty.church pittsburgh des moines steel,aff,see also volt,at noting that the california rule in question could be given effect without doing violence to the policies behind the faa.here,in contrast,the supreme court has expressly held that the rule plaintiffs seek to apply is an obstacle to the accomplishment of the faa objectives.concepcion.at.
under wolens and volt,it is clear that if directv had actually contracted with plaintiffs to allow class arbitration,it would be required to do so irrespective of concepcion.but directv did exactly the opposite.the customer agreement provides that neither you nor we shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in arbitration by or against other individuals or entities,or arbitrate any claim as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity.under these circumstances,plaintiffs argument that by referencing state law,directv incorporated the discover bank rule by reference as a substantive contract term is especially dubious.the parties agreed not to arbitrate only if state law required the availability of class arbitration procedures to enforce the arbitration clause.concepcion precludes such state laws.
for this reason,many of the parties various contract interpretation arguments are largely irrelevant to our analysis.for example,plaintiffs devote extensive briefing to their contention that the clause selecting state law in section is far more specific than the language selecting the faa in section.they likewise argue that the history of amendments to directv customer agreement over time shows that section reference to the faa is inapplicable to the jettison clause in section,and that ambiguities about whether state or federal law is controlling should be construed against directv as the contract drafter.these arguments are unavailing because,under de la cuesta and its progeny,there is no conflict between the reference to the law of your state in section of the customer agreement and the reference to the faa in section.thus,we have no occasion to choose which provision of the contract controls the enforceability of the class arbitration ban.
in answering the question whether the rule of decision is supplied by the laws of state x or by federal law,general doctrines and,accordingly,attempts by contracting parties to influence their application with clauses have no applicability because the relevant rule is supplied by the constitution itself a valid federal law preempts any state law purporting to regulate the same issue.roadway package,kayser.cir,abrogated on other grounds by hall assocs.mattel,see also volt,at brennan,dissenting observing that it is beyond dispute that the normal purpose of such clauses is to determine that the law of one state rather than that of another state will be applicable they simply do not speak to any interaction between state and federal law.for this reason,the reference to the faa in section of the customer agreement is largely superfluous to our inquiry.the law of your state language of section already incorporates of the faa.see de la cuesta,u.at paragraph provides that the deed is to be governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the property is located but the law of the jurisdiction includes federal as well as state law.thus,because the arbitration agreement is enforceable under concepcion,the district court did not err in compelling plaintiffs to arbitrate their claims against directv.
the district court determined that,although best buy is not a signatory to the customer agreement or any other arbitration agreement with plaintiffs nevertheless plaintiffs must submit their claims against best buy to arbitration.the district court relied on the doctrine of equitable estoppel,which precludes a party from claiming the benefits of a contract while simultaneously attempting to avoid the burdens that contract imposes.comer micor,cir quoting.mut.fin,llc bailey,cir.the district court reasoned that because plaintiffs alleged in their complaint concerted action on the part of directv and best buy,the lawsuit against best buy is inseparable from the lawsuit against directv.thus,the district court found it necessary to compel arbitration of plaintiff claims against best buy.
best buy argues that arbitration of plaintiffs claims against it is required under three alternative theories equitable estoppel agency and beneficiary.none of these arguments is availing.
equitable estoppel 
the united states supreme court has held that a litigant who is not a party to an arbitration agreement may invoke arbitration under the faa if the relevant state contract law allows the litigant to enforce the agreement.kramer,at discussing arthur andersen llp carlisle,accord rajagopalan noteworld,llc,d,wl,at cir.may.we therefore examine the contract law of california to determine whether best buy,as a nonsignatory,may seek arbitration under the theory of equitable estoppel.
because generally only signatories to an arbitration agreement are obligated to submit to binding arbitration,equitable estoppel of third parties in this context is narrowly confined.mundi union sec.life ins,cir.under california law,a party that is not otherwise subject to an arbitration agreement will be equitably estopped from avoiding arbitration only under two very specific conditions.our recent decision in kramer adopted as a controlling statement of california law the equitable estoppel rule set forth in goldman kpmg llp,d 
where a nonsignatory seeks to enforce an arbitration clause,the doctrine of equitable estoppel applies in two circumstances when a signatory must rely on the terms of the written agreement in asserting its claims against the nonsignatory or the claims are intimately founded in and intertwined with the underlying contract,and when the signatory alleges substantially interdependent and concerted misconduct by the nonsignatory and another signatory and the allegations of interdependent misconduct are founded in or intimately connected with the obligations of the underlying agreement.
kramer,at internal alteration,citations,and quotation marks omitted.this rule reflects the policy that a plaintiff may not,on the one hand,seek to hold the liable pursuant to duties imposed by the agreement,which contains an arbitration provision,but,on the other hand,deny arbitration applicability because the defendant is a.goldman,d at quoting grigson creative artists agency,llc,cir see also metalclad ventana envtl.organizational,d,reasoning that equitable estoppel applies where a plaintiff agreed to arbitration in the underlying written contract but now,in effect,seeks the benefit of that contract in the form of damages while avoiding its arbitration provision.we must analyze whether best buy satisfies either of the two exceptions to the general rule precluding nonsignatories from requiring arbitration of their disputes.
reliance on the underlying contract 
under the first goldman prong,equitable estoppel applies when the plaintiff claims are intimately founded in and intertwined with the underlying contract obligations.jones jacobson,d,quoting boucher alliance title,d.app.this requirement comports with,and indeed derives from,the very purposes of the doctrine to prevent a party from using the terms or obligations of an agreement as the basis for his claims against a nonsignatory,while at the same time refusing to arbitrate with the nonsignatory under another clause of that same agreement.goldman,d at.
plaintiffs claims against best buy do not rely on,and are not intertwined with,the substance of the directv customer agreement or lease addendum.best buy argues that,in addition to governing the general contours of the relationship,the customer agreement clarifies that the leased equipment is not the property of the customer,can not be transferred,and must be returned,rendering the existence of the customer agreement a necessary precondition for plaintiffs claims.but the customer agreement itself merely provides that,if a customer is leasing his directv equipment,it is and must be returned upon cancellation.the customer agreement is factually irrelevant to plaintiffs claims against best buy,which charge misrepresentations to customers at the point of sale.the complaint is replete with allegations of deceit by best buy that have nothing to do with the customer agreement.among other allegations,plaintiffs claim that best buy sold directv equipment at best buy stores in a manner that reasonable consumers would find indistinguishable from any other sale which occurs at best buy that best buy receipts given to customers memorializing the transaction contained the word sale at the top of the receipt in bold,capitalized letters and that oral r epresentations were made to some purchasers that the directv equipment was for sale.none of these allegations rely on the customer agreement or attempt to seek any benefit from its terms.
even if best buy is correct that plaintiffs claims on some abstract level require the existence of the customer agreement,the law is clear that this is not enough for equitable estoppel.in california,equitable estoppel is inapplicable where a plaintiff allegations reveal no claim of any violation of any duty,obligation,term or condition imposed by the customer agreements.id.at.applying this principle in kramer,we held that toyota could not compel arbitration of a consumer class action on the basis of arbitration clauses contained in the purchase agreements customers entered into with their dealerships.see at.we expressly rejected toyota argument that the plaintiffs claims were necessarily intertwined with the purchase agreements merely because the lawsuit was predicated on the bare fact that a vehicle purchase occurred.id.at.rather,we held that the plaintiffs causes of action,which,as here,largely arose under california consumer protection law,were not sufficiently intertwined with the purchase agreements to trigger equitable estoppel.id.at.likewise,here,the customer agreement proves at most the existence of a transaction plaintiffs claims do not depend on the agreement terms.the ucl and clra allow plaintiffs to sue best buy for misleading consumers regardless of whether or not they signed largely unrelated contracts with directv see rajagopalan,at,wl,at rejecting equitable estoppel theory under washington law where the plaintiff lawsuit stated statutory claims that are separate from the contract itself internal alteration and quotation marks omitted.
in short,plaintiffs rely not on the customer agreement,but on best buy alleged words and deeds in the course of transactions leading to t
