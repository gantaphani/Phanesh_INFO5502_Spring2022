in this putative class action lawsuit alleging wage and hour violations against an employer,the trial court ordered plaintiffs to provide the defendant with the names,addresses and telephone numbers of all putative class members who contacted plaintiffs counsel.for simplicity,we refer to the putative class members as class members.most or all of the class members who contacted plaintiffs counsel did so in response to a neutral letter sent to a sample of class members.plaintiffs claim the compelled disclosure violates the privilege,the attorney work product doctrine,and the privacy rights of the persons who contacted plaintiffs counsel.we agree with the last of these contentions.accordingly,we grant plaintiffs writ petition challenging the propriety of the trial court order 
factual and procedural background 
in may,petitioner kevin tien and another individual filed this putative class action lawsuit against tenet healthcare corporation the action seeks relief on behalf of current and former hourly employees of tenet who were allegedly denied meal and rest breaks,as well as proper payment for overtime work 
in july,plaintiffs served two special interrogatories,one asking for the number of class members,and the other asking for their names,addresses,and telephone numbers.tenet responded that there were approximately class members,but it objected on various grounds to the interrogatory requesting their names and contact information.
in february,the parties resolved the discovery dispute by stipulating to an order under which a neutral letter was to be sent to a random sample of class members selected by tenet pursuant to an procedure.under the stipulated order,tenet was to provide the necessary mailing labels to a neutral third party retained to handle the mailing.thus,while tenet would know the identities of the persons to whom the neutral letter would be sent,plaintiffs would not.
the text of the neutral letter read as follows 
to whom it may concern

you are not required to call anyone regarding this lawsuit unless you personally wish to do so.if you do elect to call,please be assured that doing so will not have any negative effect on your employment with any facility.original emphasis.
the neutral letter was sent to approximately class members.
in august,tenet served special interrogatories.one of the special interrogatories requested the names of,and contact information for,all class members who contacted plaintiffs counsel in response to the neutral letter interrogatory,while another requested the same information for other class members who had contacted plaintiffs counsel interrogatory 
plaintiffs moved for a protective order,claiming the information sought was protected by the privilege,the attorney work product doctrine,and the privacy rights of those class members who contacted plaintiffs counsel.in a declaration he filed in support of the motion,plaintiffs counsel,joseph antonelli,stated that o ut of the neutral mailers,his office received calls from class members,of which had retained his firm to represent their interests.antonelli stated that the class members who contacted his office had requested that their identities remain confidential and that some had expressed concern their current jobs would be in jeopardy if tenet discovered they had spoken with him.antonelli stated that o ne person in particular refused to give her name address to antonelli office unless the office could guarantee that defendant would not know that she spoke with antonelli.antonelli did not expressly state that he had provided such assurances to this or any other class member.
at the hearing,the trial court observed that the information sought was relevant because it could lead to the discovery of admissible evidence,as the class members who contacted antonelli have shown an interest in the litigation by virtue of their having contacted antonelli.after hearing argument,the court took the matter under submission.
a few days later,the court issued an order denying plaintiffs motion for a protective order.the court acknowledged that compelling disclosure of the names of the class members who contacted antonelli would impact their privacy rights,but it concluded those rights were outweighed by tenet right to the discovery.with respect to the privilege claim,the court observed that a client identity generally is not protected.while there are certain exceptions to this general rule,the court concluded they did not apply in this case.the court order did not expressly discuss plaintiffs attorney work product contention.
the court stayed its order for days to permit plaintiffs to advise the affected class members so they would have time to seek exemption from the order.
a few weeks later,plaintiffs informed the court that their counsel had sent a letter to class members who had contacted counsel office,asking whether they would consent to the release of their identities.of the,consented to the disclosure of their identities,refused to consent,and did not respond to counsel letter.plaintiffs stated they intended to disclose the names of those class members who had consented to disclosure,but they sought guidance from the court regarding the remaining class members.
the matter was discussed at a november status conference where the court reaffirmed its ruling the court ordered plaintiffs to provide tenet with the requested information concerning the class members who had consented to disclosure and those who had not responded to the letter from plaintiffs counsel within days.as to identifying information for those who had expressly stated they did not consent to disclosure,the court stayed its order for an additional days to allow counsel time to seek appellate review.
plaintiff tien filed a writ petition challenging the trial court order to the extent it required disclosure of the names of,and contact information for,the class members who did not expressly consent to disclosure approximately persons.we stayed the order and issued an alternative writ.we then received additional briefing from the parties and heard oral argument.
discussion 
the standard of review.
we review discovery orders under the abuse of discretion standard,and where the petitioner seeks relief from a discovery order that may undermine a privilege,we review the trial court order by way of extraordinary writ.kleitman superior court th,d.where there is a basis for the trial court ruling and it is supported by the evidence,a reviewing court will not substitute its opinion for that of the trial court.citation.the trial court determination will be set aside only when it has been demonstrated that there was no legal justification for the order granting or denying the discovery in question.citations.lipton superior court th,d.we defer to the court factual findings concerning privilege if they are supported by substantial evidence.scripps health superior court th,d,original brackets.where the facts are undisputed,the privilege claim is one of law which is reviewed de novo.see sierra vista hospital superior court d.
the discovery sought by tenet is relevant.
the scope of discovery is very broad.a ny party may obtain discovery regarding any matter,not privileged,that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.code civ.this right to discovery includes the right to obtain the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter.ibid.
although plaintiffs questioned tenet need for the discovery at issue in this writ proceeding,it does not appear that they expressly argued before the trial court or in their petition that the discovery should not be permitted because it is irrelevant.as a matter of caution,however,we address the question.
although it is not necessarily the case,it is reasonable to assume that at least some of the class members who contacted plaintiffs counsel may have relevant information about the issues in the case beyond the mere fact that they are class members.it is also reasonable to assume that at least some of these class members have more information than other class members who did not contact plaintiffs counsel.given the deference accorded to the trial court discretion in matters of relevance in discovery rosso,johnson,rosso ebersold superior court d.rosso,and the broad scope of the discovery statutes,we can not say the trial court abused its discretion in concluding the discovery was relevant.
compelling disclosure of the identities of class members who contacted plaintiffs counsel does not violate the attorney work product doctrine.
the scope of the attorney work product privilege is codified in code of civil procedure section,which provides 
a a writing that reflects an attorney impressions,conclusions,opinions,or legal research or theories is not discoverable under any circumstances.
b the work product of an attorney,other than a writing described in subdivision a,is not discoverable unless the court determines that denial of discovery will unfairly prejudice the party seeking discovery in preparing that party claim or defense or will result in an injustice.
we fail to see how the names of class members who contacted plaintiffs counsel constitute the work product of plaintiffs counsel.indeed,the petition offers no explanation why the information constitutes attorney work product.it notes only that the policy of this state is to prevent attorneys from taking undue advantage of their adversary industry and efforts.however,the persons who contacted plaintiffs counsel did so in response to a neutral letter mailed by a third party to persons whose names and contact information were provided by tenet.plaintiffs counsel was merely the passive recipient of some telephone calls.therefore,the trial court discovery order does not violate the attorney work product doctrine.
compelling disclosure of the identities of class members who contacted plaintiffs counsel does not violate the privilege.
the privilege is a privilege to refuse to disclose,and to prevent another from disclosing,a confidential communication between client and lawyer,see also bus,subd.e an attorney has a duty t o maintain inviolate the confidence,and at every peril to himself or herself to preserve the secrets,of his or her client.c onfidential communication between client and lawyer means information transmitted between a client and his or her lawyer in the course of that relationship and in confidence by a means which,so far as the client is aware,discloses the information to no third persons other than those who are present to further the interest of the client in the consultation or those to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary for the transmission of the information or the accomplishment of the purpose for which the lawyer is consulted,and includes a legal opinion formed and the advice given by the lawyer in the course of that relationship.the term client is not limited to persons who retain an attorney.rather,it includes any person who consults a lawyer for the purpose of retaining the lawyer or securing legal service or advice from him in his professional capacity,see also hooser superior court th,d hooser the privilege applies to all confidential communications made to an attorney during preliminary discussions of the prospective professional employment,as well as those made during the course of any professional relationship resulting from such discussions.thus,for purposes of the privilege analysis,there is no basis to distinguish between class members who retained plaintiffs counsel and those who did not.
however,as plaintiffs recognize,i t is well established that the privilege,designed to protect communications between them,does not ordinarily protect the client identity.hays wood cal d.it is true that limited exceptions to this general rule have been recognized.one exception has been recognized in cases wherein known facts concerning an attorney representation of an anonymous client implicate the client in unlawful activities and disclosure of the client name might serve to make the client the subject of official investigation or expose him to criminal or civil liability.ibid.in this case,plaintiffs make no effort to show that this exception applies.disclosing the names of class members who contacted plaintiffs counsel will not implicate them in any unlawful activity and will not expose them to criminal or civil liability.
another recognized exception arises where known facts regarding an attorney representation are such that the disclosure of the client identity would betray personal,confidential information regarding the client.hooser,supra,th at,d.this situation arose in rosso,supra,d,a case upon which plaintiffs rely.in rosso,a woman responded to a law firm advertisement directed toward women who might have suffered problems arising from use of the dalkon shield intrauterine device.after communicating with the woman for some time,the law firm decided not to represent her,and it sent her a letter suggesting she contact another attorney if she wished to pursue the case and recommending that she do so quickly because of time limits that may be applicable.sometime thereafter,the woman retained another firm,which filed an action on the woman behalf against the firm that had placed the advertisement and one of its partners,claiming they had missed the statute of limitations.in discovery,the plaintiff requested that the defendants produce a master list of their dalkon shield cases.after the defendants objected on relevance and privilege grounds,the trial court granted plaintiff motion to compel production of the list.
the court of appeal granted the defendants petition for a writ of mandate.after acknowledging the general rule that the identity of an attorney clients is not protected by the privilege,the court noted that c ourts in a few jurisdictions have supported the view that in unusual situations,particularly where so much is already known of the relationship that to disclose a client name will betray a confidential communication,the identity of a client may be treated as privileged information.rosso,supra,d at,quoting,wl.the court then explained that b ecause the people who are on the master list of clients have answered an advertisement directed to women who have suffered injury arising from the use of a dalkon shield,revealing their names would reveal the nature of a medical problem,ordinarily considered a confidential communication.rosso,supra,d at.the court explained that disclosure of the identity of the client in the setting usually says nothing regarding the reason for legal counsel or the content of the communication with the attorney,quoting smith superior court d.however,in the case before it,disclosure reveals the problem of the client,making it one of the exceptional cases where the identity of the client should be protected.rosso,supra,d at.
in this case,disclosing the names of class members who contacted plaintiffs counsel will not disclose any personal,confidential information.it will disclose only that they are members of a class who may have been denied some employment benefits,a fact already known to tenet.and while it will also disclose that they contacted plaintiffs counsel,this fact,in and of itself,would reveal nothing confidential.
thus,we hold the trial court discovery order does not violate the privilege.
