plaintiffs want to represent all persons,authorized to work in the united states,who have been or are now employed at ibp plant in joslin,illinois.they appeal from the district court decision that their claim should have been submitted to the national labor relations board rather than a court.despite.c as soon as practicable after the commencement of an action brought as a class action,the court shall determine by order whether it is to be so maintained,the district judge dismissed the suit without mentioning the class aspects of the complaint.the two plaintiffs,as at joslin,likely are poor representatives of its current just because plaintiffs quit,but because the plant workers already have a representative a union certified by the nlrb.the claim in this case is that ibp wages are too low,and that sort of contention must be presented by the union rather than individual members of the labor force.plaintiffs request to proceed on behalf of a class of all workers shows that they seek to usurp the union role.but we are getting ahead of ourselves.
plaintiffs complaint alleges,and we must assume given the case posture,that about half of the employees at ibp joslin plant are aliens who can not lawfully work in the united that ibp not only knows in a statistical sense that many of its employees lack the sort of visas that authorize working here but also can identify which ones they are,yet winks at obviously fake green cards and other spurious credentials.ibp alerts its unauthorized employees to stay away the days when immigration officials conduct inspections.the complaint leaves it to the imagination how ibp learns these dates.when immigration officials do manage to catch and remove aliens not allowed to work or be in the united states,ibp pays recruiters to smuggle them back into the country and immediately them under new aliases and new bogus identification.moreover,the complaint alleges,ibp has arrangements with organizations,such as the chinese mutual aid association based in chicago,under which these groups refer known illegals to ibp for employment.the upshot,plaintiffs believe,is that wages at the joslin plant are depressed by about per hour compared with what ibp would have to pay if the labor force included only citizens plus aliens holding green cards.
if the allegations are true,managers at ibp have committed hundreds of felonies.we have no idea whether any of the plaintiffs allegations is accurate,though we do know that the united states has not commenced a criminal prosecution.still,the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,permits private actions for three times the loss caused by a pattern of racketeering activity.see c.since,rico has included among its predicate offenses any act which is indictable under the immigration and nationality act,section relating to bringing in and harboring certain aliens if the act indictable under such section of such act was committed for the purpose of financial gain.f.plaintiffs contend that,for financial gain a reduction in the wages it must pay,ibp brings in and employs illegal aliens,violating a a and thus,derivatively,rico.section a a makes it a crime to hire more than persons in any period with actual knowledge that the individuals are aliens described in subparagraph b.subparagraph b reads an alien described in this subparagraph is an alien who i is an unauthorized alien as defined in section h of this title,and ii has been brought into the united states in violation of this subsection.
two courts of appeals have held that similar allegations present claims that must be resolved on the merits.see commercial cleaning services,colin service systems,cir mendoza zirkle fruit,cir.without citing either decision,the district court nonetheless dismissed the suit for want of jurisdiction,see.b,on the ground that it is a labor dispute in disguise and must be presented to the nlrb.see wl,dist.lexis.the district court relied principally on san diego building trades council garmon,d.because commercial cleaning services was commenced by a competitor rather than an employee,garmon was not relevant to its disposition.but the plaintiffs in mendoza were employees that decision can not be distinguished so for reasons that we discuss later it matters that the labor force in mendoza was not unionized,while ibp staff not only has an exclusive bargaining representative but also works under a collective bargaining agreement.
jurisdiction is the first question,as it must be in all suits filed in federal court.the district judge described garmon as creating a rule of preemption and held that,because the labor laws preempt rico,there is no federal jurisdiction.this reasoning is hard to follow.federal statutes do not preempt other federal statutes,and,though one may repeal another implicitly if they are irreconcilable,rico was enacted after the national labor relations act.federal laws do preempt state laws,but preemption is a defense and thus does not affect jurisdiction.caterpillar williams,d gully first national bank.
garmon held that state law may not regulate conduct arguably protected or arguably forbidden by federal labor laws.that is a genuine doctrine of preemption,with a jurisdictional overlay federal labor law so occupies the field of labor relations that it is impossible to formulate a claim under state law.see avco machinists workers,d.this misleadingly named doctrine of complete preemption has jurisdictional significance in the sense that federal law dominance allows removal under b without regard to diversity of citizenship.see beneficial national bank anderson,d.yet plaintiffs filed their case in federal court,exactly where the doctrine of complete preemption directs litigants.federal courts are authorized to hear many disputes by,and others by the jurisdiction.see teamsters troha,cir.rico is a federal statute,and a claim based on it therefore arises under federal law for purposes of.
applied to claims in federal court,and arising under federal law,garmon has nothing to do with either preemption or jurisdiction.it is a rule of primary jurisdiction,allocating to an administrative agency the first crack at certain matters.see,marquez screen actors guild,d.and the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is implemented by means by staying rather than dismissing the litigation.see,arsberry illinois,cir.once the agency has completed its work,the parties return to court for the resolution of any remaining issues.here,for example,if the dispute were referred to the nlrb,and the board determined that labor law neither protected nor prohibited ibp conduct,the litigation could resume.dismissal for want of jurisdiction was inappropriate.
ibp has filed a,arguing that the district court decision should be one on the merits and thus with prejudice to renewal later rather than for lack of jurisdiction.yet although dismissal under rule b was inappropriate,it does not follow that decision should have been rendered on the merits abstention in favor of the labor board primary jurisdiction remains an option that must be considered.
garmon and its successors are principally about the relation between state and federal policy,but the doctrine applies even in cases that include issues within the labor board charge.see laborers health welfare trust advanced lightweight concrete,d.we applied this principle in talbot robert matthews distributing,cir,to hold that a rico action based on predicate acts that also violate federal labor law is incompatible with the nlrb role in implementing labor policy.but it was vital in talbot that the underlying conduct of the plaintiffs rico claim was wrongful only by virtue of the labor laws emphasis in original,something that can not be said of plaintiffs claim here.section of the immigration and nationality act is not one of the federal labor laws it the national labor relations act and is in some respects incompatible with it.although aliens may be employees for purposes of the nlra,see,nlrb,d,those without proper visas do not receive the same benefits under the nlra as persons whose employment is lawful.see hoffman plastic compounds,nlrb,d.when the predicate offenses of a parti
