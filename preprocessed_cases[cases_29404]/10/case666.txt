purchasers of crossroads systems,stock between january,and august,filed this putative class action against crossroads and three of its officers seeking recovery for securities fraud under sections b and a of the securities exchange act and rule.the action is based on several statements made by defendants relating to the capabilities of crossroads products and financial results for the first three quarters of fiscal year.the defendants moved for partial summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiffs can not establish reliance on any of crossroads alleged false statements under the theory of.we agree with the district court analysis as to most of the alleged false statements but disagree with respect to the allegedly false statements made on may,june,june,and july.we therefore vacate the summary judgment as to these latter statements and remand for further proceedings.
crossroads is a public company based in austin,texas,that designs,manufactures,and sells storage routers on january,crossroads announced that production was beginning on its third generation of storage routers,comprised of models,and.the release included details on several features of the new line of routers,such as interoperability,increased speed,and backup.over the next several months,crossroads made additional statements concerning the capabilities of its third generation line of routers.on july,crossroads released multiple items of unfavorable news,including the news that crossroads had issued a temporary of its products because of interoperability problems.after the july release,the price of crossroads stock fell by about.
in february,the plaintiffs filed this private securities fraud class action on behalf of purchasers of systems,crossroads common stock between january,and august,the class period,alleging violations by crossroads and its principal executives of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of.the plaintiffs alleged that during the class period crossroads made several material public misrepresentations overstating the interoperability and other capabilities of its router products that tended to inflate the price of the company stock.in addition,the plaintiffs alleged that crossroads overstated the company financial results during the class period plaintiffs also alleged that the truth about these statements was revealed on july and august,causing the price of crossroads stock to decline sharply.
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss under rule b.the district court denied this motion on august.in september of,this court issued its opinion in nathenson zonagen,cir,which clarified,inter alia,the rule in this circuit concerning the proof required to establish reliance in a securities fraud case based on.after completing discovery and deposing the lead plaintiff,crossroads filed a motion for partial summary judgment arguing that under nathenson the plaintiffs were not entitled to a presumption of reliance under the theory of their case.the district court held that under nathenson,plaintiffs asserting a theory are not entitled to the presumption of reliance where the alleged misrepresentations do not affect the market price of the stock.the district court concluded that an efficient market will digest unexpected new information within two days of its release.the district court used this window to determine whether the alleged misrepresentations sufficiently affected the price of crossroads stock so that the plaintiffs would be entitled to the presumption of reliance for various reasons discussed below,the district court concluded that the plaintiffs were not entitled to the presumption of reliance for any of the alleged misrepresentations.the district court then designated this partial summary judgment a final judgment and dismissed the plaintiffs case.

to state a private securities fraud claim under b and rule a plaintiff must allege,in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,a misstatement or an omission of material fact,made with scienter on which plaintiff relied that proximately caused the plaintiffs injury.nathenson zonagen,cir quotation omitted emphasis added.the supreme court recognized that requiring proof of actual reliance in class actions was unduly burdensome because of the obvious difficulty of showing that every class member individually relied on the alleged misstatement.to ease this burden the supreme court,in basic levinson,recognized the securities fraud theory of,d.under this theory,reliance on the statement is rebuttably presumed if the plaintiffs can show that the defendant made public material misrepresentations,the defendant shares were traded in an efficient market,and the plaintiffs traded shares between the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed.id.at,d the defendants may rebut this presumption by a ny showing that severs the link between the alleged misrepresentation and either the price received or paid by the plaintiff,or his decision to trade at fair market price.id.at,d.
during the discovery phase of the instant case,this court issued its opinion in nathenson zonagen,cir,where we stated,
basic plainly states that the presumption of reliance may be rebutted by a ny showing that severs the link between the alleged misrepresentation and the price received or paid by the plaintiff.this would include a showing that the market price would not have been affected by the alleged misrepresentations,as in such a case the basis for finding that the fraud had been transmitted through market price would be gone.
nathenson,at citations omitted.accordingly,nathenson held that in cases depending on theory,the complained of misrepresentation or omission must have actually affected the market price of the stock.id.at.the nathenson plaintiffs could not show that the price of zonagen stock was actually affected by the allegedly false statements,either by showing an increase in price following the allegedly false positive statements or a corresponding decrease in price following the revelation of the misleading nature of these statements.as such,the plaintiffs were not entitled to the presumption of reliance.
crossroads moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of presumption of reliance based on nathenson requirement of an actual effect on stock price.the district court noted that the price of crossroads stock either declined or did not increase in a statistically significant manner in the two days following the alleged misrepresentations made on january,february,february,march,march,april,may,may,june,june,june,june,june,july,and july.the lack of stock price movement led the district court to conclude that under nathenson the plaintiffs were not entitled to the presumption of reliance for the statements made on these days.the district court further found that the release of the truth of these allegedly false statements on july and august was not evidence that the stock price had actually been affected by those statements because the decline in price following both of these dates was statistically insignificant.in reaching this conclusion the district court compared the overall decline in stock price between the first day of the class period and the day before the july release because decline in stock price during the class period was,respectively,almost and greater than that following the release of the truthful information,the district court concluded that the decline in price following july and august was not statistically significant.
the plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in finding that they were not entitled to the presumption of reliance for each of the allegedly false statements made by crossroads during the class period.the plaintiffs concede that by looking only to the change following these dates they can not show that the price of crossroads stock increased in a statistically significant manner.however,the plaintiffs argue that nathenson allows them to benefit from the presumption of reliance if it can be shown that special circumstances prevented the price from otherwise rising.
the plaintiffs argument centers around the following statement from nathenson 
we also realize that in certain special circumstances public statements falsely stating information which is important to the value of a company stock traded on an efficient market may affect the price of the stock even though the stock market price does not soon thereafter change.for example,if the market believes the company will earn a share and this belief is reflected in the share price,then the share price may well not change when the company reports that it has indeed earned a share even though the report is false in that the company has actually lost money presumably when that loss is disclosed the share price will fall.
at emphasis added.
the plaintiffs argue that this statement somehow relieves them of their burden in a case to show that a stock price was actually affected by an allegedly false statement.we do not agree.this example merely recognizes a market reality that a stock price will not change upon the release of confirmatory information,information already known to the market.this reality,however,is immaterial to the question of reliance in fraud claims.reliance is an indispensable element of any fraud claim because it provides the causal connection between a defendant misrepresentation and a plaintiff injury.basic,at.the fact that a market will not the same information does not establish a nexus between misrepresentation and injury,especially in the context of where we allow this relationship to be proved indirectly.a causal relationship between the statement and actual movement of the stock price is still required.indeed,the example itself notes that when the truth is revealed the share price will fall.nathenson,at.it is this actual movement of stock price which must be shown by plaintiffs,and a plaintiff can not relieve himself of this obligation by referring to special circumstances in an attempt to explain of the stock price.id.for these reasons,we reject the plaintiffs argument that a showing of special circumstances will entitle them to the presumption of reliance.
on july,crossroads released several items of very negative news.the release stated,in pertinent part 
the company believes that revenues for the third quarter may be as much as below revenues for the prior quarter.
one of the company largest customers will not be ordering at the end of this quarter due to an imbalance in its inventory as it transitions to new products.to address this,crossroads and the customer have agreed to a rebalancing of inventory and movement to crossroads newer products.
during the fiscal third quarter crossroads products experienced interoperability issues in certain san configurations and in the company issued a stop ship as a precaution.a correction is in the final stages of testing and is scheduled to be released shortly.
finally,compaq informed the company late in july of its plan to transition out of the crossroads router solutions by the end of this calendar year and replace them with compaq own solution.
following this statement,the price of crossroads stock declined almost,from to.the plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in concluding that the decline in price following this statement was not statistically significant.furthermore,the plaintiffs argue that this statement revealed the falsity of crossroads previous statements and that the ensuing decline sufficiently demonstrates that the price of crossroad stock was artificially inflated,or propped up,by those previous statements.
we first consider whether the district court erred in concluding that the drop in stock price following the statement on july was not statistically significant.in reaching this conclusion,the district court compared the dollar difference between the drop in price following the july announcement and the overall decline in price during the class period.the district court found it significant that following the july release crossroads stock price dropped from to,a decline of,while the price of the stock fell from to,a decline of,during the total class period prior to the july release.the district court compared these two declines and concluded that the decline following the july statement was not statistically significant because the overall decline in stock price during the class period was greater than the decline following july.the district court relied on ieradi mylan laboratories,cir,where the third circuit came to a similar conclusion when the overall drop in share price immediately prior to the alleged revelation of the truth was only greater than the drop in share price in the two days after the truth was revealed.
the plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in determining the significance of the decline by comparing the decline following july to the total decline in stock price during the class period the plaintiffs argue that the proper method for determining whether a drop in price is statistically significant is to consider the percentage of value lost following the revelation of the truthful information.the plaintiffs point out that under the district court reasoning,even if the price of the stock dropped,from to zero,it would still not be statistically significant.
we find the district court reliance on ieradi to be misplaced.first,the portion of ieradi relied upon by the district court concerns the question of materiality.at.the presumption addresses reliance,not materiality,and the two elements are fundamentally different.nathenson,at.second,as the plaintiffs point out,under the district court method even if crossroads stock had lost all its value following the july statement,that loss of would still not be considered statistically significant because of the much larger decline of during the overall class period.indeed,in that situation the overall decline would still be greater than that following july.but the question is one of causation,and we believe the focus should be on the change in price following the release of the truthful information.in this case,where the price of the stock fell within two days after the information was released,we find the district court erred in concluding that this was not a statistically significant drop in price 
we next consider the plaintiffs argument that the significant decline in stock price following the july statement is evidence that the price had been inflated by crossroads earlier statements.as we have noted,the main concern when determining whether a plaintiff is entitled to the presumption of reliance is the causal connection between the allegedly false statement and its effect on a company stock price.nathenson makes it clear that to establish this nexus the plaintiffs must be able to show that the stock price was actually affected.at.this is ordinarily shown by an increase in stock price immediately following the release of positive information.we read nathenson to also allow plaintiffs to make this showing by reference to actual negative movement in stock price following the release of the alleged truth of the earlier misrepresentation.id.at.nathenson repeatedly emphasizes that the plaintiffs were not entitled to the presumption of reliance because the price of the defendants stock did not decline upon revelation that the earlier positive statements were misleading.id.at.because in nathenson there was no decline in price following the release of the alleged truth,nathenson had no reason to explain the requirements for succeeding on a claim where such a decline occurred.
we are satisfied that plaintiffs can not trigger the presumption of reliance by simply offering evidence of any decrease in price following the release of negative information.such evidence does not raise an inference that the stock price was actually affected by an earlier release of positive information.to raise an inference through a decline in stock price that an earlier false,positive statement actually affected a stock price,the plaintiffs must show that the false statement causing the increase was related to the statement causing the decrease.without such a showing there is no basis for presuming reliance by the plaintiffs.a similar problem arises where multiple items of negative information are released on the same day.for example,a company may make a false statement and later reveal the falsity of that statement and at the same time release other unrelated negative information.in this situation,to trigger the presumption plaintiffs must demonstrate that there is a reasonable likelihood that the cause of the decline in price is due to the revelation of the truth and not the release of the unrelated negative information.in the absence of such a showing the invocation of the presumption of reliance would be based solely on speculation.
finally,it is necessary that the earlier positive misrepresentation not be confirmatory.as we noted in our example in nathenson,at,confirmatory information has already been digested by the market and will not cause a change in stock price.because the presumption of reliance is based upon actual movement of the stock price,confirmatory information can not be the basis for a claim.
in sum,in order for plaintiffs to show that a stock price was actually affected through evidence of a significant price decrease following the revelation of the alleged truth of earlier false statements,plaintiffs must demonstrate that the negative truthful information causing the decrease in price is related to an allegedly false,positive statement made earlier and that it is more probable than not that it was this negative statement,and not other unrelated negative statements,that caused a significant amount of the decline.
turning to the summary judgment evidence in this case,we first consider whether evidence of the drop in price following the july statement raises an inference that the price of crossroad stock was actually affected by crossroads earlier statements regarding the features of its products.of the alleged misrepresentations made by crossroads regarding the features of its products,only those made on january,february,june,june,and june are and therefore actionable 
on january june and june crossroads made,positive statements that were allegedly false concerning the interoperability of its new line of routers.the july statement specifically revealed the interoperability problems crossroads was having with its routers.the plaintiffs have therefore shown that the positive statements and the july negative,truthful statement are related.but the plaintiffs are faced with the additional problem that the july announcement included other unrelated negative information in addition to information relating to interoperability problems.specifically,the statement informed the market that one of crossroads biggest customers,compaq,would no longer be a customer because it was developing its own line of routers,that another large customer,storagetek,would not be ordering any new routers because of an overstock in inventory of crossroads older routers,and that crossroads third quarter earnings would be almost below analysts estimates.comparing the relative seriousness of all the information released in the july statement,the news that crossroads had ordered a temporary of its products is by far the least negative information released that day.temporary glitches in technology products are by no means a rare or devastating occurrence.thus,in order for the plaintiffs to trigger the reliance presumption they must demonstrate the likelihood that the july interoperability statements played a significant role in the decline in stock price.the plaintiffs have not done so,either in their complaint or through their expert,hakala.in the face of the more serious negative statements unrelated to interoperability and without any explanation by the plaintiffs,we conclude that a fact finder could not find that the news regarding temporary interoperability problems played a significant role in the decline in price following the july statement.for these reasons,the statements regarding the interoperability of crossroads routers can not form the basis for a claim.
the plaintiffs allege that crossroads february statement falsely reported on the speed of its new routers the plaintiffs allege that this statement was false and misleading because at the time it was made performance tests had not yet been run to verify its accuracy.the negative information released on july,however,makes no reference to increased router speed.without a showing that the allegedly false,positive information was related to the negative information released on july,the plaintiffs can not demonstrate that this statement artificially inflated the price of crossroads stock.this statement can not form the basis of a claim.
the plaintiffs allege that crossroads june statement falsely reported that backup was now available on its line of routers the plaintiffs allege this statement was misleading because backup was not available on the line of routers when this release was issued.again,however,the negative information released on july makes no mention of backup or the lack of its availability on the new routers.without a showing that the allegedly false positive information was related to the negative information released on july,the plaintiffs can not demonstrate that this statement artificially inflated the price of crossroad stock.this statement can not form the basis for a claim.
we next consider whether the drop in price following the july statement may be used to show that crossroads stock price was actually affected by the financial statements made by crossroads directly and to analysts.of the allegedly false financial statements made by crossroads,only those made on february,february,may,june,and july are and therefore actionable 
the statements made on february and february reported crossroads financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year and detailed analysts earnings estimates for the fiscal second quarter.the july statement states only that revenues for the third quarter may be as much as below revenues for the prior quarter.the release does not report any concern that crossroads first and second quarter earnings may be incorrect.moreover,the july release makes no reference at all to crossroads first and second fiscal quarters.because there is no relationship between the statement made on july and those made on february and february,crossroads statements on these days can not form the basis for a claim.
the allegedly false statements made on may june june and july all concerned crossroads earnings for the third quarter of fiscal year.because the july release clearly concerned a significant revenue shortfall for crossroads third fiscal quarter,the plaintiffs have shown the requisite link between the july negative information and the earlier statements.the plaintiffs,however,are again faced with the additional problem that the july announcement included negative information that was unrelated to the earnings shortfall.the plaintiffs offer no evidence or analysis tending to show that the drop in price following the july release was likely caused by the negative financial news.however,unlike the news of temporary interoperability problems,we are persuaded the news that a company revenue will be below estimates satisfies the plaintiffs burden.news that a company earnings will be short of analysts estimates is the type of negative information most likely to cause a sharp decline in stock price.for these reasons,we find that crossroads statements on may,june,june,and july may form the basis for the plaintiffs claim.
we next consider the only purportedly false statement alleged in the plaintiffs complaint which was followed by a significant increase in stock price.on february crossroads announced a worldwide agreement with hitachi data systems to resell crossroads older model router.the release stated,in pertinent part
