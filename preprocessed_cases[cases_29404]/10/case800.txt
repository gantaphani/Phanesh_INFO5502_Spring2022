a putative class of plaintiffs,represented by mark olson,filed a complaint against the sheriff of tippecanoe county,tracy brown,alleging several first amendment violations and violations of indiana law in the tippecanoe county jail.olson filed for class certification at the same time he filed the complaint.shortly after olson filed the complaint and motion for class certification,the indiana department of correction transferred him out of tippecanoe county jail.because the transfer took place before class certification,the district court dismissed the suit as moot.olson appeals the dismissal on the ground that this case is inherently transitory for any possible named plaintiff and therefore falls within the exception to the mootness doctrine announced in gerstein pugh,d.we find that this case fits within the exception to the mootness doctrine carved out for inherently transitory cases and therefore we reverse the district court dismissal.
background 
tippecanoe county jail tcj is a temporary detention center that houses inmates awaiting trial,release on bail,or transfer to the indiana department of correction,or serving sentences of less that one year.the parties stipulate that the following statistics regarding the inmate population as of february,represent a typical portrait of the inmate population at any given time tcj housed inmates inmates had been incarcerated for less than days inmates had been incarcerated between and days inmates had been incarcerated between and days inmates had been incarcerated between and days inmates had been incarcerated for more than days and the average length of stay for the inmates was days.coincidentally,olson was incarcerated at tcj for exactly august,through january.
tcj employs a grievance policy to address inmate concerns.once an inmate files a grievance,the jail is responsible for responding to the grievance within seven days.if the inmate does not agree with the decision,he or she may appeal.the jail then has fifteen days to respond to the appeal.while incarcerated at tcj,olson filed grievances and grievance appeals.the jail never responded to any of them.olson maintained a journal recounting the precise language of each grievance and each grievance appeal.olson grievances included two grievances regarding jail staff opening his legal mail outside of his presence,one regarding a denial of access to the law library,and one regarding the jail failure to respond to grievances.
on january,while incarcerated at tcj,olson filed this complaint and a motion for class certification.olson complaint set forth claims for injunctive relief against the sheriff of tippecanoe county with respect to four basic conditions of his confinement an inadequate grievance procedure,in violation of indiana law inadequate access to the law library,in violation of indiana law inspection of mail from the courts outside of his presence,in violation of the first and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution and indiana law and inspection of mail from attorneys outside his presence,in violation of the first and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution and indiana law.with the motion for class certification,olson included affidavits of inmates detailing their experiences with jail staff opening their legal mail outside of their presence,denying them access to the law library,and failing to respond to their grievances.thirteen days after olson filed this complaint and his motion for class certification,the indiana department of correction transferred olson to a new facility.
brown removed this cause of action to federal court on january.on february,brown filed his answer to the complaint.on march,brown filed his motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court heard oral argument on olson motion for class certification on march,but reserved its ruling on the class certification issue pending a ruling on brown motion for judgment on the pleadings.on june,days after the initial filing of this cause of action,the district court granted brown motion for judgment on the pleadings holding that olson transfer away from tcj rendered this cause of action moot.
this appeal follows.
ii.discussion 
whether a case is moot is a question of law which we review de novo.franzoni hartmarx,cir.a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.united states parole commission geraghty,d.
it is without question that this case would be moot if olson had brought his claims individually.olson only sought injunctive relief and is no longer subject to the conditions that formed the basis of his complaint.therefore,the controversy is resolved in relation to olson.however,olson filed for class certification while he was a party to a live controversy.this fact would generally not save a cause of action from becoming moot upon the termination of the named plaintiff claims prior to the certification of the class.however,timely filing for class certification can save a cause of action if it falls within the exception to the mootness doctrine announced in gerstein pugh,d.the issue before this court is whether olson claim is so inherently transitory that it is uncertain that any member of the class would maintain a live controversy long enough for a judge to certify a class.if so,then this case is not moot for the purpose of class certification.
in gerstein,the court addressed the issue of class certification for florida prisoners seeking a declaratory judgment that they had a constitutional right to a probable cause hearing for pretrial detention.before reaching the substantive issues,the court addressed whether it had jurisdiction to hear the claim.faced with a situation where it was likely that none of the named plaintiffs had a live claim at the time of the class certification decision,the gerstein court specifically addressed the problem of mootness for class claims brought by detainees.the court found that the case was not moot,reasoning,
at the time the complaint was filed,the named respondents were members of a class of persons detained without a judicial probable cause determination,but the record does not indicate whether any of them were still in custody awaiting trial when the district court certified the class.such a showing ordinarily would be required to avoid mootness under sonsa.but this case is a suitable exception to that requirement.the length of pretrial custody can not be ascertained at the outset,and it may be ended at any time by release on recognizance,dismissal of the charges,or a guilty plea,as well as by acquittal or conviction after trial.it is by no means certain that any given individual,named as plaintiff,would be in pretrial custody long enough for a district judge to certify the class.moreover,in this case the constant existence of a class of persons suffering the deprivation is certain.the attorney representing the named respondents is a public defender,and we can safely assume that he has other clients with a continuing live interest in this case.
at.internal citations omitted.a number of subsequent supreme court cases have reiterated and clarified the exception to the mootness doctrine announced in gerstein.see,swisher brady,d county of riverside mclaughlin,d.in swisher,the court affirmed a district court decision to certify a class of juveniles involved in the juvenile court system despite the fact that the named plaintiff claims were moot at the time of the decision.the court in swisher relied on gerstein predecessor,sosna iowa,d,to find 
there may be cases in which the controversy involving the named plaintiff is such that it becomes moot as to them before the district court can reasonably be expected to rule on a certification motion.in such instances,whether certification can be said to relate back to the filing of the complaint may depend on upon the circumstances of the particular case and especially the reality of the claim that otherwise the issue would evade review.
