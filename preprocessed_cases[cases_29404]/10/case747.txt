in,ronald berry founded a summer program for disadvantaged youth called government.this program was funded in part by the urban county government lfucg.numerous former teenagers who participated in government now claim that lfucg continued to support the program even after learning that berry was sexually molesting them,and that lfucg knowingly concealed berry conduct for political reasons.
these appeals arise from the plaintiffs attempt to maintain a lawsuit against lfucg.although several procedural issues are raised,the key issue is whether to vacate two orders dismissing earlier lawsuits against lfucg brought by berry victims.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court in guy et lfucg,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
from until,lfucg provided funding for government,a summer program founded by ronald berry.the purpose of the program was to provide summer employment for disadvantaged area youth.according to many of the program participants,however,berry physically,mentally,and sexually abused them,with the latest acts of abuse occurring in may of.berry was subsequently convicted on counts of sodomy and abuse of minors in criminal proceedings brought by the commonwealth of kentucky.
the plaintiffs in the present case,former government participants,claim that lfucg knowingly concealed and facilitated the abuse.specifically,they allege that lfucg officials were informed of the abuse on a number of occasions,and that at least one lfucg official actually witnessed one of berry sexual outings.nevertheless,lfucg continued to fund government and is alleged to have actively concealed berry behavior.the plaintiffs further allege that lfucg retained berry as the director of the program even after lfucg officials were aware of the abuse,and that at least one mayor of lexington refused to cut off funding or expose berry because doing so would not have been politically sustainable.
procedural background 
on october,the four victims who initiated the criminal charges against berry keith rene guy,barry lynn demus,octavius gillis,and christopher andrew williams filed a class action lawsuit against lfucg,alleging that it had been both aware of and deliberately indifferent to the abuse.this suit,guy et lfucg,is hereinafter referred to as guy.but in january of,before any determination was made as to the certification of the class,the guy plaintiffs with the exception of guy himself settled with lfucg and joined in the defense motion to dismiss the case.on january,craig johnson and david jones,two victims who were not among the guy plaintiffs,moved to have notice of the dismissal provided to the putative class members pursuant to rule e of the federal rules of civil procedure.this request for notice was rejected by the district court in an april,order that provides the following rationale 
four named plaintiffs brought the instant case and jones and johnson moved to intervene.considering that this lawsuit was filed in october and that there has been an enormous amount of publicity about the case,the court believes that it is unlikely that many more alleged victims will come forward.accordingly,the court finds that the class is not so numerous that joinder is impracticable.since the class fails to meet the prerequisites of rule a,notice to putative class members is not warranted.
as demonstrated by the later filings related to this case,however,the district court reasoning was based on faulty assumptions.nearly putative class members came forward within two years after the district court april,guy order that dismissed the case.guy,johnson,and jones all appealed.
as discussed in greater detail below,johnson and jones eventually settled.guy appeal,however,was considered by a prior panel of this court in guy urban county gov t,wl cir,unpublished.the panel concluded that guy lacked standing to pursue the claim with respect to the notice requirement.similarly,the panel concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding guy to his earlier agreement to settle his case.it therefore affirmed the judgment of the district court in guy.
on may,johnson,jones,and seven other john does filed a second complaint that contained the same allegations as in guy.this action,doe lfucg,is hereinafter referred to as doe doe i was settled some two years later,on june.the district court again failed to provide any notice to putative class members when the parties settled,and the case was dismissed.no one,however,requested that notice be provided,and there is nothing in the record to demonstrate that the district court even considered the applicability of rule e.johnson,jones,and lfucg subsequently filed a joint motion to dismiss johnson and jones outstanding appeal in guy.the motion was granted by this court in january of.
on september,john does who are included in the present appeal filed a third class action case,making the same allegations as in guy and doe i,as well as various claims under federal racketeering laws.this action,doe lfucg,is hereinafter referred to as doe ii.the district court,on april,dismissed doe ii as being barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
discovery and attorney fees 
at a scheduling conference in doe ii,the district court gave both parties days to conduct discovery on the issue of whether the case was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.although the does did not initially object to the deadline,and even failed to depose certain parties out of professional courtesy,they subsequently moved for an extension of time to conduct more discovery on lfucg alleged concealment of berry abuse.the district court denied the motion,noting that extensive discovery had already been conducted on the concealment issue and chastising the does for permitt ing the opportunity to depose the desired parties to slip through their fingers even as they held that opportunity in their hands.
after successfully opposing the does motion to compel during this discovery period,lfucg moved to recover its attorney fees on that motion.the district court held that the does motion to compel had not been substantially justified,and thus awarded lfucg in attorney fees.
on the same date that doe ii was dismissed,new john does who are also included in the present appeal filed still another case,again repeating the same allegations as in guy,doe i,and doe ii.this action,doe lfucg,is hereinafter referred to as doe iii.doe iii was dismissed over a year later by the district court on november,as being by the applicable statute of limitations.
doe miller 
the new does also filed a separate action,doe miller,in which they moved to intervene in the earlier guy and doe i cases pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.they contend that the lack of notice to the putative class members violated their right to the due process of law,making the judgments in those cases void.the does claims in doe miller were rejected by the district court in an order entered on october.
three related appeals have arisen from this procedural morass.doe miller has been consolidated with guy lfucg.the third appeal is doe lfucg.

b.the does motion under rule b with respect to their rule e notice claims 
by failing to provide notice to the putative class members in guy and doe i,the district court is alleged to have acted inconsistently with both the rules of civil procedure and with basic notions of due process.the does therefore request that this court vacate the guy and doe i judgments pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,which allows us to grant relief when an earlier judgment is void.a judgment is void under b if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter,or of the parties,or if it acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law.antoine atlas turner,cir quoting in re edwards,cir.
rule e b of the federal rules of civil procedure regulates the dismissal or settlement of class actions.that subsection,as it applies to the facts of this case in its formulation prior to amendment in december of,provided that a class action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court,and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to all members of the class in such manner as the court directs.e.as many commentators have noted,t he purpose of the rule is to discourage the use of the class action device by the individual representative plaintiff to secure an unjust private settlement and to protect the absent class members against the prejudice of discontinuance.alba conte herbert newberg,newberg on class actions ed.
most courts have found that rule e notice requirement applies to putative class members as well as to certified class members.see culver city of milwaukee,cir t he context in which class is used in rule e indicates that it is not limited to a certified class.even cases that refuse to apply rule e to putative class actions require notice to the members of the putative class if it seems clear that otherwise their interests would be harmed.see also birmingham steel tva,cir holding that once a district court has decertified a class,it must ensure that notification of this action be sent to the class members,in order that the latter can be alerted that the statute of limitations has begun to run again on their individual claims crawford roche,cir finding that rule e is applicable even if a class has not yet been certified,and that in deciding whether to allow dismissal or issue notice,the district court must consider,among other things,the possibility that potential members of the class would be prejudiced diaz trust territory of the pac.islands,cir adopting the majority approach that rule e applies before certification,and noting that notice of dismissal protects the class from prejudice it would otherwise suffer if class members have refrained from filing suit because of knowledge of the pending class action.
even the circuits that have not required notice to putative class members as a general rule have warned that failure to provide notice is justified only in instances free of prejudice and collusion.see shelton pargo,cir i n the settlement context of an action begun as a class action,a district court is not automatically obligated to order notice to all putative class members under the terms of e but should,after proper inquiry,determine whether the proposed settlement and dismissal are tainted by collusion or will prejudice absent putative members with a reasonable reliance expectation of the maintenance of the action for the protection of their interests.pearson skydell,cir w here a court has ruled under rule c that an action can not properly be maintained as a class action,the notice requirements of rule e do not apply,at least where the dismissal and settlement of the action do not directly affect adversely the rights of individuals not before the court.
ultimately,the general rule adopted by most federal courts that have addressed the topic is the one articulated in newberg 
m ost requests for voluntary dismissals of representative suits are made before there has been any class ruling.whether a voluntary dismissal in these circumstances is sought in connection with a proposed settlement of claims of the individual plaintiff only or in a nonsettlement context,most courts have stressed the need under rule e to examine whether any prejudice to the class will result if the dismissal of the action is allowed without class notice.
alba conte herbert newberg,newberg on class actions ed footnotes omitted emphasis added see also simer rios,cir w e believe that there are serious shortcomings with a rule that would require that rule e be applied to all settled class actions which have not been certified therefore,rather than setting down an absolute rule,we choose to place discretion in the district court to assess the prejudice to absent class members caused by the settlement,the institutional costs of notice and a certification hearing,as well as other factors relevant to this determination.emphasis added.if,upon examination,the district court should find that the putative class members are likely to be prejudiced on account of a settlement or dismissal,the district court should provide rule e notice.
lfucg,however,argues that the precedents from the context do not apply because class certification was expressly denied in guy and doe this position,however,is not supported by the relevant caselaw.the seventh circuit,for example,explicitly considered and rejected the argument that notice is not required when class certification has been denied in the case of culver city of milwaukee,cir.in culver,a group of white males brought a class action on behalf of themselves and others,claiming that they had been discriminated against by the milwaukee police department.the district court granted the city motion to decertify the class action on the merits.it did not,however,issue a notice of dismissal to the putative class members.
on appeal,the seventh circuit determined that the class action had been correctly dismissed.nonetheless,the court found that the district court had erred in failing to give notice to the putative class members pursuant to rule e.it noted that an important justification for the application of rule e was that t he filing of a class action suit tolls the statute of limitations for all the members of the class,but when the suit is dismissed without prejudice or when class certification is denied,the statute resumes running for the class members.id.at citations omitted.the court further concluded that,in the present case,the statute of limitations on the class members claims will run without their knowing it until it is too late.id.applying the rule that t he judge duty is to order notice unless the risk of prejudice to absent class members is nil,id.at,the court remanded the case to the district court for compliance with rule e,even though,as here,the district court had already rejected class certification.see also birmingham steel tva,cir adopting the rule in culver.
consistent with the above caselaw,the does argue that prejudice can be inferred from the great publicity surrounding the underlying facts of this case.they point to a line of cases standing for the proposition that prejudice can be inferred where the litigation has received widespread publicity,which increases the likelihood that putative class members have relied on the lawsuit in question.see,in re cardizem cd antitrust,wl,at,unpublished observing that a reliance interest can become a danger when
