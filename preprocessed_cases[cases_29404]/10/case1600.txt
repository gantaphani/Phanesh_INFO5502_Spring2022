statement of facts and procedural history 
in december,diane tucker brought an action against sprint pcs and sprint spectrum collectively,sprint alleging that sprint misrepresented its cellular telephone rates to consumers.bus.tucker was not a sprint customer and her claims were dismissed for lack of standing after the unfair competition law was amended to limit recovery to those who have lost money or property.bus.sprint customers pamela meyer and timothy phillips were substituted into the action as plaintiffs,and in they filed a first amended complaint asserting a putative class action against sprint.meyer was later voluntarily dismissed from the case and phillips became the sole named plaintiff.
in,sprint filed a motion to compel arbitration under a provision in its customer agreement mandating individual arbitration of disputes.code civ.the arbitration provision applies to all claims,controversies or disputes including claims relating to services and advertising,and precludes resolution of disputes on a basis.under the terms of the provision,the federal arbitration act faa,not california law,govern s all questions of whether a claim is subject to arbitration.
plaintiff opposed the motion arguing,among other things,that the class action waiver is unconscionable.plaintiff relied upon discover bank superior court cal th,d,discover bank,which held that waivers in consumer contracts of adhesion are unenforceable under certain circumstances.in discover bank,the california supreme court also concluded that the faa does not preempt california law in this respect.ibid.basing its decision on discover bank,the trial court denied sprint motion to compel arbitration.sprint did not appeal that order.
in,the trial court certified a class of all sprint consumer and business subscribers who contracted with sprint in california for wireless telephone service between may and june.in,the united states supreme court granted certiorari in another cellular telephone company class action in which the court applied the discover bank rule to hold a class action waiver unconscionable.concepcion,supra,at.at.sprint moved to stay the proceedings in this case pending resolution of concepcion,arguing that a reversal in concepcion likely would require this court to reconsider the order denying sprint petition to compel arbitration,and compel this case to a bilateral arbitration.the court granted the stay,excepting limited discovery.
in april,the united states supreme court issued its opinion in concepcion,holding that the faa preempts california discover bank rule on the unconscionability of class action waivers in consumer contracts.concepcion,supra,at.at.the high court held that b ecause it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress citation.california discover bank rule is preempted by the faa.id.at.at.the court consider ed whether the faa prohibits states from conditioning the enforceability of certain arbitration agreements on the availability of classwide arbitration procedures id.at.at,and held that it does.c lass arbitration,to the extent it is manufactured by discover bank rather than consensual,is inconsistent with the faa.id.at.at.
in june,sprint renewed its motion to compel arbitration based upon the change in law effected by concepcion.code civ,subd.b.sprint asked the court to revisit its order and to compel plaintiff to pursue his claim in bilateral arbitration.in opposing the motion,plaintiff contended that the prior order denying arbitration was res judicata,precluding sprint from relitigating the enforceability of the contractual arbitration provision.
the court rejected plaintiff contention and granted sprint renewed motion and,alternatively,exercised its own discretion to reconsider the prior order in light of a significant change in law.code civ,subds.b,c.the court observed concepcion has resulted in a significant clarification of the federal arbitration act and a major change in california law.it goes to the heart of the issue sprint raised early in the case.now,according to the united states supreme court,it appears the arbitrability issue was wrongly decided by this court insofar as it relied on discover bank.were the case poised for trial the court might not exercise its discretion to rehear the matter.but so little has been done,and the case has been so little advanced,that it appears reasonable to reconsider a matter as fundamental as this.having considered the renewed motion to compel in light of concepcion,the court granted sprint motion to compel bilateral arbitration by the sole remaining named plaintiff.the court directed sprint to prepare an appropriate form of order to address what further proceedings,if any,need be had in this court,including with regard to the class members whose claims were certified in.
sprint submitted a proposed form of order compelling arbitration by the named plaintiff and dismissing the class claims.plaintiff objected to the proposed order,asserting that class claims remain viable because there are class members without arbitration agreements and the arbitrator might deny enforcement of plaintiff arbitration agreement and return the case to the civil court.plaintiff also filed a motion for reconsideration of the order compelling arbitration.the court issued a formal order compelling arbitration between plaintiff and sprint but deferring consideration of the class claims until it ruled on the motion for reconsideration.the court subsequently issued an order denying plaintiff motion for reconsideration under code of civil procedure section,but indicated that sua sponte it would reconsider the entire arbitrability issue and ordered further briefing.however,plaintiff filed a notice of appeal before the briefing was complete and before the court reached the issue of how the claims of other class members would be resolved.
discussion 
i.the order compelling arbitration is not appealable.the appeal will be treated as a petition for a writ of mandate and reviewed on that basis.
sprint asserts that this court does not have jurisdiction to hear this appeal because an order compelling arbitration is not appealable.ordinarily,no immediate appeal lies from an order compelling arbitration and review of the order must await appeal from a final judgment entered after arbitration.abramson juniper networks,th,d.plaintiff concedes this point but argues that the order to individually arbitrate his dispute with sprint effectively rang the death knell for the class claims,making the order immediately appealable.the death knell doctrine is applied to orders in class actions that effectively terminate class claims,such as orders denying class certification or decertifying a class,while allowing individual claims to persist.in re baycol cases i ii cal th,d,safaie jacuzzi whirlpool bath,th,d.the doctrine is animated by the concern that an individual plaintiff may lack incentive to pursue his individual claims to judgment,thereby foreclosing any possible appellate review of class issues.baycol,supra,at,d.to preserve appellate review of class issues,the death knell doctrine permits appeal from an order that amounts to a de facto final judgment for absent plaintiffs,under circumstances where the persistence of viable but perhaps de minimis individual plaintiff claims creates a risk no formal final judgment will ever be entered.id.at,d.under this doctrine,an order compelling a plaintiff to pursue his or her claim in arbitration and dismissing the action as to all other members of the class has been held to be immediately appealable.franco athens disposal,th,d.
sprint contends that the death knell doctrine is inapplicable here because the class member claims have not been dismissed.plaintiff responds that the class member claims were effectively dismissed by the order compelling arbitration of his claim because the subscriber agreements of all other class members contain the same arbitration provision,so that each and every substituted class representative would be forced to arbitrate his or her claims on an individual basis.under such circumstances,no class claims could ever be litigated.this contention represents a complete turnabout from the position plaintiff asserted in the trial court.in the trial court,plaintiff objected to the proposed order dismissing class claims by arguing that there are class members in this case who have no arbitration agreement with sprint who could be inserted in this case as class representatives,and pursue this action.sprint argues that plaintiff should be judicially estopped from first asserting the viability of class claims to defeat a dismissal order and then asserting the nonviability of those claims to establish a right to appeal from that order.sprint argument has some force a party may be judicially estopped from asserting a position in a legal proceeding that is contrary to a position previously taken in the same or some earlier proceeding.scripps clinic superior court th,d.
plaintiff correctly asserts that judicial estoppel applies only if the party was successful in asserting the first position.aguilar lerner cal th,d.plaintiff disclaims success here,arguing that the trial court deferred ruling on the class claims and never adopted his position that claims of some class members survived the motion to compel arbitration.however,while in response to plaintiff objection the court did defer ruling on sprint request for dismissal of the class claims,the court never ruled on that aspect of the motion because plaintiff filed a notice of appeal before the court received the briefing it requested and had an opportunity to rule on the matter.we emphatically reject the suggestion that this court should assume what the trial court would have done when the plaintiff deprived the court of jurisdiction to rule by filing the notice of appeal.the trial court having been deprived of jurisdiction to determine the status of class claims,we shall not speculate as to what action it would have taken or whether its prior order necessarily foreshadowed the fate of the class claims.the order compelling plaintiff to arbitrate his personal claim is not appealable under the death knell doctrine.
nevertheless,immediate review of an order granting a motion to compel arbitration may be obtained by a petition for writ of mandate.kinecta alternative financial solutions,superior court th,d accord nelsen legacy partners residential,th,d.despite the manner in which plaintiff precluded the trial court from ruling,the unusual circumstances of this case warrant immediate review.the rationale on which the court compelled plaintiff to arbitrate his dispute presumably will foreclose a class action by all other subscribers with arbitration provisions in their sprint agreements,which undoubtedly is most if not all class members.if writ review is denied,the arbitrability issue raised here may evade review because plaintiff and others similarly situated have little financial incentive to proceed through arbitration to a final judgment entitled to appellate review.the issue presented is a purely legal issue that has been fully briefed by the parties and is a pressing one with relevance to other pending consumer class actions.refusing review at this point thus would result in a significant waste of time and judicial resources.in the interest of justice and to avoid unnecessary delay,we will treat the appeal as a petition for a writ of mandate and proceed on that basis.see olson cory cal d,explaining factors warranting writ review.
ii.an intervening change of law permitted the trial court to revisit its order denying arbitration and to issue a new order compelling arbitration.
a party motion for reconsideration of an order must be made within ten days after service of notice of entry of the order.code civ,subd.a.but that time limitation does not apply to a party renewal of a motion or a court sua sponte reconsideration of an order if there has been a change of law,subds.b,c.a party who originally made an application for an order which was refused in whole or part may make a subsequent application for the same order upon new or different facts,circumstances,or law,subd.b.a renewed motion may be brought whether the order denying the previous motion is interim or final,subd.e.and,i f a court at any time determines that there has been a change of law that warrants it to reconsider a prior order it entered,it may do so on its own motion and enter a different order,subd.c.even without a change of law,a trial court may exercise its inherent jurisdiction to reconsider an interim ruling.le francois goel cal th,d.when a trial court concludes there has been a change of law that warrants reconsideration of a prior order,it has jurisdiction to reconsider and change its order international ins.superior court th,d and may do so at any time prior to entry of judgment darling,hall rae kritt th,d.miscarriage of justice results where a trial court is unable to correct its own perceived legal errors.kerns cse ins.group th,fn,d.
sprint renewed motion to compel arbitration was filed following the change of law occasioned by concepcion.concepcion,supra.concepcion indisputably changed the legal landscape and undermined the foundation of the trial court earlier order denying arbitration.the trial court denied the original motion to compel arbitration in express reliance on discover bank.in concepcion,the united states supreme court held that the faa preempts california discover bank rule and declared class action waivers in consumer contract arbitration provisions enforceable.concepcion,supra,at pp.at.as the trial court here rightly noted,concepcion has resulted in a significant clarification of the federal arbitration act and a major change in california law.whatever views the trial court or this court may hold regarding the relative wisdom of discover bank and concepcion,we are all bound to follow the law as it has been interpreted by our highest court.
the trial court decision to grant reconsideration of a prior order and to permit renewal of an earlier motion is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.glade glade th,d corcoran city of los angeles d.we discern no abuse of discretion here.the trial court explicitly stated that it was exercising its discretion to reconsider its earlier order denying arbitration,observing that despite the great age of this case,plaintiff has done little to advance it to trial.the court acknowledged that were the case poised for trial the court might not exercise its discretion to rehear the matter.but so little has been done,and the case has been so little advanced,that it appears reasonable to reconsider a matter as fundamental as this.we concur in the trial court approach.in exercising its discretion in such circumstances,the extent of the preparation that has already occurred in the trial court proceedings and the proximity of a trial date are properly taken into account,along with the materiality of the change that has been made in the state of the law and the potential for prejudice to any of the parties.given the significance of the concepcion decision,the absence of for trial,and the failure to make any showing of prejudice,the trial court acted properly here in revisiting the earlier order denying arbitration.
iii.the court initial order denying sprint motion to compel arbitration was not res judicata,bar
