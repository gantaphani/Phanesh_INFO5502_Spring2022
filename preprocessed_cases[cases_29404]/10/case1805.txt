introduction 
joshua frey appeals from an order denying his motion for class certification.he alleged claims against trans union corporation under the unfair competition law,business and professions code section et the ucl,violation of privacy rights,and unjust enrichment.all further statutory references are to the business and professions code unless otherwise specified.frey contends he and others provided confidential financial information to trans union who then unlawfully sold the information to third parties.
we first analyze the trial court ruling with regard to the unfair competition claims.we apply proposition to this case and,as a result,we reverse the ruling on the unfair competition claims.proposition repealed the right under the ucl to bring a representative action without meeting the class certification requirements of section of the code of civil procedure.in ruling on the unfair competition claims,the trial court relied on a legal assumption that now is not frey could pursue a representative action for unfair competition without satisfying class certification requirements.because an order denying a motion for class certification will be reversed if the trial court made an erroneous legal assumption drug stores,superior court cal th,d,we reverse the trial court order denying class certification of the unfair competition claims,and remand for further hearing with regard to those claims.
the trial court denied frey motion as to the privacy claims and the claim for unjust enrichment.in doing so,the court weighed the respective benefits and burdens of certifying the proposed class.in applying the standards set forth in,supra,cal th,d,and linder thrifty oil cal th,d,linder,we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion.we therefore affirm as to those claims.
background 
we refer only to those portions of the procedural history of this case that are relevant to the issues on appeal.
in december,frey filed a second amended operative complaint on behalf of himself as an individual,as a private attorney general acting in the public interest under the ucl,and as a class representative on behalf of all others similarly situated who reside in the state of california.the second amended complaint alleged,inter alia,trans union is one of the largest consumer credit reporting agencies in california and the united states collects detailed credit,financial,and other private and confidential information about consumers for the purpose of providing credit reports to its customers amasses target marketing lists through its master file database later referred to by the parties as the list master file which stores the collected private information unlawfully misappropriated,disclosed,and sold frey and others private financial,credit and other confidential information to third parties for profit for at least eight years and violated the fair credit reporting act fcra,the california consumer credit reporting agencies act ccraa,the ucl,and frey and others constitutional rights to privacy 
the second amended complaint alleged the following five causes of action against trans union violation of the ucl declaratory relief as to violation of the ucl violation of the right to privacy declaratory relief as to violation of the right to privacy and unjust enrichment.we refer to the first and second causes of action as the unfair competition claims,and the third and fourth causes of action as the privacy claims.
in june,frey filed a motion seeking certification of the following class all california residents whose names and credit information were disclosed by trans union in the form of unauthorized consumer reports through the transfer or sale of,among other things,its list master file to any unaffiliated third party,during the period from august,to march.frey motion also requested certification of two additional groups as classes or subclasses frey additional request is not a subject of this appeal,and we therefore do not discuss it further.trans union opposed frey motion.the trial court denied the motion.

discussion 
for class certification and applicable standard of review 
in,supra,cal th,d,the california supreme court reviewed the established standards for class certification as follows code of civil procedure section authorizes class actions when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court the party seeking certification has the burden to establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among class members.citation.the community of interest requirement embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.citation.the certification question is essentially a procedural one that does not ask whether an action is legally or factually meritorious.citation.a trial court ruling on a certification motion determines whether the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.
we review the trial court denial of class certification for abuse of discretion.because trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action,they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification accordingly,a trial court ruling supported by substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous legal assumptions were made citation citation any valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order,supra,cal th at,d.
as the focus in a certification dispute is on what type of or likely to arise in the action,rather than on the merits of the case citations,in determining whether there is substantial evidence to support a trial court certification order,we consider whether the theory of recovery advanced by the proponents of certification is,as an analytical matter,likely to prove amenable to class treatment.citations.reviewing courts consistently look to the allegations of the complaint and the declarations of attorneys representing the plaintiff class to resolve this question,supra,cal th at,d.
the unfair competition ucl and proposition 
the ucl prohibits unfair competition,including any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.before proposition was approved by the voters on november,and became effective on november united investors life ins.waddell reed,th,d,s tanding to sue under the ucl wa s expansive unfair competition actions c ould be brought by a public prosecutor or by any person acting for the interests of itself,its members or the general public korea supply lockheed martin cal th,d.individuals were authorized under the ucl to maintain actions for unfair competition on behalf of the general public even though the litigation was not certified as a class action.kraus trinity management services,cal th,fn,d,see also massachusetts mutual life ins.superior court th,fn,d.
proposition amended the ucl by limiting standing to the attorney general,certain local public prosecutors,and any person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property.in addition,the ucl,as amended by proposition,authorizes only representative actions that meet the class certification requirements of code of civil procedure section.section,as amended,states in part any person may pursue representative claims or relief on behalf of others only if the claimant meets the standing requirements of section and complies with section of the code of civil procedure,but these limitations do not apply to claims brought under this chapter by the attorney general,or any district attorney,county counsel,city attorney,or city prosecutor in this state.
in denying frey motion for class certification,the trial court minute order stated,in part assuming for purposes of discussion that a class could otherwise be certified in the case at bar,the court concludes that a weighing of the respective benefits and burdens counsels against certification of a class.no substantial benefit would accrue to class members that could not also be achieved in a representative action under the ucl,and the burden on the court would be large.the minute order further stated with respect to plaintiff claims under the ucl,bus.et and causes of action,the court recognizes that in the event it is ultimately determined that trans union sale of certain segments of its list master file was unlawful or unfair under the ucl,the failure to certify a class will preclude the disgorgement of profits into a fluid recovery fund.citation.the court nevertheless concludes that the ucl claims should not proceed as a class action.the substantial benefit that can be achieved by this action can be achieved as well in a representative section action without the extremely burdensome overlay of a certified class.the minute order also noted,i n the case at bar,injunctive relief is plainly available in a representative ucl action,as is restitution to those persons found at trial to have lost an interest in money or property which may have been acquired by means of unfair competition.
proposition no longer permits representative actions under the ucl that do not meet the criteria of class certification under code of civil procedure section.if proposition applies to this case,the trial court legal assumption that frey could still pursue a representative action under the ucl,regardless of whether the action complies with class certification requirements,is now incorrect we therefore turn to the question whether proposition applies to this case.
the repeal doctrine 
in governing board mann cal d,mann,the california supreme court stated,although the courts normally construe statutes to operate prospectively,the courts correlatively hold under the common law that when a pending action rests solely on a statutory basis,and when no rights have vested under the statute,a repeal of such a statute without a saving clause will terminate all pending actions based thereon.the court held,i f final relief has not been granted before the repeal goes into effect it can not be granted afterwards,even if a judgment has been entered and the cause is pending on appeal.the reviewing court must dispose of the case under the law in force when its decision is rendered.id.at,see,any statute may be repealed at any time,except when vested rights would be impaired chapman farr d.a statutory remedy does not vest until final judgment a nd an action remains pending until final determination on appeal.
in mann,supra,cal d at page,a school district successfully sought a judicial determination that a teacher marijuana conviction constituted sufficient grounds for dismissal under former education code section,subdivision h.former education code section,subdivision h provided that conviction of a felony or of any crime involving moral turpitude constitutes cause for dismissal of a permanent teacher.mann,at.during the pendency of the appeal,the legislature enacted a new health and safety code provision precluding any public entity including a school district from revoking any right of an individual on the basis of a possession of marijuana conviction so long as two years have elapsed from the date of conviction.id.at.
the california supreme court held the new health and safety code provision constituted a repeal of the provision in the education code notwithstanding the absence of express language in the legislation saying so.the california supreme court stated,although the new enactment does not specifically refer to former education code section,subdivision h,and although repeals by implication are not favored citation,when,as here,a subsequently enacted specific statute directly conflicts with an earlier,more general provision,it is settled that the subsequent legislation effects a limited repeal of the former statute to the extent that the two are irreconcilable.mann,supra,cal d at.
in younger superior court cal d,younger,the california supreme court reiterated the well settled rule that an action wholly dependent on statute abates if the statute is repealed without a saving clause before the judgment is final.the court explained,t he justification for this rule is that all statutory remedies are pursued with full realization that the legislature may abolish the right to recover at any time.ibid.
proposition repealed rights wholly dependent on statute and without a saving clause.
as discussed above,the ucl has been amended by proposition to limit representative actions only to those cases that satisfy the class certification requirements under code of civil procedure section,and standing exclusively to those persons other than the attorney general and certain local public prosecutors who have sustained injury in fact and lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition.as in mann,supra,cal d at page,proposition directly conflicts with the earlier,more general and broader standing and representative action requirements of the ucl before it was amended.therefore,proposition effects a limited repeal of the former statute.mann,at.
the repeal doctrine still applies even though the electorate documents used the word amends as opposed to the word repeals in describing proposition impact on the ucl.see younger,supra,cal d,although cast in terms of an amendment to health and safety code section,the new legislation completely eliminates the earlier procedure for records destruction by order of the court,and the repeal doctrine applies.in addition,although proposition only partially amended the ucl,partial amendment of a statutory right does not preclude application of the repeal doctrine.see benson kwikset th,d the mere fact proposition amends only portions of the unfair competition law does not preclude application of the repeal principle see also younger,supra,cal d at.
the right under the ucl to bring representative actions absent injury in fact and regardless of whether class certification requirements were satisfied was wholly dependent on statute.younger,supra,cal d at.citing bank of the west superior court cal th,d,the appellate court in branick downey savings and loan th,d held the ucl,before it was amended by proposition,granted to persons who did not suffer competitive injury the right to bring representative actions on behalf of the general right that did not exist under the common law.in bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th,d,the california supreme court stated,the common law tort of unfair competition is generally thought to be synonymous with the act of passing off one goods as those of another.the tort developed as an equitable remedy against the wrongful exploitation of trade names and common law trademarks that were not otherwise entitled to legal protection.citation.in contrast,statutory unfair competition extends to all unfair and deceptive business practices.for this reason,the statutory definition of unfair competition can not be equated with the common law definition.italics added.
when legislation repeals a right wholly dependent on statute,the california supreme court in younger,supra,cal d at page,explained,t he only legislative intent relevant in such circumstances would be a determination to save this proceeding from the ordinary effect of repeal illustrated by such cases as mann,supra,cal d.italics added.in younger,the supreme court found the legislation at issue contain ed no express saving clause,and none wa s implied by contemporaneous legislation.ibid.
proposition does not contain a saving clause indicating an electorate intent to save ucl actions from the ordinary effect of repeal.see mann,supra,cal d at,a repeal of such a statute without a saving clause will terminate all pending actions based thereon.in light of the foregoing analysis,we join those cases holding proposition applies to pending cases.see benson kwikset,supra,th at,d holding amendments to the ucl enacted by approval of proposition applied to pending action on appeal lytwyn fry electronics,th,d same branick downey savings and loan,supra,th at,d holding proposition partially repealed the ucl within the meaning of government code section and therefore applied to the case pending on appeal bivens corel th,d without a savings clause,repeal of unaffected plaintiffs statutory authorization to pursue ucl claims is effective immediately.
in californians for disability rights mervyn th,d,the appellate court,relying on evangelatos superior court cal d,held proposition did not apply to preexisting lawsuits because proposition does not show an unmistakable intent that its statutory amendments apply retroactively.the court of appeal reliance on evangelatos is misplaced because evangelatos involved the statutory repeal of a common law right,not a statutory right.evangelatos,therefore,did not discuss the repeal doctrine,or cite or analyze either mann,supra,cal d,or younger,supra,cal d.
we reverse the trial court order denying class certification as to the unfair competition claims,and remand for rehearing on the class certification motion.
because we conclude proposition applies to this case by operation of the repeal doctrine,the trial court relied on a legal assumption that is no longer frey might pursue the unfair competition claims on a representative basis without meeting the class certification requirements of code of civil procedure section.the trial court denied class certification of the unfair competition claims in light of the remedies available in representative actions and after concluding a class action is not a superior means by which to address the alleged conduct.the court,however,did not decide whether a class could otherwise be certified in this case.we therefore remand the matter to the trial court to hold a further hearing on frey motion for class certification as to the unfair competition claims.we do not express any opinion on the merits of frey motion,and our holding is without prejudice to trans union ability to file a dispositive motion challenging the merits of the second amended complaint in light of proposition impact on this case.
the privacy claims and the unjust enrichment claim 
frey argues the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion for class certification as to the privacy claims and unjust enrichment claim because the court erroneously concluded neither nominal nor punitive damages would confer a substantial benefit on individual class members neither damages on the privacy claims nor unjust enrichment could be calculated on a classwide basis and i ssues of liability for invasion of privacy also would require individualized inquiry.we address each of frey arguments in turn.
the trial court properly considered the amount of nominal damages potentially recoverable,among other factors,in concluding such damages would not confer a substantial benefit on individual class members.
in the context of the privacy claims and in response to frey argument that nominal damages and punitive damages should be made available on a basis without individualized inquiry,the trial court stated,t he term nominal damages describes two types of trifling or token allowance for mere technical invasion of a right,without actual damage and the very different allowance made when actual damages are substantial,but their extent and amount are difficult of precise proof.citation.with respect to the first type of award,a trifling or token allowance for mere technical invasion of a right,without actual damage,such an award would hardly confer a substantial benefit on individual class members.
frey contends the trial court erroneously concluded that the first type of nominal damages,described in the order as a trifling or token allowance,would not confer a substantial benefit on individual class members.he contends the trial court conclusion ran afoul of the policy articulated in blue chip stamps cal d,which was that the court should not adopt a judicial policy that would permit a company to retain the benefits of its wrongful conduct because it exacted a dollar from each of millions of customers.first italics added,second italics in original.
the california supreme court in blue chip stamps superior court,supra,cal d,directed the trial court to vacate its order certifying a class action after considering,among other things,the minimal amounts due to each purported class member in compensatory damages.justice tobriner in a separate concurring opinion stated,t he problems which arise in the management of a class action involving numerous small claims do not justify a judicial policy that would permit the defendant to retain the benefits of its wrongful conduct and to continue that conduct with impunity.id.at.in linder,supra,cal th,d,the california supreme court observed that justice tobriner separate opinion in blue chip stamps superior court effectively clarified that trial courts remain under the obligation to consider the role of the class action in deterring and redressing wrongdoing.the supreme court explained,t he benefits and burdens of a proposed class action must be evaluated under correct legal standards.while the potential amount of each individual recovery is a significant factor in weighing the benefits of a class action,it is not the only factor requiring consideration.linder,supra,cal th,d.
thus,the california supreme court decisions in blue chip stamps superior court,supra,cal d,and linder,supra,cal th,d,establish that a trial court should consider the potential amount of recovery available to class members in determining whether to grant a motion seeking class certification.linder and justice tobriner separate opinion in blue chip stamps caution,however,that the potential amount of recovery must not be the only factor considered before denying a motion for class certification.by suggesting the trial court here denied class certification solely on the ground each class member would only obtain nominal damages insufficient to confer a substantial benefit,we believe frey has taken the trial court statements out of context.
a reading of the entire minute order shows the trial court considered several factors,including the size of the proposed class.the court noted,it is easily seen that this class definition will potentially include nearly every gainfully employed adult in the state,and many minors as well t he size of this limited class may be in the range of million.frey does not challenge the trial court estimation of the potential size of the proposed class.as further discussed below,the court also considered the degree to which issues of liability and damages would entail an individualized inquiry and the manageability of the case as a class action.see,supra,cal th at,d.in view of the court weighing of those factors,its explanation and its analysis,the trial court did not abuse its discretion by considering the potentially recoverable amount of nominal damages in denying class certification of the privacy claims.
the trial court did not err by concluding the determination of damages on the privacy claims and the amount of unjust enrichment would overwhelm the court with individual inquiries.
frey contends the trial court erroneously denied class certification on the ground that neither damages nor unjust enrichment could be calculated on a basis.in the order,the trial court stated,with respect to the privacy claims the,and causes of action,plaintiff has not been able to demonstrate any means by which damages for invasion of privacy cause of action could be calculated on a basis,or how the amount by which defendant has been unjustly enriched at the expense of each class member would be measured cause of action.this inability suggests that an award of monetary damages or an award of unjust enrichment would overwhelm the court with individual inquiries as to each class member damage.this issue alone compels the conclusion that,although common issues of fact are indeed present,the common issues of fact do not predominate as to the and causes of action.
the california supreme court in,supra,cal th at page,d,stated,the party seeking certification has the burden to establish the existence of both an a
