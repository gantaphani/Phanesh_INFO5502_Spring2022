plaintiffs,proposed class representatives,appeal from the trial court order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend to the class action allegations in their complaint against their homeowners insurance carriers regarding claims for policy benefits for damages incurred by the northridge earthquake.the trial court found there was no reasonable possibility plaintiffs could satisfy the community of interest requirement for class certification and class treatment was not the superior method for resolving the litigation.we agree and affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the lawsuit and class allegations 
the named plaintiffs in the operative third amended complaint are homeowners who were insured,including earthquake insurance,at the time of the northridge earthquake.diane newell,individually and as a proposed class representative,brings suit against farmers insurance exchange and insurance exchange collectively,farmers,and maria parra and barbara inkman,individually and as proposed class representatives,bring suit against state farm general insurance company the named plaintiffs allege with respect to their insurance carrier that they and members of the class they propose to represent were wrongfully denied policy benefits for damage caused to their homes by the northridge earthquake.through causes of action for declaratory relief,breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and unfair competition pursuant to business and professions code section,plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages,injunctive relief,attorney fees,prejudgment interest and costs.
the complaint is divided into subclasses,one against farmers and one against state farm.each subclass consists of all persons and entities who had or have an ownership interest in a residential structure that was insured under an earthquake insurance policy with the insurer defendant and who submitted a claim for damages to said residential structure arising out of the northridge earthquake and a the claim was reduced or denied based upon depreciation reductions the insurer defendant failed to explain the depreciation reductions b who were denied benefits based upon the contention that the damages were below the class member deductible c the insurer defendant failed to provide a written factual basis for the denial or reduction of the claim d the insurer defendant failed to explain in writing the available coverage e who still have pending an unresolved claim with the insurer defendant on their earthquake policy for damage arising from the northridge earthquake.the class is comprised of those individuals who were not represented by counsel and which counsel signed a written compromised settlement agreement between the class member and the insurer defendant,and which counsel was admitted to the practice of law in california at the time of the settlement.
the named plaintiffs allege they meet the requirements for class certification because the members of each subclass are so numerous that joinder is impracticable common questions of law and fact as to all proposed class members predominate over questions affecting only individual class members the claims of the proposed class plaintiffs are typical of those of each putative class member the proposed class plaintiffs are adequate representatives and a class action is the superior method to resolve the litigation because individual lawsuits would be burdensome and expensive for both the parties and the judicial system.according to the named plaintiffs,the common issues include the practices and procedures used by farmers and state farm in settling northridge earthquake claims.
the demurrer to the class action allegations and the trial court ruling 
state farm filed a demurrer to the class action allegations in the third amended complaint,contending plaintiffs could not satisfy the commonality or superiority requirements for certification and farmers joined in the demurrer.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,ruling,although plaintiffs have claims typical of the proposed class and are adequate representatives,they have not,and can not sufficiently allege a prima facie community of interest.the court found resolution of the common questions alleged in the complaint would require the court to make individualized determinations as to the insurer defendants liability as to each putative class member.for all practical purposes,the common questions alleged in the complaint would not predominate over individual issues in the litigation and,therefore,a class action would not be the superior means of resolving this dispute.the court reache d this finding after numerous discussions in the instant matter and after hearing six class certification motions,for which full class discovery was afforded,in other northridge earthquake cases involving the same plaintiffs counsel or equally competent counsel.
plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.linder thrifty oil cal th,d,denial of certification to an entire class is an appealable order linder.
contention 
plaintiffs contend the trial court erred by sustaining without leave to amend the demurrer to their class action allegations because there is a reasonable possibility they can meet the requirements for class action certification.
discussion 
standard of review 
in an appeal based on an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,t he reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.citations.the court does not,however,assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.citation.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d.
where the complaint is defective,i n the furtherance of justice great liberality should be exercised in permitting a plaintiff to amend his complaint,and it ordinarily constitutes an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.citations.citations.aubry hospital,supra,cal th at,d.the plaintiff has the burden to demonstrate how he or she can amend the complaint to change the legal effect of the pleading.wilner sunset life ins.th,d see also goodman kennedy cal d,plaintiff must show in what manner he can amend his complaint and how that amendment will change the legal effect of his pleading.l eave to amend should not be granted where amendment would be futile.vaillette fireman fund ins.th,d.

requirements for certification of a class action 
class actions are statutorily authorized when the question is one of common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court code civ.the certification question is essentially a procedural one that does not ask whether an action is legally or factually meritorious.citation.lockheed martin superior court cal th,d,lockheed martin.because trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action,they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification.citation.id.at,d.
the burden is on the party seeking certification to establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members.citation.lockheed martin,supra,cal th at,d.the community of interest requirement embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.citation.ibid.t his means each member must not be required to individually litigate numerous and substantial questions to determine his or her right to recover following the class judgment and the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,must be sufficiently numerous and substantial to make the class action advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.citation.id.at,d.
a class action also must be the superior means of resolving the litigation,for both the parties and the court.caro procter gamble th,d.generally,a class suit is appropriate when numerous parties suffer injury of insufficient size to warrant individual action and when denial of class relief would result in unjust advantage to the wrongdoer.citations.linder,supra,cal th at,d.r elevant considerations include the probability that each class member will come forward ultimately to prove his or her separate claim to a portion of the total recovery and whether the class approach would actually serve to deter and redress alleged wrongdoing.ibid.b ecause group action also has the potential to create injustice,trial courts are required to carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts.citation.see weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group,benefits of class action evaluated by interest of each putative class member in controlling his or her own case personally potential difficulties in managing a class action nature and extent of already pending litigation by individual class members involving the same controversy and desirability of consolidating all action before one court.
t rial courts properly and routinely decide the issue of class certification on demurrer citations.citation.silva block th,d.when class certification is challenged by demurrer,the trial court must determine whether there is a reasonable possibility plaintiffs can plead a prima facie community of interest among class members citation.the ultimate question in every case of this type is whether,given an ascertainable class,the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.citations.if the ability of each member of the class to recover clearly depends on a separate set of facts applicable only to him,then all of the policy considerations which justify class actions equally compel the dismissal of such inappropriate actions at the pleading stage.citation.id.at,d see also canon,superior court th,d where the invalidity of the class allegations is revealed on the face of the complaint,by matters subject to judicial notice,the class issue may be properly disposed of by demurrer or motion to strike i n such circumstances,there is no need to incur the expense of an evidentiary hearing or discovery.
plaintiffs can not satisfy the commonality or superiority requirements 
basurco century insurance.
division one of this court recently affirmed the denial of a class certification motion in another northridge earthquake case.basurco century ins.th,d basurco.in basurco the putative class members in two consolidated actions were policyholders who had been denied benefits on the ground the contractual limitations provision in their insurance policies barred their claims,one group seeking supplemental policy benefits for alleged earthquake damage to their homes and one group seeking policy benefits for additional living expenses allegedly incurred as a result of the earthquake.id.at,d.division one found the denial of class certification was proper because the named plaintiffs could not satisfy either the commonality or superiority requirements.
as to commonality,division one held that,even if the named plaintiffs could show century employed a common policy of improperly denying earthquake benefits under the contractual limitations provision,each putative class member still would be required to prove that his or her individual claim had substantive other words,that century breached the insurance policy by withholding benefits that otherwise should have been paid.for example,in determining the merit of a policyholder claim,century may have to send a team of construction consultant,a structural engineer,and a each policyholder home.no two investigations will be the same t he existence of damage,the cause of damage,and the extent of damage would have to be determined on a basis.basurco,supra,th at,d.as a result,the commonality requirement was not met class actions will not be permitted where there are diverse factual issues to be resolved,even though there may be many common questions of law.citation.a class action can not be maintained where each member right to recover depends on facts peculiar to his case citation.basurco,supra,th at,d.
regarding superiority,division one found none of the factors supported class certification each putative class member had a strong interest in controlling his or her own case given the nature of the relief sought a class action would be extremely difficult to manage because individual issues predominate over common questions of law and fact given that t he existence,type,and extent of damage varies from case to case century already was a defendant in approximately earthquake actions with over plaintiffs and the complexity of the issues in the pending cases makes it impractical and thus undesirable to consolidate all actions into a single proceeding.basurco,supra,th at,d.division one also recognized the superior court had adopted a global order covering all earthquake insurance cases and t o certify a class in this case would undermine the efforts of the superior court to manage the hundreds of other similar cases.we will not turn our backs on the prodigious and innovative efforts of the superior court to manage the complexities of the earthquake insurance litigation.id.at,d.
basurco reasoning is applicable here 
we find the analysis in basurco persuasive and applicable to this case.common questions of law and fact do not predominate,despite plaintiffs contention their allegations require proof of only a pervasive scheme by state farm and farmers to limit liability on earthquake claims and widespread use of bad faith practices.even if state farm and farmers adopted improper claims practices to adjust northridge earthquake claims,each putative class member still could recover for breach of contract and bad faith only by proving his or her individual claim was wrongfully denied,in whole or in part,and the insurer action in doing so was unreasonable.see basurco,supra,th at,d.thus,each putative class member potential recovery would involve an individual assessment of his or her property,the damage sustained and the actual claims practices employed.ibid.in such cases,class treatment is unwarranted.silva block,supra,th at,d certification denied on demurrer when,even if plaintiffs could prove allegation of common improper policy,recovery of each putative class member dependent on individualized proof of constitutional injury see also hicks kaufman broad home th,d based on need for individualized proof for each putative class member to come forward and prove specific damage to her home,uneven floor,insect infestation,misaligned doors and windows,and that such damage was caused by cracks in the foundation,not some other agent,commonality of facts is lost and the action splits into more pieces than the allegedly defective foundation.
plaintiffs causes of action for unfair competition and declaratory relief fare no better.the unfair business practices cause of action is premised on the improper denial of policy benefits and plaintiffs ultimately seek restitution for the amount of benefits state farm and farmers failed to pay.thus,the individualized assessments necessary for the breach of contract and bad faith causes of action also are necessary to establish liability for unfair competition.the declaratory relief cause of action,which seeks to undo individual settlements allegedly procured by fraud or mistake,necessarily turns on each insured state of mind and the particular settlement negotiations.caro procter gamble,supra,th at,d no community of interest when putative class members would have to individually prove liability and damages based on nature of misrepresentation and reasonable reliance.
plaintiffs attempt to distinguish basurco by maintaining that recovery for
