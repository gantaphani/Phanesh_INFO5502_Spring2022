discussion 
summary judgment and summary adjudication 
summary judgment is granted when there is no triable issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.we review de novo the trial court decision to grant summary judgment and are not bound by the trial court stated reasons or rationales.hersant department of social services th,d.further,we review issues of statutory interpretation de novo.heavenly valley el dorado county bd.of equalization th,d.the appellate rules applicable to review of summary adjudication are the same as applicable to summary judgment.
ii.hospital lien act hla 
section provides every person,partnership,association,corporation,public entity,or other institution or body maintaining a hospital licensed under the laws of this state which furnishes emergency and ongoing medical or other services to any person injured by reason of an accident or negligent or other wrongful act,shall,if the person has a claim against another for damages on account of his or her injuries,have a lien upon the damages recovered,or to be recovered,by the person to the extent of the amount of the reasonable and necessary charges of the hospital,in which services are provided for the treatment,care,and maintenance of the person in the hospital or health facility affiliated with the hospital resulting from that accident or negligent or other wrongful act.section creates a statutory nonpossessory lien in favor of a hospital against third persons liable for the patient injuries.mercy hospital medical center farmers ins.group of companies cal th,d,mercy.the lien compensates a hospital for providing medical services to an injured person by giving the hospital a direct right to a certain percentage of specific property,a judgment,compromise,or settlement,otherwise accruing to that person,italics added.
scripps contends section creates a direct obligation between the tortfeasor and the hospital in the amount of the hospital reasonable charges and the amount of its lien is not based on or limited by the injured patient debt to the hospital.scripps bases its contention on section,which requires the hospital to give notice of its lien to only the tortfeasor and the tortfeasor insurer section,which requires the tortfeasor to pay the hospital directly and section,which gives the hospital a cause of action to enforce its lien against the tortfeasor,not against the injured patient.however,these provisions define who shall pay the hospital,but do not define from whose property the payment is made.
class members contend they their medical insurance carriers have paid scripps in full for its services and,by placing a lien on their recoveries,scripps seeks amounts greater than the amounts scripps agreed to accept for its services.in addressing issues raised by class members,we initially note,notwithstanding the class certification,the contracts between class members and their medical insurance carriers and between scripps and the medical insurance carriers differ substantially.because of the different contract provisions we conclude scripps wrongfully placed a lien on the recovery of one of the class representatives but rightfully placed a lien on the recovery of the other two class representatives.
the issues raised in this appeal were recently addressed in nishihama city county of san francisco th,d nishihama.we find the reasoning of nishihama compelling and elect to follow it 
even if the hla contemplated an independent right in the hospital,the extent of that right would be defined by any contract between the injured party or her insurer and the health care provider.civil code section accordingly provides that the third party shall be liable to the health care provider for the amount of its lien claimed in the notice which the hospital was entitled to receive as payment for the medical care and services rendered to the injured person.italics added.the amount that a hospital is entitled to receive as payment necessarily turns on any agreement it has with the injured person or the injured person insurer.nishihama,supra,th at,d.
the patient debt to the hospital is the foundation for the hospital right to a lien.nishihama,supra,th at,d.the reasonable and necessary charges,then,are the amounts charged to the patient or the patient insurance carrier.the hla does not give hospitals a cause of action against tortfeasors it allows hospitals to place a lien on the patient recovery from the tortfeasor.the amount of the lien is the reasonable and necessary charges for the patient treatment.however,if the agreed charges have been paid,the hospital has no amount,reasonable or otherwise,it may seek from a tortfeasor.
although scripps contends it seeks payment from tortfeasors,the payments ultimately come from the class members.under california law,the amount a personal injury plaintiff can recover for medical services is limited to the amount that has been paid or incurred for those services,even if that amount is less than the market rate or reasonable value of the services.hanif housing authority d.
in the cases involved in class members class action,the amounts class members can recover from the tortfeasors are based on class members medical insurance contracts and the contracts those insurance carriers negotiated with scripps.if scripps liens exceed these amounts,then scripps collects more from the class members judgments or settlements than the class members are legally entitled to recover from the tortfeasor for medical expenses.in effect,the amount scripps collects in excess of its agreed rate is funded by a portion of class members judgments or settlements attributable to lost wages or to pain and suffering.we conclude scripps lien rights do not extend beyond the amount it agreed to receive from class members medical insurance carriers as payment in full for services provided to class members.nishihama,supra,th at,d.
we also reject scripps contention that the legislative history of section,enacted in september,authorizes it to place a section lien for its usual and customary charges regardless of its contractual arrangements.section limits the lien rights of medical providers to the amount they actually paid for the health care,but specifically exempts hospitals pursuing section liens,subd.g.the consumer attorneys of california argued to the legislature that section should apply to hospital liens and provided the legislature with a copy of satsky united states of america,holding that a hospital could not place a lien on a patient recovery under a texas statute similar to section because the statute was clearly not intended to overcompensate hospitals that accept patients who do have the ability to pay,nor to provide a windfall for hospitals who feel aggrieved by the circumscription of hospital charges by insurance plans.
the fact that section places no express limit on a hospital lien rights is not determinative of whether those lien rights were already limited under the hla.further,subsequent legislation is,at best,an unreliable gauge of legislative intent.united states price,d recognizing that the views of a subsequent congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.for similar reasons,we do not place much weight on other statutory liens that purportedly exist in the absence of an underlying debt.the unique nature of a hospital lien under the hla makes those comparisons questionable.we conclude the amount of an hla lien may not exceed the amount the patient is indebted to the hospital.
iii.insurance contracts 
the provisions of class members medical insurance contracts and the contracts scripps entered into with those medical insurance carriers determine whether the hla liens are authorized.based on the contracts of the three class representatives,we conclude scripps was not entitled to place a lien on mcmeans recovery,but was entitled to place liens on the recoveries of shaul and denny.
the aetna insurance plan that covered mcmeans provides that if a third party is liable for a patient injury,aetna shall be subrogated to the patient recovery to the extent of the benefits aetna paid.mcmeans was treated at scripps mercy hospital.the contract between scripps mercy hospital and aetna provides in part in no event shall any member be liable to hospital for any sums owed to hospital by the applicable payor.in addition,neither hospital nor its agents,trustees,or assignees shall maintain any action at law against a member to collect sums owed by the applicable payor provided,however,that hospital may collect from members,coinsurance or deductibles for covered services,or amounts due for services.amounts for services may be charged at hospital usual and customary charges.this agreement provides that scripps may not collect payment from patients insured by aetna,other than copayments or deductibles,unless the service provided to the patient is not covered under the insurance agreement.this agreement allows scripps to bill at its usual and customary rate only for services not covered under the patient insurance agreement.because the services scripps provided to mcmeans were covered under mcmeans medical insurance policy with aetna,scripps was not entitled to place a lien for its reasonable and necessary charges on mcmeans recovery in excess of the agreed amount.
we are not persuaded by scripps contention the services mcmeans received were not covered because the aetna insurance policy provides that aetna has the right to recover the benefits aetna paid from third party tortfeasors.this portion of the policy does not provide that those services are not covered by the agreement it merely provides that aetna will be reimbursed from any future recovery.
scripps also contends it may collect its reasonable and necessary fees from a third party tortfeasor under the coordination of benefits cob section of its agreement with aetna,which provides hospital shall be entitled to all cob recoveries relating to covered hospital services.hospital shall make a reasonable effort to seek reimbursement for covered hospital services under other third party coverages when applicable for per diem or discount off charges payments,in the event that payor is the secondary carrier under the coordination of benefits rules,payor shall be required to pay hospital the difference between hospital full customary charges and the amount collected by hospital from third party payors,but in no event to exceed the amount the payor is required to pay if it were the primary carrier.
we are not persuaded by this contention.coordination of benefits is a term used when there is duplicate medical insurance coverage.kaiser foundation health plan,lifeguard,th,d.the term coverage is normally used to refer to insurance coverage.for instance,insurance code section states in part group disability policies may provide,among other things,that the benefits payable thereunder are subject to reduction if the individual insured has any other coverage other than individual policies or contracts providing hospital,surgical or medical benefits,whether on an indemnity basis or a provision of service basis,resulting in such insured being eligible for more than percent of the covered expenses.italics added.the reference to coverage is a reference to other insurance coverage.a tort obligor does not provide insurance coverage.additionally,although the contract does not expressly define the term third party payor,it reasonably contemplates an institutional payer,such as another insurance company or medicare.see palumbo myers d.a settling third party tortfeasor is not a third party payer as the term is used in welfare and institutions code section.therefore,this contract provision does not change our analysis.
scripps relies on swanson john regional medical center th,d swanson.the court in swanson held a hospital filing of liens is not an unfair business practice,an issue not raised in this appeal.the swanson court did not address contracts between hospitals and insurers that might prohibit a lien.id.at,fn,d.further,to the extent the analysis of the hla in swanson differs from the analysis in nishihama,we find the reasoning of nishihama more compelling.
shaul and denny 
shaul was enrolled in the sharp choice plan,which had no contract with scripps memorial hospital.therefore,scripps may place an hla lien on shaul recovery for the reasonable cash value of the benefits it provided to shaul.
denny californiacare contract with blue cross does not provide benefits for the medical treatment of injuries caused by third parties.under the heading reimbursement for acts of third parties,the californiacare disclosure form states in part no benefits will be provided under this plan for medical care for,or received in connection with,any illness,injury,or condition for which a third party may be liable or legally responsible by reasons of negligence,an intentional act or breach of any legal obligation.but benefits will be provided under this plan subject to the following.californiacare and your medical group will automatically have a lien to the extent of benefits provided,upon any recovery,whether by settlement,judgment or otherwise,that you receive from the third party,the third party insurer,or the third party guarantor.the lien will be for the reasonable cash value of the benefits provided by your medical group or by us under this plan for the treatment of the illness disease,injury or condition for which the third party is liable original italics omitted italics added.
the ninth circuit interpreted a similar provision in another blue cross contract and held the following the contract excludes blue cross from liability for injuries tortiously caused by third parties,and provides an exception for benefits which will be advanced in anticipation of possible future recovery.once recovery has been made,the conditions of the exception no longer exist and the exclusion remains.qualls blue cross of california,supra,at,original italics.under the californiacare plan,blue cross does not provide benefits for medical care for injuries caused by a third party tortfeasor it merely advances money.
because denny was injured by a third party tortfeasor,his medical services were not covered under the californiacare plan.blue cross merely advanced payment to scripps on denny behalf.the contract between scripps and blue cross does not limit the amount scripps may charge for the medical services it provided to denny.instead,under the californiacare plan,scripps may place a lien for the reasonable cash value of the benefits it provided.
although scripps has shown it has a contractual right to place a lien on the recoveries of shaul and denny,scripps has not met its burden of proof that the liens are for reasonable and necessary charges.the reasonable value and necessity of scripps services are questions of fact.although the amount paid or incurred for hospital services is some evidence as to its value,we also require evidence of the value and necessity of the professional services of the physicians and the hospital.guerra balestrieri d,harris los angeles transit lines d,harris.typically,a physician testifies as to these issues.see harris,supra,d at.scripps produced a declaration by clelia barbeau,president and ceo of mls.she declared,the lien asserted is the difference between the payment from the insurer and the actual reasonable and customary charges incurred by the patient.italics added.class members objected to this evidence under evidence code section.the court did not rule on the objection.under biljac associates first interstate bank d,we presume on appeal that a judge has not relied on irrelevant or incompetent evidence.accordingly,we presume the court sustained the objection as to barbeau use of the word reasonable.barbeau had no personal knowledge of the reasonable value of the medical services scripps provided to shaul or to denny.further,scripps introduced no evidence that its services were necessary.accordingly,scripps has produced no admissible evidence that the amount of the liens on the recoveries of shaul and denny were reasonable.therefore,summary adjudication of the amount of the debts of shaul and denny to scripps is inappropriate.
because scripps was not entitled to place a lien on mcmeans recovery and because there are triable issues of fact as to the reasonable value of the services scripps provided to shaul and denny,the court erred by granting summary judgment.
iv.section,subdivision b 
class members contend the court erred by denying their motion for summary adjudication of scripps thirteenth affirmative defense,the privilege conferred by section,subdivision b.class members contend this privilege does not apply because scripps actions were not communicative and were not connected to litigation.
the privilege conferred by section,subdivision b,bars all tort causes of action,other than malicious prosecution,based on conduct protected by the privilege.silberg anderson cal d.the principal purpose of the privilege is to afford litigants and witnesses freedom of access to the courts without fear of being subsequently harassed by derivative tort actions.id.at.t he privilege applies to any communication made in judicial or proceedings by litigants or other participants authorized by law to achieve the objects of the litigation and that has some connection or logical relation to the action.id.at.further,it applies to any publication required or permitted b
