discussion 
standard of review 
the appellate court assumes the truth of all properly pleaded material allegations of the complaint,and gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation by reading it as a whole and its parts in their context citation.silberg anderson cal d.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.blank kirwan cal d.if the complaint can be cured,the trial court has abused its discretion.ibid.
to meet the plaintiff burden of showing abuse of discretion,the plaintiff must show how the complaint can be amended to state a cause of action.citation.careau security pacific business credit,d.careau.however,such a showing need not be made in the trial court so long as it is made to the reviewing court.ibid.
although the appellate courts take a liberal view toward curing defects by amendment,there is nothing in the general rule of liberal allowance of pleading amendment which requires an appellate court to hold that the trial judge has abused his discretion if on appeal the plaintiffs can suggest no legal theory or state facts which they wish to add by way of amendment.careau,supra,d at.that is,t he burden is on the plaintiffs to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion and to show in what manner the pleadings can be amended and how such amendments will change the legal effect of their pleadings.citations.id.at.
ii.whether respondents are liable as employers 
a.the definition of employer under wage order 
reynolds cites ramirez yosemite water cal th,d,for the proposition that the pertinent wage orders are regulations,that should be given as much deference as statutes.reynolds urges that scheib management is defined as an employer under the definition of wage order,tit,subd.f wage order,promulgated by the industrial welfare commission iwc.as an employer,reynolds argues,scheib management is liable for unpaid wages under the labor code.we disagree with reynolds argument.
historically,employees have been able to recover unpaid wages from their employer based on statute or a theory of common law breach of contract,but not against the employer agents.klaffki kaufman.thus,in oppenheimer robinson d,the court sustained a demurrer to the plaintiff complaint for unpaid wages against a company superintendent,stating that there is no allegation that plaintiff contracted with robinson,that robinson had any duty to pay plaintiff wages or was guilty of any wrong.he was merely an employee of southern pacific and is not personally liable for nonpayment of wages to a fellow employee,oppenheimer general cable d.oppenheimer robinson,supra,d at.
nevertheless,reynolds cites tidewater marine western,bradshaw cal th,d,tidewater for the proposition that the iwc is the state agency empowered to formulate regulations governing employment in california and urges that it has an implied power to regulate wages and hours.tidewater holds that a california employee presumptively enjoys the protections of iwc wage orders,as long as there is nothing in the wage orders or the labor code to rebut that presumption.id.at,d.in that case,our supreme court held that the division of labor standards enforcement dlse policy for determining whether to apply iwc wage orders to maritime employees constituted a regulation and was void for failure to comply with the administrative procedure act.id.at,d.it then went on to determine that wage earners presumptively enjoy the protections of iwc wage orders,and that because nothing in the wage orders or the labor code rebutted that presumption,the wage orders at issue were applicable.
reynolds cites to the broad definition of employer in wage order,subdivision f promulgated by the iwc,in support of his argument that scheib management is liable for unpaid wages.wage order regulates wages,hours and working conditions in the transportation industry,which is defined in subdivision n of that order as any industry,business,or establishment operated for the purpose of conveying persons or property from one place to another whether by rail,highway,air,or water,and all operations and services in connection therewith and also includes storing or warehousing of goods or property,and the repairing,parking,rental,maintenance,or cleaning of vehicles.since,employer has been defined in the current and previous incarnations of wage order,subdivision f as any person as defined in section of the labor code,who directly or indirectly,or through an agent or any other person,employs or exercises control over the wages,hours,or working conditions of any person.
where the legislature specifically includes enumerated parties,and excludes others,effect must be given to that distinction.creutz superior court th,d.moreover,statutory interpretations that render some language mere surplusage should be avoided shoemaker myers cal d,and we must assume that the legislature references to misdemeanor penalties and fixed civil fines imposed on agents,officers,or persons are not mere surplusage.guided by these rules,we find that wage order definition of employer has nothing to do with the imposition of civil liability for overtime wages,and reynolds has not persuaded us of any connection.indeed,our reading of wage order convinces us that the iwc draws a distinction between employers and employers and their agents.that wage order provides for civil penalties against employers and their agents in part furthermore,subdivision of wage order refers to section,which imposes misdemeanor civil fines on employers,officers or agents who require employees to work longer hours than agreed upon,pay employees less than the minimum wage,or violate any provisions of the wage and hour sections.
in addition,as reflected in the labor code,the legislature has seen fit to make a distinction between employers on the one hand,and officers,agents,management and other individuals on the other hand,for the purpose of imposing liability as opposed to civil penalties.thus,the legislature has determined that the party employing labor bears the burden of complying with the wage and hour laws.in contrast,only misdemeanor penalties and civil fines can be imposed against persons acting on behalf of an employer or officers and agents of the employer.
for instance,section requires the employer to comply with overtime compensation,while section,subdivision a provides for civil penalties against employers or their agents.see any person who violates overtime laws is guilty of a misdemeanor every person who unlawfully withholds wages due any employee in violation of,or shall be subject to civil penalties.the penalty shall be recovered by the labor commissioner shall be brought in the name of the people of the state of california and the labor commissioner and all money shall be paid into the state treasury employer is forbidden from paying any unequal wage for equal work on the basis of sex and is liable for double damages to an employee who suffers such discrimination misdemeanor penalties imposed against e very employer or other person acting either individually or as an officer,agent,or employee of another person in paying an employee a wage less than the rate paid to an employee of opposite sex as required by,employer required to establish regular paydays civil penalty imposed on persons who violate,an employer is required to post a notice specifying regular paydays and the time and place of payment,payment by employer in case of discharge or strike any person,agent,manager,superintendent,or officer who violates,or is guilty of a misdemeanor.most tellingly,section,which specifically authorizes an employee to bring a civil action for overtime wages,does not enumerate persons,agents,managers,superintendents,or officers as parties who may be liable in a private civil action 
reno baird cal th,d,is instructive.in that case,our supreme court noted that the fair employment and housing act feha,through government code section,subdivision d,specifically defined an employer as any person regularly employing five or more persons,or any person acting as an agent of an employer.the court determined that the feha intentionally drew a distinction between the prohibition against an employer from engaging in discrimination under government code section,subdivision a and the prohibition against an employer or person from engaging in harassment under government code section,subdivision h.in that case,the legislature clearly provided that the employer shall be liable for discrimination,and the employer or person shall be liable for harassment.similarly,here,the legislature has placed liability for civil fines and misdemeanor penalties on any person but responsibility for compliance with wage and hour laws on the employer.
thus,both the wage orders and the labor code rebut reynolds presumption that the broad definition of employer contained in wage order applies to all sections of the labor code,thereby bringing under its umbrella managers,agents,or anyone with supervisory power we also reject amicus building and construction trades council of alameda county proposal that respondents fall within the definition of employer by virtue of the reference to employers in the phrase every person employing labor and the definition in labor code section of person as any person,association,organization,partnership,business trust,limited liability company,or corporation.
b.the definition of employer under bureerong 
reynolds next urges that respondents are employers based on the holding of bureerong uvawas.bureerong.he cites bureerong for the proposition that california courts would likely adopt the federal fair labor standards act flsa broad definition of employment and would likely focus on the economic realities of the relationship,rather than on mere contractual or technical distinctions.id.at,fn.omitted.in that case,the plaintiffs were immigrant garment workers who allegedly were falsely imprisoned in a complex in el monte,california,and employed in a system of involuntary servitude.the plaintiffs brought suit against a number of clothing manufacturers that were not directly involved in operating the el monte facility.
the court noted that the flsa broadly defines employer as any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee.bureerong,supra.at.in concluding that the plaintiffs had sufficiently pled a cause of action against the defendants for failure to pay minimum wage and overtime under the flsa to defeat a motion to dismiss,the court cited the economic realities test.that test is comprised of the following factors which tend to show an employment relationship the power to hire and fire control over employee work schedules or conditions of employment the power to determine the rate and method of payment and the power to maintain employment records.ibid.in denying the defendants motion to dismiss the second cause of action under federal law for failure to pay minimum wage and overtime,the court noted that the plaintiffs pled that the defendants contracted with the operators of the facility to provide garments at prices too low to permit payment of minimum wage and overtime the defendants contracted out garment manufacturing work in order to avoid compliance with labor law the defendants directly or indirectly employed the plaintiffs as industrial homeworkers and exercised meaningful control over the work they performed the operators acted as supervisors and managers for the defendants the facility was an integral part of the process of garment manufacturing for each defendant and the plaintiffs were an integral part of the defendants businesses.basing its holding on the broad definition of employer set forth by the flsa and the liberal federal notice pleading standards,the court held that the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged an employment relationship between the plaintiff and the defendants.id.at.
as to the third cause of action,which arose under california labor law for failure to pay minimum wage and overtime,the court noted that the labor code does not specifically define employer,employee,and employ.the court determined that california courts would likely adopt the federal flsa broad definition of employment because federal and state minimum wage and overtime provisions are analogous and complementary the iwc defines the terms employ,employee,and employer extremely broadly in a manner similar to the flsa and in borello sons,department of industrial relations cal d,our supreme court considered the nature of the work and the overall arrangement between the parties in determining whether employment existed.
we first note that in determining how much weight to give federal authority in interpreting a california wage order,courts are cautioned to make a comparative analysis between the statutory schemes.morillion royal packing cal th,d.our examination of the flsa definition of employer shows that it is not exactly the same as that proposed in wage order.wage order,subdivision f defines employer as any person as defined in section of the labor code,who directly or indirectly,or through an agent or any other person,employs or exercises control over the wages,hours,or working conditions of any person.the flsa defines employer as any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee.bureerong,supra.at d.thus,the flsa requires that the actor act in the interest of the employer,a requirement not mandated in the wage order,and that could imply a much broader definition than the one set forth by the iwc wage order.we can not assume that the iwc intended to adopt the flsa definition of employer.morillion royal packing,supra,cal th at,d,where the iwc intended the flsa to apply to wage orders,it has specifically so stated.
most crucially,bureerong,which holds persuasive value only,did not address the issue here whether management of a corporation can be held personally liable for violation of wage and hour laws.rather,bureerong concerned the employer status of corporate entities.we do not believe that even were we to adopt the economic realities test,that management,rather than the corporate entity,should be considered to be the employer for purposes of personal liability.nor are we persuaded by reynolds citation to an advisory letter issued by dlse counsel which has merely persuasive value.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d.in that case,an officer of a corporation entered into an agreement with the plaintiff under which payment of wages owed to the plaintiff was deferred in order to allow for the use of those amounts to operate the business until funding materialized.the advisory letter extensively cited from bureerong,which we do not find persuasive,in reaching its conclusion that the officer exercised the requisite control to render him personally liable for nonpayment of wages.
as we previously discussed,we are not prepared to adopt such an expansive and broad definition of employer.reynolds definition would leave virtually any management employee open to civil liability for violation of wage and hour laws.
iii.whether liability can be based on tortious acts of management or statutory causes of action 
liability based on tortious acts of management 
reynolds next contends that regardless of whether scheib management is classified as an employer,by committing tortious acts,it is personally liable for causing scheib to fall below the standards set by section wage order.
reynolds urges that scheib management committed tortious actions against the class,citing frances village green owners cal d,for the proposition that a director who causes the corporation to embark upon a course of unlawful or tortious conduct may be exposed to liability if the conduct falls below the statutory standard.in that case,the court held that directors may be personally liable for their own tortious conduct if they personally directed or participated in the tortious conduct.id.at,see also pmc,kadisha th,d officers and directors of corporations personally liable for tortious conduct including fraud,misappropriation of trade secrets,conspiring to violate the sherman act,conspiring to interfere with contractual relations,conspiring to induce breach of contract.
directors or officers of a corporation do not incur personal liability for torts of the corporation merely by reason of their official position,unless they participate in the wrong or authorize or direct that it be done.united states liab.ins,cal d.more must be shown than breach of the officer duty to his corporation to impose personal liability to a third person upon him.ibid.
a complaint that fails to charge in specific terms any specific acts on the part of the individual defendants which constituted affirmative direction,sanction,participation,or cooperation in the alleged tortious act of the corporate defendant is susceptible to a demurrer.lobato pay less drug stores cir,cause of action against individual officers of corporation failed where complaint did not allege individuals had anything to do with assembly or manufacture of defective bicycle.rather,participation in specific activities,if proved,can lead to liability on the part of directors or officers.see golden anderson d.triable issue of fact existed where facts showed that defendants were aware of preexisting brokerage relationship of seller with plaintiff,yet conspired to purchase property joanaco projects,nixon tierney constr.d.corporate stockholders actively participated in fraud by failing to use borrowed funds for housing.
b.the first and third causes of action 
as to the third cause of action,reynolds argues that as employers under wage order,respondents are liable for unlawful deductions.as we previously discussed,we have concluded that respondents are not employers for purposes of personal liability.
in any event,our examination of the fac leads us to conclude that the trial court properly sustained the demurrer to the first and third causes of action on the ground that the allegations are not sufficiently specific to allege personal liability.as to the first cause of action for failure to pay overtime compensation in violation of sections,and applicable wage orders,and the third cause of action for unlawful deductions from wages,reynolds alleged the following.respondents forced the class to work long overtime hours without overtime pay even though the class actually spends the vast majority of their workweek performing routine physical tasks and sales functions.respondents exercised control over the wages,hours,or working conditions of the class members and authorized,directed,sanctioned,consented,cooperated,approved,aided,instigated,assisted,participated in,and voted for tortious and unlawful acts of commission or omission which have operated to the injury and prejudice of the class,including but not limited to causing the corporate defendants to violate the overtime regulations found in the applicable wage order respondents knowingly and willfully conspired among themselves and agreed to and did institute a plan pursuant to which the respondents required the class to work unpaid overtime hours notwithstanding the fact that the class members are not exempt from the requirement to pay overtime compensation under either california executive exemption or any other applicable exemption under california law.respondents conspired to take unlawful deductions from class members pay and conspired to convert their wages.furthermore,respondents cooperated in the conspiracy by ratifying the acts of each respondent,voting for or otherwise approving of continuing unlawful wage practices,refusing to halt the conversion of class property,and failing to conduct an investigation into the wage and hour violations.
these allegations are simply insufficient to give notice of facts showing that the respondents actively participated in any specific,tortious acts.by way of contrast,the plaintiff in frances village green owners,supra,cal d,defeated a demurrer by alleging that the homeowner association at the condominium complex where she lived breached its duty of care by taking affirmative action that resulted in her being raped and robbed.the complaint alleged that the association was on notice of a crime wave of,that plaintiff unit had recently been burglarized and that there was a link between the lack of lighting and crime.despite repeated requests from other residents to improve the lighting condition,the homeowner association refused to take action.moreover,the complaint alleged that the defendant condominium association ordered the plaintiff to remove lights she had installed to improve security outside her unit,resulting in the extinguishing of all exterior lights.shortly afterward,the plaintiff unit was broken into,and she was raped and robbed.the complaint alleged a second breach of a duty of care to the plaintiff in that the association failed to repair the hazardous lighting condition within a reasonable period of time.the court concluded that the plaintiff had alleged sufficient facts showing that the association had authorized,directed or participated in the allegedly tortious conduct.id.at.
rather than alleging specific acts,meetings,conversations,or directives,reynolds has set forth a list of general allegations,vaguely alleging a conspiracy.none of the respondents is specifically identified as engaging in any prohibited acts.the first and third causes of action do not allege torts in themselves,but allege violations of the labor code.we conclude the trial court did not err in sustaining the demurrer to the first and third causes of action.
c.the fourth cause of action 
conversion is the wrongful exercise of dominion over the property of another.the elements of a conversion are the plaintiff ownership or right to possession of the property at the time of the conversion the defendant conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of property rights and damages.it is not necessary that there be a manual taking of the property it is only necessary to show an assumption of control or ownership over the property,or that the alleged converter has applied the property to his own use.oakdale village group fong th,d.
as to the cause of action for conversion,the fac alleged that respondents caused the wages to be converted and otherwise withheld by and in the accounts of the corporate defendants for defendants collective benefit reynolds citation to cortez purolator air filtration products cal th,d,for the proposition that failure to pay wages is conversion does not advance his cause,since there,the court found that restitution was a remedy for unpaid wages,for what was essentially an equitable conversion.the plaintiff in that case did not allege the tort of conversion against officers and directors of a corporation,nor did he seek to hold officers and directors personally liable.
this case is unlike department of industrial relations ui video stores,th,d ui where the dlse brought an action for conversion,among other things,against the defendant,doing business as blockbuster video,for failure to pay wages due as a result of a settlement agreement between dlse and blockbuster vide
