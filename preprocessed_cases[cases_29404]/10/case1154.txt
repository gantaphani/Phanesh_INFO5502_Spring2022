both parties in this action appeal various rulings of the district court summary judgment,class certification,attorney fees,and sanctions orders.the principal issue is whether a debt collector may send collection notices addressed to the debtor,in care of the debtor employer.we conclude that the answer is no.
defendant law offices of sidney mickell sent a debt collection letter addressed directly to plaintiff catherine evon in care of her employer.evon filed a class action lawsuit alleging that mickell act of sending letters care of the class members employers violated the fair debt collection practices act prohibition on communication with third parties.b.she further alleged that the contents of the letter violated the act prohibition against false,deceptive,or misleading misrepresentation s.because congress enacted the fdcpa to protect debtors from abusive debt collection practices,and because we have consistently interpreted the statute liberally to achieve that objective,mickell act of sending care of letters constitutes a per se violation of the fdcpa.we therefore reverse the district court denial of evon class certification motion on that issue and remand for further proceedings.we agree,however,with the district court that the contents of the letter does not violate the act and we therefore affirm the district court denial of evon class certification motion in that regard.
background 
evon incurred a debt,which was assigned to mickell for collection.as part of mickell collection efforts,a debt collector contacted evon at home on several occasions.during a phone call between evon and one of mickell debt collectors,evon asked that she not be contacted at work.nonetheless,either intentionally or by mistake,mickell sent a debt collection letter to evon place of employment.the mailing address read

the letter was opened and read by various individuals,including people in the legal department,before it found its way to evon.id.the letter stated that evon owed a debt and that failure to pay could result in legal action.id.
on march,evon filed suit alleging violations of the fdcpa.on july,evon filed an amended class action complaint alleging that mickell act of sending debt collection letters to the class members workplaces was unlawful and the content of the letters violated the fdcpa because they included language that was false,misleading,deceptive or threatening evon moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability and also moved for class certification.mickell moved for summary judgment on all of evon claims and opposed the motion for class certification.
the district court denied evon motions for partial summary judgment and class certification.the district court granted mickell motion for summary judgment on the class claims finding that neither mickell act of sending letters to the plaintiffs workplaces nor the content of the letters violated the fdcpa.but the district court denied summary judgment on the issue of whether mickell violated the fdcpa by sending a letter to evon workplace,finding that fact issues existed as to whether the letter was sent in error.
after the district court rendered its decision,evon accepted mickell rule offer of judgment on her individual claim.pursuant to the judgment,evon filed an application for attorney fees and the district court held a hearing on the motion.evon sought more than in attorney fees and costs and the district court awarded her.evon timely appeals.
ii.jurisdiction 
we begin by determining whether we have jurisdiction over evon appeal of the district court summary judgment and class certification rulings.
mickell first argues that there is no appellate jurisdiction over the district court partial summary judgment rulings because those rulings did not dispose of the entire case.while it is true that orders granting partial summary judgment,because they do not dispose of all claims,are not final appealable orders under section,cheng comm r,cir,evon does not argue that appellate jurisdiction arose after the district court partial summary judgment rulings,but rather after the district court entered final judgment.
mickell next argument is that there is no appellate jurisdiction because the district court judgment did not incorporate or refer to the partial summary judgment rulings.there is no requirement that the judgment must incorporate prior rulings to be considered final.this circuit takes a pragmatic approach to finality in situations where events subsequent to a nonfinal order fulfill the purposes of the final judgment rule.dannenberg software toolworks,cir.in this case,a final judgment was entered on july,disposing of all the claims between the parties.there is no danger of piecemeal appeal if we find jurisdiction here,for nothing else remains in the federal courts.anderson allstate ins,cir.
mickell final jurisdictional argument is that by voluntarily dismissing her claims after the district court denied class certification,evon extinguished her personal interest in the litigation,and therefore,no justiciable controversy remains to be heard on appeal.we recently considered this argument in narouz charter communications.cir addressing the issue of whether a class representative who voluntarily settles his or her individual claims in a putative class action renders an appeal from a denial of class certification moot.there,the court considered two prior supreme court cases,united states parole commission geraghty,d,and deposit guaranty national bank,jackson mississippi roper,d,that discussed a related question whether a named plaintiff retained jurisdiction to appeal a denial of class certification after his or her claims involuntarily expired.id.at.geraghty and roper reasoned that in such cases,the class representative ability to appeal the adverse class certification ruling depends on whether he or she maintains a personal stake in obtaining class certification defined as an interest in spreading litigation costs and shifting fees and expenses to the other litigants with similar claims.accord pitts terrible herbst,cir noting that if the district court has denied class certification the class representative may nonetheless retain either an individual economic interest in shift ing part of the costs of litigation to those who will share in its benefits if the class is certified and ultimately prevails or a interest in having a class certified if the requirements of rule are met.citations omitted.our opinion in narouz extended this principle to cases where the class representative voluntarily settles his or her individual claims.id.emphasis added.we explained that in order to retain a personal stake in the class certification ruling,a named plaintiff can not contract away any and all interests he or she may have had in class representation through a private settlement agreement.id.citing toms allied bond collection agency,cir holding that the class representative had maintained no interest in a case where he expressly relinquished any and all claims of any kind or nature whatsoever he may have individually in addition to any claims for attorney fees,costs,or compensation as class representative,and any claims he may have as a of the putative class.conversely,a settlement agreement that specifically provides that the class representative is solely releasing individual claims may permit the class representative to retain a personal stake in the class claim.id.citing richards delta air lines,holding that the named plaintiff maintained a personal stake when the settlement agreement released the defendant of any and all individual claims that she might have which were not in derogation of plaintiff class claim.whether we have jurisdiction over evon claim,therefore,turns on the language of her settlement agreement.
evon signed a rule offer of judgment that states 
defendants law office of sidney mickell and sidney mickell,defendants hereby offer to allow judgment to be taken against them pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure as follows 
judgment in favor of plaintiff and against both defendants,inclusive,in the total amount of one thousand ten dollars and ninety nine cents.
the reasonable recoverable costs of the action now accrued as determined by the court,together with a reasonable attorney fee incurred through the date of this offer,as determined by the court and including those fees and costs reasonably necessary to establish the amounts of the reasonable recoverable costs and reasonable attorney fee pursuant to usc a.
this offer is not a concession or admission of liability on the part of defendants,or an admission or concession that plaintiff has any damages.defendants also do not concede or admit that plaintiff has a right to appeal any prior ruling of this court if she accepts this offer.
while the language of the offer of judgment does not include an express reservation of evon right to pursue an appeal on behalf of the class,it is not so broad that it can be read to release her class claims.in cases where courts have found that a plaintiff has bargained away the right to appeal the class certification ruling,the language of the settlement agreement has made explicit reference to the class claims,thus clearly supporting that conclusion.sanford memberworks,cir dismissing class representative who relinquished all claims,whether class,individual,or otherwise,including any claim for costs,expenses,pre or post judgment interest,penalties,fees including attorneys fees,expert fees and consulting fees for any kind of relief whatsoever including injunctive relief,monetary relief,damages,punitive damages,restitution,reimbursement,disgorgement,and economic injury in settlement agreement toms allied bond collection agency,cir holding that plaintiff released both individual and class claim in settlement agreement that expressly relinquished any and all claims of any kind or nature whatsoever he may have individually and any and all monetary claims including any claims for attorney fees,costs,or compensation as class representative,he may have as a of the putative class,which in any way are related to or arise from those matters pleaded in this litigation.dugas trans union,cir finding lead plaintiff relinquished individual and class claims where settlement expressly referred to the class certification denial and plaintiff agreed to dismiss the entire action without any reservation of the right to appeal.when we compare evon agreement with the agreements in sanford,toms,and dugas,we find that it is not an unqualified release of her class claims.nowhere in the agreement is there a reference to all claims and no mention is even made of the class claims or the class certification ruling.indeed,the agreement appears to contemplate that evon will appeal,and if she does,preserves the jurisdictional question.
moreover,to the extent that the rule offer is ambiguous regarding whether evon relinquished her class claims,we apply general principles of contract law to determine the meaning of the agreement.see guerrero cummings,cir t he usual rules of contract construction apply to interpreting the terms of a rule settlement offer internal quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,we may use the parol evidence doctrine to shed light on the meaning of language in a contract.see restatement second of contracts,c stating that where the express terms of an integrated agreement are ambiguous,the court may determine the intended meaning of the contracting parties by considering the situation and relations of the parties,the subject matter of the transaction,preliminary negotiations and statements made therein,and the course of dealing between the parties.here,our conclusion is further strengthened by comparing the language of the original rule offer,which evon rejected,with the language of the agreement she ultimately accepted.the first offer stated 
plaintiff acceptance of defendant offer of judgment herein shall be deemed voluntary and shall operate as an express and complete release of any and all of plaintiff individual claims and all interests in this litigation.plaintiff acceptance of defendant offer of judgment shall end this case 
plaintiff agrees to take no appeal,and to seek no reconsideration or further review in this court,or in the court of appeals,or in the united states supreme court,of any and all ruling,orders,or findings made as of the date of acceptance,or thereafter,including but not limited to district court june,rulings denying plaintiff motion for class certification,her motion for partial summary judgment,her motion to reopen discovery,the granting of defendant motion for partial summary judgment 
evon rejected this offer which explicitly released all of her individual and claims.unlike the first offer,the second offer,which she accepted,makes no mention of the claims and therefore,evon can not be said to have contracted away these claims.
mickell argues that evon could easily have preserved her right to appeal by rejecting its offer of judgment.instead,mickell argues,evon chose to accept the rule offer.but evon choice should be understood in context the district court in this case had only partially granted mickell motion for summary judgment evon claim that mickell violated the fdcpa by sending a letter to her workplace was proceeding to trial.at that point,her choices were go to trial or accept the rule offer and then appeal the resulting final judgment with respect to her first choice,during the course of the litigation,evon abandoned her actual damages claim so even if she went to trial and won,the maximum recovery would be statutory damages which are capped at plus costs and attorney fees.the second offer was for just more than.by acceptance,she could avoid the expense of trial and the risk of recovering less than mickell rule offer.if she failed to accept the offer,the consequence could be no recovery of attorney fees and even being saddled with mickell costs she chose to accept the second offer and pursue an appeal of the district court rulings.
in light of the considerations outlined above,evon class claims remain subject to appellate review.

b analysis 
care of letters to debtors employers 
evon alleges that mickell sending of debt collection letters to class members places of employment without first obtaining their consent violates section b of the fdcpa.
that section states 
b communication with third parties 
except as provided in section of this title,without the prior consent of the consumer given directly to the debt collector,or the express permission of a court of competent jurisdiction,or as reasonably necessary to effectuate a postjudgment judicial remedy,a debt collector may not communicate,in connection with the collection of any debt,with any person other than the consumer,his attorney,a consumer reporting agency if otherwise permitted by law,the creditor,the attorney of the creditor,or the attorney of the debt collector.
notably absent from the list of individuals or entities that a debt collector may communicate with is the debtor employer.under the plain language of this statute,a violation occurs when a debt collector sends a letter to the debtor place of employment absent consent that much is clear.the trickier question is whether sending a letter addressed to the debtor but using the debtor employer address constitutes a violation.
congress enacted the fdcpa in in response to abundant evidence of the use of abusive,deceptive,and unfair debt collection practices by many debt collectors which contribute to the number of personal bankruptcies,to marital instability,to the loss of jobs,and to invasions of individual privacy.a.congress intended the act to eliminate unfair practices such as embarrassing communications.the senate report explicitly stated 
collection abuse takes many forms,including disclosing a consumer personal affairs to friends,neighbors,or an employer 
sess,reprinted in.
given this court recognition that the fdcpa is a remedial statute which should be interpreted liberally,clark capital credit collection,cir,mickell act manifestly constitutes a violation.mickell knew or could reasonably anticipate that a letter sent to a class member employer might be opened and read by someone other than the debtor as it made its way to this is exactly what happened to evon,causing her stress and embarrassment,precisely what the act is designed to prevent.
next,even if mickell assumed that some debtors receive mail at their place of employment,it is not reasonable for mickell to assume that all debtors mail so received remains unopened and unseen before reaching the debtor.as a lawyer in the business of debt collecting,mickell should have known of the real possibility that a letter to a debtor place of employment,even one marked personal and confidential,would be viewed by someone other than the debtor.
finally,the return address on the envelope was from the law office of sidney mickell.any person handling evon mail would therefore know that evon was receiving legal mail,a fact many people would prefer be kept private.other than holiday greetings,correspondence from an attorney office rarely relays good news and often communicates information that can be embarrassing or even frightening to the recipient.as the senate report noted,disclosing a consumer personal affairs to his or her employer is a form of collection abuse.the act was explicitly intended to protect consumers from these types of communications.the federal trade commission ftc commentary prohibits this type of conduct.in its staff commentary,the ftc states 
accessibility by third party.a debt collector may not send a written message that is easily accessible to third parties.for example,he may not use a computerized billing statement that can be seen on the envelope itself.a debt collector may use an in care of letter only if the consumer lives at,or accepts mail at,the other party address.
staff commentary,emphasis added.although not dispositive,the ftc commentary is illustrative of the types of permissible and impermissible conduct.
moreover,mickell conceded that he had evon home address.he just did want to use it.as he testified at his deposition,mickell believed that a letter at work that is received during the day when people were awake and when people are in a business mode and my office is open,is more conducive to a successful communication with the debtor.that may be true in some instances perhaps some debtors would prefer to receive debt collection letters or phone calls at their place of employment.the act allows debt collectors to contact these debtors the debtor however needs first to give his or her consent.mickell admitted that he had no practice or policy in place to inquire whether a debtor consents to receiving mail at work.he took a chance that his conduct would not run afoul of the act.o ne who deliberately goes perilously close to an area of proscribed conduct takes the risk that he may cross the line.ftc colgate palmolive,d quoting boyce motor lines,united states.here,mickell conduct crossed the line.
permitting debt collectors to send letters addressed to the debtor in care of the debtor employer absent the debtor consent would allow debt collectors to circumvent the protection inherent in section b it would also impermissibly place the burden on the consumer to affirmatively contact the debt collector to notify it that communications to third parties are unacceptable.as evon points out,if mickell practice was permissible,what would prevent mickell or any debt collector from sending debtors letters addressed to them care of their parents,neighbors,friends,or relatives 
because mickell act constitutes a per se violation,the district court erred in denying evon motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability.
content of the letters 
evon next argues that the content of the letter violated which broadly prohibits the use by a debt collector of any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.
the letter states,in its entirety 
this office has attempted to avoid the costly and time consuming process of litigating the debt.unfortunately,it appears that our efforts have failed.
because you have chosen to limit our alternatives in resolving account number xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,california code of civil procedure section,requires us to inform you of the fact that we intend to commence legal action against you in the superior court of the state of california,which could result in a judgment against you.
california code of civil procedure,section,also requires us to inform you that such a judgment awarded against you could not only include the principle due,but interest,court costs,and attorney fees as well.
according to california law,a judgment awarded against you among other things,could result in remedies such as wage garnishments,bank account levies,or attachments of your assets,as well as accrue interest at the legal rate of per year.
demand is hereby made for immediate payment of the balance in full.please make out your check,or money order,in the amount of payable to the law office of sidney mickell.we also accept payments by visa and mastercard.in the event this office does not receive your payment in full,or another arrangement is accepted by my client,we will assume that you have chosen litigation,and whichever of the legal remedies that are reasonable and appropriate,to be our only alternative.
sidney mickell 
be advised,this is an attempt to collect a debt by a legal debt collector.any information obtained will be used for that purpose.as required by law,you are hereby notified that a negative credit report reflecting your credit record may be submitted to a credit reporting agency if you fail to fulfill the terms of your credit obligation.
whether conduct violates requires an objective analysis that takes into account whether the least sophisticated debtor would likely be misled by a communication.donohue,at citation omitted.the objective least sophisticated debtor standard is lower than simply examining whether particular language would deceive or mislead a reasonable debtor.terran kaplan,cir citation omitted.most courts agree that although the least sophisticated debtor may be uninformed,naive,and gullible,nonetheless her interpretation of a collection notice can not be bizarre or unreasonable.wahl midland credit,cir see also clomon jackson,cir i n crafting a norm that protects the naive and the credulous the courts have carefully preserved the concept of reasonableness.campuzano burgos midland credit,cir t he least sophisticated standard safeguards bill collectors from liability for bizarre or idiosyncratic interpretations of collection notices by preserving at least a modicum of reasonableness,as well as presuming a basic level of understanding and willingness to read with care on the part of the recipient.citation omitted.
evon primary arguments are that,to the least sophisticated debtor,the letter misstates that judgment is inevitable and the judgment will result in the taking of all wages or assets.
with respect to evon first argument,she cites schimmel slaughter.in support.there,an attorney sent a collection letter that included the following language 
i have ordered papers for suit.after judgment is obtained,garnishment can be brought to satisfy judgment.
the court found that the most likely interpretation of the unqualified statement a fter judgment is obtained is that a judgment against the debtor is a virtual certainty once suit is filed.id.at.
here,the statement does not say that legal action will result in a judgment against you,which would come much closer to the language held by the court in schimmel to appear to be a virtual certainty but rather says that legal action could result in a judgment against you.emphasis added.use of the conditional language in this instance is appropriate,accurate,and not misleading.
as to evon second argument,she relies on oglesby rotche,c,wl.the statement at issue in that case was 
the costs of the lawsuit will be charged to you,along with statutory interest.once judgment has been entered,it is our intent to proceed with court ordered attachment and garnishments of all wages,property,and other financial assets,all at additional expense to you.
the court rejected the debt collector argument that all wages,property,and other financial assets could be reasonably understood to mean only some wages,property,and other financial assets and that as written,the statement misrepresented the breadth of the garnishment and attachment statutes.id.at.
here,evon argues that the letter fails to include language to make it clear that only a certain portion of a debtor wages can be and that certain types of property,specified in.civ,are exempt from judgment executions and can not be levied upon evon argues that here,like the statement at issue in oglesby,garnishment of all wages,levies of all bank accounts attachment of all assets is unavoidable once court action has been initiated an end result which could not lawfully happen.but the statement evon complains of does not say all and her argument is an attempt to read that word into the language of the letter.
section prohibits only false,deceptive,or misleading representations.while the letter could have included additional clarifying language,we do not believe that the language of the letter goes so far as to be considered false,deceptive,or misleading.accordingly,the district court did not err in denying evon motion for partial summary judgment with respect to liability on this claim.
iv.class certification 
under federal rule of civil procedure,a class action may be maintained if two conditions are met the suit must satisfy the criteria set forth in subdivision a,numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation,and it also must fit into one of three categories described in subdivision b.shady grove orthopedic,allstate ins,d internal quotation marks omitted.
a standard of review 
the decision to grant or deny class certification is within the trial court discretion.yamamoto omiya,cir.thus,a district court order denying a motion for class certification is reviewed for abuse of discretion.zinser accufix research,cir.
b analysis 
the proposed class is defined as follows 
all consumers to whom,according to defendants records,within one year prior to filing this action the defendants sent a collection letter at their place of employment identical to or substantially similar to the letter sent to evon.
numerosity 
this requirement is met if the class is so large that joinder of all members is impracticable.a.
the district court found that numerosity was satisfied because there were potential class members.mickell does not address this argument on appeal.the district court did not abuse its discretion when it found this element satisfied.
commonality 
this requirement is met if there are questions of law and fact common to the class.fed.a.where the circumstances of each particular class member vary but retain a common core of factual or legal issues with the rest of the class,commonality exists.parra bashas,cir see also wal mart stores,dukes,d what matters to class certification is not the raising of common questions even in droves but,rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.
the district court found that the commonality requirement was a close issue but ultimately determined that fact questions existed that precluded finding it satisfied.the district judge believed these fact questions were whether the addresses on the letters were in fact business addresses whether class members had consented to receiving debt collection communications at their workplaces whether class members had specifically requested that debt collection communications not be sent to their workplaces.
the seminal issue in this case is whether mickell violated the fdcpa when he sent debt collection letters addressed to the debtor,but in care of the debtor employer,without first obtaining consent.that claim is a common contention among the class and determination of its truth or falsity is pivotal to this lawsuit and is capable of determination in one stroke.wal mart.at.
in addition,wal mart recently clarified that c ommonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate the class members have suffered the same injury.id.quoting gen.of sw.falcon,d.the class members here have all suffered the same injury they received a debt collection letter at their place of employment without first giving their consent,in violation of the fdcpa.
as for the district court concerns regarding fact questions,it is not clear that any individualized inquiry is necessary on this issue.mickell conceded that he sent letters to debtors at their places of employment.evon asserts that the addresses on the letters are business addresses.if the letters were sent to the debtor,care of a business address,in light of mickell admission,it is reasonable to assume that the letters were sent to the debtors workplaces.even assuming that an individualized inquiry is even necessary on this issue,it will consist of a limited,straightforward factual determination that would not preclude finding commonality.
with regard to the argument that individual questions of consent abound,this issue is a red herring.there is nothing in the record that supports the district court finding that consent may be an issue in the case.mickell produced nothing showing that certain class members had consented to receipt of the letters at work.
the district court concern over whether class members had specifically instructed mickell not to contact them at work was also unfounded.the issue in this case is that mickell sent letters to class members workplaces without first obtaining authorization.the class members do not have any burden to show that they contacted mickell and that he sent a letter despite their request not to do so.while that may be true for some class members,it is only peripherally relevant to the critical issue in this lawsuit and therefore can not defeat the commonality inquiry.
this case presents the classic case for treatment as a class action that is,the commonality linking the class members is the dispositive question in the lawsuit.it is not necessary that members of the proposed class share every fact in common.rodriguez hayes,cir.thus,the district court abused its discretion in finding that commonality was not satisfied.
typicality 
to demonstrate typicality,the putative class must show that the named parties claims are typical of the class.a.the test of typicality is whether other members have the same or similar injury,whether the action is based on conduct which is not unique to the named plaintiffs,and whether other class members have been injured by the same course of conduct.hanon dataproducts,cir citation omitted.
mickell argued below and the district court agreed that the typicality requirement is not satisfied because evon claim is subject to a unique bona fide error defense,specifically that evon explicitly instructed mickell representative not to contact her at work and that mickell mailed the letter to her workplace by accident.
but mickell does not qualify for the bona fide error defense as a matter of law,and thus whether evon claim is subject to this affirmative defense can not be a reason for finding that the typicality requirement is not satisfied.
to be eligible for the bona fide error defense,mickell would have to show that he violated the fdcpa unintentionally the violation resulted from a bona fide error and he maintained procedures reasonably adapted to avoid the violation.mccullough johnson,rodenburg lauinger,llc,cir.the record is clear that mickell intentionally sent letters to the workplaces of putative class members and that he had no procedures in place to discern a debtor consent prior to sending the letters thus,mickell can not avail himself of this affirmative defense.see jerman carlisle,mcnellie,rini,kramer ulrich,lpa,d i t is a fair inference that congress chose to permit injured consumers to recover actual damages,costs,fees,and modest statutory damages for intentional conduct,including violations resulting from mistaken interpretation of the fdcpa.see also reichert credit,cir a debt collector is not entitled under the fdcpa to sit back and wait until a mistake has been made and then institute procedures to prevent a recurrence.the district court abused its discretion when it found a lack of typicality based on this ground.
the named plaintiffs must fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.a.in making this determination,courts must consider two questions do the named plaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts of interest with other class members and will the named plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute the action vigorously on behalf of the class hanon,at.
the district court found adequacy to be lacking and believed this factor to be particularly decisive of the class certification inquiry.the district court found that evon was not the best representative for the class,and that plaintiff counsel was not qualified to represent the class.
as to the first issue,mickell argues that because evon waived her actual damages claim,she is not an adequate class representative.while evon may have waived her actual damages claim,she is still able and has recovered statutory damages,fees and costs.that she has waived her actual damages does not make her an inadequate representative she still maintains that the letter was sent to her employer in violation of the fdcpa and thus shares an interest and injury with all class members.
as to the district court second finding,there is nothing in the record that supports the district judge conclusion that sergei lemberg was not qualified to represent the class.the judge viewed the case as an action,and cited in re hotel telephone charges,cir,for the proposition that because the only persons likely to benefit from a class action in this case are class counsel,a costly and class action is hardly the superior method for resolving the dispute.
in re hotel telephone charges involved an estimated million class members that were allegedly defrauded by the owners of hotels across the country by paying surcharges on their hotel room rates.id.at.the court found that the plaintiffs claims raise d individual questions that could require decades of litigation including the type of misrepresentation made and whether each individual plaintiff relied on it.id.at.even assuming,the court said,that only ten percent of the unknown class members came forward with claims,approximately one hundred years would yet be required to adjudicate the claims.id.the court found that certifying a class would be unmanageable and would produce no real benefit about two dollars to an individual plaintiff to class members.id.at.
this is not such a case.the fdcpa is a consumer protection statute and was intended to permit,even encourage,attorneys like lemberg to act as private attorney generals to pursue fdcpa claims.moreover,plaintiffs have already benefitted and will continue to benefit from this case.mickell admits that he has ceased his practice of sending letters to debtor workplaces,a benefit to all class members.furthermore,certifying the class will serve a deterrent component to other debt collectors who are engaging,or consider engaging in this type of debt collection tactic.nor would recovery be meaningless to the individual class members here,since each would be eligible to receive the statutory maximum of in damages.in light of the fdcpa remedial goals,these are important considerations and the district judge abused his discretion by refusing to certify on this ground.
the district judge also faulted lemberg for bringing the class certification motion at the same time as the summary judgment motion.bringing a class certification motion together with a rule motion is consistent with the federal rules of civil procedure.see vega credit bureau,no,wl march,in re risk mgmt,fair debt collection practices litigation,goldberg winston morrone,civ,march.while rule does not require a district court to fully consider the merits of the plaintiffs claims,addressing the merits of the claims in a related summary judgment motion can have a substantial bearing on the required rule determinations.simultaneously filing motions for summary judgment and class certification is certainly acceptable.the district court abused its discretion when it refused to certify for this reason.
in sum,the district court abused its discretion in concluding that numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy were lacking in this case.because the district judge did not reach the rule b factors,we remand for consideration of whether any one of the rule b factors is satisfied.
attorney fees 
pursuant to the rule offer evon accepted,mickell agreed to pay evon reasonable and necessary attorney fees and costs,to be determined by the court.evon sought in attorney fees and in litigation costs.mickell opposed the fees application,primarily arguing that the number of hours billed was unreasonable.
the district judge recognized that evon received an award but found that the case had merely nuisance value.he further found that the level of success achieved was next to zero and that the hours evon attorney spent on the case were excessive and avoidable.he therefore denied recovery for all but the amount of time necessary to draft evon complaint.
a standard of review 
we review the award or denial of attorney fees for abuse of discretion,but any elements of legal analysis and statutory interpretation which figure in the district court decision are reviewable de novo.coalition for clean air southern california edison,cir.we will reverse if the district court misperceives or misapplies the law governing fee awards.id.
b analysis 
the fdcpa provides that any debt collector who fails to comply with its provisions is liable in the case of any successful action for the costs of the action,together with a reasonable attorney fee as determined by the court.a.the fdcpa statutory language makes the award of fees mandatory.bridgeport camacho,cir.the reason for mandatory fees is that congress chose a private attorney general approach to assume enforcement of the fdcpa.id.quoting tolentino friedman,cir.
the district judge focused on the case supposed lack of merit and on the nominal value of the judgment obtained to the exclusion of other factors in the lodestar calculation as to the supposed lack of merit,evon suit resulted in mickell abandoning his practice of sending debt collection letters to debtors workplaces.thus the lawsuit has already achieved a significant level of success.
moreover,although evon settled the case for a relatively small amount,she recovered the full amount of allowable statutory damages.this represents a complete recovery under the statutory scheme.in joe payco general am.credits,wl,cir,an unpublished disposition,payco general appealed the district court award of reasonable attorney fees and costs for an fdcpa violation.payco general argued that because joe only won a nominal award,reasonable attorney fees were not warranted.id.at.the court disagreed stating that joe was completely successful in this action to hold payco general responsible for its statutory violations and was thus the prevailing party and entitled to reasonable attorney fees.id.emphasis added.
furthermore,while the amount of damages recovered is relevant to the amount of attorney fees awarded,it is only one of several factors that a court must consider in determining the fee award.see city of riverside rivera,d.we have specifically instructed that courts should not reduce lode
