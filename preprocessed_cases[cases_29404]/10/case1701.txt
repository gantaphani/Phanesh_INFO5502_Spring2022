josephine larner,a nurse,sued her former hospital employer for violation of overtime laws,purporting to represent a class of current and former nonexempt employees.the trial court granted in part the hospital motion for summary adjudication of larner claim that the hospital failed to pay for overtime hours.larner then amended her complaint,stating individual and class claims for failure to properly calculate overtime pay rates and for failure to keep accurate and complete wage records.the trial court denied larner motion for class certification.the parties entered into a settlement agreement and stipulated to the entry of final judgment in favor of the hospital.larner appeals both the summary adjudication of her overtime hours claim and the denial of her certification motion.we dismiss the appeal as moot.
los angeles doctors hospital associates,lp,dba los angeles metropolitan medical center hereinafter lammc employed larner as a nurse.she regularly worked an alternative work schedule aws of three shifts per week,a total of hours.she also worked some additional hours.larner left her job in april.
in september,larner sued lammc alleging that lammc violated overtime laws by failing to pay her and other employees premium overtime wages times the regular hourly rate for hours of the additional hours she worked in a week.she also alleged that lammc did not correctly calculate employees overtime pay rates,and that lammc did not keep accurate and complete wage records.she brought the action on behalf of herself as well as a ll current and former hourly workers employed by defendants who failed to receive required premium overtime wages for the past four years.
lammc moved for summary adjudication of larner claim that lammc failed to pay for hours of overtime.at a hearing on january,the trial court granted the motion in part,agreeing with lammc that subsection b of industrial welfare commission iwc wage order established that the hospital had a duty to pay overtime only after employees had worked hours in a week.the trial court gave larner leave to amend.she filed a second amended complaint on may.
after a number of continuances,the court set a final trial date of july,on larner remaining claims.on may,larner moved for certification of two separate classes,one for each of her two remaining issues improper calculation of overtime rates and failure to keep accurate and complete wage records.the trial court denied the motion on june,because the motion was unduly tardy,because larner claims were not typical of the proposed classes,and because the class definitions were overbroad.
lammc and larner prepared for a trial on larner individual claims but reached a settlement on july,two days before the trial date.the parties then entered a stipulation for entry of final judgment based on the settlement,and the trial court entered judgment for lammc on july.larner appeals from the summary adjudication of her overtime hours claim and from the denial of her motion for class certification.
discussion 
as an initial matter,we must determine whether the settlement between the parties in the trial court renders larner appeal moot.lammc argues that the appeal is moot because,after larner lost both her summary adjudication motion and her motion for class certification,she settled all her individual claims with lammc and stipulated to the entry of judgment in lammc favor on the basis of the settlement.larner responds that she specifically reserved her right to appeal both the summary adjudication of the overtime issue and the denial of her motion for class certification.the stipulation for entry of final judgment states that while larner and lammc have entered into a settlement agreement whereby the parties intend to settle and resolve all disputes,larner reserv es her right to seek appellate review of the trial court order granting lammc motion for summary adjudication as to allegations related to the alternative workweek schedule and wage order,as well as appellate review of the trial court denial of larner motion for class certification and related rulings on june,and lammc expressly reserv es all defenses to any such appeals.the judgment contains nearly identical language.larner argues that because the parties expressly carved out these issues for appellate review,this appeal is not moot.
generally,courts decide only actual controversies which will result in a judgment that offers relief to the parties.citations.thus,appellate courts as a rule will not render opinions on moot questions the policy behind this rule is that courts decide justiciable controversies and will normally not render advisory opinions.citations.one such event occurring for which a reviewing court will dismiss an appeal is when the underlying claim is settled or compromised.ebensteiner,chadmar group th,d.when a case has settled,dismissal of the appeal is the appropriate disposition because settlement operates as a merger and bar as to all preexisting claims and those alleged in the lawsuit that have been resolved.id.at,d,citing armstrong sacramento valley cal.the reason why an appeal is dismissed if the judgment is satisfied is because the satisfaction moots the issues on appeal.citations.a prejudgment settlement has the same effect.it is decisive of the rights of the parties and bars reopening the issues settled.absent a fundamental defect the terms are binding on the parties t he merits of the original controversy are no longer in issue when a compromise agreement is made in good faith and without fraud,duress or undue influence.roofing.materials community bank d.dismissing appeal as moot where parties settled before entry of judgment.neither party challenges the validity of the settlement agreement,and thus the only question before us is whether the settlement moots larner appeal.
the joint stipulation acknowledges that larner and lammc have settled all claims and disputes,but nevertheless purports to preserve larner right to appeal.the july settlement agreement similarly states,it is the mutual intention of the parties to forego a trial on the merits,and settle all claims,conditioned on larner retaining all appellate options that presently exist and would have been available at the conclusion of trial.the parties agree that larner contends she possesses certain rights of appeal,irrespective of the outcome of a trial on the merits,whether favorable,in whole or in part,to either larner or lammc.by this agreement,therefore,it is the mutual intention of the parties to replicate the appellate options that would be available to larner had a trial on the merits been conducted.emphasis added 
the mutual intention of the parties to preserve appeal,however,does not control whether this appeal is moot the parties intent can not compel this court to issue an advisory opinion on issues in which,after the settlement,larner no longer retains any individual,personal stake.in general,we can not grant plaintiff any relief by reversing an order for claims that have been settled and compromised.ebensteiner,chadmar group,supra,th at,d see muccianti willow creek care center th,d finding appeal moot where parties entered into settlement agreement after filing of notice of appeal.we examine how this general rule applies in the context of larner class action.
a class representative receipt of relief on all her individual claims does not necessarily extinguish the interests of the members of the class she purported to represent.when a plaintiff sues on behalf of a class,he assumes a fiduciary obligation to the members of the class,surrendering any right to compromise the group action in return for an individual gain.even if the named plaintiff receives all the benefits that he seeks in the complaint,such success does not divest him of the duty to continue the action for the benefit of others similarly situated.la sala american sav.loan cal d.a defendant grant of individual relief to the named plaintiffs in a class action does not,in itself,render those plaintiffs unfit per se to represent the class.kagan gibraltar sav.loan cal d.in both la sala and kagan,the trial court dismissed a class action after the defendants offered relief to the named plaintiffs and before the plaintiffs moved for class certification.the court reversed the dismissals,holding that the class actions could continue in the trial court.
a defendant offer to settle,by waiving its right to enforce a clause in a contract against class representatives la sala,or by offering the named plaintiff reimbursement of fees the class action challenged as improperly deducted kagan,does not necessarily end the class action.even after an offer of individual relief,the named plaintiff may retain an interest in proceeding on behalf of the other members of the class who are similarly situated.if the trial court concludes that the named plaintiff is no longer a suitable representative,the court should grant the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to redefine the class,or add new class representatives,or both.la sala american sav.loan,supra,cal d at,see howard gunty profit sharing plan superior court th,d.this rule prevents a prospective defendant from avoiding a class action by picking off prospective plaintiffs,settling the individual claim in an attempt to disqualify the named plaintiff as a class representative.kagan gibraltar sav.loan,supra,cal d at,la sala american sav.loan,supra,cal d at,weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group.
summary adjudication of overtime claim 
when larner settled and compromised all her individual claims against lammc,she had already lost her class claim that lammc failed to pay overtime for some of the additional hours worked.in granting lammc motion for summary adjudication,the trial court concluded that subsection b of iwc wage order established lammc duty to pay overtime so that larner was not entitled to overtime pay for hours of a week in which she worked more than the hours provided for by her schedule.when more than two and years later and after losing her class certification motion on different issues,larner settled all claims in her case,she also released her overtime hours claim.
the general rule that settlement renders a claim moot applies to larner appeal of the grant of summary adjudication.larner lost this issue on the merits.she had not moved to certify a class on this claim.the trial court resolved the issue on a substantive ground that would apply equally to deny relief to any nonexempt worker on a schedule,so the settlement can not be viewed as picking off larner as a named plaintiff on a valid class claim by offering a small settlement.see wiesmueller kosobucki cir,question whether to certify class is moot where,before certification motion,the ground on which the district court threw out the plaintiff claims would apply equally to any other member of the class.rather than resisting settlement on this claim,larner embraced it years later,after she lost her attempt to certify classes on other class claims in the trial court she would receive no individual relief even if we were to reverse the trial court summary adjudication.we therefore conclude that larner settlement renders moot her appeal of the summary adjudication 
ii.denial of class certification 
after the trial court granted summary adjudication on her overtime hours claim,larner filed a second amended class action complaint stating wage claims which,unlike the overtime hours claim,the court did not address on the merits.instead,the court denied her motion for class certification,and larner then settled those additional wage claims.we separately address whether the settlement between larner and lammc after the denial of class certification extinguishes all actual controversy on appeal as to the second amended complaint class allegations.
california and federal class action law 
our law concerning class actions is comprised of a mixture of federal and state law california law controls if it exists.otherwise,i n the absence of california authority,california courts may look to the federal rules of civil procedure frcp and to the federal cases interpreting them in re bcbg overtime cases th,d,citation omitted.no california case addresses the question presented here is a named plaintiff appeal moot following a denial of class certification,a voluntary settlement of all claims reserving the right to appeal,and a subsequent stipulated judgment we therefore look to federal authority,which we may apply where consistent with california law and policy.la sala american sav.loan,supra,cal d at.
both california and federal law favor class actions.courts long have acknowledged the importance of class actions to prevent a failure of justice in our judicial system.citations.by establishing a technique whereby the claims of many individuals can be resolved at the same time,the class suit both eliminates the possibility of repetitious litigation and provides small claimants with a method of obtaining redress.linder thrifty oil cal th,d,see deposit guaranty nat.bank roper,d where it is not economically feasible to obtain relief within the traditional framework of a multiplicity of small individual suits for damages,aggrieved persons may be without any effective redress unless they may employ the device.both state and federal courts urge careful management of class suits,to allow their maintenance only where there are substantial benefits to litigants and the courts.while class actions are an important means to prevent a failure of justice in our judicial system,they also carry the potential to create injustice.linder thrifty oil cal th,d.the potential for misuse of the class action mechanism is obvious.its benefits to class members are often nominal and symbolic,with persons other than class members becoming the chief beneficiaries.deposit guaranty nat.bank roper,supra,d.howard gunty profit sharing plan superior court,supra,th at,d.
in roper and its companion case,united states parole comm geraghty,supra,d,the supreme court allowed named plaintiffs whose individual claims were mooted to appeal the previous denials of class certification.geraghty,a prisoner denied parole,filed a class action challenging the federal parole guidelines.after the district court denied class certification and ruled against geraghty on his individual claim,geraghty appealed,but he was released from prison while the appeal was pending.even though geraghty substantive claims were moot following his release,the supreme court agreed that his appeal was not moot because he had a separate procedural right to represent a class.id.at.
in roper,credit card holders brought a class action claiming they had been charged usurious finance charges.after the trial court denied their class certification motion,the bank tendered to each named plaintiff the maximum amount that each could have recovered.although plaintiffs declined to accept the tender,the district court entered judgment in plaintiffs favor over their objection,and dismissed the action.the named plaintiffs sought appellate review of the certification denial,and the court of appeals held that the forced tender did not moot the appeal.the supreme court agreed that the case was not moot,because even after full tender the plaintiffs retained a private interest in shifting a portion of their fees and costs to successful class litigants if the class eventually was certified and prevailed a significant benefit to claimants who choose to litigate their individual claims in a context is the prospect of reducing their costs of litigation,particularly attorney fees,by allocating such costs among all members of the class who benefit from any recovery.deposit guaranty nat.bank roper,supra,at,fn.
the supreme court emphasized in both cases that the named plaintiffs did not settle voluntarily,and in geraghty,the court specifically reserved the issue in this case we intimate no view as to whether a named plaintiff who settles the individual claim after denial of class certification may,consistent with art.iii,appeal from the adverse ruling on class certification.united states parole comm geraghty,supra,at,fn.
