ikuta,circuit judge 
daniel norcia filed a class action complaint against samsung telecommunications america,llc,and samsung electronics america,collectively,samsung,alleging that samsung made misrepresentations as to the performance of the galaxy phone.samsung moved to compel arbitration of the dispute on the ground that an arbitration provision,which was contained in a warranty brochure included in the galaxy box,was binding on norcia.we affirm the district court denial of samsung motion.
on may,norcia entered a verizon wireless store in san francisco,california,to purchase a samsung galaxy phone.norcia paid for the phone at the register,and a verizon wireless employee provided a receipt entitled customer agreement followed by the name and address of the verizon wireless store.the receipt stated the order location,norcia mobile number,the product identification number,and the contract end date.under the heading items,the receipt stated yr.mfg.warranty.under the heading agreement,the receipt included three provisions,including a statement in all capital letters 
i agree to the current verizon wireless customer agreement,including the calling plan,with extended limited contract,if applicable,and other terms and conditions for services and selected features i have agreed to purchase as reflected on the receipt,and which have been presented to me by the sales representative and which i had the opportunity to review.
the receipt also stated in all capital letters i understand that i am agreeing to settlement of disputes by arbitration and other means instead of jury trials,and other important terms in the customer agreement.the customer agreement did not reference samsung or any other party.norcia signed the customer agreement,and verizon wireless emailed him a copy.
after signing the customer agreement,norcia and a verizon wireless employee took the galaxy phone,still in its sealed samsung box,to a table.the front of the product box stated samsung galaxy.the back of the box stated package contains product safety warranty brochure.the verizon wireless employee opened the box,unpacked the phone and materials,and helped norcia transfer his contacts from his old phone to the new phone.norcia took the phone,the phone charger,and the headphones with him as he left the store,but he declined the offer by the verizon wireless employee to take the box and the rest of its contents.
the samsung galaxy box contained,among other things,a product safety warranty information brochure.the brochure consisted of two sections.section contained a wide range of health and safety information,while section contained samsung standard limited warranty and end user license agreement for software.the standard limited warranty section explained the scope of samsung express warranty.in addition to explaining samsung obligations,the procedure for obtaining warranty service,and the limits of samsung liability,the warranty section included the following in all capital letters 
all disputes with samsung arising in any way from this limited warranty or the sale,condition or performance of the products shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration,and not by a court or jury.
later in the section,a paragraph explained the procedures for arbitration and stated that purchasers could opt out of the arbitration agreement by providing notice to samsung within calendar days of purchase,either through email or by calling a telephone number.it also stated that opting out will not affect the coverage of the limited warranty in any way,and you will continue to enjoy the benefits of the limited warranty.norcia did not take any steps to opt out.
in february,norcia filed a class action complaint against samsung,alleging that samsung misrepresented the galaxy storage capacity and rigged the phone to operate at a higher speed when it was being tested.the complaint alleged that these deceptive acts constituted common law fraud and violated california consumers legal remedies act cal.civ.code,california unfair competition law cal.bus.code,and california false advertising law cal.bus.code.the complaint sought certification of the case as a class action for all purchasers of the galaxy phone in california.norcia did not bring any claims for breach of warranty.
instead of filing an answer to the complaint,samsung moved to compel arbitration by invoking the arbitration provision in the product safety warranty information brochure.the district court denied samsung motion.it held that even though norcia should be deemed to have received the galaxy box,including the product safety warranty information brochure,the receipt of the brochure did not form an agreement to arbitrate claims.samsung timely appealed the district court order.

samsung raises two theories of contract formation to support its argument that norcia entered into a binding contract with samsung to arbitrate his claims.first,samsung claims that the inclusion of the arbitration provision in the product safety warranty information brochure created a valid contract between samsung and norcia to arbitrate all claims related to the galaxy phone.second,samsung contends that the customer agreement signed by norcia incorporated the terms of its product safety warranty information brochure by reference and created a binding contract between norcia and samsung.
in analyzing these arguments,we apply ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts to decide whether an agreement to arbitrate exists.first options of,kaplan.here,the parties agree that california law governs the issue of contract formation.in discerning california law,we are bound by the decisions of the california supreme court,including reasoned dicta.muniz united parcel,cir.if the california supreme court has not directly addressed the question before us,we must predict how it would decide the issue.see glendale,nlrb,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.we generally will follow a published intermediate state court decision regarding california law unless we are convinced that the california supreme court would reject it.muniz,at.applying california law,we address each of samsung theories in turn.
we first evaluate whether the product safety warranty information brochure in the galaxy box created a binding contract between norcia and samsung to arbitrate the claims in norcia complaint.although the brochure is in the form of an express consumer warranty from samsung to norcia,the arbitration provision states that arbitration is required not only for a ll disputes with samsung arising in any way from this limited warranty but also for all disputes arising from the sale,condition or performance of the products.norcia complaint involves a dispute.thus,our analysis is governed by contract law not warranty law.
we begin with the basic principles of california contract law.generally,under california law,the essential elements for a contract are p arties capable of contracting t heir consent a lawful object and s ufficient cause or consideration.united states ex rel.oliver parsons,cir.alterations in original quoting cal.civ.code.a party who is bound by a contract is bound by all its terms,whether or not the party was aware of them.a party can not avoid the terms of a contract on the ground that he or she failed to read it before signing.marin storage trucking,benco contracting eng g,cal.app.
a contract for sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement,including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of such a contract.cal.com.code.courts must determine whether the outward manifestations of consent would lead a reasonable person to believe the offeree has assented to the agreement.knutson,at citing meyer benko,cal.app.
as a general rule,silence or inaction does not constitute acceptance of an offer.golden eagle ins.foremost ins,cal.app,see also sorg fred weisz,cal.app.california courts have long held that a n offer made to another,either orally or in writing,can not be turned into an agreement because the person to whom it is made or sent makes no reply,even though the offer states that silence will be taken as consent,for the offerer can not prescribe conditions of rejection so as to turn silence on the part of the offeree into acceptance.leslie brown,cal,see also witkin,summary of california law,contracts ed.collecting california cases.
there are exceptions to this rule,however.an offeree silence may be deemed to be consent to a contract when the offeree has a duty to respond to an offer and fails to act in the face of this duty.golden eagle,cal.app.at see also beatty safway scaffold,skrable,cal.app.for example,in gentry superior court,an employee signed an easily readable,form acknowledging that he would be required to arbitrate all legal disputes unless he opted out.cal,abrogated on other grounds by mobility llc concepcion.by signing this agreement,the employee manifested his intent to use his silence,or failure to opt out,as a means of accepting the arbitration agreement.id.therefore,the california supreme court held that the employee failure to act constituted acceptance of the agreement.id.
an offeree silence may also be treated as consent to a contract when the party retains the benefit offered.see golden eagle,cal.app.at see also cal.civ.code a voluntary acceptance of the benefit of a transaction is equivalent to a consent to all the obligations arising from it,so far as the facts are known,or ought to be known,to the person accepting.in golden eagle,a couple received a renewal certificate from their insurance company,and retained the benefit of the renewed insurance policy without paying the premium.cal.app.at.the court held that in light of the existing relationship between the couple and the insurance company,the couple retention of the renewal certification was sufficient evidence of acceptance of the renewal policy under california law.id.at.
even if there is an applicable exception to the general rule that silence does not constitute acceptance,courts have rejected the argument that an offeree silence constitutes consent to a contract when the offeree reasonably did not know that an offer had been made.see windsor mills,collins aikman,cal.app.in windsor mills,a buyer ordered yarn from a supplier,and the supplier acknowledged the order on a printed form which stated in small print on the reverse side of the form.arbitration any controversy arising out of or relating to this contract shall be settled by arbitration in the city of new york id.at.the court concluded that the buyer was not bound by this provision because an offeree,regardless of apparent manifestation of his consent,is not bound by inconspicuous contractual provisions of which he was unaware,contained in a document whose contractual nature is not obvious.id.at see also marin storage,cal.app.at noting that a party is not bound by a document that does not appear to be a contract and the terms are not called to the attention of the recipient.
we now apply these principles of california law to determine whether norcia engaged in any conduct sufficient to show that he agreed to be bound by the arbitration agreement in the product safety warranty information brochure.there is no dispute that norcia did not expressly assent to any agreement in the brochure.nor did norcia sign the brochure or otherwise act in a manner that would show his intent to use his silence,or failure to opt out,as a means of accepting the arbitration agreement.gentry,cal.at.under california law,an offeree inaction after receipt of an offer is generally insufficient to form a contract.leslie,cal.at.therefore,samsung offer to arbitrate all disputes with norcia can not be turned into an agreement because the person to whom it is made or sent makes no reply,even though the offer states that silence will be taken as consent,unless an exception to this general rule applies.
samsung fails to demonstrate the applicability of any exception to the general california rule that an offeree silence does not constitute consent.samsung has not pointed to any principle of california law that imposed a duty on norcia to act in response to receiving the product safety warranty information brochure.gentry,cal.at.nor was there any previous course of dealing between the parties that might impose a duty on norcia to act.see beatty safway scaffold,cal.app.at.moreover,samsung has not alleged that norcia retained any benefit by failing to act.see cal.civ.code.indeed,the brochure states that norcia was entitled to the benefits of the limited warranty regardless whether norcia opted out of the arbitration agreement.
in the absence of an applicable exception,california general rule for contract formation applies.because norcia did not give any outward manifestations of consent that would lead a reasonable person to believe the offeree has assented to the agreement,knutson,at,no contract was formed between norcia and samsung,and norcia is not bound by the arbitration provision contained in the brochure.
to counter this conclusion,samsung argues that norcia was bound by the terms set forth in the brochure because the brochure is analogous to a license,which we held was enforceable in california,see wall data cty.sheriff dep t,cir,or is analogous to terms included in a box sent to the consumer referred to here as an contract,which the seventh circuit has held to be enforceable,see hill gateway,cir.we consider each of these arguments in turn.
in wall data,we considered a software manufacturer claim that a sheriff department had violated the terms of its license,license,and volume license booklets,and infringed the manufacturer copyright,by installing software on computers when the department was licensed to install the software on only computers.at.we defined a license as a form on the packing or on the outside of the containing the softwa
