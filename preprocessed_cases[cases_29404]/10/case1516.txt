citigroup offered a voluntary employee incentive compensation plan that provides employees with shares of restricted company stock at a reduced price in lieu of a portion of that employee annual cash compensation.employees agree that,should they resign or be terminated for cause before their restricted shares of stock vest,they would forfeit the stock and the portion of cash compensation they directed be paid in the form of the restricted stock.we consider here whether the incentive plan forfeiture provision violates labor code sections,and,which provide that employees be paid all earned,unpaid wages upon termination or resignation and prohibit agreements that purport to circumvent that requirement.we conclude the forfeiture provision does not run afoul of the labor code because no earned,unpaid wages remain outstanding upon termination according to the terms of the incentive plan.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
background 
david schachter was employed as a stockbroker by smith barney,now a subsidiary of citigroup,the company from april,to march.schachter,along with officers and other key individuals in the company employ,was given the option to participate in the company capital accumulation plan the plan a program that provided incentives to those employees who directly influenced the company value.
under the plan,eligible employees could elect to receive awards of restricted company stock in lieu of cash payment of a percentage of the employee annual compensation.participating employees could elect to receive,or percent of their total compensation in the form of restricted stock.to participate in the plan for the following calendar year,an employee had to execute a capital accumulation plan election to receive restricted stock form at the end of the current calendar year indicating the amount of total compensation in the form of restricted stock he or she wished to receive.the percentage of total compensation received as restricted stock could be different for the first and second periods of the year.
restricted stock could not be sold,transferred,pledged,or assigned for a period commencing on the date of the award however,the plan provided that participating employees shall have the right to direct the vote and receive any regular dividends on restricted stock shares during the restricted period 
for purposes of determining the number of shares to be acquired under the plan,the purchase price of the stock was discounted at a rate of percent of its market price,averaged over the five days preceding the date of the acquisition,to reflect the impact of the restrictions on the value of the restricted stock,as well as the possibility of forfeiture of restricted stock.on the date of the purchase,the company either issued stock certificates to a participating employee,to be held by the company until the restricted period lapsed,or made a book entry in the company records evidencing the award.although a participating employee could elect to pay taxes on the restricted stock when the stock was purchased see,the participating employees restricted shares were not included in the participating employees gross income for federal tax purposes until the vesting period had expired.
if an employee remained in the company employ for the two years following the purchase of restricted stock,title to the shares vested fully with the employee,free of any restrictions.however,if an employee voluntarily terminated employment or was terminated for cause before the end of the period,the employee forfeited his or her restricted stock as well as the percentage of annual income designated by the employee to be paid as shares of restricted stock.in contrast,if an employee was involuntarily terminated without cause,the employee forfeited his or her restricted stock,but received in return,without interest,a cash payment equal to the portion of his or her annual compensation that had been paid in the form of such forfeited r estricted s tock.
on december,schachter enrolled in the plan,and elected to receive percent of his total compensation in in the form of restricted stock for both periods.on july,schachter received shares of restricted stock with a vesting date of july,and on january,he received shares of restricted stock with a vesting date of january.at the end of,schachter again elected to participate in the plan during the calendar year,but modified his election such that no restricted stock would be purchased during the first half of,and percent of his total compensation between july and december would constitute restricted stock.on march,schachter voluntarily terminated his employment with the company.because schachter resignation occurred prior to the vesting dates of his restricted stock,he forfeited all of his shares of stock and the percentage of his annual compensation he directed be paid to him in the form of restricted stock.
in may,schachter filed a putative class action against the company alleging that the plan forfeiture provision violated labor code sections and which require the prompt payment of all earned wages when an employee is terminated or when an employee resigns,that the plan forfeiture provision violated section which prohibits an employee from returning wages to an employer,and that forfeiture of the percentage of annual compensation received in the form of shares of stock constituted the unlawful conversion of wages.the company filed a motion for summary judgment or adjudication,which the trial court denied in its entirety on october.
years of litigation followed,and after a class consisting of former employees who have suffered financial damages as a result of the forfeiture provisions of the p lan was certified,and an intervening appeal schachter citigroup,th,d was completed,the trial court elected to exercise its inherent authority to reconsider its original denial of the company summary judgment motion in accordance with le francois goel cal th,d.upon reconsideration,the trial court concluded that the plan forfeiture provision did not violate sections and,and it granted the company motion for summary judgment.schachter appealed,and the court of appeal affirmed the trial court grant of summary judgment.
the court of appeal concluded that the plan forfeiture provision did not violate sections and,and,accordingly,the plan did not violate section,which provides that wage payment statutes,among others,can not be contravened or set aside by private agreement.schachter argued that the forfeiture provision violated the labor code because an employee resignation or termination for cause resulted in the employee forfeiture of not only the shares of the restricted company stock they had purchased,which schachter conceded was lawful,but also the earned but unpaid compensation used to purchase those shares.in rejecting schachter argument,the court concluded that schachter was paid all of his earned in the form of restricted stock with an immediate right to vote and earn dividends,and some in the form of cash compensation.the court also reasoned and schachter conceded that if he had been paid all of his compensation in cash and then used a portion of those paid wages to purchase restricted stock,no labor code violation would have occurred.the court concluded that the only difference between the instant transaction and a certainly lawful transaction in which the company paid schachter and then permitted him to use his earnings to purchase restricted stock was the plan tax deferral benefits.the court found that at most,the omission of the intermediate step of delivering the money to schachter before implementing his request to use it to purchase the designated restricted stock amounts to a deduction of wages for an authorized use,a transaction expressly permitted by section.
schachter also argued that the plan forfeiture provision amounted to a deferral and withholding of wages because the shares lacked ascertainable value and therefore did not constitute a wage.the court rejected his argument,explaining that the shares of restricted stock had value and constituted a wage within the meaning of section the court explained that schachter received these wages and no wages were deferred or withheld.alternatively,the court opined that if schachter was correct and the restricted stock did not constitute a wage,his claim would nonetheless fail because forfeiture of the stock that is,forfeiture of something that is not a wage would not violate the labor code.
finally,the court reasoned that even if it accepted schachter argument that he was never paid wages either as cash or as restricted stock,his claim that the plan forfeiture provision violated the labor code would still fail as a matter of law because he could not show the funds used to purchase the shares were actually earned.the court explained,under basic incentive compensation plans the point at which the wage is actually earned is determined by the parties agreement.payment of incentive compensation may be contingent upon the happening of a future event,such as continued employment.relying on neisendorf levi strauss th,d neisendorf,which held that an employee is not eligible to receive a bonus if his or her employment terminates prior to the happening of a contingent future event such as employment on a specified date,the court explained that schachter elected not to remain in the company employ for the designated period presumably after making a calculated decision that the economic and noneconomic reasons to leave outweighed the reasons to stay,which included completing the required services needed to earn the restricted stock.accordingly,schachter did not thus had no right to the restricted stock or the funds used to purchase it.we granted schachter petition for review.
discussion 
we review de novo a trial court grant of summary judgment along with its resolution of any underlying issues of statutory construction.barner leeds cal th,d.a trial court may only grant a motion for summary judgment if no triable issues of material fact appear and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c state of california allstate ins.cal th,d.the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see binder aetna life ins.th,d.
to ascertain whether the plan forfeiture provision violates sections and,we must first address whether schachter or any class member would be therefore would be required to earned and unpaid wages upon resigning or being terminated for cause,subd.a.a wage is defined as all amounts for labor performed by employees of every description,whether the amount is fixed or ascertained by the standard for time,task,piece,commission basis,or other method of calculation,subd.a.we construe the term wages broadly to include not only the periodic monetary earnings of the employee but also the other benefits to which he is entitled as a part of his compensation.wise southern pac.cal d.courts have recognized that wages also include those benefits to which an employee is entitled as a part of his or her compensation,including money,room,board,clothing,vacation pay,and sick pay,suastez plastic cal d,department of industrial relations ui video stores,th,d.murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th,d.incentive compensation,such as bonuses and plans,also constitute wages.see neisendorf,supra,th at,d lucian all states trucking d.ware merrill lynch d.
schachter alleges that the percentage of his annual compensation he directed be paid to him in the form of shares of restricted stock constitutes a wage that remained earned but unpaid following his resignation.we disagree.certainly all cash compensation schachter received constituted a wage.the court of appeal concluded,and we agree,that the shares of restricted stock issued to schachter also constituted a wage.the company does not dispute that both the cash compensation and restricted the conditional present rights voting and dividend rights,as well as contingent future rights of full ownership in that restricted stock awarded but never transformed into noncontingent,fully vested rights constituted wages.schachter does not contest these conclusions,and does not allege that the company failed to pay him the compensation he elected to receive as cash or the shares of restricted stock upon his termination.instead,schachter alleges that the portion of his cash compensation he directed be paid to him in form of restricted stock should have been paid to him in cash upon his resignation.
schachter makes this argument in a somewhat convoluted fashion,alleging here,as he did before the court of appeal,that the plan is illegal and unenforceable pursuant to section prohibiting agreements that attempt to circumvent the requirements of the labor code,and a court would be precluded from denying his wage claim under section regarding the timely payment of wages upon termination based upon the terms of the plan despite the fact that schachter voluntarily enrolled in the plan.the company argues,however,and we agree,that schachter has put the cart before the horse.before schachter can argue that the plan constitutes an improper agreement under section,he must demonstrate that the plan forfeiture provision violates sections and,the statutes governing wage payment upon termination or resignation.this he can not accomplish.
schachter correctly suggests that section prohibits an employer and employee from agreeing,even voluntarily,to circumvent provisions of article i consisting of of the labor code.schachter also correctly argues that agreement s prospectively waiving an employee rights under sections and to receive all his or her earned but deferred or unpaid wages constitute waivers which section renders illegal and unenforceable.however,it is settled that an employer may unilaterally alter the terms of an employment agreement,provided such alteration does not run afoul of the labor code.digiacinto th,d digiacinto see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.agency and employment,unilateral reduction in wage.there is,of course,a strong common law presumption that an employee may be demoted at will.since it is presumed that an employee may be discharged at will,the presumption would surely apply to lesser quant a of discipline as well.scott pacific gas electric cal th,d,see digiacinto,supra,th at,d.the presumption authorizing an employer to discharge or demote an employee similarly and necessarily authorizes an employer to unilaterally alter the terms of employment,provided that the alteration does not violate a statute or breach an implied or express contractual agreement.scott pacific gas electric,supra,cal th at,d,digiacinto,supra,th at,d.an employee who continues in the employ of the employer after the employer has given notice of changed terms or conditions of employment has accepted the changed terms and conditions.digiacinto,supra,th at,d.
it can not be questioned that employers and employees are free to prospectively and bilaterally alter the terms of employment.as we recently noted,s wages above the minimum wage are a matter of private contract between the employer and employee.gentry superior court cal th,d,quoting earley superior court th,d.here,when schachter submitted his plan election form in december,he agreed to a restructured compensation package for the following year that included a lower annual salary and payment in the form of restricted stock subject to all of the provisions and administrative rules of the plan.again,in,schachter submitted a plan election form requesting that he be paid entirely in cash during the first six months of,and in cash and restricted stock during the latter six months of.he acknowledged that his resignation or termination for cause before the end of the vesting period would result in forfeiture of the restricted stock and the percentage of his compensation that he authorized to be paid in the form of such restricted stock.
schachter does not contest that he received all of the cash compensation to which he was entitled.instead,he argues that the portion of compensation he directed be paid to him in the form of restricted stock should have been transformed into a cash payment upon his resignation.this argument is unavailing.when he executed the plan election forms,schachter essentially renegotia
