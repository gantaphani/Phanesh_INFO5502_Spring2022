the secretary of the interior,in his official capacity,petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus disqualifying special master alan balaran and suppressing three reports he filed with the district court in the litigation involving interior management of trust accounts for the benefit of american indians,cobell norton,d.although balaran has since resigned as special master,interior still seeks to suppress both his interim report on the misconduct charges native american industrial distributors,naid made against the department and two reports on his visits to interior facilities where individual trust account information is maintained.before writing the three reports,balaran had hired a former employee of naid to assist him,thereby creating a situation in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned and requiring his disqualification pursuant to a.we therefore grant the secretary petition and order that the three reports be suppressed.
background 
the special master reports at issue here arise from the protracted litigation over interior mishandling of the individual indian money iim trust accounts created for each indian having an interest in certain allotted lands.the facts and procedural history we recount here tell but a small portion of the full story of that class action,which began a decade ago.for a more complete account,see cobell norton.
in the district court concluded that by failing properly to account for the balances in the iim trust accounts,the department,as trustee,had breached the fiduciary duty it owed to the plaintiffs under the american indian trust fund management reform act of,et.see cobell babbitt,d.the court directed the department to design and implement an accurate accounting and system for the trust accounts retained jurisdiction in order to provide ongoing judicial review of trust reform efforts and ordered the department to file quarterly progress reports.id.at.the better to monitor interior progress,the district court authorized special master alan balaran to oversee the department retention and protection from destruction of iim records through visits to any location where iim records are maintained.balaran was later charged also with oversight of the department policies and procedures relating to the security of iim records.
a significant element in the plan to reform interior trust management is the creation of the trust asset and accounting management system taams,a computerized system meant to account properly for balances in iim trust accounts.for assistance with the taams project,the department retained naid,an information technology firm.in august naid filed a motion to intervene as a plaintiff in the class action,claiming the department had unilaterally modified its contract with the company,effectively replacing it with a competitor,in retaliation for naid unfavorable assessment of the taams project.naid also alleged the department had omitted material information from its eighth quarterly report,which it filed with the district court in january.upon determining the company could seek relief only under the contract disputes act of,et,the district court in september dismissed naid motion to intervene.
in october special master balaran,following up on naid allegations,contacted the department of justice and asked for a copy of the administrative record upon which the interior department had based the eighth quarterly report.some weeks later the district court formally sanctioned balaran inquiry,directing him to ascertain whether there is any validity to naid contention that interior withheld information from the court that should have been disclosed in the eighth quarterly report.in late january interior counsel at justice wrote to balaran stating that interior would produce unprivileged documents,along with a privilege log,by,but that did not happen.interior counsel instead invited balaran to inspect the documents at the department of justice,which he did on february.interior counsel also arranged for michael smith,an executive vice president of naid who had worked on the taams project team and was knowledgeable about the administrative record,to attend on the.earlier that year,smith had written to interior on naid behalf reiterating the allegations of fraud and demanding monetary relief.
shortly after the inspection,and unbeknownst to the departments of interior and of justice,balaran hired smith to assist him in collecting and analyzing documents relevant to his investigation into the completeness and accuracy of the eighth quarterly report.balaran also made smith employment retroactive from the date of the inspection.in due course balaran submitted to interior billing records indicating that from february to april,inclusive one mss had worked some hours on the investigation,much of that time specifically review ing qr documents,analyz ing qr exhibits,and draft ing qr analysis.on april smith,according to the president of naid,terminated any and all relationships with special master balaran,after which naid was his sole employer.
on april balaran issued a interim report to the district court,on the first page of which he noted that he had relied upon documentation obtained outside of normal channels and to sic which the parties may have no familiarity.the referenced documents were attached to the report in the form of exhibits.the report detailed interior alleged intention to mask certain deficiencies of the taams project and concluded the eighth quarterly report failed to provide a clear and independent picture of trust reform rather,it was designed to avoid liability at all costs.
apart from his investigation of the alleged relating to taams,in march balaran had visited interior offices in gallup,new mexico and window rock,arizona,and in september he inspected the department office in dallas,texas.in august and september balaran issued reports in which he criticized various aspects of the department operations at those facilities.
in the meantime,having learned that balaran had employed smith,interior moved in may to disqualify balaran from further participation in the case,pursuant to a requiring recusal in any proceeding in which a judge impartiality might reasonably be questioned and b requiring recusal where a judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party,or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding.the class action plaintiffs opposed the motion.six months later,the district court not having ruled upon the motion,the secretary of the interior petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus directing the recusal of special master alan balaran.the district court then denied the department motion to disqualify balaran,see cobell norton,d,holding special master balaran engaged in no untoward conduct,after which balaran resigned as special master.
then came in re brooks,in which we held special master balaran ex parte contacts with parties and counsel to certain contempt proceedings arising from this same class action necessitated his recusal with respect to those proceedings under both a and b of id.at.in order to protect those proceedings from the taint of his participation,we ordered that balaran work product relevant to those proceedings be suppressed.id.in light of that decision,interior now urges us to suppress the three reports balaran issued after he hired smith.
ii.analysis 
although interior concedes that balaran resignation mooted the question of his further participation in the case,the department argues suppression of the three reports is still appropriate if balaran was disqualified as special master before he submitted those reports to the district court.the class action plaintiffs claim the department mandamus petition became moot in its entirety upon balaran resignation and oppose suppression of the three reports here at issue.
the plaintiffs point out that interior mandamus petition requested no other relief than an end to balaran involvement in the underlying litigation.because there is no need for the court to decide whether to compel balaran removal from further involvement in the case now that he has resigned,the plaintiffs
