plaintiffs,a class of prisoners incarcerated by defendant michigan department of corrections,and their prospective visitors,sue the department under,claiming that restrictions on prison visitation imposed in violate their rights under the first,eighth,and fourteenth amendments.
in,michigan department of corrections issued new regulations limiting who can visit prisoners.the regulations challenged by plaintiffs banned visits from prisoners minor brothers,sisters,nieces and nephews banned all visits by prisoners children when parental rights had been terminated banned all visits by former prisoners who are not immediate family required that visiting children be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian,and permanently banned visitors,apart from attorneys and clergy,for prisoners who twice violated the department drug abuse policies.
the new regulations were a response to growth in michigan prison population in the early and the resulting increase in the number of visitors.department officials believed the increase in visitors made supervising visits more difficult and smuggling of drugs and weapons more difficult to stop.officials also decided that the increased number of visiting children was a problem because it was difficult for prison guards to supervise children and because the prison environment was bad for the children.we note that there are two kinds of visits,contact and.contact visits allow physical contact between a prisoner and visitors,and occur in meeting rooms supervised by prison guards.visits occur when a prisoner and visitors sit in separate rooms,but can see one another through a clear window and speak on a telephone.at.
in,plaintiffs challenged the new regulations,asserting they violated plaintiffs first,eighth,and fourteenth amendment rights.the department defended the constitutionality of the regulations,arguing they were only applied to contact visits,to which prisoners have no absolute right.the district court found plaintiffs challenge to the permanent ban on visitors for substance abuse violations was not ripe,but upheld the other regulations as they applied to contact visits.see bazzetta mcginnis.we affirmed its decision,holding that there is no inherent,absolute right to contact visits with prisoners,bazzetta mcginnis,cir emphasis added,but we did not address whether prisoners have a right to visits.see bazzetta mcginnis,cir.subsequently it turned out that the department seriously misled us and was applying the regulations to all visits,contact and.plaintiffs again brought suit challenging the regulations,this time as applied to visits.all of the regulations in question apply to visitors who communicate with prisoners by phone and view them through glass walls.
after a bench trial,the district court found for the plaintiffs.see bazzetta mcginnis,d.it held that the regulations limiting visits infringed on prisoners first amendment right of intimate association and were not reasonably related to a valid penological objective,and that the permanent ban on visitors for two violations of the drug abuse policy infringed on prisoners first amendment right of intimate association,was not reasonably related to a valid penological objective,was cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment,and was imposed in a manner violating prisoners fourteenth amendment due process rights.defendants timely appealed.
prisoners rights and legitimate restrictions 
prison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the constitution.turner safley,d.a prison inmate retains those first amendment rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives of the correctional system.pell procunier,d accord shaw murphy,d incarceration does not divest prisoners of all constitutional protections.
the first amendment guarantees individuals the right to freedom of association,and prisoners retain their first amendment rights to the extent that the rights do not conflict with their status as prisoners and the legitimate demands of the prison system.see pell,at.until now,this court has not addressed whether prisoners retain the right to freedom of association.see long norris,cir in the sixth circuit we have not decided the degree to which prison inmates retain their freedom of association.this question is squarely before us now.for plaintiffs to make out their claim under,they must retain some right to freedom of association,contrary to defendants assertion that there are no such rights.
we hold that prisoners do retain a limited right to freedom of visits with intimate while incarcerated.this follows clearly from pell,where the supreme court held that a prisoner retains a first amendment right unless it is incompatible with incarceration.see at.imprisonment does sharply limit inmates right of association.for instance,prisoners who pose a security risk have no right to remain in the general prison population,see hewitt helms,d holding temporary,nonpunitive transfer to administrative segregation does not violate a prisoner constitutional rights,and prisoners have no constitutional right to contact visits,see bazzetta,at holding prisoners have no constitutional right to contact visits accord thorne jones,cir holding incarcerated individuals maintain no right to physical association.but the right of association is not wholly extinguished by imprisonment.
in support of its claim that inmates retain no right of association,the department cites supreme court cases which hold that prisoners do not have a right to unfettered or contact visits.see,kentucky of corrections thompson,d inmates have no right to unfettered visitation jones north carolina prisoners labor union,d upholding ban on inmate union organizing and group meetings pell,at.upholding ban on visits by journalists.none of these cases,however,say that prisoners have no right to visitation,and several caution that they should not be read to reach such a conclusion.in thompson,the court warned that n othing in the court opinion forecloses a claim that a prison regulation permanently forbidding all visits to some or all prisoners implicates the protections of the due process clause in a way that the precise and individualized restrictions at issue there do not.at.kennedy,concurring.in pell,the court upheld a ban on visits from journalists,but noted that the regulation was permissible in part because prisoners retained an unrestricted opportunity to communicate with the press or any other member of the public through their families,friends,clergy,or attorneys who are permitted to visit them at the prison.at.far from holding that prisoners had no right to visits,the pell court analyzed the new restrictions before upholding them,and stated that it would not defer to prison officials when there was substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials had exaggerated their response to a problem.id.at.close analysis is especially appropriate when,as is the case here,the challenged restrictions interfere with family relationships,including the bond,specially protected by the constitution.see,d choices about marriage,family life,and the upbringing of children are among associational rights this court has ranked as of basic importance to our society,rights sheltered against the state unwarranted usurpation,disregard,or disrespect internal citations omitted moore city of east cleveland,d there is a private realm of family life which the state can not enter citation omitted pierce society of sisters.parents have the liberty to direct the upbringing and education of their children.
the fact that a prison regulation interferes with a constitutional right does not mean it will be struck down.in most situations,when evaluating such a regulation,federal courts will defer to state prison officials reasoned judgment that the regulation is necessary and appropriate.
t he problems of prisons in america are complex and intractable,and they are not readily susceptible of resolution by decree.running a prison is an inordinately difficult undertaking that requires expertise,planning,and the commitment of resources prison administration is,moreover,a task that has been committed to the responsibility of the legislative and executive branches,and separation of powers concerns counsel a policy of judicial restraint.
turner,at.in turner safley,the supreme court laid down a deferential test for evaluating such regulations when a prison regulation impinges on inmates constitutional rights,the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.id.at.in applying this broad standard,we ask a series of questions whether there is a valid connection between the regulation and a penological interest whether prisoners retain an alternative means of exercising the right whether assertion of the right will have a significant effect on guards and other inmates and whether prisoner officials have ready alternatives to the infringing regulation.see id.at.as long as prison authorities present evidence to support their judgment that prison security will be undermined in the absence of a challenged regulation,we will not substitute our judgment for theirs.brown johnson,cir.
b.the department restrictions on visitors 
plaintiffs ask us to strike down the regulations if we find they significantly infringe visitors first amendment rights.the supreme court has made clear,however,that such an approach would unreasonably constrain the corrections system.we therefore analyze the regulations solely as they infringe on prisoners rights.see thornburgh abbott,d heightened scrutiny is not appropriate even in circumstances where a prison regulation affects rights of both prisoners and outsiders.
minor brothers,sisters,nieces,and first challenged regulation forbids visits from a minor child unless he or she be the child,stepchild,or grandchild of the prisoner or an emancipated minor.admin.code plaintiffs challenge this ban to the extent it prevents visits from prisoners siblings,nieces,and nephews.
at trial,the department claimed this restriction was needed to reduce the number of visitors to manageable levels,to stop smuggling,and to protect children from exposure to the prison environment.on appeal,the department does not offer a specific defense of this particular regulation or the other regulations,instead it asks this court to hold there is no right to visitation,or alternatively simply to defer to its judgment that the measures are necessary to ensure prison safety.for the sake of thoroughness,we address claims made by the department at trial.
first,the department claimed the regulation was necessary to reduce the number of visitors,who it said were overwhelming prison facilities.department officials hoped the new regulations would reduce visits by,at which point they apparently believed visits would again be manageable.after the new regulations were passed,the department figures show,visits fell by half.see bazzetta,d at.like district judge edmunds,we view the banning of visits from minor sisters,brothers,nieces,and nephews as an exaggerated response to perceived problems in prison visitation.the record shows that,when the defendants implemented the new regulations,they had no idea how many visitors would be affected by them,or what the effect would be on visitors and inmates.see id.at.in light of these facts,the regulations appear as attempts not to manage visits but to end them.had prison officials merely wished to reduce the number of visiting children,they had at hand less stringent alternatives,including banning visits from unrelated children,which would have reduced visitors without straining close family ties.
the department also claims that the new regulations are required to stop smuggling and to protect child visitors.it offers no data or expert testimony to support these claims,relying instead on prison officials vast experience to justify the restrictions.appellant br.at.as the district court pointed out,visits prevent both smuggling by,and possible assaults on,child visitors.prison officials also stated that they opposed allowing children to visit because visiting would cause the children to become too comfortable with prisons and,we presume,lead them to a life of crime.see bazzetta,d at.this determination is for parents to make,not prison officials.prison officials do not stand in loco parentis for visiting children and the desire to make children frightened of prison,or of relatives in prison,has little to do with maintaining prison safety,the stated objectives of the regulations.
the department also defended the regulations by arguing that letters and phone calls are adequate alternatives to visits for inmates who wish to keep in touch with minor relations.that is not the case.at trial,unchallenged expert testimony showed that to of inmates are functionally illiterate,unable to compose a letter.phone calls are also unsatisfactory.they are monitored by department staff and terminated after a few minutes.see id.at.
while the department offered no clear benefits to be gained from excluding prisoners minor siblings,nieces,and nephews,plaintiffs offered over a dozen witnesses who testified to the myriad of ways the restrictions on minor visitors disrupted family relationships,particularly where prisoners had performed parental duties for their siblings,nieces,or nephews.see id.at.
for the above reasons,we find that the department prohibition on visits from inmates minor siblings,nieces,and nephews is not reasonable related to a legitimate penological goal.the district court decision is affirmed.
when parental rights are second challenged regulation forbids a prisoner natural child from visiting if t he parental rights of the prisoner to the child have been terminated.admin.code a.plaintiffs challenge this regulation only as it has been applied to visits from children whose parents have voluntarily surrendered their parental rights so a child could be placed for adoption they do not,presumably,challenge the ban on visits from children when the parents rights were terminated for abuse or neglect.plaintiffs br.at.
the department offers no specific reason why it decided to ban visits from these children,except its general desire to reduce the number of visitors and protect children.we have already stated why these reasons are not sufficient to ban visits from minor siblings,nieces and nephews.for identical reasons,we hold these reasons are also not sufficient to block visits from an inmate child,when the inmate has voluntarily surrendered parental rights in the child best interests.as the district court noted,in such situations contact between parent and child is an important ongoing need for both parent and child.bazzetta,d at.in one instance,the department policy prevented a and visit from a child recently placed for adoption,threatening the child.at.a ban on such visits is not reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.we affirm the district court decision.
former third challenged regulation bans visits from a prisoner,a former prisoner,a probationer,or a parolee other than a prisoner immediate family.admin.code.this regulation is intended to prevent illegal or disruptive activity occasioned by such visits.bazzetta,d at.like the other challenged regulations,this had significant unintended consequences.in many instances,exclusion of former prisoners creates significant hardship on friends and family,including instances where former prisoners have been completely rehabilitated and have served as social workers or governmental ombudsmen.id.in one instance,a child was not allowed to visit to her imprisoned mother because the only adult available to bring her was the child father,who was not married to the mother and so not immediate family and who had been convicted of a crime years before.
it is a closer call whether this regulation is reasonably related to a legitimate penological objective.the asserted goal,the prevention of disruption by,is a legitimate penological objective.a blanket ban on all noncontact visits by former inmates is,however,an exaggerated response to the problem raised by visits with.it prevents visitors with legitimate reasons for seeing prisoners,such as social workers,from doing so.the departm
