class action plaintiffs filed a consumer protection action against gte california,now known as verizon california,verizon,in october of,alleging verizon engaged in unfair business practices by improperly billing residential customers for rented telephone equipment.in august of,the parties entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which verizon agreed to make cash payments to verizon customers who filed claims in which they averred,under penalty of perjury,they had been unaware of the rental charges.after entry of final judgment,the claims of the eligible verizon customers were administered and settlement checks were mailed to the claimants.the present dispute involves in settlement checks that either were not cashed or were returned by the post office as undeliverable.
over two years after judgment was entered,the plaintiffs sought to amend the judgment to distribute these funds pursuant to code of civil procedure section,which requires unpaid residuals in class action litigation be paid to nonprofit organizations or foundations to support projects that will benefit the class or similarly situated persons code civ,subs.a,b.the trial court found,inter alia,section did not apply to the settlement the plaintiffs and verizon had negotiated in this case.the plaintiffs appealed the trial court ruling.
in resolving the issue presented,we look to the words of section,subdivision b,which define unpaid residue as the difference between the total amount that will be payable to all class members,if all class members are paid the amount to which they are entitled pursuant to the judgment and the total amount that was actually paid to the class members,subd.b.
we conclude that,notwithstanding the nature of the settlement,the definition of unpaid residue accurately describes the unclaimed funds at issue in this case.we also reject verizon assertion the legislative history of section suggests it should be applied only in fluid recovery cases in which a common fund is created.
accordingly,we reverse the trial court ruling and remand for further proceedings.
facts and procedural background 
the plaintiffs class action lawsuit.
following deregulation of the telephone companies in,the california public utilities commission cpuc permitted service providers to give customers the option of purchasing telephone equipment from third parties or to continue renting telephones from the service provider if the rental charge was separately identified on the telephone bill.the cpuc also required service providers to include in every customer bill an insert or mailer advising the customer of the option of purchasing telephone equipment from a third party.
in october of,the plaintiffs filed a class action complaint alleging verizon billed residential customers for obsolete or telephones and therefore collected undeserved fees without providing or offering meaningful service.the complaint further alleged verizon failed to identify the nature of the equipment rental charges and instead denot ed the charges simply as equipment rental the complaint included causes of action under the unfair competition law for a variety of unfair business practices and fraud.the complaint also alleged causes of action based on consumer protection theories,negligent misrepresentation,unjust enrichment and violations of the false advertising law.
early in the proceedings,verizon demurred to the complaint on the ground the cpuc had exclusive jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claims or,alternatively,the primary jurisdiction doctrine applied the trial court agreed.however,in cundiff gte california th,d,this court reversed the trial court finding and concluded the trial court had jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs claims.in so doing,we noted the basis of the plaintiffs lawsuit was the allegedly intentional or negligent misrepresentation of the true nature of equipment rental charges and concluded,this is not a topic about which the commission would have more expertise than the trial court,or even as much expertise.actions based on alleged deceit are not known to be within the technical expertise of the cpuc.id.at,d.
the settlement agreement.
on remand,the plaintiffs and verizon entered into a comprehensive settlement agreement which identified three main subclasses of the member class legacy customers who rented a telephone throughout the class period changing customers who changed rental service at some point within the class period and,customers of verizon affiliates.legacy customers were eligible for reimbursement of approximately percent of the rental fees paid between march and january.changing customers were eligible to receive percent of the rental fees paid between march and the date the customer changed service.customers of verizon affiliates were to receive transferable calling cards with a value of.
the settlement agreement required legacy and changing customers to file a claim in which they declared,under penalty of perjury,they were unaware of the rental charge until they changed their rental service or the rental charge ceased.legacy and changing customers who did not submit a claim form received a verizon coupon.verizon also agreed to pay a incentive award to each named plaintiff and to donate a total of million to designated charitable organizations.
pursuant to the settlement agreement,verizon was to compile a list of potential class members and publish notice of the class settlement.following completion of the notice process,the trial court would conduct a final approval hearing and,upon approving the settlement,enter judgment and dismiss the action with prejudice.once judgment had been entered,verizon would mail a claim form to each legacy and changing customer.the class members had days to submit a completed claim form.the settlement administrator was to process the forms,compute the amount owed to each customer and notify the parties of the total amount to be distributed.at that point verizon was to deliver sufficient funds to pay the claims.
the settlement agreement contemplated that plaintiffs counsel would make a request for attorney fees in connection with the final approval of the settlement agreement.verizon reserved the right to oppose the request.
motion for attorney fees final approval of settlement.
in conjunction with the request for final approval of the settlement agreement,plaintiffs counsel requested attorney fees computed as a percentage of the common fund created by the settlement.see serrano priest cal d,serrano iii.plaintiffs counsel asserted the total projected value of the settlement if all eligible customers filed a claim would be.plaintiffs counsel sought million in fees,which amounted to nine percent of the potential value of the settlement.
alternatively,plaintiffs counsel sought attorney fees under the lodestar method.serrano iii,supra,cal d at.plaintiffs counsel argued the lodestar amount of should be multiplied by a factor of four.plaintiffs counsel also noted that,even when the percentage of the common fund method is inappropriate for computation of attorney fees,it nonetheless may be used as a of a lodestar based multiplier.lealao beneficial california,th,d.
verizon opposed the attorney fees request.verizon argued the amount of the plaintiffs aggregate recovery was presently unknown.thus,the common fund doctrine,which assumed a percent claims rate,was inappropriate in this case.
verizon also argued it had agreed to a settlement in which the amount to be paid is not a liquidated amount.lealao beneficial california,supra,th at,d of lodestar method proper only when the fund can be monetized with a reasonable degree of certainty serrano iii,cal d at,common fund principles inapplicable where equal protection challenge to school funding system did not result in creation of an identifiable fund dunk ford motor th,d common fund inapplicable in a coupon only settlement.
the trial court found the percentage of the common fund method of computing attorney fees did not apply because the settlement did not create a true fund rather,it is a settlement.thus,there was no way of knowing what the ultimate value of the settlement will be.using the lodestar method,the trial court awarded plaintiffs counsel attorney fees in the amount of.
administration of the claims and disclosure of unclaimed funds.
after entry of final judgment in december of,the settlement administrator processed the claim forms and computed the amount due to the various subclasses of plaintiffs.verizon then deposited with the settlement administrator the amount required to fund the claims and the settlement administrator mailed checks to the claimants as required by the settlement agreement.
in september of,the settlement administrator advised the parties that settlement checks with a value of that had been mailed to legacy and changing customers remained uncashed.also,letters containing in settlement checks had been returned to the settlement administrator.the uncashed and returned checks were no longer valid,having expired six months after issuance.the settlement administrator indicated it held in funds earmarked to pay the expired checks.
the trial court ruling on the plaintiffs motion to amend the judgment under section.
when the parties could not agree on the disposition of the unclaimed funds,the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the judgment pursuant to section to direct the settlement administrator to pay the unclaimed funds on a pro rata basis to the charities designated in the settlement agreement.
the trial court concluded section did not apply to the claims made settlement the parties had negotiated because no common fund had been created.the trial court further found it lacked any legal basis on which to modify the judgment under section,subdivision b,because more than two years had passed since entry of judgment thus,the judgment could not be modified unless extrinsic fraud or mistake could be shown.in re marriage of umphrey d.here,the parties simply failed to provide for the possibility of unclaimed funds in the settlement agreement.
as a consequence of this ruling,the unclaimed funds reverted to verizon.
contentions 
the plaintiffs contend the unclaimed funds constitute unpaid residue within the meaning of section,subdivision b,and the trial court was required to direct these funds to nonprofit organizations or foundations to support projects that will benefit the class or similarly situated persons.
discussion 
the plain language of section indicates application.section.
section,subdivision a states t he intent of the legislature in enacting this section is to ensure that the unpaid residuals in class action litigation are distributed,to the extent possible,in a manner designed either to further the purposes of the underlying causes of action,or to promote justice for all californians 
section,subdivision b states p rior to the entry of any judgment in a class action established pursuant to section,the court shall determine the total amount that will be payable to all class members,if all class members are paid the amount to which they are entitled pursuant to the judgment.the court shall also set a date when the parties shall report to the court the total amount that was actually paid to the class members.after the report is received,the court shall amend the judgment to direct the defendant to pay the sum of the unpaid residue to nonprofit organizations or foundations to support projects that will benefit the class or similarly situated persons,or that promote the law consistent with the objectives and purposes of the underlying cause of action,to child advocacy programs,or to nonprofit organizations providing civil legal services to the indigent 
principles of statutory construction.
pursuant to established principles,our first task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in determining such intent,a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves,giving to the language its usual,ordinary import and according significance,if possible,to every word,phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose citations.both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent.citations,fair employment housing com.cal d,in re vitamin cases th,d.
we therefore commence our analysis with the words of the statute.
section definition of unpaid residue applies to the uncashed and returned settlement checks.
as noted above,section defines unpaid residue as the difference between the total amount that will be payable to all class members and the total amount that was actually paid to the class members,subd.b.
applying these words to this case,the aggregate amount owed to verizon customers who filed claim forms declaring they were unaware of the rental billing practice clearly falls within the first part of the definition,namely,the total amount payable to all class members,subd.b.this total amount payable to all class members was established when the settlement administrator determined the amount necessary to satisfy the filed claims.
the difference between the total amount payable to all class members and the total amount that was actually paid to the class members,describes the unclaimed funds at issue in this case.thus,the plain meaning of the words of the statute indicates the unclaimed funds constitute unpaid residue within the meaning of section,subdivision b.indeed,we can not characterize the unclaimed funds in any manner other than residue within the meaning of section.
d.the legislative history of section supports this view.
a statement of the legislative intent in enacting section is found in subdivision a.it states the legislature intended to ensure that the unpaid residuals in class action litigation are distributed,to the extent possible,in a manner designed either to further the purposes of the underlying causes of action,or to promote justice for all californians,subd.a.
the origin of this statement of legislative intent was discussed in two cases that construed section in the context of objections to proposed settlements,in re microsoft cases th,d microsoft and in re vitamin cases,supra,th,d.microsoft referred to the senate floor analysis prepared by the senate rules committee for introduction of the bill that led to the initial enactment of the statute that has since been renumbered as section.rules,off.of floor analyses,on bill reg.sess.as introduced.floor analysis.microsoft,supra,at,d.microsoft noted the senate floor analysis explained that there was often an unclaimed balance of the total class recovery residue either because the claimants can not be located or choose not to collect the award ibid.
microsoft further observed one significant concern expressed in the same senate floor analysis was that a defendant might argue that any unclaimed class action funds must be returned citation.the analysis explained that unless there is a court approved settlement which provides for reversion of remaining funds to the defendant the general rule is that defendants do not have a right to recover the funds once they have deposited the funds into an escrow account.citation.with regard to this concern,the analysis concluded that r ather than allowing the unclaimed residue to revert to the defendant,this bill would require the court to distribute the residual in a manner consistent with the action or to remit the funds to the fund named in the legislation.citation.microsoft,supra,th at,d.
the senate floor analysis appears to be aimed directly at the unclaimed funds in issue here,which verizon deposited into an escrow account for payment to eligible claimants who now can not be located or have chosen not to cash their checks.this is virtually identical to the situation envisioned by the senate floor analysis.further,the trial court ruling permitted the unclaimed funds to revert to verizon and the quoted material reveals the legislators understood reversion would occur only where the parties agreed that unclaimed funds would revert to the defendant.
thus,microsoft approved a settlement provision whereby of any coupons that were issued but never used would revert to the defendant as against an objection that section required distribution of unclaimed residue only as specified in subdivision b.microsoft found such a provision permissible as long as it did not render the settlement unfair,inadequate or unreasonable.microsoft,supra,th at,d see also,owners for fair franchising southland th,d dunk ford motor supra,th at,d.here,the settlement agreement did not address the possibility of unclaimed funds.
we are aware that reversion to a defendant may be appropriate where deterrence is not a factor see conte newberg,newberg on class actions ed,and here verizon steadfastly denied wrongdoing.thus,reasonable minds could conclude reversion might otherwise be an appropriate result in this case.however,in the absence of a reversion provision in the settlement agreement,section has eliminated the prospect of reversion of unpaid residue to a defendant in that it requires payment of such residue to nonprofit organizations.
we therefore conclude both the plain meaning of the words of the statute and its legislative history indicate the unclaimed funds at issue in this case constitute unpaid residue within the meaning of section,subdivision b.we next address verizon assertion section applies only in fluid recovery cases.
section is not limited to fluid recovery cases.
fluid recovery in general.
the term fluid recovery refers to the application of the equitable doctrine of cy près in the context of a modern class action.granberry islay investments cal th,fn,d,citing state of california levi strauss cal d,levi strauss.cy près derives from the norman french cy près comme possible,literally,as near as possible.microsoft,supra,th at,fn,d.where compliance with the literal terms of a charitable trust became impossible,the funds would be put to the next best use,in accord with the dominant charitable purposes of the donor.citation.the theory underlying fluid class recovery is that since each class member can not be compensated exactly for the damage he or she suffered,the best alternative is to pay damages in a way that benefits as many of the class members as possible and in the approximate proportion that each member has been damaged,even though,most probably,some injured class members will receive no compensation and some people not in the class will benefit from the distribution citation.in re vitamin cases,supra,th at,d.
with respect to the procedure for distribution of damages in fluid recovery cases,levi strauss stated,the implementation of fluid recovery involves three steps.citation.first,the defendant total damage liability is paid over to a class fund.second,individual class members are afforded an opportunity to collect their individual shares by proving their particular damages,usually according to a lowered standard of proof.third,any residue remaining after individual claims have been paid is distributed by one of several practical procedures that have been developed by the courts.levi strauss,supra,cal d at.
cy près or fluid recovery has been applied to distribute the total amount of damages assessed against a defendant where each individual recovery may be too small to make traditional methods of proof and distribution worthwhile.levi strauss,supra,cal d at.
cy près or fluid recovery also may be used to distribute a residue that remains after claims are paid to those class members who have sufficient interest in obtaining recovery and can produce the documentation necessary to file individual claims.kraus trinity management services,cal th,d,kraus.levi strauss recognized several methods of fluid recovery,including a rollback of consumer prices,the creation of a consumer trust fund,providing additional pro rata payments to class members who already have filed claims and escheat to the government.see levi strauss,supra,cal d at.levi strauss remanded the case to permit the trial court to select the most appropriate method in that case.
verizon argument.
verizon argues the procedure established by subdivision b of section for entry of judgment in a class action so closely resembles levi strauss statement of the procedure for distribution of damages in fluid recovery cases that the legislature must have intended section to apply only where a common fund is established for the benefit of a class and against which individual class members may make claims according to verizon,section,subdivision b,addresses a problem that arises exclusively in common fund or fluid recovery cases.
verizon contends the instant settlement agreement does not provide for a common fund or fluid recovery.rather,the parties agreed to a procedure.the money at issue,verizon asserts,is not the residue of funds allocated to a class,but constitutes lapsed or unclaimed settlement payments.verizon finds support for its argument in the observation of kraus that the legislature authorized employment of a fluid recovery remedy in class actions by the enactment of section.kraus,supra,cal th at,d.verizon concludes the unclaimed funds must revert to verizon because there is no legal basis to amend the judgment to allow any other distribution.
resolution.
verizon comparison of the procedure set forth in levi strauss with the procedure established by subdivision b of section does not reveal a legislative intent to limit application of that provision to fluid recovery cases or cases in which the defendant has paid into a common fund for the benefit of a class.indeed,the legislative history suggests the enactors intended a broad application.
here,no fund was established at the time final judgment was entered.however,after the claims were administered and verizon deposited the money necessary to pay the claims,a fund was created.the unclaimed funds at issue are the unpaid residue of that fund.
verizon assertion the plaintiffs motion to amend the judgment is time barred.
verizon contends the plaintiffs motion to amend the judgment was filed long after the deadline of section,subdivision b had expired.thus,the trial court lacked jurisdiction to amend the judgment.see sporn home depot usa,th,d.
this argument fails because the plaintiffs motion to amend the judgment did not rely on section,subdivision b,which addresses general relief from default in general.rather,the plaintiffs expressly relied on section,which does not include any time limit within which relief must be sought.the specific directive to amend the judgment in appropriate class action cases must be seen as taking precedence over the general relief provisions of section,subdivision b.miller superior court cal th,d,a specific provision relating to a particular subject will govern in respect to that subject,as against a general provision,although the latter,standing alone,would be broad enough to include the subject to which the more particular provision relates.citations.
