we must decide whether the district court abused its discretion in denying plaintiff denise edwards motion for class certification,in her action against defendants first american corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary first american title insurance company collectively,first american.edwards,seeking to represent a class of home buyers,alleged that first american engaged in a national scheme of paying the title agencies things of value in exchange for the title agencies agreement to refer future title insurance business to first american,in violation of the real estate settlement procedures act respa.we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand.
edwards bought a home in cleveland,ohio.edwards used tower city title agency,llc tower city as her settlement agent,and by referral of tower city,she used first american as her title insurer.prior to edwards home purchase,first american and tower city entered into a transaction first american acquired a ownership interest in tower city for million and,in the same transaction,tower city agreed to refer future title insurance business to first american.first american also entered into similar transactions with various other title agencies.in each of these transactions,first american paid the title agency a lump sum of money in exchange for a minority ownership interest in the title agency and the title agency agreement to refer future title insurance business to first american.
edwards filed a putative class action against first american,alleging that the transactions between first american and the captive title agencies violated respa provision.edwards originally moved to certify a class of home buyers referred to first american by any of the title agencies that first american partially owned.the district court declined to certify that class but ordered discovery to determine whether it should certify the tower city class,consisting of all home buyers who were referred to first american by tower city.
after completing discovery,edwards moved to certify the tower city class.the district court denied certification.we reversed and held that there is a single,overwhelming common question of fact whether the arrangement between tower city and first american violated respa.edwards v.the first am,app x,cir edwards i.we ordered nationwide discovery on remand and gave edwards an opportunity to renew her motion to certify a nationwide class.id.after further discovery,edwards moved to certify a nationwide class consisting of all home buyers who entered into a mortgage transaction using one of title agencies that sold a minority ownership interest to first american and,in the same transaction,agreed to refer future title insurance business to first american.
the district court again denied certification,now on the basis that common issues did not predominate over individual issues for the nationwide class.first,the district court concluded that individual inquiries were required to determine whether first american overpaid for its ownership interests in each title agency.second,the district court found that common issues did not predominate over individual issues of reliance and causation for referrals.third,the district court concluded that inquiries as a result of the different types of title agencies will not require common proof related to first american liability.edwards appeals the district court order denying class certification.
we review the district court determination of class certification for abuse of discretion and consider whether the district court correctly selected and applied rule criteria.parra bashas,cir.the underlying legal questions,however,are reviewed de novo,and any error of law on which a certification order rests is deemed a per se abuse of discretion.ret.plans trust funds amgen,cir.
federal rule of civil procedure allows a representative to litigate on behalf of a class of individuals who are too numerous to join the litigation.the party seeking class certification bears the burden of establishing that the proposed class meets the requirements of rule.see wal mart stores,dukes,zinser accufix research,cir,amended by cir.to be certified,a proposed class must satisfy all requirements in rule a and at least one of the requirements in rule b.rule a requires that plaintiffs demonstrate numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation.a.rule b lists three alternative requirements for class certification,and where,as here,plaintiffs seek class certification under subsection b,they must demonstrate the superiority of maintaining a class action and show that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.b see also zinser,at.
a court,when asked to certify a class,is merely to decide a suitable method of adjudicating the case and should not turn class certification into a on the merits.ellis costco wholesale,cir.but rule a is not a pleading standard,so to the extent necessary,our determination of commonality will inevitably touch upon the merits of plaintiffs underlying respa claims.see,amgen.ret.plans trust funds,wal mart stores.at stockwell city cty.of,cir.
in,congress passed respa to protect consumers from unnecessarily high settlement charges caused by certain abusive practices.a.one of the provisions is respa,which furthers congress goal of eliminat ing kickbacks or referral fees that tend to increase unnecessarily the costs of certain settlement services.id.b see also freeman quicken loans.paying kickbacks or referral fees to induce referrals of title insurance underwriting is part of the serious problem congress sought to remedy in respa.see,reprinted in.
the national title insurance industry is highly concentrated,with most states dominated by two or three large title insurance companies.see gov t accountability office,title insurance actions needed to improve oversight of the title industry and better protect consumers.a factor that raises questions about the existence of price competition is that title agents market to those from whom they get consumer referrals,and not to consumers themselves,creating potential conflicts of interest where the referrals could be made in the best interest of the referrer and not the consumer.id.kickbacks paid by the title insurance companies to those making referrals lead to higher costs of real estate settlement services,which are passed on to consumers without any corresponding benefits.
section a of respa aims to eliminate these unlawful kickbacks.it prohibits any exchange of a thing of value pursuant to real estate referrals 
no person shall give and no person shall accept any fee,kickback,or thing of value pursuant to any agreement or understanding,oral or otherwise,that business incident to or a part of a real estate settlement service involving a federally related mortgage loan shall be referred to any person.
a.respa defines a thing of value broadly to include any payment,advance,funds,loan,service,or other consideration.id.courts commonly find a violation of a when a payment or thing of value was exchanged,pursuant to an agreement to refer settlement business,and there was an actual referral.see galiano fid.title ins,cir see also egerer woodland realty,cir culpepper irwin mortg,cir.notwithstanding the general prohibition of exchanging any thing of value for a referral,a statutory safe harbor exempts a payment from respa violation if the payment despite being made simultaneously with a referral was for goods or facilities actually furnished or for services actually performed.see id.c.
congress gave the department of housing and urban development hud authority to regulate under respa,and hud promulgated the corresponding regulations known as regulation see,stat.the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act transferred the regulatory authority of respa from hud to the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb,and cfpb later republished regulation x without material changes.see,c.
under regulation x,a referral includes any oral or written action directed to a person which has the effect of affirmatively influencing the selection by any person of a provider of a settlement service for which the home buyer will pay a charge and an exchange of a thing of value is used as synonymous with a payment and does not require a transfer of money d,f.regulation x further explains the safe harbor in c.see id.g if the payment of a thing of value bears no reasonable relationship to the market value of the goods or services provided,then the excess is not for services or goods actually performed or provided.
we first address whether individual inquiries on each of the transactions are required due to the safe harbor in c and g.the district court held that the statute and the regulation require edwards to prove that first american overpaid for its ownership interests in each of the title agencies,and these individual inquiries render class action improper.
cfpb submitted an amicus brief interpreting respa and its own regulation cfpb contends that c does not apply to the transactions here because first american payment for ownership interests is not a payment for goods,facilities,or services.cfpb urges us to give deference to its interpretation.
as a threshold matter,we must consider the proper level of deference to be given to the agency interpretation.our analytical framework depends on whether the agency is interpreting the statute or the regulation.an agency interpretation of an ambiguous statute is entitled to chevron deference when the interpretation is promulgated in the exercise of the agency formal authority.see chevron,res.def.council.an agency interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation is generally entitled to auer deference.see auer robbins,holding that an agency interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation is controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation internal citation omitted.
here,cfpb is interpreting the statute,not the regulation.an agency interpretation of the statute when presented in an amicus brief is not promulgated in the exercise of its formal authority,so no chevron deference is warranted.see united states mead,price stevedoring servs.of,cir en banc.even if the terms goods,services,and facilities also appear in the regulation,see g iv,cfpb is in fact interpreting congress words in the statute,so we give no deference to cfpb interpretation.chase bank usa,mccoy.in addition,because the statutory terms at issue are not ambiguous,no deference is merited.see chevron,at united states able time,cir.
we nevertheless agree with cfpb interpretation,which is consistent with the language of the statute.neither respa nor regulation x defines goods,facilities,or services,see,so we begin with the statutory text and end there as well if the text is unambiguous.satterfield simon schuster,cir.here,the meanings of goods,facilities,and services are plain.goods are tangible movable personal property having intrinsic value excluding money a facility is something as a hospital,machinery,plumbing that is built,constructed,installed,or established to perform some particular function or to serve or facilitate some particular end and service is the performance of work commanded or paid for by another.see webster third new international dictionary see also american heritage dictionary defining goods as product that is bought and sold or portable personal property facility as a building,room,array of equipment,or a number of such things,designed to serve a particular function and service as w ork that is done for others as an occupation or business or a n act or a variety of work done for others,especially for pay.
the ownership interests purchased by first american are equity shares,not goods,services,or facilities.first american contends that two of the transactions at issue also contained acquisitions of facilities,such as a title and buildings.this misses the point.the purchase of ownership interests which are not goods,services,or facilities disqualified first american transactions from the exemption under c,regardless of whether the acquisitions may have also included facilities.we conclude that c can not apply to first american transactions as a matter of law,so the district court erred in relying on c to determine the propriety of class certification.
we next address whether individual inquiries are required because of a.the district court interpreted the thing of value in a,as applied to the transactions at issue,to be the amount that first american overpaid for its ownership interests in each of the captive title agencies.the district court relied on decisions of our circuit,as well as those of other circuits,to conclude that the determination of kickback amount requires individual comparisons between the payment and the services provided.see,lane residential funding,cir bjustrom trust one mortg,cir schuetz banc one mortg,cir see also howland first am.title ins,cir glover standard fed.bank,cir.as a result,it concluded that an individual inquiry on each transaction will be required to determine whether first american purchase prices of the ownership interests exceeded their fair market value.
the cases relied on by the district court are inapplicable here,because they interpreted the statutory exemption under c,which we have concluded does not apply to first american transactions.see lane,at schuetz.also,these cases adopted and applied hud test interpreting c first,there must be actual performance of compensable services and second,the total compensation must be reasonably related to the goods or services provided.see,schuetz,at explaining that the hud test reflects the statutory safe harbor in c.but the hud test is also inapplicable here,because no services were provided by the title agencies to first american.we hold that the district court abused its discretion in denying class certification based on an erroneous interpretation of a.ret.plans,at,and that cases alleging illegal kickbacks in violation of a are not necessarily unfit for class adjudication.
but the question remains are there individual issues here that could predominate over common issues such that class action certification is inappropriate see.b.we hold that the answer to this question is no.respa does not as the district court held require edwards to pinpoint how much money first american paid for the referral agreement as opposed to the equity interest.rather,she can state a claim under respa a by alleging that first american paid a lump sum of money to each captive title agency the thing of value,and in exchange for that money each title agency agreed to refer first american future insurance business agreement.
absent c,nothing in the statute requires edwards to prove first american gave money to the title agencies only in consideration for the referral agreement.the statute merely prohibits the exchange of a thing of value for a referral agreement.a.it and the regulation define thing of value broadly to include a wide variety of considerations,and an exchange of a thing of value need not involve a transfer of money solely as a kickback.see d.here,edwards alleges that first american paid the title agency a lump sum of money in return,first american obtained two items the title agency equity interest and the title agency agreement to refer future title insurance business.whether this transaction violates respa a does not require inquiry into individual issues of payment.
this conclusion comports with our understanding of contract law.there is a presumption that when parties enter into a contract,each and every term and condition is in consideration of all the others,unless otherwise stated.am.sav.bank,united states,quoting stone forest,united states.although the contract terms were silent on how much of first american monetary consideration was attributed to the referrals,the law does not require every term of the contract to have a separately stated consideration.sarnoff am.home products,cir,superseded on other grounds by gardynski leschuck ford motor,cir.the undivided monetary consideration paid by first american must be treated in law as consideration for both the equity interests and referrals.see restatement second of contracts,cmt.a am.law inst a single performance or return
