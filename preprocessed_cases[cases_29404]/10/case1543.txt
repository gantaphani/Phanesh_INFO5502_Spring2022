ii.children hospital moves for summary adjudication and judgment.
a.the motion for summary judgment.
before class certification was decided,the hospital moved for summary judgment on the ground that the statutes of limitations applicable to falk were not tolled by palazzolo or mays.the hospital argued that american pipe tolling did not apply to falk claims because the judgment in palazzolo was the equivalent of an adverse ruling on the substantive merits of the class american pipe tolling applies only to individual actions and not to successive class actions and palazzolo did not place the hospital on notice of falk dual rate wage claims and highly specific meal and rest period claims.
falk responded that palazzolo tolled her claims the hospital was judicially estopped from arguing that falk was unrelated to mays and palazzolo and the statutes of limitations should be equitably tolled.
it was undisputed that the trial and appellate courts in palazzolo never addressed class certification.
b.the trial court ruling.
the trial court granted summary judgment against falk on july.judgment was entered on july.the court found american pipe tolling inapplicable because judgment in palazzolo was on the ground the individual plaintiff had no viable causes of action.the court also rejected the notion that american pipe permits piggybacking of successive class actions.even if american pipe applied,the court found that palazzolo did not put the hospital on notice of the esoteric dual rate claim raised by falk 
discussion 
standard of review.
we independently review the trial court order granting summary judgment and determine if the undisputed facts establish that children hospital is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its statute of limitations defense.code civ,subd.c aguilar atlantic richfield cal th.
ii.american pipe tolling.
falk employment ended on august.assuming that four years is the outermost limitations period applicable to her claims her complaint had to be filed by august,to state a claim.her complaint was not filed until december.falk,however,contends that her complaint was timely because any limitations period was tolled from may,the day palazzolo was filed to february,the day we issued the remittitur in palazzolo and from january,the day mays was filed under american pipe,supra.
american pipe tolling commences when the initial class action is filed.
american pipe applied tolling under the following circumstances.utah filed a putative class action.class certification was denied,under federal rules of civil procedure,rule rule,because the class was so numerous that joinder of all members was impracticable.american pipe,supra,at.class members then filed motions to intervene,but their motions were denied on statute of limitations grounds.id.at.american pipe concluded that utah filing of the putative class action tolled the statute of limitations for the intervenors where class action status has been denied solely because of failure to demonstrate that the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,the commencement of the original class suit tolls the running of the statute for all purported members of the class who make timely motions to intervene after the court has found the suit inappropriate for class action status.id.at.
crown,cork seal parker crown,cork,extended american pipe.the plaintiffs filed a class action discrimination case.their motion for class certification was denied because the named plaintiffs claims were atypical of those of the class,they were not adequate representatives,and the class was not so numerous as to make joinder impracticable.crown,cork,at.after denial of class certification,parker filed an individual action alleging similar claims as in the class action.crown,cork held that the filing of a class action tolls the statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class,citation not just as to intervenors.id.at.once the statute of limitations has been tolled,it remains tolled for all members of the putative class until class certification is denied.at that point,class members may choose to file their own suits or to intervene as plaintiffs in the pending action.id.at.
our california supreme court summarized the tolling rule derived from american pipe and crown,cork under limited circumstances,if class certification is denied,the statute of limitations is tolled from the time of commencement of the suit to the time of denial of certification for all purported members of the class who either make timely motions to intervene in the surviving individual action citation,or who timely file their individual actions citation.jolly eli lilly cal d,jolly.
based on american pipe and its progeny,falk contends that the filing of palazzolo,as well as mays,tolled any limitations periods for her subsequent class action.sawyer atlas heating sheet metal works,cir,sawyer,is instructive.a class action was filed.before the district court had decided whether to certify the class,the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the complaint,leaving the other putative class members in the lurch.id.at.sawyer tried to intervene in the action to keep it alive,but the district court denied intervention.sawyer therefore filed his own class action.in applying american pipe tolling to sawyer action,the court rejected the defendant argument the initial action did not count because it was never a class action.sawyer,at.that could not be determinative,because american pipe and crown,cork also were never class actions.ibid.
rather,the rationale of american pipe does not permit a distinction among situations in which the putative class representative gives up before,or after,the judge decides whether the case may proceed on behalf of a class.tolling lasts from the day a class claim is asserted until the day the suit is conclusively not a class action which may be because the judge rules adversely to the plaintiff,or because the plaintiff reads the handwriting on the wall and decides not to throw good money after bad.sawyer,supra,at see also american pipe,supra,at the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class,italics added.american pipe goal of enabling members of a putative class to rely on a pending action to protect their interests can be achieved only if the way in which the first suit ends denial of class certification by the judge,abandonment by the plaintiff,or any other fashion is irrelevant.sawyer,at.
denial of certification,however,is important to the extent denial is based on a reason that would be equally applicable to any later suit,for example,that the supposed victims are too few to justify class litigation,that a common question does not predominate,or that issues would make class treatment unmanageable,in which circumstances tolling would not apply.sawyer,supra,at see generally yang odom cir,american pipe tolling applies to class members who file a class action following the denial of class certification due to rule deficiencies of the class representative.american pipe tolling would not apply to sequential class actions where the earlier denial of certification was based on a rule defect in the class itself mckowan lowe,ltd jasmine,cir,class claims of intervening class members are tolled if class certification is denied for reasons unrelated to the appropriateness of the substantive claims for certification perkin san diego gas electric th,perkin class certification was not denied because of subtle factors but because of insufficient commonality and the class action was not superior to individual litigation tolling therefore was inappropriate.
what happened here is similar to sawyer.palazzolo was filed as a class action.class certification was never denied or granted indeed,the issue was never addressed in the trial court.instead,the hospital chose to move for summary judgment on palazzolo individual claims,before the certification issue was decided that motion for summary judgment was granted because palazzolo,not the class,failed to state viable causes of action.the merits of palazzolo individual claims were therefore addressed and adjudicated but not the merits of the class claims.although it appears that palazzolo tried to preserve the class claims,he failed like the putative class members left in a lurch when the lead plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the class action in sawyer,the putative class members in palazzolo were,through no fault of their own,left without an action to pursue their claims.where certification was not denied based on a reason that would be applicable to a subsequent action or,as here,not addressed at all,american pipe tolling should apply.
palazzolo gave children hospital sufficient notice of claims in falk.
still,tolling will not apply unless the two policy considerations underlying american pipe are met.those considerations are,first,protection of efficiency and economy in litigation as promoted by the class action device,and,second,effectuation of the purpose of the statute of limitations to protect a defendant from unfair claims.jolly,supra,cal d at.crucial to this second consideration is that the initial class action provide the defendant with sufficient notice of the substantive claims brought against it as well as the number and generic identities of the potential plaintiffs.id.at,quoting american pipe,supra,at.
justice blackmun thus cautioned that american pipe must not be regarded as encouragement to lawyers in a case of this kind to frame their pleadings as a class action,intentionally,to attract and save members of the purported cla
