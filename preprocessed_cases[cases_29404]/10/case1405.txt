the appellants,john and patricia culpepper and beatrice hiers,brought the present class action against appellee irwin mortgage corporation irwin,a mortgage lender,pursuant to the real estate settlement procedures act respa,et.the appellants alleged that irwin payment of yield spread premiums to mortgage exchange for delivering interest rates above the par rate violated section of respa,a.after a lengthy procedural history,which is detailed herein,the appellees ultimately filed motions for summary judgment and to decertify the class,both of which the district court granted.
on appeal,the appellants argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of irwin for two reasons first,because the doctrine obligates us to adhere to our prior rulings in this case,despite an of policy by the department of housing and urban development hud,the administrative agency charged with enforcing respa and,second,because,even applying hud test for liability,irwin yield spread premium payments were illegal under respa.the appellants further argue that the district court erred in decertifying the class.
upon review,we conclude that two exceptions to the doctrine apply and that the district court acted properly in applying hud test for liability to the facts of appellants case and in concluding that irwin was entitled to summary judgment.we also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in decertifying the class,due to its determination that individual issues of fact predominate in this type of action.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
this is the fourth time we have had cause to review the appellants respa action against irwin.in culpepper inland mortgage corporation,cir culpepper i,we reversed a grant of summary judgment in favor of irwin,vacated the district court denial of class certification,and remanded for further proceedings.in culpepper inland mortgage corporation,cir culpepper ii,we denied irwin petition for a rehearing of culpepper i,and clarified our decision in that case.in culpepper irwin mortgage corporation,cir culpepper iii we clarified the standard for liability under respa we also affirmed the district court class certification.the procedural backdrop leading to the present appeal is,as our sister circuit has put it,cumbersome but important.schuetz banc one mortgage,cir.
our review of this backdrop is as follows.first,we briefly discuss the facts and allegations of the appellants action against irwin.second,we review our holdings in culpepper i and culpepper ii,as well as the statement of policy issued by hud in the wake of those decisions.third,we discuss our opinion in culpepper iii and the statement of policy that hud issued in direct response in explicit criticism iii.we then discuss the effect of the hud statement of policy on our respa case law.finally,we discuss the district court proceedings that led to the present appeal.
a.the borrowers action against irwin 
in,the appellants john and patricia culpepper and beatrice hiers hereinafter,collectively,the borrowers brought the instant action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated,against irwin a mortgage lender,alleging that irwin had acted illegally in paying yield spread premiums to their mortgage brokers.a yield spread premium ysp is a payment made by a mortgage lender to a mortgage broker in exchange for that broker delivering a mortgage that is above the par rate being offered by the lender.heimmermann first union mortgage,cir.the par rate refers to the rate at which the lender will fund of a loan with no premiums or discounts to the broker.schuetz,at.when a mortgage broker brought irwin a loan at below the par rate,the broker was required to pay discount points for the loan.see culpepper i,at.conversely,when a mortgage broker brought irwin a loan at a rate above the par rate,irwin agreed to pay a ysp to the mortgage broker.id.generally speaking,the ysp was calculated as a percentage of the total amount of the loan the exact amount was determined by the extent to which the actual interest rate exceed ed the par rate.heimmermann,at.
the particular facts these consolidated cases are not in dispute.both of the borrowers obtained their federally insured home mortgage loans through third party mortgage brokers,and irwin,as the lender,was the source of the funds in each transaction.the culpeppers obtained their loan with irwin through premiere mortgage company premiere,a mortgage broker.the interest rate that they agreed to in connection with their mortgage was,despite the fact that the par is,the rate at which irwin was willing to make the same actually.because the loan premiere assigned to irwin was above par,irwin paid premiere a ysp.at the closing of the transaction,the culpeppers directly paid premiere a loan origination fee of in addition to this amount,irwin paid to premiere a ysp of,approximately of the loan amount.
appellant hiers obtained her loan with irwin through homebuyers mortgage incorporated hmi,another third party mortgage broker.hiers agreed to an interest rate of in connection with her loan,despite the fact that the par rate for an adjustable rate loan was.at the closing,hiers paid hmi an origination fee of and a loan discount of.in addition to these fees,irwin paid hmi a ysp of,approximately of the total loan amount.
although the ysps were disclosed to the borrowers at their closings and were included in their respective hud closing forms,they argued that the payment of ysps from irwin to their brokers,for obtaining above par mortgages,violated respa specifically,the borrowers argued that irwin payment of ysps violated section of respa,which prohibits the payment of any fee,kickback,or thing of value pursuant to any agreement or understanding,oral or otherwise,that business incident to or part of a real estate settlement service involving a federally related mortgage loan shall be referred to any person.a.the borrowers argued that the ysps constituted illegal referral fees under respa,in that they were paid for nothing more than a broker delivery of a loan with a higher interest rate.in response,irwin contended that its payment of ysps to mortgage brokers were not kickbacks or referral fees,but,rather,that the payments fell within the safe harbor of respa,c,which provides that n othing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the payment to any person of a bona fide compensation or other payment for goods or facilities actually furnished or for services actually performed.
irwin moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted.the subsequent appeal resulted in our first decision in this case,culpepper 
culpepper i and ii,and hud statement of policy 
in culpepper i,we first noted that n o circuit court had yet addressed whether a ysp violates respa.at.in addressing that issue,we held that a lender payment of a ysp to a broker would be an illegal referral fee under respa if a payment of a thing of value was made pursuant to an agreement to refer settlement business and a referral actually occurr ed.id.at.we concluded that the ysp in the culpeppers case violated respa,since it satisfied all three requirements.specifically,the ysp had been paid to premiere pursuant to a arrangement between premiere and irwin,and the later assignment of the culpeppers loan,from premiere to irwin,had,in fact,occurred.id.
we also rejected the argument that the ysp was bona fide compensation for a good or service performed by premiere,such that it should be exempt from liability under c.id.at.we found that irwin had not shown that the ysp was payment for a good under respa,because no identifiable good was ever transferred from premiere to irwin in fact,irwin was,from the outset,the original source of the funds and thus the sole owner of the loan.id.at.nor had irwin established that the ysp was payment for a service that premiere had provided,because the culpeppers had already paid a separate loan origination fee directly to premiere to cover its services irwin had stated in discovery that it paid premiere a ysp for the right to service the culpeppers loan,exh.at,thereby belying the notion that the ysp was intended to compensate premiere for the loan services it provided to the culpeppers and the brokerage services that premiere provided were the same,whether the loan was above par,below par,or at par.at.
in finding that the culpeppers ysp was a referral fee that did not fall under the compensable safe harbor of c,we concluded that the ysp was illegal under a.id.at.our culpepper i decision refrained from inquiring whether the ysp that irwin had paid to premiere was reasonable or a fair market price,stating that the reasonableness inquiry only applied if the first step of the c safe harbor was is,if it was first shown that the ysp covered a compensable good or service.id.at.accordingly,we reversed the district court grant of summary judgment and remanded for further proceedings.
in culpepper ii,we denied a petition for a rehearing of culpepper see at.in doing so,however,we saw fit to clarify our holding in culpepper i.we indicated that culpepper i had not been intended to conclusively establish liability on the part of irwin,nor had culpepper i stated that ysps from a mortgage lender to a mortgage broker were per se illegal under respa.id.rather,the culpepper i decision had been limited to the question of whether the district court had erred in granting summary judgment for irwin on the culpeppers respa action.id.because irwin had failed to establish that the ysp it had paid to premiere had been compensation for either goods or services that premiere had provided,we concluded that the district court had acted prematurely in granting irwin summary judgment as a matter of law.id.at.we stated that nothing in culpepper i would prevent irwin,on remand,from arguing its position at trial.id.
subsequent to our decisions in culpepper i and culpepper ii,hud issued a statement of policy sop intended to clarify its position on lender payments to mortgage brokers.see.hud first stated that it was issuing the sop because congress had instructed it to do so,based on the fact that congress had never intended payments by lenders to mortgage brokers for goods or facilities actually furnished or for services actually performed to be violations of respa id.citation omitted.hud sop indicated that mortgage brokers provided many valuable services to home buyers in processing home mortgage loans,and that it was acceptable for mortgage brokers to receive fees as compensation for those directly from the borrower or indirectly from the long as the compensation bore a reasonable relationship to the market value of the goods,facilities,or services provided.id.at.hud also expressly stated its view that payments by lenders to mortgage brokers,including ysps,were not illegal per se.id.at.
rather,hud recommended a reasonableness test to determine whether a payment to a mortgage broker such as a ysp was permissible under respa.the first step of the inquiry under the hud test was whether goods or facilities were actually furnished or services were actually performed for the compensation paid.id.the sop listed a number compensable services that a mortgage broker might provide in a mortgage transaction,such as,among others,taking information from the borrower and filling out the mortgage application analyzing the prospective borrower income and debt and the borrower for a mortgage educating the borrower about the various loan products available to him or her and assisting the borrower in the mortgage financing,from commencement of the process to the closing.id.at.
the second step of the hud test then asked whether the total compensation paid to the mortgage broker was reasonably related to the value of those goods or services that he furnished.id.at.as to this second step,hud stated that courts were to examine the total compensation paid to the is,fees paid by both the lender and the a lump sum in order to assess whether it was reasonably related to the services provided.id.
culpepper iii and hud statement of policy 
in,we again addressed the borrowers respa action against irwin.the issue before us in culpepper iii was whether the district court had erred in certifying a class action pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c.at.although culpepper iii involved the narrow question of class certification,we accepted the parties contention that we could only determine if class certification was appropriate if we first settle d on a rule of liability under a and c.id.at.thus,in culpepper iii we sought to construe the proper test for liability under respa,in light of hud recent pronouncement on the question via the sop.
first,we indicated our view that the hud sop on respa was ambiguous.id.at.we then construed the test that had been set forth in the sop.we observed that the first step under that test was an assessment of whether the payments at issue were for services actually performed for the compensation paid.id.at citing.at.we construed that first step as requiring some level of exchange between the broker and the lender.id.at stating that the inquiry in this step includes not only whether the broker performed services,but also whether the broker performed the services as part of a exchange.that is,we held that it was not enough for a lender to show that services had been performed by the mortgage broker rather,we stated that the lender would have to show that the services that were performed were directly tied to the ysp payment.id.at see also schuetz,at stating that in culpepper iii we held that the test for liability is not whether the broker performed some services,but whether the ysp is payment for those services.
we then stated that,if the compensation to the broker was not shown to be directly tied to the services is,if the ysp was not shown to be payment for those services,culpepper iii,at the second step of the hud analysis whether the total compensation was reasonable was wholly unnecessary.rather,if the defendant failed at the outset to establish that the ysp payment was directly tied to the services performed,then the ysp was likely a referral fee,which,we held,was illegal,period under respa.id.at.after articulating this approach to liability under respa,we indicated that class certification in the borrowers case was proper,because the ysps were paid pursuant to standardized,agreements between the lender and the mortgage broker,and,therefore,the requirements of rule had been satisfied.id.at.
in the wake of our decision in culpepper iii,hud issued a second sop in october,entitled,in pertinent part,clarification of statement of policy regarding lender payments to mortgage brokers.see.hud stated that the new sop was intended to eliminate any ambiguity concerning the department position with respect to ysps.id.hud also indicated that the sop was being issued in direct response to culpepper iii,indicating that t he need for further clarification of hud position,as set forth in the sop,on the treatment of lender payments to mortgage brokers under a is evident from the recent decision in culpepper iii.id.at.hud went on to state that it disagree d with the judicial interpretation of that we had set forth in culpepper iii.id.
hud sop reiterated the test it had established in the sop,indicating that the proper analysis involved an assessment,first,into whether compensable services were actually performed by the broker,and,second,whether the total compensation paid to the broker was reasonable.id.at.the sop restate d hud position that ysps were neither per se legal,nor per se illegal.id.at.rather,hud advised that each case involving a ysp payment from a lender to a broker should be assessed based on the specific factual circumstances applicable to each transaction in which a ysp is used.id.
hud then clarified its test for ysp payments under respa.as to step one,hud stated that it was improper to require as we had in culpepper iii that there be a clear and direct link between the services the mortgage broker provided and the compensation that was paid.id.rather,hud observed that a lender might often be aware that a mortgage broker was performing compensable services for both the lender and the broker,even if the relationship between the services provided and the compensation paid was not explicitly set forth in a contractual agreement.id.hud recommended that the inquiry instead focus on whether compensable as those it had listed in its been provided by the mortgage broker,irrespective of whether the parties had agreed that the ysp was intended to cover those services.id.in clarifying step one in this way,the sop rejected the exchange analysis that had been applied by our court in culpepper iii.hud sop also made clear that if any compensable services were,in fact,provided by a broker,the proper analysis would then be to move to step two,that is,whether the total compensation was reasonably related to those services.
as to that second step,hud reiterated that the inquiry should focus on whether the total compensation that the mortgage broker received was reasonably related to the total set of goods or facilities actually furnished or services performed.id.hud stated that the total compensation was to be viewed as a whole not just the ysp in isolation,and that an assessment of whether the compensation was reasonable involved both an objective component that is,typical mortgage broker compensation in comparable markets and a subjective component that is,in light of the particular services that the broker provided.id.
d.the impact of the statement of policy on our case law 
subsequently,in heimmermann first union mortgage corporation,we addressed the impact of the hud sop.although the borrowers in the instant case were not parties to heimmermann,the facts of that case were similar to the borrowers action we characterized heimmermann as one of several cases dealing with respa effect on the legality of the payment of ysps by mortgage lenders to mortgage brokers.at.the issue before us in heimmermann was whether the district court had applied the correct legal standard for respa liability in the course of certifying a class in that case.
at the outset,heimmermann addressed the applicability of the hud sop on our respa case law.first,we held that the sop was not a new rule or regulation,but merely a clarification of existing law,and therefore,no problem with the retroactive application of the sop exist ed.id.at.second,we noted that respa expressly delegated to hud the power to issue interpretations and statements of policy similar to the carry the full force of law,and therefore,the sop was entitled to deference by our court.id.at we rejected the plaintiff arguments that the sop should not be afforded chevron deference because it had not been issued pursuant to a formal process and it was inconsistent with earlier expressions of hud position and the statutory language.id.
after determining that the sop was entitled to chevron deference,we held that the rule announced in the sop had the effect of overrul ing the holding of culpepper iii.id.at.we stated that the sop had explicitly reject ed the foundation of culpepper iii and that we were bound to apply the revised test as it had been articulated by hud in the sop.id.we cited our decision in satellite broadcasting and communications association of america oman,cir,for the proposition that we were bound to defer to an intervening statutory interpretation that was contrary to our earlier precedent,so long as the agency interpretation was based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.
having adopted the sop as the law in our circuit on the question of ysp liability under respa,we concluded in heimmermann that the district court had applied the wrong legal standard in deciding to certify the class.id.at.specifically,we observed that the district court had certified the class based on the fact that for each class member loan,the ysp was not tied directly to specific additional services provided by the broker.id.emphasis added.because that legal standard was suggestive of culpepper iii exchange approach that had since been rejected by the held in heimmermann that the district court had committed legal error.id.moreover,we indicated that the sop had made clear that it was necessary to determine whether compensable services were provided by the broker and whether the total amount of broker compensation was reasonable in the light of the circumstances of each loan,a fact that militated against certifying a class of plaintiffs based only on the fact that their mortgage brokers had received ysps.id.
although the heimmermann court did not proceed to apply the hud test as articulated in the sop,we later had occasion to apply that test in hirsch bankamerica corporation,cir per curiam.like the borrowers case,hirsch was an action against a mortgage lender for paying a ysp to a mortgage broker.id.at.in hirsch the mortgage broker had received in fees from the,and had received an additional ysp from the lender for delivering a loan with a favorable interest rate.id.at.
in hirsch,we reiterated that heimmermann had adopted the sop as the law of this circuit we then applied the test as articulated in the sop.id.at.first,we found that the mortgage broker had provided actual services to the hirsches,such as recording their information,preparing the mortgage application,analyzing their income and debt,and attending the closing.id.having satisfied the first step of the hud test,we then moved to step two,and concluded that the total compensation paid to the of the loan reasonable under the circumstances.id.accordingly,we held that the was entitled to summary judgment on the hirsches respa claim,since the hirsches had failed to establish that the ysp was illegal under the hud test construing section of respa.id.
e.the district court proceedings after the statement of policy 
in the wake of these appeals,and subsequent to the parties discovery in this case,irwin filed motions for summary judgment and to decertify the class.as to irwin motion for summary judgment,the district court found that heimmermann had made clear that our circuit had adopted hud test,as articulated in the sop.the court then turned to the facts of the borrowers transactions in order to assess whether the services provided by their mortgage brokers premiere for the culpeppers,and hmi for hiers had complied with hud test.as to step one,the district court found that the borrowers mortgage brokers had provided compensable services to them,including those services listed in the sop,such as collecting financial information assisting with the mortgage application process and maintaining contact with the borrower.
moving to step the total compensation the mortgage brokers received was reasonably related to the value of the services the mortgage brokers performed.district court found that the borrowers had not presented any evidence to show that the compensation received by their brokers was unreasonable.the court found that the borrowers argument that the ysp was paid to their brokers without any concomitant reduction in their,costs was not sufficient,in and of itself,to establish that the brokers total compensation was not reasonably related to the services the brokers provided.the court further found that the borrowers had failed to present any evidence that the compensation these brokers received was unreasonable in comparison to similar mortgage loans in similar transactions.because the borrowers had not provided any evidence that establishe d the unreasonableness of premiere or hmi total compensation in light of market norms,the district court concluded that there was no genuine issue of fact on the issue of the reasonableness of the compensation,and,therefore,irwin was entitled to summary judgment on the borrowers respa action.at.
as to the separate motion to decertify the class,the district court indicated that the heimmermann decision made clear that ysp payments to brokers should be assessed on a basis,and that therefore class certification was not appropriate for these kinds of actions,in which individual fact issues predominate.the court also rejected the borrowers argument that the ysp payments were above the limit on loan origination fees,and therefore that they were per se illegal,without the need for an individualized assessment.the court found that this approach would contradict the hud sops of and,which mandated a analysis to determine if a particular ysp was illegal under respa.accordingly,the court granted irwin motion,and decertified the class.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
district court grant of summary judgment in favor of irwin 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard used by the district court.see johnson bd.of regents,cir citation omitted.under that standard,summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we have held that the plain language of rule c mandates the entry of summary judgment against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case,and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.johnson,at quotations and citation omitted.
the borrowers make two arguments concerning the district court decision to grant summary judgment in favor of irwin.first,they argue that the doctrine obligates us to adhere to our prior rulings in this case,despite the taken by hud in its and sops.second,the borrowers argue that even assuming the hud test for liability applies to their case,summary judgment still should not have been granted to irwin,since their evidence establishes that the ysps irwin paid were illegal under that test.we address each contention in turn.
the borrowers argue that the doctrine precludes us from reconsidering our holdings in the earlier culpepper our holding in culpepper iii that we need not assess the reasonableness of the compensation irwin paid to the mortgage brokers,and may find a respa violation,absent any evidence that the ysp was directly tied to the services that the mortgage brokers provided.the borrowers argue that,under the doctrine,we are bound by the approach that we took in culpepper iii,notwithstanding the fact that approach was expressly refuted in the hud sop,and notwithstanding the fact that we later held that the hud sop overruled culpepper iii.see heimmermann,at.
the doctrine holds that subsequent courts will be bound by the findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the court of appeals in a prior appeal of the same case.wheeler city of pleasant grove,cir per curiam citation omitted.the purpose of the doctrine is to bring an end to litigation,and to protect against the agitation,or,of settled issues.id.citations omitted.although the doctrine bars reconsideration of settled issues,however,we have stated that the rule is not an inexorable command,nor does it require rigid adherence to rulings made at an earlier step of a case in all circumstances.murphy fdic,cir citation omitted.rather,we have described the doctrine as direct ing a court discretion rather than limit ing the tribunal power.id.we are not bound under the doctrine to adhere to a ruling with which we have emphatically and repeatedly disagreed.id.
moreover,there are three notable exceptions to the doctrine.we will not be barred from reconsidering the when a subsequent trial produces substantially different evidence controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of law applicable to that issue or the is clearly erroneous and will work manifest injustice if not if not reconsidered.wheeler,at citation omitted.
the district court concluded that the doctrine was inapplicable to the present case,and,consequently,that it was not bound to follow the approach to respa liability taken in culpepper iii.this conclusion was proper,for two reasons.first,the doctrine second exception applies,because the sop constituted controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of law applicable to that issue.see wheeler,at.moreover,the doctrine is inapplicable because we are convinced that the prior decision culpepper iii is clearly erroneous and would work manifest injustice if it were blindly followed.see murphy,at citations omitted.
as to the first point,the hud sop constituted controlling authority that has since made a contrary decision of law applicable to the borrowers case.wheeler,at.in heimmermann,we stated that the hud sop was an agency ruling that carried the full force of law,that it was based on a permissible construction of the statute,and that it was entitled to chevron deference by our court see at.moreover,in heimmermann,we adopted the sop as the law of our circuit.see id.at see also hirsch,at.because the sop constitutes controlling authority carrying the force of law,we our bound to follow it,rather than our earlier,contrary holding in culpepper iii.a contrary result would wed this circuit to an earlier decision,while all other circuits and the supreme court would be bound under chevron to defer to the agency rule.see satellite broadcasting,at.
moreover,we are convinced that the third exception to the doctrine is is,that the approach to respa liability taken in culpepper iii was clearly erroneous,such that continuing to apply it would work manifest injustice.see murphy,at.we intimated as much in heimmermann,where we stated that the district court,by following the standard of liability of culpepper iii,had applied the wrong legal standard.at emphasis added.we have repeatedly stated that the sop had the effect of overruling culpepper iii,thereby suggesting that the approach to respa liability taken in culpepper iii was clearly erroneous.see see also glover standard federal bank,cir rejecting the analysis of culpepper iii and querying whether the case retains any residual viability in the eleventh circuit in the wake of hud sop.for that reason,we find that continuing to follow culpepper iii would work manifest injustice.
because we conclude that the approach to respa liability taken in culpepper iii was clearly erroneous and that continuing to follow that approach would work manifest injustice,we agree with the district court that the doctrine is inapplicable to the borrowers case.we are not bound under the to continue to follow the respa liability standard set forth in culpepper iii rather,the hud sop test applies.we now turn to that test in order to determine if irwin was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.
whether the borrowers ysps constitute illegal payments under respa 
the borrowers contend that even under the hud test,the district court nevertheless erred in granting summary judgment in favor of irwin,because the ysps irwin paid to the borrowers mortgage brokers were unreasonable and illegal under the hud test.
hud test for whether a ysp to a mortgage broker constitutes an illegal payment under respa involves two steps.first,we ask whether the broker performed actual services in the course of arranging the mortgage transaction,that is,whether he performed any of the services mentioned in hud sop.hirsch,at.if the answer to the first question is no,then a respa violation has been established.glover,at.if the answer to the first question is yes,we then proceed to ask whether the total compensation was reasonable in light of the total array of services that the broker performed.see hirsch,at.in undertaking this analysis,we do not ask whether the services the broker performed were linked to the ysp in particular rather,we look at all of the services performed and evaluate them in light of all the compensation not just the ysp in isolation the mortgage broker received from any source.id.at.see also glover,at stating that step two involves an assessment of whether any part of the total payment,including the ysp,proves to be excessive,and,thus,an unlawful referral fee.
here,it is undisputed that the borrowers mortgage brokers provided them with the kinds of services listed in hud sop,including,among others,taking down their information and filling out their mortgage applications analyzing their income and debt and them to determine the maximum mortgages that they could afford collecting their financial information and participating in their loan closings.see.these are compensable services under respa,and thus the first step of the hud test is satisfied 
we then must ask whether the total compensation paid to the mortgage brokers was unreasonable in light of the services th
