we hold today that when nominal damages are awarded in a civil rights class action,every member of the class whose constitutional rights were violated is entitled to nominal damages.an award of nominal damages to only the named class representatives fails to appreciate the difference between a class action and a conventional lawsuit.
we also hold that,pursuant to ninth circuit rule,a request for attorney fees incurred on appeal must be made to us,not to the district court.the district court is not authorized to award attorney fees for an appeal unless we transfer the fee request to the district court for consideration.
this is the second time this case has been on appeal.a detailed description of the facts underlying this case is set out in cummings connell,cir cummings i.we briefly summarize them here.defendant california state employees association,local,service employees international union,is the exclusive representative for nine bargaining units of california state employees.the seven named plaintiffs are nonunion employees of the state of california.although the plaintiffs have no affiliation with the union,the state deducts agency fair share fees from their paychecks to cover their share of the collective bargaining process between the state and the union plaintiffs brought a class action pursuant to on behalf of nonunion members alleging that the union was improperly withholding the agency fees without providing the procedural safeguards mandated by the supreme court in chicago teachers union hudson,d the district court certified the class and ultimately determined that the notices were indeed deficient under hudson.the court ordered the union to refund the portion of the fee to all fee payers,including those who did not object to any of the notices.this restitution award came to approximately million dollars.the court also awarded plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs of nearly.
in cummings i,we affirmed the district court certification of the class.we also affirmed the court ruling that the union first hudson notice was defective for failing to include verifications of the withholding calculations.however,we reversed as the award of restitution of the nonchargeable portion of the fee to all class members,including to those who did not object to any of the notices.we said 
we agree with the union,however,that the district court went too far in ordering partial restitution to all class members.ordinarily,if there is a proper hudson notice,the employee has the burden to object to paying the full nonmember fee,and only then is entitled to a refund of the nonchargeable portion of the fee.
in this case,the nonmembers all eventually received notices with sufficient information under hudson,and a renewed opportunity to object and receive their money back with interest.we fail to see how plaintiffs suffered any compensable harm aside from nominal damages from the initial defective notice.
on remand,the district court should reconsider the issue of attorneys fees and costs to determine whether further reduction is appropriate in light of our decision regarding the proper remedy for the hudson violation.

on remand,the district court made two rulings that are now before us on appeal.the first one concerned the award of nominal damages.the court ruled that in light of our opinion in cummings i the issue of whether plaintiffs suffered an injury entitling them to nominal damages is not a matter of dispute.d at.what remained to be resolved was which plaintiffs should receive those of the class members or just the seven class representatives and also the amount of nominal damages to be awarded per person or per person in the end,the district court ruled that only the seven named class representatives were each entitled to the one dollar nominal damages award,not each class member.the court additionally declined to grant a separate nominal damage award for each of the seventeen alleged acts of the same constitutional violation.the total damage award against the union was.plaintiffs appeal both the failure to award nominal damages to each class member,and the amount awarded per person.
the second one concerned attorney fees.following the entry of the amended judgment,plaintiffs renewed their request for attorneys fees and costs,seeking roughly.after taking into consideration plaintiffs limited success on appeal and deducting all fees associated with the unsuccessful chargeability cause of action,the court awarded a total of.this figure represented approximately for attorneys fees and costs incurred in the district court for the pre and phases of the case.of particular significance,it also included approximately for fees and expenses incurred on appeal.the parties the fees and costs order.
ii.discussion 
nominal damages award award of nominal damages to class representatives all class members 
the district court declined to award each class member because the total award against the union would be,which the court found to be substantial as already mentioned,the court awarded a total of,to each of the class representatives.plaintiffs contend that each member of the plaintiff class had been subjected to a constitutional violation,and thus each member should receive nominal damages to do otherwise,fails to vindicate the rights of the other class members and disregards the purpose of class action litigation.the union counters that where,as here,the plaintiff class is large,awarding even a to each class member offends the purpose underlying nominal damages.
under,damages for violations of constitutional rights are determined according to principles derived from the common law of torts.see,memphis cmty.sch.dist.stachura,d carey piphus,d.damages are commonly understood to compensate a party for loss or harm sustained.nominal damages,however,serve a separate function.as distinguished from punitive and compensatory damages,nominal damages are awarded to vindicate rights,the infringement of which has not caused actual,provable injury.
courts traditionally have vindicated deprivations of certain absolute rights that are not shown to have caused actual injury through the award of a nominal sum of money.by making the deprivation of such rights actionable for nominal damages without proof of actual injury,the law recognizes the importance to organized society that those rights be scrupulously observed but at the same time,it remains true to the principle that substantial damages should be awarded only to compensate actual injury or,in the case of exemplary or punitive damages,to deter or punish malicious deprivations of right.
carey,at.nominal damages,as the term implies,are in name only and customarily are defined as a mere token or trifling.see,id.at.magnett pelletier,cir per curiam.although the amount of damages awarded is not limited to one dollar,the nature of the award compels that the amount be minimal.see romano,cir.nominal damages serve one other function,to clarify the identity of the prevailing party for the purposes of awarding attorney fees and costs in appropriate cases.farrar hobby,d stating that a plaintiff who wins nominal damages is a prevailing party under.
cummings i established that only nominal damages should have been awarded.however,on remand,the question remained nominal damages awarded to whom each class member or just the seven named class representatives 
in harrington city of albuquerque,d,the district court awarded nominal damages after finding that the union failed to provide constitutionally sufficient hudson notices.id.at.the plaintiffs sought partial summary judgment awarding nominal damages for each named plaintiff and each class member.id.at.the union conceded that the named plaintiffs were entitled to nominal damages,but,having opposed plaintiffs motion for class certification,oppose d awarding damages to each class member.id.the court rejected the union argument because it had already determined that the class was properly certified.no other objection being discussed,the court awarded the entire class of plaintiffs nominal damages in the amount of one dollar per person.id.the class comprised approximately members,harrington city of albuquerque.
in hohe casey,cir,yet another hudson notice violation case,the third circuit affirmed the district court award of nominal damage to each nonmember,because it had been established that constitutionally inadequate procedures were used in imposing the fair share fee.the plaintiff class was comprised of roughly members,id.at,making the total nominal damage award approximately.
on the other hand,there are cases where the court granted the damages award to the class,as opposed to each class member,as if the class existed as a distinct entity like a corporation or partnership.in norwood bain,cir per curiam en banc,the fourth circuit sitting en banc remanded a class action to the district court with instructions to enter judgment that includes an award of nominal damages to the plaintiff class against defendants not exceeding.the court in alexander polk,followed suit awarding in nominal damages to the entire plaintiff class in a case.the court additionally awarded in nominal damages individually to a plaintiff who was not a member of the class.id.the third circuit affirmed the nominal damage award to the individual member and remanded the class award to the district court for consideration of whether compensatory damages,in lieu of nominal damages,were appropriate.alexander polk,cir.see also davenport derobertis.approving jury award of in nominal damages to each of the named plaintiffs in prisoner class action suit.
finally,adding to the mix,is the apparently atypical position taken by the court in callahan sanders,denying any award of nominal damages because of the enormous size of the plaintiff class.plaintiffs filed a suit against the alabama justices of the peace alleging imposition of fines in violation of due process and the alabama highway laws.the court determined that the defendants conduct resulted in constitutional deprivations,but found that plaintiffs failed to sustain actual injury.the court,after recognizing the availability of nominal damages,refrained from awarding any damages because the class was large.the fifth circuit affirmed.callahan wallace,cir.
we agree with the approach taken by the courts that have recognized that each class member whose constitutional rights were violated is entitled to nominal damages.once a class has been certified,there is no justification for awarding nominal damages to only the named class representatives.class action litigation is a procedural mechanism designed to join multiple parties with similar or identical claims,so that they may seek redress in an efficient and expeditious manner.eyak native village exxon,cir.
one of the goals of class action litigation is to save the resources of both the courts and the parties by permitting an issue potentially affecting every class member to be litigated in an economical fashion under rule.califano yamasaki,d.this is accomplished in part by allowing the class to proceed on a representative basis a class representative functions as a for the entire class and assumes duties on behalf of the class.see.of the southwest falcon,d acknowledging that class actions present the exception to the rule that litigation is to be conducted by and on behalf of the individually named parties.nevertheless,while class representatives stand in the stead of their fellow class members,rule recognizes that the absent class members rights must be scrupulously observed.requiring that the class representative fairly and adequately represent the interests of the absent class members.
where a plaintiff proves a violation of constitutional rights,nominal damages must be awarded as a matter of law.schneider county of san diego,cir.every member of the plaintiff class was entitled to the hudson procedural safeguards every member of the class received the same inadequate hudson notice sent by the union every member of the class suffered the same deprivation of rights.and it follows that every member is entitled to nominal damages,just as if each one had brought his or her own lawsuit.it is axiomatic that rule can not abridge,enlarge or modify any substantive right of any party to the litigation.consequently,the mere fact that a case is proceeding as a class action does not allow the district court to vindicate the rights of the individually named plaintiffs differently as compared to the absent class plaintiffs.
we are unpersuaded by the union assertion that the class representative function is to act as the symbol of the entire class,and in such a capacity,is appropriately awarded the symbolic on behalf of the entire class.awarding nominal damages to only the named class representatives results in a divergence of interests between the class representatives and the absent class members.this is in direct contravention of rule.
finally,and perhaps most importantly,the union assertion that only the class representatives should receive the damage award fails to appreciate the significance attached to the fact that a class was certified.the purpose of a class action is to obviate the need for all similarly situated persons to file separate lawsuits when impractical to do so.this purpose is defeated if only the named individuals recover nominal damages.it would also create the anomalous situation in which class members would be bound by a judgment if they lose,but can receive no individual vindication if they win.
balancing the goals of class action litigation to make litigation expeditious and economic with the purpose underlying nominal damages to vindicate injury not resulting in actual harm,we conclude the district court erred by awarding damages to only the class representatives to the exclusion of the absent class members.
discrete acts general nominal damages award 
plaintiffs also take issue with the district court refusal to award separate nominal damages of for each of the seventeen acts that resulted in a constitutional violation of the nonmembers rights.plaintiffs maintain that it was the involuntary taking of the nonmembers wages that resulted in a violation of the employees constitutional rights,and accordingly,each separate seizure must be remedied by a separate award of nominal this case totaling not,but per person.
in redding fairman,cir,prison inmates filed suit pursuant to challenging the constitutionality of procedures used by the illinois department of corrections to conduct disciplinary hearings.following the district court award of nominal damages,one of the plaintiffs asserted that he should receive for each of the separate violations of his procedural due process rights.id.at.the seventh circuit rejected that argument concluding that 
nominal damages are not compensation for loss or injury,but rather recognition of a violation of rights.nominal damages do not measure anything.the plaintiff argument must be rejected we will not disturb the district court decision to award only nominal damages.
id.this reasoning is persuasive.an award of nominal damages is intended to serve as a symbol that defendant conduct resulted in a technical,as opposed to injurious,violation of plaintiff rights.carey,at.nominal damages are not intended to compensate a plaintiff for injuries,nor to act as a measure of the severity of a defendant wrongful conduct.recovery of nominal damages is important not for the amount of the award,but for the fact of the award.indeed,nominal damages do not measure anything.as a consequence of the present lawsuit,plaintiffs true relief is the moral satisfaction of knowing that a federal court concluded that their rights had been violated,hewitt helms,d and an enforceable judgment requiring the alteration of defendant behavior to plaintiffs benefit.accordingly,there is no justification for calculating an award of nominal damages on the basis of the number of times the defendant violated plaintiff rights.
nominal damages exist as a purely symbolic vindication of a constitutional right.schneider,at quoting floyd laws,cir.applying plaintiffs approach converts the damage award into something more akin to compensatory damages.as the court in redding acknowledged,multiple incidents in a continuing constitutional violation ar
