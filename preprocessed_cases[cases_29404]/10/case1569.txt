introduction 
david tourgeman brought a putative class and representative action against dell financial services,dell financial services and respondents nelson kennard and robert kennard.in his complaint,tourgeman contended that respondents violated the fair debt collections practices act fdcpa et while attempting to collect a debt that tourgeman incurred in connection with his purchase of a dell computer.tourgeman brought a single claim under the unfair competition law ucl bus,seeking an injunction to prevent respondents from engaging in unlawful,unfair,fraudulent debt collection practices in the future.respondents filed a special motion to strike pursuant to the statute code civ,
tourgeman voluntarily dismissed his action against respondents.after the action was dismissed,respondents filed a motion for attorney fees.code civ,subd.c.tourgeman opposed the motion.in his opposition,tourgeman conceded that the trial court had jurisdiction to rule on respondents motion for attorney fees,but argued that the trial court was required to determine whether respondents would have prevailed on their special motion to strike as a prerequisite to awarding them attorney fees under the statute.tourgeman further argued that respondents would not have prevailed on their special motion to strike because the action was exempt from the statute,under the public interest exception to the statute 
the trial court determined that tourgeman had failed to demonstrate that the public interest exception applied to his lawsuit,and entered an order to this effect.the court awarded attorney fees and costs to respondents in the amount of the court later entered judgment in favor of respondents in this same amount.
on appeal,tourgeman contends that the trial court erred in concluding that his action was not subject to the public interest exception,subd.b to the statute.we conclude that tourgeman action satisfied each of the requirements of the public interest exception and that his complaint was therefore not subject to a special motion to strike.the trial court thus erred in awarding respondents attorney fees and costs pursuant to the statute.accordingly,we reverse the judgment and the attorney fees and costs order and remand the matter to the trial court with directions to deny respondents motion for attorney fees and costs.
factual and procedural backgrounda.tourgeman complaint 
in may,tourgeman filed a complaint against dell financial services and respondents.in his complaint,tourgeman alleged that he purchased a dell computer in november and that dell financial services had arranged for tourgeman to obtain a loan from cit online bank.tourgeman alleged that in january,nelson kennard generated a collection letter to tourgeman on a form template that misidentified the original creditor of tourgeman loan.tourgeman further alleged that scott kennard had spent very little time reviewing this letter,and did not review tourgeman file or account notes,before signing it.tourgeman claimed that as a result,kennard had not been meaningfully involved,in connection with the collection of the debt as required by the fdcpa.
tourgeman further alleged that nelson kennard had sent collection letters to hundreds of consumers that falsely identified the consumer original creditor.tourgeman also alleged that scott kennard had not conducted any meaningful review before signing these letters.
tourgeman claimed that nelson kennard had filed a lawsuit against him that misidentified the original creditor of tourgeman loan,that he had incurred over in legal fees defending the lawsuit,and that nelson kennard had eventually dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice.tourgeman further alleged that nelson kennard had filed similar false complaints against dozens of consumers throughout california.
tourgeman stated that he was bringing the action on behalf of himself and the following classes 
all consumers who financed a product through dell financial services,and to whom nelson kennard sent,to an address in california,a collection letter that identified the consumer original creditor as an entity that was different than the entity with which the consumer actually had a loan agreement.
all consumers who financed a product through dell financial services,and against whom nelson kennard filed a california lawsuit that alleged the consumer entered into a written loan agreement with an entity that was not the entity with which the consumer actually had a loan agreement.
tourgeman alleged a single cause of action against dell financial services and respondents for violation of the ucl on behalf of himself,members of the c lass,and of the general public.tourgeman claimed that respondents continued to send collection letters and file collection lawsuits without enact ing measures to ensure that they obtain complete and accurate information about consumers before sending out collection letters filing suits.
in his prayer for relief tourgeman sought 
an injunction enjoining,preliminarily and permanently,the respondents from continuing the unfair,unlawful,fraudulent conduct alleged herein,including an injunction requiring the respondents to enact sufficient measures that will include the name of the correct original creditor on any collection letters they send out or in any lawsuits that they file in the future.
an injunction enjoining,preliminarily and permanently,the respondents from continuing the unfair,unlawful,fraudulent conduct alleged herein,including an injunction requiring respondents to enact policies and procedures to ensure that an attorney is meaningfully involved in the attempt to collect debts by,among other things,conducting a sufficient review of the consumer file before signing a collection letter.
respondents special motion to strike and motion for attorney fees 
in august,respondents filed a special motion to strike pursuant to the statute.tourgeman subsequently dismissed this action against respondents without prejudice.after the dismissal,respondents filed a motion for attorney fees and costs pursuant to the statute.
tourgeman opposed the motion,contending that respondents were not entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs pursuant to the statute because they would not have prevailed on their special motion to strike.specifically,tourgeman argued that the action was exempt from application of the statute pursuant to the public interest exception.
in support of his claim that the action was exempt from the statute,tourgeman emphasized that he had not sought any monetary damages or restitution for himself,and that the sole remedy that he had sought in his complaint was injunctive relief designed to ensure that california consumers were not harmed by respondents allegedly unfair,unlawful and fraudulent debt collection practices in the future.tourgeman further argued that he had not sought any benefit for himself and that instead,he had brought this case purely for the benefit of a large class of californians who might one day wind up on the receiving end of a collections letter or lawsuit from respondents that violates the fdcpa.tourgeman also argued that his action would benefit the public interest,and that private enforcement was necessary and placed a disproportionate burden on him.
respondents filed a reply in which they argued that tourgeman action did not meet the three requirements of the public interest exception to the statute.with respect to the first prong,that the plaintiff have sought no greater or different relief than that sought for the general public or class,respondents contended that in a related federal action,tourgeman sought relief personal to himself,different from and far greater than the injunctive relief he sought on behalf of the class in this action.with respect to the second prong,that the action would enforce an important right affecting the public interest,respondents argued that tourgeman had provided argument,but no evidence.specifically,respondents contended that tourgeman had failed to present evidence as to how many of its collection letters and lawsuits had misidentified the consumer original creditor.finally,with respect to the third prong,that private enforcement was necessary and placed a disproportionate burden on the plaintiff,respondents argued that the federal trade commission and consumer financial protection bureau were authorized to enforce compliance with the fdcpa,and that they had done so in several recent cases.respondents further argued than tourgeman has failed to present any evidence of the financial burden this litigation would impose on him relative to his stake in the matter.
c.the trial court ruling 
on november,the trial court entered an order granting respondents motion for attorney fees and costs.the court concluded that tourgeman action did not come within the public interest exception to the statute,reasoning 
plaintiff complaint in this action sought only injunctive relief,and it is unlikely plaintiff would have benefitted from the requested injunction.however,plaintiff has not shown an important public interest that affected a large group of persons would have been vindicated by his complaint or that private enforcement was necessary and placed any financial burden on plaintiff greater than his stake in this action.
the court noted that tourgeman had not otherwise opposed the motion 
plaintiff does not dispute his sole claim for violation of business and professions code section arose from the respondents exercise of their constitutional right to petition.plaintiff also does not attempt to demonstrate he could meet his burden of establishing a probability of prevailing on the merits of his section claim.
the court awarded respondents attorney fees and costs pursuant to section,subdivision c in the amount of.on december,the trial court entered a judgment in favor of respondents against tourgeman for.
d.the appeal 
tourgeman timely appeals 
discussionthe trial court erred in awarding respondents attorney fees and costs pursuant to section,subdivision c 
tourgeman contends that the trial court erred in awarding respondents attorney fees and costs pursuant to section,subdivision c.
respondents contention that we may affirm the attorney fees and costs award regardless of whether the public interest exception applies is unpersuasive 
citing coltrain shewalter th coltrain,respondents contend that we may affirm the trial court attorney fees and costs order on the ground that they realized their objectives in the litigation,irrespective of whether they would have prevailed on their special motion to strike.
in coltrain,a panel of the fourth appellate district,division two concluded that when a plaintiff voluntary dismisses its complaint while a special motion to strike is pending,it is within the trial court discretion to determine whether the defendant is the prevailing party for purposes of attorney fees under section,subdivision c,and that i n making that determination,the critical issue is which party realized its objectives in the litigation.coltrain,supra,th at,italics added.the coltrain court added,since the defendant goal is to make the plaintiff go away with its tail between its legs,ordinarily the prevailing party will be the defendant.ibid.
numerous courts have agreed with the coltrain court conclusion that a trial court retains jurisdiction to award attorney fees pursuant to section,subdivision c after a plaintiff voluntary dismisses its complaint while a special motion to strike is pending.see,liu moore th,liu pfeiffer venice properties bernard th,pfeiffer law offices of andrew ellis yang th.however,in contrast to the coltrain court statement that it is within the trial court discretion to award attorney fees pursuant to section,subdivision c if the court determines that the defendant achieved its objectives in the litigation,other courts have concluded that,under the terms of subdivision c,the critical issue is the merits of the defendant motion to strike.liu,supra,at,italics added pfeiffer,supra,at stating that t he fee motion is wholly dependent upon a determination of the merits of the slapp motion,and that the trial court is required to rule on the merits of the slapp motion accord kyle carmon th,the trial court adjudication of the merits of the section motion supports affirmance of the award of attorney fees and costs to defendant.
thus,under liu and other cases that have adopted its reasoning,the trial court adjudication of the merits of a defendant motion to strike is an essential predicate to ruling on the defendant request for an award of fees and costs.liu,supra,th at see also ibid.disagreeing with coltrain to the extent that it permits an award of attorney fees and costs regardless of whether the action is a slapp suit or not,quoting coltrain,supra,th at accord pfeiffer,supra,th at the statement in coltrain,supra,at page,that the trial court has discretion to determine whether the defendant is the prevailing party for purposes of attorney fees under code of civil procedure section,subdivision c,is not accurate.
we agree with the liu court and disagree with coltrain to the extent that coltrain permits the trial court to award attorney fees and costs pursuant to section,subdivision c without first determining whether the defendant would have prevailed on the special motion to strike.subject to exceptions not applicable here,section,subdivision c authorizes an award of attorney fees and costs to a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike.italics added.thus,a determination of whether a defendant would have prevailed on its motion to strike is an essential prerequisite to an award of attorney fees and costs pursuant to section,subdivision c.liu,supra,th at pfeiffer,supra,th at.
accordingly,we conclude that we may not affirm the trial court award of attorney fees and costs on the alternative ground that the trial court had discretion to determine that respondents were the prevailing party under section,subdivision c,without determining whether respondents would have prevailed on their motion 
tourgeman action was not subject to a special motion to strike because it was protected by the public interest exception to the statute 
tourgeman claims that his action was not subject to a special motion to strike because it was protected by the public interest exception to the statute,subd.b we apply the de novo standard of review to tourgeman claim.see people ex rel.strathmann acacia research th,strathmann.
section,subdivision b provides 
b section does not apply to any action brought solely in the public interest or on behalf of the general public if all of the following conditions exist 
the plaintiff does not seek any relief greater than or different from the relief sought for the general public or a class of which the plaintiff is a member.a claim for attorney fees,costs,or penalties does not constitute greater or different relief for purposes of this subdivision.
the action,if successful,would enforce an important right affecting the public interest,and would confer a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,on the general public or a large class of persons.
private enforcement is necessary and places a disproportionate financial burden on the plaintiff in relation to the plaintiff stake in the matter.
in club members for an honest election sierra club cal th,club members,the supreme court explained that i n,the legislature enacted section to curb the disturbing abuse of the statute,subd.a.according to the sponsor of section,senator sheila kuehl,the same types of businesses who used the slapp action were inappropriately using the motion against their adversaries.hence,the legislature expressly designed subdivision b of section to prevent the use of the device against specified public interest actions,among others.citation.blanchard directv,th,blanchard.
the court in ingels westwood one broadcasting services,th,ingels,summarized section,subdivision b and the legislature intent in enacting that provision as follows 
on its face,subdivision b appears to exempt class actions and private attorney general suits from treatment under section.a review of the legislative history confirms that was the intent of the legislature senate bill no.would make the slapp motion inapplicable to public interest and class action lawsuits brought solely in the public interest or on behalf of the general public when three specified conditions are met.in general,the qualifying language would clearly encompass claims brought under the unfair competition law business and professions code section et,the unfair practices act business and professions code section et,the consumer legal remedies act civil code section et,as well as any other public interest or class actions lawsuits where the three specified conditions are met.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may,see also assem.com.on judiciary,on bill reg.sess.as amended june.
the three conditions of section,subdivision b through mirror the three elements for determining the eligibility for a fee award under the private attorney general doctrine as codified in section.blanchard,supra,th at.
if a plaintiff lawsuit comes within section,subdivision b,it is exempt from the statute,and thus,a trial court may deny the defendants special motion to strike without determining whether the plaintiff causes of action arise from protected activity,and if so,whether the plaintiff has established a probability of prevailing on those causes of action under section,subdivision b.see,strathmann,supra,th at northern cal.carpenters regional council warmington hercules associates th,carpenters.
tourgeman action satisfied each of the requirements of the public interest exception 
tourgeman action was brought solely in the public interest 
section applies only to actions brought solely in the public interest or on behalf of the general public.t he term public interest is used to define suits brought for the public good or on behalf of the public.club members,supra,cal th at.the term solely as used in section,subdivision b expressly conveys the legislative intent that section,subdivision b not apply to an action that seeks a more narrow advantage for a particular plaintiff.club members,supra,at.
to determine whether tourgeman lawsuit met those definitions,we rely on the allegations of the complaint because the public interest exception is a threshold issue based on the nature of the allegations and scope of relief sought in the prayer.strathmann,supra,th at club members,supra,cal th at if a complaint satisfies the provisions of the applicable exception,it may not be attacked under the statute italics added accord carpenters,supra,th at concluding action was brought solely in the public interest based on allegations of the complaint.
tourgeman putative class and representative action complaint contained a single claim under the ucl bus,et against respondents for violations of the fdcpa et tourgeman did not seek damages or restitution on behalf of himself or the class or the general public.rather,the sole remedy that tourgeman sought was injunctive relief directed at preventing respondents from engaging in unlawful,unfair,fraudulent debt collection practices in the future.in addition,as the trial court observed,it is unlikely tourgeman would have benefitted from the requested injunction,since it is doubtful that tourgeman will again be the subject of respondents debt collection efforts.in sum,tourgeman putative class and representative action was one seeking injunctive relief to benefit the general public in the future by ensuring that respondents comply with state and federal statutory law.
in light of the nature of tourgeman claim and the relief that he sought,we conclude that tourgeman action was brought solely in the public interest,subd.b see strathmann,supra,th at section,subdivision b was intended to exempt private attorney general actions from the statute carpenters,supra,th at concluding putative class action seeking enforcement of city prevailing wage policy was brought solely in public interest bell farmers ins.exchange th,by preventing a failure of justice in our judicial system citation,the class action not only benefits the individual litigant but serves the public interest in the enforcement of legal rights and statutory sanctions.
b.the trial court properly determined that tourgeman did not seek relief greater than or different from the relief sought for the general public 
respondents contend that the trial court erred in concluding that tourgeman did not seek relief greater than or different from the relief he sought for the general public.respondents do not dispute that tourgeman complaint did not seek any relief in this action different from that which he sought for the general public.rather,respondents contend that in his federal court lawsuit,tourgeman sought relief personal to himself,different from and far greater than the injunctive relief he sought on behalf of the class.italics added.however,the plain language of section,subdivision b states that the exception applies to any action as to which certain conditions exist.italics added.subdivisions b and c of section expressly state that they apply to the action,and the matter there is no language in any of the provisions of section that suggests that a court may consider relief sought by the plaintiff in other lawsuits between the parties in determining whether an action,subd.b is subject to the public interest exception.further,respondents fail to cite any authority,or to make any textual argument,in support of their contention that we may consider tourgeman federal action in considering whether this action is subject to the public interest exception.
accordingly,we conclude that tourgeman did not seek any relief greater than or different from the relief that he sought for the general public,subd.b.
tourgeman action,if successful,would enforce an important right affecting the public interest and would confer a significant benefit of the general public 
as noted above,tourgeman complaint alleged that respondents violated the fdcpa et,and in so doing committed an unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent business practice under business and professions code section.specifically,tourgeman claimed that respondents sent him collection letters and filed an action against him based on a false representation as to the identity of the creditor to whom he purportedly owed a debt.tourgeman brought his ucl claim on behalf of himself,members of the class and members of the general public,and sought an injunction requiring respondents to enact sufficient measures that will ensure they include the name of the correct original creditor on any collections letters they send out or in any lawsuits that they file in the future.
in enacting the fdcpa,congress stated that it had found abundant evidence of the use of abusive,deceptive,and unfair debt collection practices by many debt collectors.a.congress enacted the fdcpa in order to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors,to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged,and to promote consistent state action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.e.the fdcpa attempts to achieve this purpose through provisions regulating the practices of debt collectors.see et federal courts have concluded that a false representation as to a creditor name may constitute a violation of the fdcpa.see wallace washington mut.bank,cir,district courts have decided,and we agree,that a clearly false representation of the creditor name may constitute a false representation to collect or attempt to collect any debt under section.in his lawsuit,tourgeman seeks to enjoin respondents from continuing to violate a federal law enacted to protect the general public from abusive debt collection practices.we therefore conclude that tourgeman action,if successful,would enforce an important right affecting the public interest and would confer a significant benefit on the general public.
respondents arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.respondents do not dispute that the fdcpa provides important rights to the general public,or that tourgeman complaint sought to further the public policy goals of the fdcpa.rather,respondents contend,as they did in the trial court,that tourgeman failed to present evidence that his action,if successful,would benefit the public.specifically,respondents contend that tourgeman failed to present evidence of how many of respondents letters or lawsuits allegedly misidentified the original creditor or otherwise ran afoul of the law.italics added.
respondents suggestion,unsupported by any authority,that tourgeman was required to make an evidentiary showing in order to establish this prong of the public interest exception,is unpersuasive.whether tourgeman action would benefit the public is determined by examining his complaint to determine whether his lawsuit is of the kind that seeks to vindicate public policy goals.strathmann,supra,th at the public interest exception is a threshold issue based on the nature of the allegations and scope of relief sought in the prayer see,id.at concluding public benefit requirement of section,subdivision b met where qui tam action sought to further objectives of insurance frauds prevention act,et.carpenters,supra,th at concluding that action that sought to promote objectives of city prevailing wage policy met public benefit requirement of,subd.b.as we concluded above,tourgeman complaint is of the type that seeks to vindicate public policy goals embodied in federal statutory law.tourgeman was not required to present evidence demonstrating that his action would in fact serve these goals.
in a related argument,respondents contend that tourgeman failed to demonstrate that this action would benefit the public because a federal court rejected related claims on the merits.section,subdivision b states that a court is to assume that the challenged action will be successful in considering whether the action benefits the public.ibid.the action,if successful,would enforce an important right affecting the public interest,and would confer a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons italics added.the merits of tourgeman claim are thus irrelevant in determining whether the action meets the public benefit requirement of section,subdivision b.
private enforcement was necessary and placed a disproportionate financial burden on tourgeman in relation to his stake in the matter 
i.the necessity of private enforcement 
c ongress chose a private attorney general approach to assume enforcement of the fdcpa citation.heritage pacific financial,llc monroy th.our legislature also has authorized private attorney general actions with respect to the enforcement of the ucl bus,et.see coast plaza doctors hospital blue cross of california th,a claim for injunctive relief under business and professions code section et is brought by a plaintiff acting in the capacity as a private attorney general.thus,concluding that tourgeman action is within the ambit of the public interest exemption is fully consistent both with congress intent in enacting fdcpa and the legislature intent in enacting the ucl and section.see ingels,supra,th at the qualifying language would clearly encompass claims brought under the unfair competition law business and professions code section et,quoting the legislative history of.
it is undisputed that no public entity has sought to enforce the rights that tourgeman sought to vindicate in his lawsuit.under these circumstances,we conclude that private enforcement was necessary to enforce the right at issue in tourgeman action.see strathmann,supra,th at in this case,private enforcement is necessary because neither the attorney general nor the insurance commissioner has intervened to prosecute the action carpenters,supra,th at concluding private enforcement action is necessary b ecause the city of hercules has failed to take any action to enforce the city wage policy on the project.
respondents contend that the federal trade commission is authorized to enforce compliance with the fdcpa and that the consumer financial protection bureau is beginning to take an active role in fdcpa enforcement.however,as the cases cited above make clear,the possibility that a public entity might bring a lawsuit to vindicate certain rights does not demonstrate that a private plaintiff action to vindicate such rights was not necessary where,as here,the public entity has not filed such a lawsuit.see,strathmann,supra,th at carpenters,supra,th at.
ii.disproportionate financial burden 
in blanchard,supra,th at pages,in discussing the law to be applied in considering whether a plaintiff has demonstrated that private enforcement placed a disproportionate financial burden on the plaintiff in relation to the plaintiff stake in the matter,subd.b,the court of appeal stated the following 
it has been said about this element that the less direct or concrete a personal interest someone has,the more likely he or she will satisfy the element citation.courts first focus on what sort of financial stake the plaintiff had in the outcome citation,what the plaintiff hoped to gain financially from the litigation in comparison to what it cost.citation the relevant inquiry is whether the cost of the plaintiffs legal victory transcends their personal interest.citation.
in this case,as discussed above,tourgeman did not seek any financial benefit from the lawsuit,and,as the trial court noted,it is unlikely that tourgeman would have benefitted from any potential injunctive relief,since it is doubtful that he will again be the subject of respondents debt collection efforts.this fact,alone,supports the conclusion that the financial burden on tourgeman is disproportionate to his stake in the action.see carpenters,supra,th at concluding the financial burden on the plaintiffs is disproportionate to their stake in the action because plaintiffs bring the action to vindicate a public interest relating to enforcement of the prevailing wage policy but do not themselves belong to the class of nonunion workers compare with blanchard,supra,th at concluding plaintiffs were unable to demonstrate disproportionate financial burden element because plaintiffs seek an accounting to them and restitution to them of moneys they paid to directv.
further,tourgeman could reasonably have expected to incur significant litigation costs in attempting to prove that respondents violated the fdcpa and that injunctive relief was an appropriate remedy to deter future violations tourgeman also could reasonably have anticipated that he might be found liable for an adverse award of costs.see strathmann,supra,th at concluding that plaintiff may demonstrate that a lawsuit places a disproportionate burden on him because of the possibility that he may become subject to an attorney fees and costs award.
in arguing to the contrary,respondents again contend,without citation to authority,that tourgeman was required to make an evidentiary showing in order to establish this prong,arguing that tourgeman failed to submit any evidence of the financial burden this litigation would have imposed on him relative to his stake in the matter.italics added.we reject this argument.as discussed previously,the applicability of the public interest exception is determined by examining the complaint.see,strathmann,supra,th at.
respondents also argue,contrary to strathmann,supra,th,that a plaintiff potential liability for an award of attorney fees and costs is and should be irrelevant in determining whether an action places a disproportionate financial burden on a plaintiff.we agree with respondents that such risk will not necessarily establish that a plaintiff faced a disproportionate financial burden in litigating the matter.for example,in a case in which the plaintiff seeks to gain significant personal relief,the specter of such relief may outweigh the possibility of an adverse award of costs in determining whether the plaintiff faces a disproportionate financial burden.however,we disagree with respondents that the possibility of such an award is irrelevant to a determination of whether an action places a disproportionate financial burden on the plaintiff.where a plaintiff files a lawsuit in which he stands to gain little or no personal relief,the possibility of an adverse award of costs may outweigh the personal relief that the plaintiff seeks.see blanchard,supra,th at relevant inquiry in determining disproportionate financial burden is what the
