in early,ford and citibank issued a credit card that offered cardholders the opportunity to save on the purchase or lease of a new ford vehicle through a program.under the program cardholders earned a rebate on each purchase made using the credit card and could accrue a maximum of in rebates per year representing in purchases over a period,for a maximum possible rebate of,redeemable toward the purchase or lease of certain ford vehicles.on december,than five years after the program and citibank terminated the rebate accrual feature of the credit card.
six state actions were filed in washington,oregon,california,illinois,alabama,and new york,alleging generally that ford and citibank misrepresented or withheld information about the nature and duration of the rebate program and wrongfully discontinued it.ford and citibank removed each case to federal district court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction,then petitioned the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation panel to consolidate and transfer the cases to a single district court for proceedings,pursuant to.under,the panel is authorized to transfer civil actions pending in more than one district involving one or more common questions of fact to any district court for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings upon its determination that transfer will be for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and will promote the just and efficient conduct of such actions.fed.judicial,moore federal practice manual for complex civil litigation ed.
on january,and june,the panel transferred the six removed actions to the western district of washington for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.the transferee district court consolidated the cases on july,and a consolidated complaint was filed on august.purporting to sue on behalf of a nationwide class of six million cardholders,the consolidated plaintiffs alleged state law causes of action for breach of contract,unjust enrichment and consumer fraud,and plead diversity jurisdiction under a.the consolidated plaintiffs sought relief in the form of specific performance,disgorgement,and compensatory and punitive damages.
after transfer and consolidation,ford and citibank moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,and the district court denied the motion.the consolidated plaintiffs moved for class certification.however,after discovery was completed and the issue had been fully briefed by the parties,the district court deferred judgment on class certification and instead issued an order to show cause why the consolidated action should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction,and why the six underlying actions should not be remanded to state court.though neither party had challenged the district court jurisdiction at any point in the proceedings,the district judge properly raised sua sponte the issue of whether the consolidated complaint alleged more than in controversy under a.
ford and citibank filed a memorandum in support of jurisdiction,raising three reasons why the amount in controversy requirement was met the cost of compliance with the request for injunctive relief would exceed the consolidated plaintiffs have a common and undivided interest in their compensatory damages claim,which exceeds and the consolidated plaintiffs have a common and undivided interest in their punitive damages claim,which exceeds.
in an order dated october,the district court held that it lack ed subject matter jurisdiction over the consolidated complaint and the six removed cases.the district court dismissed the consolidated complaint for lack of jurisdiction and remanded the underlying actions to the several state courts of origin.
pursuant to the panel rules of procedure,see a,the district court sent a copy of the order to the panel on november.in the attached letter,the district judge explained 
t his order dismisses,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,a consolidated complaint filed by the plaintiffs in this court.the dismissal of the consolidated complaint necessitated a disposition of the six original actions filed in state court,removed to federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship,and transferred by the panel to the western district of washington for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,the order remands those cases to state court.
ford and citibank timely appealed,challenging both the district court dismissal of the consolidated complaint and its remand of the underlying actions.
we must first consider whether we have jurisdiction to review the district court order which states t he consolidated complaint is hereby dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.because the district court order dismissed the complaint rather than the action,the question arises whether the order is final and appealable.ordinarily an order dismissing a complaint but not dismissing the action is not appealable under section unless circumstances make it clear that the court concluded that the action could not be saved by any amendment of the complaint.hoohuli ariyoshi,cir.however,i f it appears that the district court intended the dismissal to dispose of the action,it may be considered final and appealable.id.emphasis added.
here,the record clearly indicates that the district court intended to dispose of the consolidated action.first,the dismissal did not grant leave to amend.see see also gerritsen de la madrid hurtado,cir failure to allow leave to amend supports an inference that the district court intended to make the order final.we are also aided by the district court contemporaneous letter to the panel which demonstrates a clear intention to terminate the case.the district court expressly sent the letter i n compliance with a,which provides that a ctions terminated in the transferee district court by valid judgment shall not be remanded by the panel and shall be dismissed by the transferee district court.the clerk of the transferee court shall send a copy of the order terminating the action to the clerk of the panel emphasis added.
although a specific dismissal of the action would have been preferable,we conclude in this case that we have jurisdiction to review the dismissal order under.
we review de novo a district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.brady united states,cir.the party asserting federal jurisdiction bears the burden of proving the case is properly in federal court.mcnutt general motors acceptance.here,diverse citizenship is uncontested.thus,the sole jurisdictional question is whether the minimum amount in controversy required to maintain a diversity suit in federal court is present.as the parties asserting diversity jurisdiction,ford and citibank bear the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the amount in controversy exceeds.see sanchez monumental life ins,cir.
on appeal,ford and citibank do not contend that any plaintiff has an individual damages claim exceeding.nor do they contend that the individual plaintiffs damages claims may be aggregated to satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirement.it is undisputed on appeal that the individual plaintiffs do not have a common and undivided interest in a claim for damages.
however,compensatory damages are not the only form of relief sought.the consolidated plaintiffs also seek injunctive relief,disgorgement,and punitive damages.ford and citibank contend that each of these claims provides the requisite jurisdictional amount.
ford and citibank first argue that their cost of compliance with the request for injunctive relief carries this case over the jurisdictional amount threshold.relying upon our decision in sanchez,at,they contend that the amount in controversy requirement is satisfied if either party can gain or lose the jurisdictional amount the either viewpoint rule.here,the consolidated plaintiffs seek specific performance of the rebate program,and ford and citibank submit that it will cost them more than to reinstate and administer the rebate accrual feature of the credit card.
under the either viewpoint rule,the test for determining the amount in controversy is the pecuniary result to either party which the judgment would directly produce.see ridder,blethen,cir holding that for purposes of calculating amount in controversy,t he value of the thing sought to be accomplished by the action may relate to either or any party to the action internal quotation omitted.in other words,where the value of a plaintiff potential recovery in this case,a maximum of is below the jurisdictional amount,but the potential cost to the defendant of complying with the injunction exceeds that amount,it is the latter that represents the amount in controversy for jurisdictional purposes.
in sanchez,we observed en banc that ridder rejected the rule,which states that courts attempting to determine the value of a claim for purposes of the amount in controversy requirement should look only to the benefit to the plaintiff,rather than to the potential loss to the defendant.at.ridder stated that in suits involving equitable relief,if the value of the thing to be accomplished is equal to the dollar minimum of the jurisdictional amount requirement to anyone concerned in the action,then jurisdiction is satisfied.at.we did not apply ridder in sanchez,however,because the party with the burden of proof failed to provide any evidence to determine the extent of the loss that it would incur by an injunction.
but ridder and sanchez are cases.here,there are multiple plaintiffs seeking to sue on behalf of a putative class of six million individuals.we have specifically declined to extend the either viewpoint rule to class action suits.see snow ford motor,cir.this limitation on the rule should apply regardless of whether the requested class has been certified.indeed,logic would dictate that it should apply to all complaints.while i t may seem paradoxical to decline jurisdiction in the multiplaintiff setting,where the potential loss to defendants typically is well beyond the jurisdictional amount threshold,it is implicit in the rule that forbids aggregation of class members separate claims that it will sometimes be more difficult for a party asserting federal jurisdiction to establish the minimum amount of controversy in a multiplaintiff case than in a much smaller case.in re brand name prescription drugs antitrust,cir.
in snow,we acknowledged the inherent conflict between the either viewpoint rule and the rule when calculating the amount in controversy in class action suits seeking equitable relief,and determined that the former must yield.snow,at.in light of the supreme court decisions in snyder harris,d and zahn international paper,d,prohibiting aggregation,we declined to apply ridder in a class action suit seeking damages and injunctive relief,stating that in class actions,the threshold question is aggregation,and it must be resolved affirmatively before total detriment to the defendant can be considered.id.at.otherwise,the principle of snyder and zahn would be subverted,plaintiffs with minimal damages could dodge the rule by praying for an injunction.see id.at.we recognized that t otal detriment is basically the same thing as aggregation,and held that where the equitable relief sought is but a means through which the individual claims may be satisfied,the ban on aggregation applies with equal force to the equitable as well as the monetary relief.id.at internal quotation omitted.
thus,under snow,the proper focus in multiple plaintiff cases is not influenced by the type of relief requested,but rather depend s upon the nature and value of the right asserted.id.put differently,w hatever the form of relief sought,each plaintiff claim must be held separate from each other plaintiff claim from both the plaintiff and the defendant standpoint.the defendant in such a case is deemed to face multiple claims for injunctive relief,each of which must be separately evaluated.brand name,at,citing snow,at.the question then becomes whether each plaintiff is asserting an individual right or,rather,together the plaintiffs unite to enforce a single title or right in which they have a common and undivided interest.snyder,at.if it is the latter,we may then look to the either viewpoint rule to determine jurisdiction.if it is the former,the test is the cost to the defendants of an injunction running in favor of one plaintiff.see brand name,at.
in an effort to carry this case across the amount in controversy threshold in the face of snow,ford and citibank first contend that the consolidated plaintiffs have a common and undivided interest in the injunctive relief they seek,and compliance will cost substantially more than.second,they aver that it will cost them more than to reinstate and administer the rebate accrual program whether it is done for one plaintiff or six million.thus,they allege that the either viewpoint rule may be applied in this case without running afoul of the principle of snyder and zahn.
turning to the first point,we are helped to understand the meaning of common and undivided interest by gilman bhc,cir,where the court explained that the paradigm cases allowing aggregation of claims are those which involve a single indivisible res,such as an estate,a piece of property the classic example,or an insurance policy.these are matters that can not be adjudicated without implicating the rights of everyone involved with the res.id.citation omitted.that does not fit the case before us in which the claims arising out of the termination of the rebate program do not implicate a single indivisible res,and could be adjudicated on an individual basis because the consolidated plaintiffs and putative class members have no common and undivided interest in accruing rebates under the program.each plaintiff charged purchases and accrued rebates individually,not as a group.thus,prior to litigation,they shared no common interest.as ford and citibank correctly stated in their memorandum opposing class certification,t his case,after all,does not involve a common fund or a joint interest among cardholders.instead,it involves a collection of individual claims based on individual patterns of consumer purchasing decisions.they concluded that b ecause the putative class members in this case do not in any sense possess joint ownership of,or an undivided interest in a common res,their claims are separate and distinct.id.at.
in spite of this earlier concession,ford and citibank now urge us to adopt loizon smh societe suisse de microelectronics,and hold that the putative class members have a common and undivided interest in the opportunity to accrue rebates because the injunctive relief the rebate accrual would benefit the putative class as a whole.there,plaintiffs sought injunctive relief,requiring the defendants to notify all putative class members of the potential dangers of wearing a line of watches manufactured by the defendants that contained a radioactive isotope.id.at.the court found that the injunctive relief benefit the class as a whole and,thus,held that the putative class members had a common and undivided interest because only the class,and not individual class members,could request the injunctive relief.id.at.
we are foreclosed from adopting loizon because our decision in snow tells us that the proper focus is not the type of relief requested,but rather the nature and value of the right asserted.at.here,the consolidated plaintiffs assert the right to accrue rebat
