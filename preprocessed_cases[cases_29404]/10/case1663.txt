appellants are managers managers employed by respondent,tuesday morning,tm.the managers filed a class action against tm,alleging that tm failed to pay overtime wages.the trial court denied certification.the supreme court subsequently issued an opinion addressing the standards for granting class certification.in light of the decision,the trial court reversed its position and granted the managers motion to certify the class.two years later,tm filed a motion to decertify the class.a different trial judge granted the motion on the ground that individual issues predominated over common issues,thus a class action was not the appropriate mechanism by which to litigate the managers claims.we affirm.

class certification 
the honorable frances rothschild denied certification of the managers as a class.the supreme court then issued drug stores,superior court cal th,d,and the managers filed a motion for reconsideration.the trial court reconsidered its decision in light of and granted the motion for class certification on january.it concluded that the common issues predominate and,at minimum,there are key issues which are susceptible of class treatment.consistent with the decision,the court stated,should it appear in the future that the action is no longer appropriate for class treatment,the court has authority to decertify the class.
motion for decertification 
the parties conducted extensive discovery.on december,tm filed a motion to decertify the class.the matter was assigned for all purposes to the honorable alice altoon.the motion was based on the declarations of five attorneys,three managers,the of store operations,and tm expert.the declaration of attorney robert dawson referenced the depositions of additional managers.
tm expert,david lewin,is a professor of management at ucla,who specializes in the area of human resource management and industrial relations.lewin declared that the managers perform primarily managerial work.he based his opinion on two videotapes taped june,and october,depicting the activities performed by two store managers during their shifts of seven and six hours,respectively.the stores were located in glendora and woodland hills.tm produced the videotapes converted to dvds,which were narrated by manager joseph chrisman.
lewin described in detail the activities he observed on the dvds.it was his opinion that the first manager spent percent of her time performing managerial work and percent performing nonmanagerial work.the second manager spent percent on managerial and percent on nonmanagerial work.lewin noted that,according to tm training materials,the managers are responsible for each store profit and loss and have an incentive plan.he declared this indicated that the managers are regarded as the general managers of their stores and part of tm corporate management.chrisman submitted a declaration stating that he had videotaped the two stores and photographed nine others to demonstrate that no two stores are alike.
the declaration of attorney danielle clarkson addressed seven factors demonstrating the differences among the stores.they included store size,configuration,sales volume,number of employees store number of other management personnel,management style and competence.store size affects the amount and value of merchandise,and management time is spent deciding how to fit merchandise within the store,and the optimum location for sales.it also has a bearing on truck deliveries,planning,budgeting and scheduling.
according to clarkson,other factors to be considered are the number of boxes delivered by truck on delivery days,which involve unloading and unpacking boxes and determining how merchandise should be displayed.stores differ in the amount of time each manager spends processing returns and exchanges.depending upon the store,managers have supervised between five and employees.clarkson alleged that the number of employees supervised directly affects managerial tasks,such as delegation,training,hiring,scheduling.
in,annual sales per store ranged from in santee,california,to in torrance,california.clarkson alleged that the larger stores do not necessarily generate a higher sales volume.the variety of locations of tm stores affects matters such as employee turnover and quality,customer type,customer preference and merchandising.each store is configured differently,affecting the amount of square footage available for selling and stocking.a store might be located within a shopping center or next to a warehouse.the stores are located in diverse communities,described variously as very wealthy,working class,and very suburban.a store located in a high crime area requires more employee training in loss prevention.all of the foregoing factors have a direct impact upon the time spent in managerial activities.
deborah darue slaver,a visual display manager,declared that managers attend training in the corporate office in dallas,texas,within days of their hire,and return once a year for additional training.the training material includes information on fixture plans,product categories,types of displays,merchandising standards,product knowledge,pricing,markdowns and returns and exchanges.tm encourages managers to use their own judgment and creativity.slaver estimated that managers use their individual judgment approximately percent of their time in merchandising and percent of their time following fixed corporate directives.because each tm store differs in size and configuration,each will reflect the individual personality of the manager.
attorney richard kobdish submitted a declaration including a statistical analysis of the declarations of managers concerning their time spent managing.they ranged from percent to percent.kobdish considered the deposition of five other managers,who estimated they spend percent to percent of their time managing.kobdish indicated that this was possible because many of the managers were constantly.he concluded that,although the managers managed their stores in unique ways and spent differing amounts of time managing,all spend over percent of their time engaged in managerial duties.
attorney andrea valdez submitted a declaration concerning weekly variances in managers duties.these included the number of sales associates present during different shifts the number of truck deliveries and sales and the resulting increased work.the workload increased when there were seasonal changes,such as christmas,and decreased when the store closed for inventory.after reopening,workload increased due to the number of returned items other factors included whether the manager had an assistant or regional manager who could help with management duties,or if the manager lacked management support,or spent extra time training a new manager.
manager lindsey duran declared that certain factors vary between managers,such as managerial style,competence and retail experience.this affects matters such as merchandising decisions,sales volume,customer service,employee training and delegation of tasks.some managers choose to perform tasks typically done by subordinates,while others choose solely to manage.other managers simultaneously perform hourly work as well as managing.
andy paris is the of store operations for tm.he enumerated various management activities and declared that tm expects the managers to perform these duties at least percent of the time.while managers learn general policies and procedures during training,due to the inherent differences between both stores and managers,these guidelines must be adapted by each indi
