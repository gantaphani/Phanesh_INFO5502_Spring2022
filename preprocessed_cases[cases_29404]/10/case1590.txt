in this wage and hour class action,the issue presented is whether california minimum wage law requires an employer that compensates its automotive service technicians on a basis for repair work must also pay those technicians a separate hourly minimum wage for time spent during their work shifts waiting for vehicles to repair or performing other tasks directed by the employer.the employer contends it was not required to pay the technicians a separate hourly minimum wage for such time because it ensured that a technician total compensation for a pay period never fell below what the employer refers to as the minimum wage floor the total number of hours the technician was at work during the pay period including hours spent waiting for repair work or performing tasks,multiplied by the applicable minimum wage rate.the employer did so by supplementing a technician pay,if necessary,to cover any shortfall between the technician wages and the minimum wage floor.
the trial court concluded that the employer method of compensation violated the minimum wage law because california law does not allow an employer to avoid paying its employees for all hours worked by averaging total compensation over total hours worked in a given pay period.the trial court cited armenta osmose,th armenta,as support for its ruling.
we too find the court reasoning in armenta to be persuasive.applying that reasoning here,we conclude that class members were entitled to separate hourly compensation for time spent waiting for repair work or performing other tasks directed by the employer during their work shifts,as well as penalties under labor code section,subdivision a.we therefore affirm the judgment.
background 
the parties 
defendant and appellant downtown la motors,lp doing business as downtown la motors mercedes benz is an automobile dealership that sells and services mercedes benz automobiles.defendant shammas automotive holdings,is its owner.those entities are referred to collectively as dtla.
plaintiffs are a class of automotive service technicians who worked for dtla between april and june.
dtla compensation system 
dtla compensates its service technicians on a basis,which differs from an hourly wage method in that technicians are paid primarily on the basis of repair tasks completed.under dtla system,technicians are paid a flat rate ranging from to,depending on the technician experience,for each flag hour a technician accrues.flag hours are assigned by mercedes benz to every task that a technician performs on a mercedes benz automobile and are intended to correspond to the actual amount of time a technician would need to perform the task.a dtla technician who completes a repair task accrues the number of flag hours that mercedes benz assigns to that task,regardless of how long the technician actually took to complete it.dtla technicians accrue flag hours only when working on a repair order.
dtla calculates its technicians pay for an hour pay period by multiplying flag hours accrued during that pay period by the technician applicable flat rate.for example,a technician with a flat rate of who accrued flag hours in a pay period would earn x or.
in addition to tracking a technician flag hours,dtla also keeps track of all the time a technician spends at the work site whether or not the technician is working on a repair order.at the end of each pay period,dtla calculates how much each technician would earn if paid an amount equal to his total recorded hours on the clock multiplied by the applicable minimum wage.dtla refers to this amount as the minimum wage floor.if a technician flat hour pay falls short of the minimum wage floor,dtla supplements the technician pay in the amount of the shortfall 
plaintiffs experience 
plaintiffs worked shifts.during their shifts,plaintiffs were required to remain at dtla place of business and had to obtain permission to leave during a shift if they were not working on a repair order.plaintiffs were also required to clock in when they arrived for work,clock in and out for lunch,and clock out at the end of their shift.
plaintiffs regularly did not have repair work to do because there were not enough vehicles to service.when this occurred,plaintiffs had to remain at work,and those who asked to leave early were told that they needed to stay because customers might come in.plaintiffs accrued no flag hours during time spent waiting for cars to repair.while waiting for repair work,plaintiffs were expected to perform various tasks,including obtaining parts,cleaning their work stations,attending meetings,traveling to other locations to pick up and return cars,reviewing service bulletins,and participating in training.they accrued no flag hours while performing these tasks.
the instant lawsuit 
plaintiffs filed the instant action against dtla claiming that dtla violated california law by failing to pay technicians a minimum wage during their waiting time periods of time they were on the clock,but waiting for repair orders or performing other tasks.plaintiffs also claimed that technicians terminated from employment during the class period were entitled to penalties under labor code section,subdivision a because dtla had failed to pay these technicians all the wages they were due upon their termination.
the trial court denied for summary adjudication filed by the parties as to whether dtla technicians were entitled to a separate hourly pay for waiting time in addition to their flag hour pay and minimum wage floor supplement,and the matter proceeded to a bench trial.
the parties presented documentary evidence as well as testimony by class members and expert witnesses regarding the amount of waiting time experienced by class members.both parties also presented expert testimony as to the amount per pay period that class members either were or were not underpaid.
the trial court issued a proposed statement of decision,to which dtla objected.after hearing argument on those objections,the trial court issued a final statement of decision on june.
the trial court ruled in favor of plaintiffs,concluding that california law requires class members to be paid for their waiting time between work on repair orders.the trial court found the testimony of plaintiffs expert to be credible,and adopted that expert conclusions that plaintiffs experienced waiting time of hours per day on average,that the average amount of unpaid compensation for waiting time per plaintiff was per day,and that in total,plaintiffs lost the amount of in uncompensated time during the class period.the trial court determined that the value of the class waiting time,including interest,was and awarded that sum to plaintiffs.the trial court also awarded plaintiffs penalties in the amount of under labor code section,subdivision a for dtla willful failure to pay all wages owed them at the time their employment was terminated.
this appeal followed.

ii.wage order 
the wage order at issue in this case is wage order commonly known as wage order.subdivision b of that wage order provides as follows every employer shall pay to each employee,on the established payday for the period involved,not less than the applicable minimum wage for all hours worked in the payroll period,whether the remuneration is measured by time,piece,commission,or otherwise,tit,subd.b.
hours worked is defined in subdivision k of the wage order as the time during which an employee is subject to the control of an employer,and includes all the time the employee is suffered or permitted to work,whether or not required to do so,tit,subd.k.
iii.the parties contentions 
dtla contends its method of compensating technicians complies with the plain language of wage order because technicians are paid an amount not less than the amount they would have earned had they been paid the applicable hourly minimum wage for all hours worked during a given pay period.dtla argues that compliance may be achieved by supplementing a technician wages in an amount necessary to cover any shortfall between those wages and the minimum wage floor,or the amount the technician would have earned if paid an hourly minimum wage for all hours on the clock,including waiting time,during a pay period.
plaintiffs and amicus california employment lawyers association argue that the plain meaning of the term all hours worked is each and every hour worked and that technicians should have been separately compensated,at the applicable minimum wage rate,for each and every hour of time spent waiting for repair work.the trial court agreed with plaintiffs and cited armenta as support for that interpretation.
dtla argues that the trial court interpretation contravenes the plain language of the wage order,which does not distinguish between waiting time and productive time and does not require an employee paid on a basis to be compensated separately for waiting time.dtla and its amici contend that such interpretation undermines the compensation system,which is intended to reward technicians for performing repair tasks efficiently.dtla and its amici further contend armenta does not and should not apply to compensation systems such as the one at issue here and that the trial court erred by awarding plaintiffs penalties under labor code section.
iv.armenta 
in armenta,division six of the court of appeal,second appellate district construed the same language in the same wage order that is at issue here and concluded that it expresses the intent to ensure that employees be compensated at the minimum wage for each hour worked.armenta,supra,th at,italics added.the court in armenta further concluded that the employer method of averaging employees hours worked in a given pay period in order to compute its minimum wage obligations violated the minimum wage law.
the plaintiffs in armenta were employed by a company that maintained utility poles in rural or remote locations.the company provided the employees with a truck that carried the tools and equipment needed to perform the work in the field,and employees were required to travel in the truck from a central meeting place to the various job sites.armenta,supra,th at.employees time was considered productive if directly related to maintaining utility poles in the field and nonproductive if spent performing other tasks such as traveling to and from a job site,loading or maintaining vehicles,and attending safety meetings.ibid.employees were only paid for productive time.
the employer argued that its compensation system did not violate state minimum wage laws because under the terms of the employees collective bargaining agreement,it paid hourly wages substantially higher than the applicable minimum wage and total employee compensation exceeded the product of total hours worked both paid and unpaid and the minimum wage,resulting in an average hourly rate that was higher than the applicable minimum wage.armenta,supra,th at.the court in armenta ruled that the employer had violated the minimum wage law by not compensating employees for travel time and for time spent on daily paperwork.id.at.
as support for its ruling,the armenta court cited a january,opinion letter issued by the division of labor standards enforcement dlse as persuasive reasoning why,under california law,the employees were entitled to compensation for all hours worked.armenta,supra,th at.in the opinion letter,the dlse acknowledged that the minimum wage law is susceptible to two divergent interpretations,as espoused by the parties in armenta and by the respective parties in the instant case that the obligation to pay minimum wages attaches to each and every separate hour worked during the payroll period,and that payment must be made for all such hours on the established payday,or that the obligation to pay minimum wages for the total number of hours worked in the pay period is determined backwards from the date that any payment is due,without considering any hour or part of any hour in isolation.ibid.the dlse endorsed the former interpretation,requiring payment of the minimum wage for each and every separate hour worked.ibid.the dlse noted that although federal courts had consistently applied the latter interpretation,significant differences between federal and california labor laws required a different approach in california.ibid.
the court in armenta agreed with the dlse,and distinguished federal case authority applying an averaging formula to assess minimum wage violations.among the cases distinguished was a california federal district court decision,medrano.d medrano,in which agricultural workers who were compensated on a basis brought a class action against their employer seeking recovery of minimum wages due for travel time to the fields.the federal district court in medrano held that the employer complied with the minimum wage requirements so long as a worker was paid no less than the sum the worker would have been paid during the pay period had the employer paid the minimum wage multiplied by total hours worked,including waiting and travel time.armenta,supra,th at.the court in armenta found federal authorities such as medrano to be of little assistance in construing california laws and regulations that differed substantially in both language and intent from federal minimum wage laws.armenta,at.the armenta court then undertook a comprehensive analysis of wage order and concluded that t he averaging method utilized by the federal courts for assessing a violation of the federal minimum wage law does not apply here.ibid.
the armenta court focused first on the language of the wage order,noting that it differ ed significantly from the federal labor standards act.armenta,supra,th at.for example,subdivision b of wage order requires payment of the minimum wage for all hours worked whereas the federal statute requires payment of minimum wage to employees who in any work week are engaged in commerce.armenta,at,italics added.the federal language referring to payment in any work week,the armenta court reasoned,allows an employer to average an employee total pay over an entire work week.in contrast,the california wage order emphasis on hours worked reflected the intent to ensure that employees be compensated at the minimum wage for each hour worked,italics added.
after parsing through the regulatory language,the armenta court next considered the wage order in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.the court noted that labor code sections,and require an employer to pay all employee hours at either the statutory or agreed rate and prohibit an employer from using any part of that rate as a credit against its minimum wage obligation armenta,supra,th at.the court concluded that allowing the employer to average its employees compensation over their total hours worked contravenes these code sections by effectively reducing the employees contractual rate of compensation.ibid.
the court then compared california minimum wage rate with the federal rate and found california law to be more protective of minimum wage employees.on that basis,the court found a clear legislative intent to protect the minimum wage rights of california employees to a greater extent than federally.armenta,supra,th at.
finally,the court in armenta considered the policies underlying california minimum wage law and regulations which reflect a strong public policy in favor of full payment of wages for all hours worked.armenta,supra,th at.given that public policy,the court concluded that a method of averaging all hours worked in any work week to compute an employer minimum wage obligation under california law is inappropriate.ibid.the court in armenta held that use of such an averaging method to determine an employer minimum wage obligation violates california law and that t he minimum wage standard applies to each hour worked by the employees for which they were not paid.ibid.
armenta applicability to the instant case 
a.the plain language of wage order covers compensation 
the court in armenta construed wage order to preclude an employer from averaging an employee compensation over the total number of hours worked to determine compliance with minimum wage obligations.the principal argument advanced by dtla and its amici is that armenta concerned only hourly employees and the armenta court construction of wage order should not be applied to workers who are compensated on a basis.but this argument requires a construction that is contrary to the plain language of the wage order.
by its terms,wage order does not allow any variance in its application based on the manner of compensation.subdivision of the wage order states that subject to exceptions that are not applicable here this order shall apply to all persons employed in professional,technical,clerical,mechanical,and similar occupations whether paid on a time,piece rate,commission,or other basis,tit,subd,italics added.subdivision b similarly requires uniform application of the minimum wage requirements regardless of how an employee is paid every employer shall pay to each employee,on the established payday for the period involved,not less than the applicable minimum wage for all hours worked in the payroll period,whether the remuneration is measured by time,piece,commission,or otherwise,tit,subd.b,italics added.that dtla compensated its technicians on a basis is not a valid ground for varying either the application or interpretation of the wage order.
federal courts have applied armenta to workers 
dtla attempt to limit armenta to hourly workers has been rejected by federal district courts applying california minimum wage law.see,cardenas mclane foodservices,d cardenas carillo schneider logistics,d.of these federal cases,cardenas is instructive as it involved truck drivers who were paid on a basis and who claimed their employer failed to compensate them for time spent each day waiting for customers and performing pre and duties such as conducting vehicle inspections and safety checks and picking up keys and manifests.cardenas,supra,d at.the employer argued that it paid the truck drivers substantially more than the minimum wage for all their working hours and that armenta should not apply because that case did not involve a compensation system.the cardenas court rejected this distinction,stating though armenta did not involve a formula,and involved an employer who violated an explicit agreement,those distinctions do not detract from the decision holding that t he averaging method used by the federal courts for assessing a violation of minimum wage law does not apply to california claims.cardenas,supra,at.the cardenas court then held that a formula that does not compensate directly for all time worked does not comply with california labor codes,even if,averaged out,it would pay at least minimum wage for all hours worked.ibid.
like the court in cardenas,we find the court reasoning in armenta to be equally applicable to employees compensated on a basis.
aleman does not compel a different result 
dtla contends that our decision in aleman supports its position that an employer may satisfy its minimum wage obligations by ensuring that an employee overall wages reach a certain threshold amount.aleman is inapposite.that case concerned split shift workers and the subdivision of wage order applicable to such workers subdivision c,rather than b,the subdivision applicable here.our decision in aleman did not address the armenta court interpretation of subdivision b of the wage order,nor did it validate the interpretation advanced by dtla.
d.the absence of a collective bargaining agreement is not a valid basis for distinguishing armenta 
dtla argues that the armenta court interpretation of wage order should not apply here because the court reasoning was premised in part on labor code sections,and,which are inapposite to the instant facts.those statutory provisions do not apply,dtla maintains,because it did not collect or receive any previously paid wages from its employees,it does not have a collective bargaining agreement or any other agreement setting a wage rate higher than the minimum hourly wage,and it did not secretly pay a lower amount than promised to its technicians.
labor code sections,and govern an employer obligation to pay wages,a term that is defined to include compensation as well as hourly pay averaging wages over total hours worked results in underpayment of employee wages required by contract under labor code section,as well as an improper collection of wages paid to an employee under labor code section,as illustrated by the following example a technician who works four hours in a day at a rate of per hour and who leaves the job site when that work is finished has earned for four hours of work.a second technician who works the same hours at the same rate but who remains at the job site for an additional four hours waiting for customers also earns for the day however,averaging his wages over the work day results in an average pay rate of per hour,a percent discount from his promised per hour.the second technician forfeits to the employer the pay promised by statute under labor section because if his pay is allocated only to hours,he is not paid at all for his nonproductive hours.
the dlse applied this same analysis in the january,opinion letter that the court in armenta found persuasive 
a ll hours for which the employees are entitled to an amount equal or greater than the minimum wage pursuant to the provisions of the cba collective bargaining agreement or other contract must be compensated precisely in accordance with the provisions of the cba or contract and all other hours or parts of hours which the cba or contract explicitly states will be paid at less than the minimum age,but which constituted hours worked under state law,must be compensated at the minimum wage.averaging of all wages paid under a cba or other contract,within a particular pay period,in order to determine whether the employer complied with its minimum wage obligations is not permitted under these circumstance
