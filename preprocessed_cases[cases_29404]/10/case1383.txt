this appeal concerns whether the district court abused its discretion when it denied a motion to certify a class action for employees of mohawk industries who complain that mohawk engaged in racketeering activity by hiring illegal aliens and depressing the employees wages.this appeal is the third time that our court has considered issues in this litigation.williams mohawk,mohawk i,cir per curiam williams mohawk,mohawk ii,cir per curiam.we conclude that the district court abused its discretion when it denied the employees motion for class certification.the district court erred when it ruled that the employees complaint fails to present issues of law or fact common to the class.a,and when it ruled that the claims of the proposed representatives are not typical of the claims of the absent class members,id.a.those errors also led the district court to misapply the standard for determining whether the employees may maintain a class action for compensatory relief,id.b,and a hybrid class for injunctive relief,id.b.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
background 
our discussion of the background is divided in two parts.first,we discuss the course of the litigation before the employees moved to certify a class action.second,we discuss the employees motion for class certification and the denial of that motion by the district court.
a.the course of the litigation 
on january,current and former employees of mohawk who worked for hourly wages at various facilities in northern georgia filed a complaint that mohawk engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity prohibited by the racketeer influence and corrupt organizations act,c,by hiring and harboring illegal aliens in violation of the immigration and nationality act,a a iii,a a iv,a a.the employees alleged that mohawk formed an enterprise with various temporary employment agencies to hire illegal aliens and depress wages.the employees alleged that they were harmed by the racketeering activity of mohawk because their wages were depressed.the employees also alleged that mohawk violated the georgia statute that prohibits racketeering activity,ann.a,c,by committing various predicate acts involving fraud and misuse of visas,a,b,and that mohawk was unjustly enriched by its criminal activities under the law of georgia.
mohawk moved to dismiss the employees complaint for failure to state a claim.b.the district court granted the motion as to one claim of unjust enrichment based on the alien workers hesitation to bring worker compensation claims,but denied the motion as to all other claims.at the request of mohawk,the district court certified the order for an interlocutory appeal.we affirmed the decision of the district court that the employees stated claims under the federal and georgia rico statutes,but we reversed the decision that the employees stated a separate claim for unjust enrichment about wages.mohawk i,at.
mohawk petitioned the supreme court for a writ of certiorari and raised two questions for review whether a defendant corporation and its agents may constitute an enterprise under rico and whether the employees had stated a claim that the alleged practices of mohawk proximately caused injuries to business property in the form of depressed wages.the supreme court granted certiorari as to the first question,but then dismissed the petition as improvidently granted and remanded to our court for further consideration in the light of anza ideal steel supply corporation,d.mohawk,williams,d.we again concluded that the claims of unjust enrichment failed and that the employees stated claims of racketeering under state and federal statutes,and we remanded to the district court for further proceedings.mohawk ii,at.
b.the class certification decision 
after discovery commenced,the employees moved to certify the following class of lawful employees of mohawk in north georgia 
all persons legally authorized to be employed in the united states who are or have been employed in hourly positions by mohawk industries,its subsidiaries or affiliates in georgia at any time from january,to the present,other than excluded employees.
excluded employees are employees whose employment at mohawk has been limited to,unilin,or any mohawk facility or facilities in milledgeville,dublin,tifton,norcross,kennesaw or atlanta,georgia.
the employees sought certification of one of their claims under georgia law.ann.a,for injunctive relief under federal rule of civil procedure b,and sought certification of all of their claims under rule b.
the employees alleged several common questions when they sought certification,including whether mohawk conducted or participated,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of an enterprise affairs,whether mohawk engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity,and whether mohawk engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity or a conspiracy to violate a of the georgia rico statute.mohawk argued that its hiring and practices were decentralized and differed significantly over time,that there was no evidence of a single enterprise or conspiracy,and that proof of injury was not possible.the employees responded that mohawk decentralization mantra was irrelevant to the commonality analysis because the employees had alleged common questions for which they would present common proof.
the employees also argued that the claims of the named plaintiffs were typical the named plaintiffs claims and the claims of the class members arise out of the same course of conduct the operation and management of an enterprise through which mohawk hires and harbors illegal workers and the same legal theory that this unlawful conduct depresses wages.mohawk responded that the claims of plaintiffs jones and pelfrey were not typical because jones never worked at a mohawk location that used temporary labor and pelfrey was a former employee.the employees responded that jones claim was typical because her allegation,like the allegation of the class,was that the illegal hiring by mohawk depressed all the wages of legal employees,regardless of location.
the employees also argued that the scheme by mohawk to hire and harbor illegal workers satisfied the requirement that a defendant has acted on grounds that apply generally to the class.b.mohawk argued against certification under subsection b on the ground that the damages sought by the employees were not incidental to their claim for equitable relief.the employees responded that they were seeking certification of a hybrid class for only injunctive relief under subsections b and c,and that class would be separate from the class for which they were seeking monetary damages under subsection b.
the employees argued that the common issues whether mohawk conducted the affairs of an enterprise,engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity,and participated in a conspiracy,and whether and to what extent the class suffered injury predominated because those issues would have to be resolved in every class member individual action.mohawk argued that hiring and differed across the class,there was no evidence of a single enterprise or conspiracy,there was no common method of proving injury or damages,and defenses based on statutes of limitation would require individual determinations.the employees responded that any hiring and wage discretion did not negate the existence of common questions,arguments about the existence of an enterprise and damages were premature arguments about the merits of their complaint,and the employees sought only damages incurred during the limitations period.
the district court denied class certification.the district court determined that the employees satisfied the requirements of numerosity.a,and adequacy of representation,id.a,but that the employees did not satisfy the requirements of commonality,id.a,and typicality,id.a.the district court agreed with mohawk that the employees had not satisfied the commonality requirement because c ontrary to plaintiffs arguments that defendant engaged in one grand conspiracy to employ illegal workers,the evidence in the record indicates that defendant operations,including its use of temporary employment agencies and practices,are extremely decentralized.the district court also agreed with mohawk that neither of the proposed class representatives presented claims typical of the class because jones never worked at a mohawk facility that used temporary labor and because both jones and pelfrey worked at only a handful of mohawk facilities.
the district court agreed with mohawk that a class could not be certified under subsection b.the district court concluded that the employees demand for monetary damages was not incidental to their demand for injunctive relief.the district court also declined to certify a hybrid class for both monetary and injunctive relief on the ground that having one jury resolve all of the many individual and issues relating to plaintiff claims before the court issued a ruling as to equitable remedies would be overly cumbersome,confusing,and highly inefficient.
the district court refused to certify a class under rule b on the grounds that common issues did not predominate and the class action would not be superior to other available methods of relief.the district court again relied on the corporate structure of mohawk when it determined that class litigation would present an unmanageable number of individual legal and factual issues because the evidence in the record fails to support a determination that defendant engaged in a relationship with the various temporary employment agencies at a level.the district court determined that the first three factors in the superiority analysis weighed in favor of the employees,but the district court determined that the manageability factor tips the scales in favor of concluding that plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the superiority requirement because a s previously noted,resolution of the issues involved in this case will,by necessity,break down into an unmanageable number of individual legal and factual issues.
the district court did not evaluate the employees expert testimony.the district court concluded that arguments by mohawk attacking the experts were essentially evidentiary challenges or challenges to the merits of the opinions offered by plaintiffs experts.the district court determined that the expert evidence presented by plaintiffs is sufficiently probative to be useful to the court in determining whether plaintiffs have satisfied the requirements for class certification.
ii.standard of review 
we review a denial of class certification for an abuse of discretion.heffner blue cross blue shield of,cir.a n abuse of discretion occurs if the judge fails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making the determination,or makes findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.birmingham steel tva,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
iii.discussion 
our discussion is divided in four parts.first,we address the employees argument that the district court abused its discretion when it determined that the employees did not present a question of law or fact that was common to all members of the class under rule a.second,we address the employees argument that the district court abused its discretion when it determined that the claims of the proposed class representatives were not typical of the claims of the class under rule a.third,we address the employees argument that the district court abused its discretion when it determined that the questions of law or fact common to all class members do not predominate over any questions affecting individual members and that a class action is not superior under rule b.fourth,we address the employees argument that the district court abused its discretion when it declined to certify a hybrid class for injunctive relief under rule b and c.
a.the district court abused its discretion when it determined that the employees failed to present questions of law or fact common to all members of the class.
a class may be certified only if there are questions of law or fact common to the class.a.under the rule a commonality requirement,a class action must involve issues that are susceptible to proof.murray auslander,cir.commonality requires that there be at least one issue whose resolution will affect all or a significant number of the putative class members.stewart winter,cir footnote omitted.
the employees presented two overarching questions that are common to all members of the class whether mohawk conducted or participated,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of an enterprise affairs under the federal rico statute and whether mohawk engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity or a conspiracy to violate a of the georgia rico statute.under section c of the federal rico statute,the employees must satisfy four elements of proof conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.mohawk i,at quoting jones childers,cir internal quotation marks omitted.as to elements one and two,all the employees must prove that mohawk participate d in the operation or management of the enterprise,reves ernst young,d.as to elements three and four,all the employees must prove that mohawk engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity by hiring and harboring illegal aliens.the law of georgia makes it unlawful for any person,through a pattern of racketeering activity or proceeds derived therefrom,to acquire or maintain,directly or indirectly,any interest in or control of any enterprise,real property,or personal property of any nature,including money.ann.a.the georgia rico statute does not require proof of an enterprise,but it requires proof that the defendant committed predicate offenses at least twice.mohawk i,at quoting cobb county jones group.all the employees allege and must prove under georgia law that mohawk violated federal criminal prohibitions of fraud and misuse of visas,which is a predicate offense under the law of georgia.ann.these are all common questions because each employee would have to prove these elements of their claims of racketeering activity under federal and state law to establish the liability of mohawk.
we agree with the employees that the district court erred when it relied on our precedents about the certification of a class action for a complaint of employment discrimination under title vii of the civil rights act of.in klay humana,cir,we explained that claims under rico,in contrast with claims under title vii,are often susceptible to common proof 
rico claims are not simply individual allegations of underpayments lumped together,and the allegation of an official corporate policy or conspiracy is not simply a piece of circumstantial evidence being used to support such individual underpayment claims.instead,the very gravamen of the rico claims is the pattern of racketeering activities and the existence of a national conspiracy these are not facts from which jurors will be asked to infer the commission of wrongful acts against individual plaintiffs these very facts constitute essential elements of each plaintiff rico claims.
the district court relied on the decentralized decisions of mohawk about hiring and wages to conclude that the employees complaint does not present questions common to the class,but the employees complaint is not dependent on proof of individual acts of disparate treatment as often is the case under title vii.
we agree with the employees that their complaint raises questions that are common to all members of the class.these common questions are sufficient to satisfy the low hurdle of rule a.whether mohawk conducted the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity that depressed the wages of all employees is a question common to each employee complaint.the district court abused its discretion when it ruled that the employees complaint did not present questions of law or fact common to the proposed class.
b.the district court abused its discretion when it determined that the named plaintiffs did not present claims that were typical of the class.
a class may be certified only if the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.a.the claim of a class representative is typical if the claims or defenses of the class and the class represent
