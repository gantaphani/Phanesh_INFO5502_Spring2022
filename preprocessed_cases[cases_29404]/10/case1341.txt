this interlocutory appeal asks us to determine whether the class action tolling doctrine,originally announced by the supreme court in american pipe construction utah,d,applies when an individual member of a putative class pursues an independent,individual claim before the district court has decided the class certification issue but after a statute of limitations would have run.the district court certified this question,in part,because it involves a legal question about which there is substantial ground for differences of opinion,and so it does the four circuits that have offered opinions on the issue have split evenly.
leslie boellstorff boellstorff initiated an individual action against state farm mutual automobile insurance company state farm over four years after she suffered injuries in a car accident.boellstorff alleged various violations of the colorado auto accident reparations act caara or no fault act.stat repealed effective july,state farm moved for summary judgment,arguing that boellstorff claims were untimely in light of the applicable statute of limitations.boellstorff countered that her claims were in fact timely,and,alternatively,that a putative class action brought against state farm even before her accident captioned clark state farm mutual auto insurance company clark class action,but alleging the same conduct about which boellstorff the statute of limitations under american pipe.state farm responded to this latter argument by asserting that boellstorff forfeited any benefit offered by the american pipe doctrine when she pursued her individual claim prior to the district court class certification decision in clark.
the district court concluded that boellstorff claims were stale,but were saved nonetheless by the american pipe tolling doctrine.the court then certified the american pipe question to us.because we believe that the colorado supreme court would agree with the district court conclusion,we affirm the district court order denying state farm summary judgement 
background 
on september,boellstorff sustained serious injuries in a car accident while driving her brian ford explorer.brian boellstorff had procured a colorado automobile insurance policy from state farm in may at that time,he selected the minimal level of personal injury protection pip benefits.the parties do not dispute that boellstorff was covered by brian state farm automobile insurance policy at the time of her accident.
within a week after the accident,state farm sent boellstorff a letter setting forth the pip benefits to which she was entitled.this letter listed the minimum pip benefits selected by brian when he purchased the state farm policy the letter did not discuss the option of procuring enhanced pip benefits.a few months later,boellstorff retained the law firm of abadie zimsky to represent her in a suit against another driver involved in her accident 
colorado automobile insurance statutory scheme 
in,colorado legislature enacted the no fault act with the stated goal of avoid ing inadequate compensation to victims of automobile accidents.the act provided that all colorado automobile liability policies must include minimum pip benefits.see.more to the point,the no fault act mandated that insurers offer to their policyholders the option of purchasing enhanced pip benefits.id.while the minimum pip benefits include time and dollar,enhanced pip benefits do not see clark state farm mut.auto.ins.clark i,cir noting that enhanced pip benefits do not place time or dollar limitations on medical expense claims and offer the possibility of greater wage loss reimbursements.pip benefits were payable to four classes of individuals the person named as the insured in the policy household relatives of the named insured permissive occupants of the insured vehicle and pedestrians injured in an accident involving the insured vehicle.id.
the colorado courts eventually clarified the scope of the no fault act mandate in a series of decisions,including brennan farmers alliance mutual insurance.there,the colorado court of appeals held that colorado insurers were obligated to offer enhanced pip coverage to people in all four of the categories,not just to the named insured.id.at.these decisions triggered a slew of litigation many policyholders who had not been offered enhanced individuals in the other three suit under the no fault act seeking reformation of their policies to provide benefits without the minimum pip time and dollar.see,clark state farm mut.auto.ins.clark ii,cir 
b.the clark class action 
in august,ricky clark filed a putative class action against state farm in colorado state court.clark,a pedestrian who was struck and injured by a vehicle insured by state farm,alleged that state farm had routinely failed to offer or pay enhanced pip benefits as required by the no fault act and by brennan.see clark i,at.
clark filed suit on behalf of himself and a ll injured persons covered under a state farm automobile insurance policy who were not offered extended coverage as required by of the colorado auto accident reparations act,and who were not provided the additional benefits provided for therein.the parties do not dispute that clark original class definition included boellstorff state farm removed clark suit to federal court on september,predicating federal jurisdiction on the parties diversity.see clark class action,dkt.the clark case then oscillated between the district court for the district of colorado and the tenth circuit through,resulting in two published opinions from this court.see clark i,clark ii.clark finally filed a motion for class certification on may.clark class action,dkt.the district court denied the motion for class certification on september,approximately a week before state farm filed its reply brief in this appeal.see id.dkt.at.
boellstorff individual action 
boellstorff brought this individual action against state farm on october,alleging violations of the no fault act that mirrored those alleged in clark complaint.as had clark,she sought reformation of the insurance policy to include enhanced pip benefits,and damages for alleged breach of contract,willful and wanton breach of contract,and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
because boellstorff filed suit over four years after her accident,state farm moved to dismiss the case as untimely under the no fault act statute of limitations.see nelson state farm mut.auto.ins,cir w hen an action for benefits is brought under caara,it is subject to caara statute of limitations.the district court converted the motion to dismiss into a rule motion for summary judgment and both parties filed supplementary materials.state farm maintained that boellstorff cause of action accrued when she received the letter listing her pip benefits or,alternatively,when she first retained counsel.boellstorff countered that her claims were in fact timely.she also asserted that the class action tolling doctrine initially announced in american pipe saved her claims because the clark action tolled the statute of limitations.
in an order dated september,the district court found that boellstorff cause of action accrued on september,the date on which state farm sent her the letter informing her of the pip benefits to which she was entitled.as such,the no fault act limitations period had expired by the time boellstorff commenced her individual action.having held boellstorff claims untimely,the court continued on and concluded that american pipe tolling protected her claims because of the pendency of the clark action,which was filed before her claims accrued and remained pending at the time boellstorff filed the instant,individual action.the court rejected state farm argument that boellstorff had forfeited the benefits of the class action tolling doctrine by filing her individual action before the clark court decided whether to certify a class.
state farm quickly moved the court to certify the issue for appellate review pursuant to b the district court accepted this invitation,and,on february,amended its september order to certify for review this question whether the opportunity to invoke the class action toll of american pipe is lost by a putative class member who commences an individual action prior to a decision as to class certification we granted state farm petition for permission to appeal on may.hence,we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to b we answer the certified question in the negative.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
on interlocutory appeal,as always,we review de novo the denial of a motion for summary judgment,applying the same standard as the district court pursuant to rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.chessin keystone resort,cir see also qwest v.at t,cir.we are governed by this standard even when we sit in diversity.see morris travelers indem.of,cir.
applicable law 
as this is a diversity action,we must apply colorado law in deciding whether boellstorff claims are.burnham humphrey hospitality reit trust,cir a federal court sitting in diversity applies state law for statute of limitations purposes.additionally,we must follow colorado tolling rules,as they are an integral part of the several policies served by the statute of limitations.cook searle,cir quoting walker armco steel,d.in so doing,we apply the most recent statement of state law by the colorado supreme court.clark ii,at.absent such guidance,we consider decisions of a state intermediate appellate courts as some evidence of how the state supreme court would decide the issue,though such decisions are only persuasive authority.id.quotation omitted.
colorado rule is virtually identical to the federal rule,and so colorado courts rely on cases applying the federal rule.goebel.dep t of,see also rosenthal dean witter reynolds,aff in part,rev in part.colorado has adopted american pipe class action tolling doctrine.see kuhn.dep t of,affirming,without comment on american pipe,a trial court order asserting that t he filing of a class action lawsuit tolls the limitations period as to all putative class members,even before the certification of the class rosenthal,at the statute of limitations remains tolled for all members of the putative class until class certification is denied.levine empire sav.loan ass n.but neither the colorado supreme court nor any colorado appellate court has spoken to the instant issue.with this in mind,we will consult colorado cases in the first instance,but will also rely on federal cases interpreting american pipe.
the controlling issue certified by the district court is whether boellstorff,who was unequivocally a member of the putative clark class,may avail herself of the american pipe tolling doctrine to save her otherwise claim even though she filed her claim before the clark court decided the class certification question.we anticipate that the colorado supreme court would,as do we,find persuasive the reasoning of in re worldcom securities litigation,cir.we therefore hold that colorado would apply the american pipe doctrine to toll the statute of limitations for individual claims filed before the class certification decision.
american pipe and its progeny 
the american pipe court held that parties are entitled to intervene in an action after the denial of class certification even though the statute of limitations had expired as to the parties seeking to intervene.see american pipe,at.the commencement of the original class suit tolls the running of the statute of limitations for all purported members of the class until after the denial of the class certification motion id.at,or until they chose not to continue as a class member,id.at.at that juncture,the statute of limitations begins running again.id.
conceptually,american pipe incarnates the principle that the class action is a representative creature.see id.at.that is,members of a putative class are treated as if they were parties to the action itself until and unless they received notice thereof and chose not continue.id.at.thus,the filing of a class action,in a classic legal fiction,causes the courts to treat members of the asserted class as if they hav e instituted their own actions,at least so long as they continue to be members of the class and they have the benefit of tolling for as long as the class action purports to assert their claims.in re worldcom,at see also american pipe,at.t he filing of a timely class action complaint commences the action for all members of the class as subsequently determined.relying on the representativeness of class actions,the american pipe court concluded that no different a standard should apply to those members of the class who did not rely upon the commencement of the class action or who were even unaware that such a suit existed american pipe,at.see also id.at.
pragmatically,the court also concluded that a tolling rule was necessary to advance the goals of rule,namely the efficiency and economy of litigation.id.at.if not for a tolling doctrine,individuals would feel compelled to file placeholder lawsuits prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations,thereby clogging the channels of the court with suits already encompassed by the class action.id.at.a rule requiring successful anticipation of the determination of the viability of the class would breed needless duplication of motions.the tolling doctrine clears that clutter by sidelining lawsuits that might have been filed merely to preserve the option of later,individual intervention.id.at.
lastly,the american pipe court concluded that the tolling doctrine would not subvert the purpose of statutes of limitation.id.at.such statutes are designed to promote justice by preventing surprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost,memories have faded,and witnesses have disappeared.id.at.quoting order of telegraphers ry.express agency.triggered as it is by the filing of a class action,the tolling doctrine also obviates surprises.the class action notifies the defendants not only of the substantive claims being brought against them,but also of the number and generic identities of the potential plaintiffs who may participate in the judgment.id.at.
the supreme court subsequently expanded on american pipe holding.first,the court in american pipe disposed of the argument that class members,even if notified individually of the class certification,would not exercise their federal rule of civil procedure c b rights because of concerns that their claims would be.eisen carlisle jacquelin,d.eisen asserted that american pipe dispelled this concern because it established that commencement of a class action tolls the applicable statute of limitations as to all members of the class,whether the class was ultimately certified or not.id.
second,in crown,cork seal parker,d,the court reemphasized the broad strokes of american pipe t he commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action.id.at.quoting american pipe,at.this is the case regardless of whether those class members sought to intervene or to bring individual actions after the denial of class certification.id.at.the court also underscored its holding that,once the statute of limitations has been tolled,it remains tolled for all members of the putative class until class certification is denied.id.emphasis added 
lower court opinions on the instant issue 
american pipe,eisen,and crown all address the question of whether a litigant may intervene or file an individual suit after the class certification decision.in this case,however,the court must consider an earlier window,the time period running from the moment a class action is filed up to the time when the trial court denies class certification or the plaintiff opts not to continue as a member of the class.the supreme court has not addressed this question squarely,leaving it to percolate in the lower courts.at the federal appellate level,the second circuit has recently considered this very issue in in re worldcom,holding that a plaintiff who chooses to bring an individual action while the class action is pending can still claim the benefit of the american pipe tolling doctrine.and,even more recently,the ninth circuit,in in re hanford nuclear reservation,cir,has adopted the reasoning of in re worldcom.in earlier cases,however,both the sixth and first circuits have reached the opposite conclusion 
we agree with the analysis of the second and ninth circuits.after reviewing the supreme court precedents,the second circuit concluded that it should take at face value the court repeated assertion that the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action.in re worldcom,at quoting crown,at.the court also echoed the point that tolling does not undermine the purpose of statutes of limitation.id.at.
additionally,w hile reduction in the number of suits filed by class members would follow from a forfeiture rule,it was not the purpose of american pipe either to reduce the number of suits filed,or to force individual plaintiffs to make an early decision whether to proceed by individual suit or rely on a class representative.id.at.granted,judicial efficiency and economy were foremost in the american pipe court mind,but the case was not meant to induce class members to forgo their right to sue individually.id.thus,the tolling doctrine applies to protect separate suits whenever they are filed.id.
the ninth circuit recently relied on the in re worldcom rule in concluding that members of a who filed otherwise untimely individual suits before the putative class representatives decided to withdraw their motion for certification were entitled to the benefits of american pipe tolling.in re hanford.as did the second circuit,the ninth circuit concluded that applying american pipe tolling to plaintiffs who filed individual suits before certification is consistent with the purpose underlying statutes of limitation.id.at.moreover,that the american pipe doctrine protects plaintiffs from being forced to file suit before the certification decision does mean that plaintiffs who file before certification are not entitled to tolling.they have a right to file at the time of their choosing id.at citation omitted.
state farm counsels that this court should instead rely on the sixth circuit decision.there,after it had already decided that the applicable statute of limitations expired before this class action was filed,at,the court continued on to find in the alternative that the purposes of american pipe tolling are not furthered when plaintiffs file independent actions before decision on the issue of class certification,but are when plaintiffs delay until the certification issue has been decided.id.at.specifically,the sixth circuit concluded that freezing the situation until a class certification decision has been issued ensures that the courts will not be burdened by separate lawsuits which,in any event,may evaporate once a class has been certified.id.quoting in re worldcom.sec,d.those separate lawsuits,the court rationalized,might disappear because putative class members usually are in a far better position after the class certification decision to evaluate whether they wish to proceed with their own lawsuit,or to join a class id.quoting in re worldcom,d at 
state farm also relies on glater,a first circuit case.there,the plaintiff argued that she should be considered a new hampshire resident on the ground that she was a resident of that state at the time of the filing of a separate class action,which named eli lilly as a defendant and included the plaintiff in the putative class see at.the first circuit rejected this argument,noting that american pipe says nothing about the plaintiff ability to maintain a separate action while class certification is pending.the policies behind rule and american pipe would not be served,and in fact would be disserved,by guaranteeing a separate suit at the same time that a class action is ongoing.id.thus,the court concluded that the pendency of the separate class action did not preclude a dismissal of th e plaintiff case for lack of personal jurisdiction.id.
despite the concerns of the sixth and first circuits,we find the rationale of the in re worldcom and in re hanford decisions consonant with american pipe language and its conceptual and pragmatic underpinnings.for the following reasons,we join the second and ninth circuits.
first and foremost is the supreme court language in american pipe and crown.crown underscored what american pipe first asserted 
the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action.once the statute of limitations has been tolled,it remains tolled for all members of the putative class until class certification is denied.
crown,at.quoting american pipe,at.internal citation omitted.the supreme court language is clear.and at least one colorado appellate court has adopted this particular language from american pipe,as contoured by crown.see rosenthal,at the commencement of a class action tolls the statute of limitations for all members of the putative class until class certification is denied.we see no reason why colorado would not give effect to the broad language of those cases.this broad language suggests that the statute of limitations applicable to boellstorff claim remained tolled while the putative clark class remained in limbo.
second,in a sense,application of the american pipe tolling doctrine to cases such as this one does not involve tolling at all.joseph wiles,cir.the class action mechanism inherent representativeness means that each putative class member has effectively been a party to an action against the defendant since a class action covering him was filed.id.american pipe made much of this principle,positing that the class action tolling doctrine would apply regardless of the reliance or awareness of putative class members.at.thus,when clark filed a class action against state farm in august,alleging the same claims later asserted by boellstorff,clark in essence boellstorff suit.thereafter,when boellstorff filed her independent suit she simply retook the reins from clark.
third,state farm was afforded the benefit of the no fault act statute of limitations.clark suit put state farm on notice of the substantive claims being brought against it as well as the number and generic identities of the potential plaintiffs.american pipe,at.see also in re worldcom,at t he initiation of a class suit gives defendants all the information they need to prepare their defense.citing american pipe,at.accordingly,application of the tolling doctrine here would not undermine the policy choices embodied by colorado statute of limitations.see in re worldcom,at.
fourth,as boellstorff notes,locking putative class members into the class until the class certification decision makes little sense and could adversely affect certain individuals.rule c a mandates that the trial judge a t an early practicable time after a putative class action is filed determine by order whether to certify the action as a class action.c a.in practice,however,this decision may take time.here,for example,clark filed his class action in august,but did not file a motion for class certification until may,nearly seven years later.the second circuit rule permits litigants to decide to bring an individual action if they either deem their own claims valuable enough or decide that class certification is doubtful.in re worldcom,at noting that the american pipe doctrine was not meant to induce class members to forgo their right to sue individually jahn orcr,noting prerogative of class members to of class and pursue claims individually.forcing such plaintiffs to wait out a class certification decision makes even less sense when we consider the costs of delay for example,the possibility that the evidence will grow stale and added time the plaintiff must go without recovery.
fifth,on the macrocosmic level,the second circuit rule would not substantially impede the efficiency and economy of the class action mechanism.presumably,the only litigants likely to avail themselves
