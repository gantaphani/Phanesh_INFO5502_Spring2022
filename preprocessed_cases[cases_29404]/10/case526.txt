opinion of the court 
this appeal arises in the wake of the settlement of a nationwide class action against the prudential insurance company of america.two policyholders who were members of the class appeal the district court order enjoining them from prosecuting suits they filed in state court in florida based upon policies that were eligible for inclusion in the nationwide class,but which the plaintiffs excluded from the terms of the class settlement.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm.
factual background 
a large group of policy holders started a nationwide class action against prudential life insurance company alleging that prudential agents had engaged in deceptive sales practices.
the class is comprised of over million prudential policyholders who allegedly were the victims of fraudulent and misleading sales practices employed by prudential sales force.the challenged sales practices consisted primarily of churning vanishing premiums and fraudulent investment plans and each cause of action is based on fraud or deceptive conduct.
on october,the class representatives entered into a stipulation of settlement with prudential.app.at.that same day,the district court entered an order conditionally certifying the class for settlement purposes,designating class counsel and class representatives,staying pending motions,directing issuance of notice,issuing injunction and scheduling settlement hearing the certification order.app.at.in that certification order,the district court also conditionally certified the following for purposes of settlement 
a class that consists of all persons who own or owned at termination an individual permanent whole life insurance policy issued by prudential or any of its united states life insurance subsidiaries during the class period of january,through december,the policy or policies,except as specifically described below not relevant here policyholders,and do not timely exclude themselves from participating in the settlement class members or the class.
app.at.the certification order also scheduled a date for a settlement hearing 
to consider the fairness,reasonableness and adequacy of the proposed settlement and terms and provisions of the stipulation,and to determine whether the proposed settlement and the stipulation should be finally approved by the court.
id.at.in addition,the certification order required that prudential provide class notices to all policyholders.the court required that the class notice 
i contain a short,plain statement of the background of the actions,the conditional class certification and the proposed settlement,ii describe the proposed forms of relief,iii explain the procedures for receiving and participating in the proposed forms of relief,iv explain class members rights of exclusion,objection and appeal and v state that any relief to class members is contingent on the court final approval of the proposed settlement.
the class notice also advised class members of the effect of the proposed settlement and referenced a release that was attached as appendix a.the release stated in relevant part that class members hereby expressly agree that they shall not institute,maintain or assert any and all causes of action,claims that have been,or could have been,asserted by plaintiffs or any class member against prudential in any other court action connected with the released transactions id.at.
the class notice also told the class members how they could exclude themselves from the class and explained that policyholders who owned more than one policy could choose to remain a class member with respect to some policies,but exclude themselves from the class with respect to other policies.id.
following the mailing of the class notice and the fairness hearing,the district court entered a final order and judgment certifying a settlement and approving the settlement as fair,reasonable and adequate.in re prudential ins.of america sales practices litigation.the final order also clearly informed all class members of the preclusive effect of the settlement.it stated 
the terms of the stipulation of settlement and of this final order and judgment,including all exhibits and supplemental exhibits thereto,shall forever be binding on,and shall have res judicata and claim preclusive effect in all pending and future lawsuits maintained by or on behalf of,the plaintiffs and all other class members,as well as their heirs,executors and administrators,successors and assigns.all claims for compensatory or punitive damages on behalf of class members are hereby extinguished,except as provided for in the stipulation of settlement.
id.in addition,the district court expressly incorporated the release into the final order.id.at.
the certification order also contained the following injunction 
prudential has offered evidence showing the existence of multiple class actions which could act to seriously impair this court ability to oversee the orderly and efficient management of the proposed nationwide class action settlement,and have demonstrated that without preliminary injunctive relief,many similar actions could proceed.based on its familiarity with the issues in this lawsuit and the complexity of the proposed settlement,the court finds that such actions may substantially impair the ability of this court and the parties to implement the proposed settlement therefore,based on the record,including the legal and factual support for an injunction submitted by prudential,this court finds that an injunction is necessary to protect its jurisdiction,and hereby issues the following injunction,effective upon the mailing of the class notice,with policyholders having been thus afforded the opportunity to exclude themselves from the class 
all policyholders and all persons acting on behalf of or in concert or participation with any policyholder,are hereby enjoined from filing,commencing,prosecuting,continuing,litigating,intervening in or participating as class members in,any lawsuit in any jurisdiction based on or related to the facts and circumstances underlying the claims and causes of action in this lawsuit,unless and until such policyholder has timely excluded herself or himself from the class.
id.at emphasis added.
the district court invoked the authority of the act,a,and the act,in entering this injunction.the court reasoned that the injunction was necessary in aid of its jurisdiction in order to effectuate the proposed settlement,id.at,and therefore permissible under the act and authorized by the act.the court retain ed exclusive jurisdiction as to all matters relating to administration,consummation,enforcement and interpretation of the stipulation of settlement and of the final order and judgment,and for any other necessary purpose,before dismissing the action pursuant to the settlement agreement.

ii.the florida suit 
marvin and alice lowe,the appellants here,are members of the class because they purchased five prudential insurance policies between and.four of those policies were class eligible.the lowes requested that two of the policies be excluded from the class the excluded policies,but they remained class members as to two other policies the class policies.
ten months after the district court certified the class and approved the nationwide settlement,the lowes started an action in state court in broward county florida.there,they initially alleged that a prudential agent had engaged in deceptive and fraudulent practices in connection with their purchase of all five insurance policies.however,because the class policies constituted released transactions under the terms of the class settlement,the lowes filed an amended complaint in which they limited their claims to the two excluded policies.the lowes first amended complaint asserts a cause of action against prudential for breach of fiduciary duty,violations of florida rico statute,negligent misrepresentation,fraudulent inducement,common law fraud,constructive fraud,reckless and wanton supervision,negligent supervision,and unjust enrichment.first am.compl.at.
prudential claimed that the first amended complaint continued to rely on,and enumerate,all of the circumstances surrounding the purchase of the two class policies.in fact,prudential insisted that the lowes merely deleted the policy numbers of the two class policies from their original complaint then refiled that same complaint as the amended complaint.for example,the class action complaint alleged that 
prudential engaged in a systematic fraudulent marketing scheme in which its agents wrongfully induced policyholders to purchase certain prudential life insurance policies.second am.compl.at.
prudential implemented its scheme through the use of false and misleading sales presentations,policy illustrations,marketing materials,and other information that prudential approved,prepared,and disseminated to its nationwide sales force.second am.compl.at.
beginning in the early,prudential used its centralized marketing system to implement a scheme to sell new insurance policies to existing and new customers through three deceptive sales tactics churning,vanishing premium,and investment plan techniques.
at.the lowes first amended complaint alleged 
sometime prior to,the exact date being unknown to the lowes,prudential devised a sales scheme and artifice to deprive its insureds and potential customers,including the lowes,of their property,in which prudential trained its sales force,to induce and persuade current and potential customers,including the lowes,to purchase life insurance policies based on false and misleading policy illustrations and sales presentations,involving,inter alia,churning and vanishing premiums.
prudential embarked upon a scheme,plan,and common course of conduct through its agency system within florida to sell high commission whole life polices to residents of the state of florida through false and misleading sales presentations and policy illustrations based upon the vanishing premium concept.in this regard,prudential targeted the lowes in a scheme that included inter alia the sale of vanishing premium policies,and churning prior existing in force polices.the lowes were induced to purchase various life insurance policies based on sales presentations and policy illustrations and promises that,if they made premium payments for a designated number of years,the interest earned on the polices would be sufficient to pay the premiums thereon for life,and thus,they would not have to come to pay premiums after the designated number of years.
lowe first am.compl.at.
the first amended complaint and the class complaint both alleged senior management involvement in the scheme.compare.at and at describing class allegations,including allegations of senior management involvement with lowe first amended complaint at a fter training and encouraging its agents to engage in the fraudulent scheme outlined above,prudential turned a blind eye toward the fraudulent practices of its agents.
the lowes,however,insisted that their first amended complaint deleted their claims for damages stemming from the purchase of the released transactions as well as any reference to the released transactions.they argued that the first amended complaint was not based on,and did not seek damages for,the claims underlying the two class policies.
in a letter to prudential counsel dated january,the lowes counsel explained while we do not intend to seek damages based upon the out policies,the facts surrounding them were relevant to our claims,including but not limited to our claim of a pattern and practice by prudential justifying not only the imposition of liability,but additionally an assessment of punitive damages.app.at emphasis added.prudential concluded that this letter established that the lowes intended to rely upon evidence relating to the class policies in their suit on the excluded policies.thus,argued prudential,the lowes intended to establish a pattern and practice of defrauding policyholders by relying upon facts relevant to the class policies and to use that evidence as a basis for their state claims for punitive and compensatory damages in relation to the sale of the excluded policies.prudential argued that the lowes state court action would therefore force prudential to defend the very matters covered by the class release accordingly,prudential asked the district court to rule that the lowes action in florida on the excluded policies violated the terms of the class settlement.
the district court agreed and held that 
permitting litigation of excluded policies claims through the use of evidence of those sales practices and patterns that were the subject of the class action would impair the finality of the class settlement to an unacceptable degree.in effect,this would permit the relitigation of the released claims.
dist.op.at.therefore,on march,the district court issued an order specifically enjoining the lowes 
from engaging in motion practice,pursuing discovery,presenting evidence or undertaking any other action in furtherance of their state court action that is based on,relates to or involves facts and circumstances underlying the released transactions in the class action 
this appeal followed.
iii.discussion 
we review the terms of an injunction for an abuse of discretion,underlying questions of law receive de novo review,and factual determinations are reviewed for clear error.epstein family partnership kmart,cir.the standard of review for the authority to issue an injunction under the act and the act is de novo.frank russell wellington mgmt,cir carlough amchem,cir.
the act provides 
a court of the united states may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a state court except as expressly authorized by act of congress,or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.
the act is an absolute prohibition against enjoining state court proceedings,unless the injunction falls within one of three specifically defined exceptions.atlantic coast line brotherhood of locomotive engineers,d.consequently,any injunction against state court proceedings otherwise proper under general equitable principles must be based on one of the specific statutory exceptions to if it is to be upheld.id.at.these exceptions are narrow and are not to be enlarged by loose statutory construction.chick kam choo exxon,d citations,internal quotations and brackets omitted.
the injunction issued by the district court here was not expressly authorized by congress.accordingly,it can be upheld only if it was necessary in aid of the district court jurisdiction or to protect or effectuate that court judgments.
the rule allowing injunctions that are necessary to protect or effectuate a court judgments is also known as the relitigation exception to the anti injunction act.kam choo,at.the relitigation exception was designed to permit a federal court to prevent state litigation of an issue that previously was presented to,and decided by,the federal court.id.the exception is founded in the concepts of res judicata and collateral estoppel.id.a n essential prerequisite for applying the relitigation exception is that the claims or issues which the federal injunction insulates from litigation in state proceedings must actually have been decided by the federal court.id.at.
the supreme court has therefore urged that courts proceed with caution when considering issuing an injunction under the act.a federal court does not have inherent power to ignore the limitations of and to enjoin state court proceedings merely because those proceedings interfere with a protected federal right or invade an area preempted by federal law,even when the interference is unmistakably clear.atlantic coast line,at.this rule applies regardless of whether the federal court has jurisdiction over the controversy,or whether it is ousted from jurisdiction for the same reason the state court is.id.at.moreover,even when the district court does have jurisdiction,it is not enough that the requested injunction is related to that jurisdiction,but it must be necessary in aid of that jurisdiction.id.at.emphasis added.
while this language is admittedly broad,it implies something similar to the concept of injunctions to protect or effectuate judgments.both imply that some federal injunction relief may be necessary to prevent a state court from so interfering with a federal court consideration or disposition of a case as to seriously impair the federal court flexibility and authority to decide that case.
id.moreover,a ny doubts as to the propriety of a federal injunction against state court proceedings should be resolved in favor of permitting the state courts to proceed in an orderly fashion to finally determine the controversy.id.at.
however,a caveat is in order here.usually,the aid of jurisdiction exception to the act applies only to parallel state in rem rather than in personam actions.winkler eli lilly,cir citing vendo,d.the most notable exception to this general pattern of in rem application is school desegregation cases,where conflicting orders from different courts would only serve to make ongoing federal oversight unmanageable.winkler,at citation omitted.another exception that is more pertinent to our inquiry includes consolidated multidistrict litigation,where a parallel state court action threatens to frustrate proceedings and disrupt the orderly resolution of the federal litigation.id.citing,among other cases,carlough amchem products,cir.in winkler,the court concluded that the necessary in aid of jurisdiction exception should be construed to empower the federal court to enjoin a concurrent state proceeding that might render the exercise of the federal court jurisdiction nugatory.id.citing martin redish,the statute reconsidered,chi.
the act is similar in scope and operation to the act.in pertinent part,the act provides that 
the supreme court and all courts established by act of congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.
a.the act acts in concert with the act to permit the issuance of an injunction.
w hile the act does not provide positive authority for issuance of injunctions,it describes those situations where injunctions are not permitted.the act,by contrast,grants the federal courts the authority to issue injunctions where necessary in aid of their jurisdiction.the parallel necessary in aid of jurisdiction language is construed similarly in both the act and the act.
carlough,at cir.
the lowes argue that the district court injunction here purports to rest on both the necessary in aid of its jurisdiction exception and the to protect or effectuate its judgments exception to the act.lowes br.at.prudential argues that the injunction was based solely on the relitigation exception of the act.prudential br.at.in its opinion,the district court stated that allowing the lowes to use evidence of sales practices and patterns relating to the class policies in their state action on the excluded policies would impair the finality of the class settlement to an unacceptable degree and would effectively permit the relitigation of the released claims.dist.op.at.
we are mindful,of course,that the injunction here is not directed at the florida state court.rather,it is directed at the lowes as plaintiffs in that state court action.the anti injunction act is nevertheless directly implicated because the prohibition of can not be evaded by addressing the order to the parties.atlantic coast line,at.see also the salaried retirement plan for eligible employees of crucible,nobers,cir the act can not be evaded by the formality of enjoining named parties rather than the state court proceeding itself.
the lowes contend that the injunction was not authorized under the act and was barred by the act.they argue in the alternative that the injunction should be vacated because it is overbroad,vague,ambiguous,beyond the scope of the final judgment and order,and otherwise an abuse of discretion.
it is now settled that a judgment pursuant to a class settlement can bar later claims based on the allegations underlying the claims in the settled class action.this is true even though the precluded claim was not presented,and could not have been presented,in the class action itself.see,tbk partners,western union,cir.tbk partners appears to be the first case firmly establishing this principle.however,that rule has since been applied in other cases in the second circuit,see also in re single premium deferred annuities insurance litigation,cir,and it has been accepted by the ninth circuit court of appeals.see,class plaintiffs city of seattle,cir.in class plaintiffs,the court held that a federal court may release claims over which it has no subject matter jurisdiction if the state claims arise from the same nucleus of operative facts as the claims properly before it.
admittedly,it may seem anomalous at first glance that courts without jurisdiction to hear certain claims have the power to release those claims as part of a judgment.grimes vitalink communications,cir.however,we have endorsed the rule because it serves the important policy interest of judicial economy by permitting parties to enter into comprehensive settlements that prevent relitigation of settled questions at the core of a class action.id.quoting tbk partners,at.we cited this principle approvingly when we affirmed the district court approval of the class action settlement here.see at.
that does not,however,end our inquiry.although this principle is well established,we must examine the text of the class notice and,more particularly,the class release to determine the propriety of this injunction.we must determine whether settlement of claims the lowes had under the class policies precludes them from pursuing claims in florida purportedly arising from the excluded policies.
the class notice specifically referred to the class release and informed class members 
if the proposed settlement is approved by the court,and affirmed on appeal,the lawsuit will be dismissed with prejudice,and prudential will be released from all claims that have been or could have been asserted by class members.the release encompasses any matter relating to the marketing,solicitation,application,underwriting,acceptance,sale,purchase,operation,retention,administration,servicing,or replacement,by means of surrender,partial surrender,loans respecting withdrawal terminations of policies or any insurance policy or annuity sold in connection with or relating in any way directly or indirectly to the sale or solicitation of,the policies.the release is intended to be very broad.the release is a critical element of the proposed settlement,and accordingly,the entire text has been included in appendix a to this notice except for certain defined terms that appear elsewhere in this notice.because it will affect your rights if you remain in the class,you should read this paragraph and the entire release.
id.at emphasis added.as noted earlier,the release was attached as appendix a to the class notice,and provided,in relevant part 
plaintiffs and all class members hereby expressly agree that they shall not now or hereafter institute,maintain or assert against any of the releasees,either directly or indirectly,on their own behalf,on behalf of the class or any other person,and release and discharge the releasees from,any and all causes of action,claims,damages,equitable,legal and administrative relief,interest,demands or rights,of any kind or nature whatsoever,whether based on federal,state or local statute or ordinance,regulation contract,common law,or any other source,that have been,could have been,may be or could be alleged or asserted now or in the future by plaintiffs or any class member against the releasees in the actions or in any other court action or before any administrative body including any state department of insurance or other regulatory commission,tribunal or arbitration panel on the basis of,connected with,arising out of,or related to,in whole or in part,the released transactions and servicing relating to the released transactions
