this appeal requires us to determine whether a services contract conforms with various massachusetts consumer protection statutes.after studying the pertinent contractual and statutory provisions,we find no nonconformity.accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal of the action.
background 
because this appeal follows the granting of a motion to dismiss,see.b,we rehearse the facts as elaborated in the operative pleading here,the plaintiff amended complaint.see palmer champion,cir.we recognize,however,that our obligation to approach the facts from this vantage does not require us to credit bald assertions,unsupportable conclusions,and opprobrious epithets.chongris bd.of appeals,cir quoting snowden hughes.
in march of,gisselle ruiz signed a contract for services the contract with holiday universal,a subsidiary of bally total fitness holding the contract allowed the plaintiff access to one of bally facilities for months in exchange for payment of a membership fee of,followed by monthly dues of.rather than pay the membership fee up front,the plaintiff chose to finance the sum less a down payment of over a period at an annual percentage rate of.under that arrangement,she was to pay bally per month in addition to her monthly dues.
although the contract contained a multiplicity of provisions,we enumerate here only those that are directly relevant to our analysis.under the contract,the plaintiff was free to stop paying her monthly dues at any time by submitting written notice to bally,with the understanding that she would then forfeit her right to use the facilities.the plaintiff was not free to discontinue the deferred payments on the membership fee refund of the membership fee could be triggered only by certain identified events,disability or relocation to an area remote from any of bally locations.so long as the contract remained in full force and effect,the plaintiff had the option,at the end of the initial period,to extend her membership from month to month by paying increased dues of or per month depending upon the payment method that she elected.finally,the contract contained a provision specifying that bally would not be liable for personal property that the plaintiff chose to bring to the club.
sometime later in exact date is plaintiff purported to cancel the contract and requested that bally refund the balance of her membership fee.bally refused her request.
undaunted,the plaintiff repaired to a massachusetts state court and filed a putative class action.her complaint contained a myriad of claims.two of them comprise the focal point of this appeal i that the contract violated a provision of the massachusetts health club services contracts act the hcsca prohibiting the required financing of a contract for more than one month beyond the expiration of that contract,see.laws ch,and ii that the contract transgressed the hcsca prohibition on waiver of consumer claims,see id.relatedly,the plaintiff alleged that these infractions also implicated the commonwealth general consumer protection statute.see.laws ch.chapter.the plaintiff sought damages for herself and for the putative class members,multiplied under chapter,see id,and the opportunity for all class members to rescind their contracts.
bally removed the case to the federal district court under the diversity of citizenship statute.see a see also id.a.shortly thereafter,it moved to dismiss,asserting among other things that the plaintiff lacked standing to pursue the action and that,in all events,the contract did not offend the hcsca.the district court agreed with these arguments and dismissed the action.see ruiz bally total fitness holding,d.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
we review the district court dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo.see arruda sears,roebuck,cir.in that process we,like the district court,must assume the truth of all facts and give the plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences therefrom.see rogan menino,cir.we may consider not only the factual allegations of the amended complaint but also any matters fairly incorporated within that pleading.see in re colonial mortg.bankers,cir.and,finally,because this is a diversity case,we must apply the substantive law of the forum state here,massachusetts.see of warwick,baccarat,cir.
with this framework in place,we turn to an evaluation of the plaintiff claims.in so doing,we bear in mind that we are not bound by the district court decisional calculus but,rather,may affirm the decision below on any ground made manifest by the record.see united states,cir intergen grina,cir.
as an initial matter,we address the contention that the plaintiff lacks standing to sue under the relevant statutory provisions because she has not asserted any injury resulting from the alleged infractions.see.laws ch,providing a private right of action for any consumer who has suffered any injury as a result of a violation of the hcsca.laws ch,providing a ny person who has been injured by a practice declared unlawful under chapter with a private right of action.in the context of a massachusetts consumer protection statute,the term injury has two components.in the first instance,it denotes an invasion of a legally protected interest.leardi brown,see aspinall philip morris.to be actionable,however,that invasion must cause a loss either economic or noneconomic to the holder of the legally protected interest.see hershenow enter.
the plaintiff primary claim of injury runs along the following lines.if,as she contends,certain provisions of the contract violate the hcsca,the contract is unenforceable.see.laws ch,any contract for health club services which does not comply with the applicable provisions of this chapter shall be void and unenforceable as contrary to public policy.yet,bally refused to honor her request to cancel the contract.thus,the enduring obligation to make the subsequent payments called for by the contract constitutes a cognizable injury.
we agree with the premise on which this rationale rests.while the facts relating to the plaintiff attempted cancellation are as yet undeveloped,the plaintiff is entitled,on a rule b motion to dismiss,to all reasonable inferences from the facts alleged in her amended complaint.see rogan,at.here,it plausibly may be inferred from the factual averments in the amended complaint that the plaintiff tried to cancel the contract because she believed that it did not conform to the requirements of massachusetts law.if that belief proves to be is,if the contract is found to violate the plaintiff rights under the violation would necessarily constitute an invasion of a legally protected interest.see leardi,at.in that event,the plaintiff would be facing a causally related economic loss in the form of the obligation to make future payments under the contract.
in an effort to parry this thrust,bally counters with a pair of massachusetts cases.first,it laments that,under the plaintiff theory of injury,any consumer who has made payments under a contract alleged to violate the hcsca would have standing to sue.this result,bally asserts,would render the statutory injury requirement meaningless.
this lamentation relies heavily on an unpublished trial court decision allowing a motion for summary judgment against a plaintiff who alleged violations of the hcsca.see albats town sports int l,slip op.may,in that case,the only injury claimed by the plaintiff was that she had lost certain protections under the law.id.at.in concluding that the plaintiff had not alleged an adequate injury,the albats court emphasized that the plaintiff had continued to use the facility after filing her initial complaint.id.at.moreover,she had not manifested a desire to be released from her contractual obligations.id.
here,however,the facts are materially different.the plaintiff in this case,unlike the plaintiff in albats,attempted to cancel the contract before filing suit.although she no longer covets her membership,she has been required to continue making payments because bally refused to honor her request for a full cancellation.given these averments,bally reliance on albats is mislaid.
the second case upon which bally relies is her
