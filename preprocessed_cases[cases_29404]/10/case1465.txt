this appeal arises from a longstanding discrimination action by black farmers against the united states department of agriculture department alleging racial discrimination in the administration of credit and benefit programs.the appellants are farmers whose discrimination claims were denied in adjudications conducted pursuant to a consent decree and whose petitions for review of the adverse adjudications were rejected as untimely because they were filed after the stipulated deadlines that the parties negotiated and the court approved in a stipulation and order s o.the appellants challenge the district court denial of their motions for relief from the stipulated deadlines under.b and the court inherent equitable authority.because the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motions,we affirm its judgment.
in a class of black farmers filed this action in the district court alleging racial discrimination in violation of the equal credit opportunity act,et on april,the district court entered the consent decree which established a system for resolving the individual class members claims.pigford glickman,affirmed.under track a,a class member with little or no documentary evidence could submit his claim to an adjudicator and obtain payment of and forgiveness of debt owed the department if he proved discrimination by substantial evidence.such a claimant has a fairly low burden of proof but his recovery is limited.id.at.track b,by contrast,set no dollar cap on a claimant recovery but the claimant must prove discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence,a higher burden of proof.id.a claimant in either track could file a petition for review of an adverse decision by the adjudicator with an independent monitor who shall direct the adjudicator to reexamine the claim if he determines that a clear and manifest error has occurred that is likely to result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.id.at quoting consent decree b iii,at.
because the consent decree provided no timetable for seeking review by the monitor,the parties negotiated filing deadlines which are set out in the s o entered by the district court on july.under the s o any claimant who had received an adverse adjudicator decision as of the date of the s o had days from that date,by november,to file a petition with the monitor.any claimant who received an adverse decision after the s o date had days from the date of the adjudication to file a petition.the s o expressly recites no extensions of these deadlines will be granted for any reason.id.
on october,the claimants class counsel filed a motion seeking to redesign the unworkable petition filing process,noting that as of that date counsel had filed petitions on behalf of only of the claimants requesting filing assistance.pls.mot.for expedited hearing at,filed.following a conference with the parties the district court issued an order on november,directing that,in lieu of a completed petition for each of the claimants,counsel could satisfy the november,deadline by submitting a register of petitions register which simply listed the name and claim number of each claimant who had sought counsel assistance in filing a petition for review of an adverse decision issued as of the s o date.pigford glickman,wl filed.the court explained that,while counsel should be held to the commitments to which they agreed,nonetheless counsel failings should not be visited on their clients.id.at,wl,at.the court further directed that class counsel file of the register petitions by december,and another by the of each month thereafter up to a final filing date of may.the order recited under no circumstances shall the monitor accept supporting materials or withdrawals after may.id.at,wl,at.in effect,the court doubled the stipulated time to file a petition for review of an adjudication decided as of the date of the s 
on march,the appellants filed a motion for an order suspending the may,deadline.the district court held a status conference and on april,issued an order directing that all deadlines set forth in the court order of november,are suspended until further order of the court pending a scheduled meeting on may,between class counsel and outside lawyers who might be able to assemble a team of pro bono lawyers to assist class counsel on an emergency basis.pigford veneman,d.in addition,the court ordered that if,after the may meeting,class counsel decided additional time was necessary they should file a motion for extension no later than may,setting out a realistic filing schedule.
after the pro bono meeting the appellants proposed extending the filing deadline to september,and the district court so ordered on may,finding the new deadline both realistic and reasonable in light of the impressive commitment made by pro bono counsel to assist class counsel.pigford veneman,d.the may,order warned that u nder no circumstances shall the monitor accept supporting materials or withdrawals that are filed after september.id.at.class counsel,with pro bono assistance,succeeded in filling all of the remaining petitions by the new deadline.
on july,class counsel filed a motion seeking relief under.b or the court inherent equitable authority on behalf of claimants whose review petitions had been rejected as untimely.on june,the district court denied the motion,concluding there were no changed circumstances that justified modifying the s o deadlines as amended.pigford veneman,d.the claimants moved for reconsideration,which the district court denied on march.pigford veneman,d.this appeal followed.
the appellants comprise two groups of claimants those represented by class counsel,now numbering,and some others who either proceeded pro se or were represented by lawyers unaffiliated with class counsel.class counsel argues on behalf of each group that the district court erred in denying relief from the filing deadlines under either rule b or its inherent equitable power.we review the district court decision whether to modify a consent order,either under.b or pursuant to its inherent authority,for abuse of discretion.see rufo inmates of suffolk county jail,d rule b shepherd am.broad,inherent authority.we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the appellants motion for relief.
class counsel petitions 
the district court denied the appellants motion for relief as to the petitions filed late by class counsel because the appellants failed to demonstrate changed circumstances to warrant modifying the s o schedule under rule b,which provides in relevant part on motion and upon such terms as are just,the court may relieve a party or a party legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for the following reasons it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application the appellants challenge the court rule b decision on two grounds.we address each in turn.
first,the appellants assert the district court incorrectly invoked rule b because the rule governs only orders that are final the appellants contend that the s o was not a final order and that therefore the court should have decided whether to grant relief solely under its inherent equitable authority.see envtl.defense fund,costle,the power of a district court sitting as a court of equity to modify the terms of a settlement agreement it previously adopted can not be drawn into question.as a practical matter,it makes little difference whether the district court resolved the motion under rule or under its equitable authority as the standard for each is substantially the same.compare rufo inmates of suffolk county jail,d under rule b,a party seeking modification of a consent decree must establish that a significant change in facts or law warrants revision of the decree and that the proposed modification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance,with envtl.defense fund,inc,at s ound exercise of judicial discretion may require that terms of a consent decree be modified when there has been a significant change in the circumstances obtaining at the time the consent decree was entered.nonetheless,we conclude that the court correctly invoked rule b.
the appellants do not dispute that the consent decree itself is final within the meaning of rule b.see appellants br.at.they contend,however,that because the s o simply establish es procedures for enforcing or implementing the decree,the s o is not considered final within the meaning of rule.id.citing united states,bogard wright,cir.the authorities the appellants cite do not support their position.in western this court reviewed the district court denial of a request for waiver from restrictions in a consent decree based on the district court decision not to consider the merits of such a waiver request until a later time when there is substantial competition in local service.at quoting united states.we explained that the district court order denying the request was not final because the district court contemplated further proceedings before ruling on the requests.id.at.similarly in bogard,the seventh circuit concluded that an order that extended the term of a monitor initially appointed for a term unless extended by order of this court was not a final order because it had no termination date and therefore t he postjudgment proceeding could drag on for many years and involve a host of orders the consequences of which could not be undone when if ever the postjudgment proceeding ended with a showing of compliance so complete that the monitor services could be dispensed with.at.by contrast,the district court s o fixed final deadlines for filing petitions with the monitor.see s o,at no extensions of these deadlines will be granted for any reason.as with the consent decree,which the s o supplemented,no further court action was contemplated at the time the s o issued.that the s o was in fact subsequently modified by the court in response to the appellants requests does not make it any less final.such modification of a final order is precisely what rule b contemplates 
next,the appellants contend that even if the s o is a final order subject to rule b,the district court abused its discretion in failing to modify the s o for changed circumstances.again we disagree.
in the june,order denying the appellants motion for relief,the district court rejected their contention that the large volume of claimants requesting assistance with petitions during a short period of time constituted a changed circumstance because it occurred before,not after,the relevant deadlines were agreed to by the parties and endorsed by the court.d at emphasis by court.the court explained the exponential increase in claimants was fully apparent when plaintiffs and defendant negotiated and agreed to the july,stipulation and order,including its clear provision that no extensions of these deadlines will be granted for any reason.id.at quoting s o,at.the appellants do not quibble with the court analysis,see appellants br.at,but contend the court abused its discretion by failing to grant relief based on four other changed circumstances the unusually high number of claimants with meritorious grounds for review of their claim denials caused by an unusually high rate of errors by the adjudicators the extreme work load borne by the two small class counsel firms because outside of counsels participated only minimally in the review petition filing particularly after the court march,ruling that attorney fees for monitor review work not be available until after readjudication of reviewed claims produced a disincentive to work on the monitor review process,appellants br.at the exhaustion of class counsel funds and credit by march,and the extra step created by the register provision.it is no surprise that the district court did not address these four changed circumstances in its initial decision as the appellants raised them for the first time in their motion for reconsideration.compare pls.mem.in supp.of mot.for relief at filed july,and pls.reply to def.opp to mot.for relief at filed,with pls.mot.for recons.at filed june.when the court addressed these newly raised circumstances in the reconsideration order,its response was admittedly brief the court is well aware of the circumstances surrounding these petitions and further elaboration does not change this court opinion that plaintiffs have not demonstrated changed circumstances sufficient to justify modification of the court orders under rule b.d at.the court brevity,however,is understandable given what had come before.
to the extent the four new circumstances adversely affected the petition filing process,the court had already taken them into account and provided the appellants with relief.in response to class counsel october,plea of an unexpectedly high volume of meritorious review petitions,the court modified the s o on november to permit class counsel to satisfy the november,filing deadline through the simple register listing,a remedy the appellants accepted without complaint when class counsel sought relief in spring because of their depleted resources,both financial and human the court granted a extension until september,by which deadline all of the remaining petitions were filed.given the district court repeated accommodation of class counsel continuing delinquency,we can not say the court abused its discretion in denying the appellants motion for further relief 
the dissent contends the district court erred in two respects.first,it argues the court erred in relying on a finding of fact that the critical changed circumstances occurred before the parties agreed to the deadline in the s dissent at.we perceive no such error.the court was correct when it found as a fact in its june,decision denying relief that t he exponential increase in claimants was fully apparent when plaintiffs and defendant negotiated and agreed to the july,stipulation and order,d at,as the appellants acknowledge the district court was also correct when it stated in the june,order that the critical changed circumstance on which plaintiffs rely occurred before,not after,the relevant deadlines were agreed to by the parties and endorsed by the court.d at first emphasis added the appellants had argued at that stage that relief from the deadlines was warranted because of t he predominant change in circumstances,since the consent decree was approved in,namely,that the number of participants,with or without counsel,has increased,overwhelming the system set up by the consent decree,pls.reply to def.opp to mot.for relief at,plainly referring to the increased number of claimants.it is not at all surprising if,as the dissent notes,dissent at,the court june,order ignored the key distinction argued by appellants in the motion for reconsideration of the order,which was filed on june.further,as we noted supra,the court had already granted relief from the increase in meritorious petitions when it established the simplified register procedure for meeting the november,filing deadline.
second,the dissent asserts the district court erred as a matter of law by failing to consider whether class counsel failures to meet the deadlines amounted to an unforeseen obstacle warranting relief.dissent at.the dissent relies on the court decision in pigford veneman,pigford i,for the proposition that where class members lack competent counsel,counsel failure to meet deadlines itself may amount to an unforeseen obstacle that makes the decree unworkable.dissent at quoting pigford i,at.pigford i,however,presented a different situation in two respects.first,contrary to the dissent characterization,pigford i did not present the same issue of modification of deadlines as here,dissent at emphasis by dissent,so as to implicate law of the case.in pigford i the court modified the consent order to permit arbitrators to extend the deadlines for filing evidentiary materials in track b litigation,set out in paragraph of the consent decree,based on class counsel malpractice in the track b litigation,namely,its inability to represent all track b claimants adequately,pigford i,at quoting d at,as exemplified by one lawyer failure to timely file a claimant direct testimony with the arbitrator.here,the appellants seek to modify the s o track a deadlines for filing review petitions under paragraph b iii,relying on their repeated failures to meet the filing deadlines.second,pigford i came before us in a different posture.in that decision,we rejected the district court determination that the consent decree could be interpreted to permit extending deadlines but affirmed the decision to extend deadlines based on the alternative ground,not addressed by the district court,that the decree could be so modified under rule b because counsel failures amounted to changed circumstances warranting relief under rule b.because we affirmed the district court decision,we were free to do so,as we did,on a ground not reached by the district court and without reviewing the district court rationale.eeoc aramark,although the district court never addressed the safe harbor provision,the issue is fully briefed,and because we review the district court judgment,not its reasoning,we may affirm on any ground properly raised.citing doe gates.in this case,however,we review the district court decision not to grant relief and may overturn such an order only for abuse of discretion.summers howard,citing computer prof ls for soc.responsibility secret,twelve john does district of columbia.although the district court might have been warranted in modifying the deadlines based on class counsel failure to meet deadlines,as we explained supra,the court did not abuse its discretion in declining to do so.for us to decide the question sua sponte or require the district court to do so as a matter of law,as the dissent suggests,would infringe on the district court discretion and run counter to the presumption of client accountability for attorney conduct which,as we confirmed in pigford i,applies in class actions.see pigford i,at.
pro se and unaffiliated counsel petitions 
next,the appellants contend the district court abused its discretion in denying relief under its inherent equitable authority to the late filing claimants who were not represented by class counsel and did not,class counsel contends,receive actual notice of the s o deadlines in their motion for relief the appellants cited lack of notice as a changed circumstance supporting modification of the s o under either rule b or the court inherent authority because track a decision letters issued after july,mistakenly omitted language informing claimants that they had days from the date of the decision to petition the monitor for review.pls.mem.in supp.of mot.for relief at.the district court rejected this argument because the s o did not require the letters to include such notice and therefore its absence was not a changed circumstance on reconsideration,the appellants took a different tack,arguing that when class members do not receive actual notice of a deadline by which they must take some action to preserve their claims,and therefore miss the deadline,the district court may exercise its equitable authority to excuse the late filings.pls.reply to def.resp.to mot.for recons.at quoting in re orthopedic bone screw prods.liability,cir alteration original.the appellants further urged the court to apply the excusable neglect standard in exercising its inherent authority as well as the four factors the third circuit adopted under the standard in orthopedic,namely 
the danger of prejudice to the nonmovant the length of the delay and its potential effect on judicial proceedings the reason for the delay,including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant and whether the movant acted in good faith.
at citing pioneer inv.servs.brunswick assocs,d.the district court applied the third circuit formulation and under the first and third factors found no excusable neglect warranting equitable relief because of the potential prejudice to the department and the appellants role in drafting the s o.the court concluded that the government will be prejudiced to the tune of almost one million dollars if the court permits consideration of the late petitions and if even five percent of them are successful,d at quoting pigford veneman,d at,and because the deadlines were negotiated and agreed to by plaintiffs,it logically follows that the resulting failure to meet those deadlines had been within the reasonable control of plaintiffs,id.at.in so concluding the court did not abuse its discretion.as the district court pointed out in the may,order suspending the deadlines as part of the bargain struck between the parties and approved by the court in the order of july,class counsel agreed to meet the day deadline in return for the government agreement to admit more than track a claimants into the class who otherwise would have been excluded.d at.if the district court had granted the requested relief from the deadlines,the government would have lost the benefit of its and finality as to its maximum liability as of the agreed upon the claimant class would have recovered the right to compensation for claimants filing review petitions beyond the stipulated deadlines as extended by the court the prejudice to the government distinguishes this case from in re orthopedic in which the court found the defendant would suffer no prejudice because the addition of claimants would have no effect on the amount the defendant would pay to those aggrieved by its products as its liability had been capped by a settlement agreement.at.here,because there is no cap,the expansion of the number of successful claimants which would result from extending the deadline will substantially expand the department monetary liability.see id.noting consideration of prejudice there was a unique inquiry and expansion of plaintiff class in the ordinary class action will be to the detriment of the defendant grace detroit,unlike the cases cited by plaintiff,in this case there is no fixed settlement fund.every tardy claim accepted would be an expansion of defendant city liability for a reason not originally ordered.the total sum of defendant liability is yet to be determined,and increases with each successive claimant.
for the foregoing reasons,the district court orders denying the appellants motions are affirmed.
so ordered.
the history of this litigation bears witness to the many obstacles to relief for the class of african american farmers covered by a consent decree based on their allegations of unlawful racial discrimination by the united states department of agriculture in administering its farm loan programs.the task has not been easy for a number of reasons,including the complications necessarily associated with ensuring relief to eligible class members and the deficiencies of class counsel,as determined by the district court.while the district court efforts so far have ensured that only a small portion of the class will not have their claims for monitor review considered,as a result of the court decision today,the claims of class members are unduly extinguished farmers will lose the opportunity to have independent administrative review of their claims by a monitor in accordance with the claims procedure in the consent decree,and farmers without counsel,who may not have received notice of the filing deadlines,will lose their opportunity to pursue their claims at all.
in denying appellants motion of july,for relief for these class members,and the motions for reconsideration of june,the district court clearly erred in relying on a finding of fact regarding the increased claims workload,and erred,alternatively,as a matter of law by failing to consider,in accordance with pigford veneman,pigford i,whether class counsel untimely filings was a changed circumstance within the meaning of federal rule of civil procedure b.it also erred by failing to inquire whether claimants late filings were due to the inadequacy of the notice procedures before determining whether to deny any relief under federal rule of civil procedure b.accordingly,while i concur in the holding that the july,order establishing the original filing deadlines was a final appealable order,see op.at,i would reverse and remand the case to the district court to determine whether the filing deadlines were unworkable,and thus warranting relief for class members pursuant to rule b,and to determine whether class members failed to receive notice of the filing deadlines as a result of inadequate notice procedures and were entitled to relief under rule b.
the question on appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion in denying appellants motions for an extension of the filing deadlines,and for reconsideration under rule b.evans williams,peters passenger.while our review is deferential,an abuse of discretion occurs when the district court relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact,fails to consider a relevant factor,or applies the wrong legal standard.see in re vitamins antitrust class actions,evans,at marina mgmt.servs.vessel my girls,see also kickapoo tribe of indians babbitt.
rule b provides,in relevant part,that the court may relieve a party from a final judgment,order or proceeding if it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.b.a movant under rule b must demonstrate changed circumstances since the entry of the judgment from which relief is sought.rufo inmates of the suffolk county jail,d.such change need not be unforeseeable,but only unforeseen.id.at.the supreme court in rufo explained,
ordinarily modification should not be granted where a party relies upon events that actually were anticipated at the time it entered into a decree.citations omitted if it is clear that a party anticipated changing conditions that would make performance of the decree more onerous but nevertheless agreed to the decree,that party would have to satisfy a heavy burden to convince a court that it agreed to the decree in good faith,made a reasonable effort to comply with the decree,and should be relieved of the undertaking under rule b.
id.in pigford i,the court held that changed circumstances may include unforeseen obstacles that make an order unworkable.pigford i,at see rufo,at.
the district court found that the large increase in the number of claimants occurred before the deadlines in the july order were agreed to,and therefore did not amount to unanticipated changed circumstances rendering the deadlines unworkable within the meaning of rule b.see pigford veneman,d,reconsideration denied,pigford veneman,d.in so finding the district court,as does the court today,op.at,ignored the key distinction argued by appellants in their motion for reconsideration and supported by evidence in the record.appellants pointed out that the critical changed circumstance was not the vastly greater number of total claimants,but the unanticipated large number of claimants seeking monitor review because their claims likely had been denied erroneously in the first instance by the adjudicator,and had potentially meritorious grounds for seeking monitor review.appellants explained that class counsel originally had anticipated that the vast majority of seekers of monitor review would not meet the high standards for such review set forth in the consent decree clear and manifest error that is likely to result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice,consent decree b iii and therefore,at the time they agreed to the july order deadlines,had estimated that only approximately petitions would require processing for monitor review.however,class counsel subsequently discovered that a much higher number of the claims rejected by the adjudicator were potentially meritorious claims even under the high standard for monitor review.in fact,the total volume of claims actually processed for monitor review was much higher than class counsel and the law firm chestnut,sanders ended up processing track a requests for monitor review,with other firms processing other,smaller numbers of requests.
in support of this distinction,appellants pointed to the high success rates of claims upon monitor review the facilitator report cited by appellants indicated that approximately of the claimants who had filed for review with the assistance of counsel had been approved by the monitor for reexamination by the adjudicator,and of reexamined petitions prevailed on the merits.this statistical evidence substantiated class counsel argument that many meritorious claims had been erroneously denied by the adjudicator,necessitating the filing of petitions for monitor review and creating more work for class counsel than was anticipated when the july order deadlines were agreed to.
the record further indicates that the number of class members seeking monitor review was unanticipated by either party or by the district court when the parties agreed to those deadlines.as noted,when the district court established the register of petitions process in the november,order,class counsel was estimating a total of petitions for monitor review.the district court relied on this estimate to set the filing schedule for fully supported petitions.the november order further indicated that the higher volume of petitions for monitor review was not anticipated,for the district court acknowledged that neither the department nor the monitor were prepared to handle and process the higher volume of petitions.the court stated 
it is obvious that if class counsel,of counsel and all unaffiliated counsel were forced to file thousands of fully supported petitions by november,the government would be unable to respond to them in a meaningful way within the days that it has to file a response.citation omitted furthermore,the monitor informed the court at the hearing that even if the government had the resources to complete such a task,the monitor initially will be unable to decide the petitions at a pace greater than to each month.
indeed,the district court later acknowledged at the april,status conference that some of the failings of the lawyers,if we want to call them that,are simply because people were overworked.there was much more to be done than people thought.emphasis added.
in light of the record evidence that the high number of class members seeking monitor review was unanticipated at the time the july order deadlines were agreed to,the district court clearly erred in relying on its finding in its opinion of june,that the critical changed circumstance had occurred before,not after,the relevant deadlines were agreed to,in denying appellants motion for reconsideration in its opinion of march,pigford,d at,without distinguishing between the overall number of claimants and the number of petitions for monitor review.instead,the district court denied reconsideration stating that,notwithstanding appellants further elaboration,the c ourt declines to revisit its determination that the asserted changed circumstances presented by appellants do not justify modification of the c ourt prior orders under rule b.id.while the court states that the district court established the register procedure to provide relief from the increased volume of meritorious petitions,op.at,that relief created filing problems of its own and,in any event,the district court underestimated the volume of petitions even then.
moreover,in denying appellants motions,the district court failed to consider the instruction of pigford i that where class members lack competent counsel,counsel failure to meet deadlines itself may amount to an unforeseen obstacle that makes the decree unworkable under rule b.pigford i,at.in pigford i,this court embraced the concept that the district court has a duty to protect class members where such members did not choose their counsel and where retention of other lawyers is unlikely,at,a concept embraced by other circuits as well noting that the consent decree express purpose is to ensur e that in their dealings with the department,all class members receive full and fair treatment,consent decree at,and its main accomplishment was the establishment of a process to adjudicate individual claims,this court distinguished between the failings of class counsel and the opportunity of class members to avail themselves of the remedial scheme under the consent decree the court opined that there was no basis for holding the class members responsible for counsel failure to meet deadlines which had been bargained for by the parties,pigford i,at,and held that relief was appropriate under rule b because class counsel failure to meet critical track b deadlines amounts to an unforeseen obstacle that makes the decree unworkable,id.at quoting rufo,at.
this conclusion in pigford i is no less applicable now than it was then,for t o hold otherwise would sanction the farmers double betrayal first by the department and then by their own lawyers.id.in granting an extension of track b deadlines missed due to attorney error,the district court had previously acknowledged that the general rule that attorney error is not excusable should not apply here,where t he history of this case is unique and requires more than hasty application of general practice.pigford veneman,d.this court observed in pigford i that,
t he decree itself assumes competent representation for the farmers.the decree express purpose is to ensur e that in their dealings with the department,all class members receive full and fair treatment,and its main accomplishment was the establishment of a process to adjudicate individual claims.unless the farmers have competent counsel,we can not imagine how they could ever obtain full and fair treatment in a claims process where missing a single deadline could be fatal.
at quoting consent decree,at pigford glickman.not only has the district court found class counsel performance sanctionable and imposed severe monetary fines on them,pigford veneman,d,but at a time when there was,as the district court stated,much more to be done than people thought,and the critical filing deadlines were drawing near,class counsel and were in dire financial straits as a result of the lack of payment of interim fees by the government,as appellants reminded the district court in their motion for reconsideration the district court recognized at a status conference held on april,that the delay in awarding interim fees 
had an impact on the number of lawyers and the amount of time that those lawyers are spending on the monitor petition process if you have to succeed or prevail to get paid,then getting new lawyers in the act would be hard,and i understand that it is also having an impact on the existing lawyers.class counsel has cut back on its staff.
emphasis added.
today,by affirming the denial of appellants motions,the court ignores our analysis in pigford i and the duty of the trial judge to protect class members who do not chose their own counsel when unanticipated circumstances have created a situation where there were too many cases and too few lawyers.br.for appellants at.by declining to account for pigford i contrary holding as an infringement of the district court discretion,op.at,the court ignores that pigford i involved the same unique history,the same consent decree,the same class counsel,and the same issue of modification of deadlines missed by class counsel under federal rule of civil procedure b considered in the same court,and as such its holding is nearly akin to the law of the case,in addition to being law of the circuit.see lashawn barry,en banc.that pigford i involved claims under track b rather than track a does not change the fact that the legal issue before the court is the same whether appellants are entitled to relief under rule b for counsel failures to meet filing deadlines.see op.at.while the court points out that pigford i acknowledged the presumption of client accountability for attorney conduct,it ignores that pigford i also found this presumption overcome because class counsel was not freely chosen by class members and the circumstances of the case,together with the terms of the decree,made retention of other lawyers unlikely.pigford i,at.here,the very same circumstances remain,and were further exacerbated by additional unanticipated circumstances which created a situation where there were too many cases and too few lawyers.br.for appellants at.this court can not avoid,by pointing to a different procedural posture,op.at,that the district court is bound,under pigford i,see lashawn,at,to separate class counsel failings from the claims of the class members,particularly in light of the district court affirmative duty to renew its stringent examination of the adequacy of class representation throughout the entire course of the litigation,in re fine paper antitrust litigation,cir,and that the district court failure to do so is an abuse of discretion,evans,at.
finally,while the secretary would distinguish pigford i as concerned with extinguishing a class member claim,see pigford i,at,from the denial of an opportunity to seek monitor review,from the perspective of the class member whose claim has been wrongfully denied,the effect is the same neither class member will have the opportunity to utilize the remedial process established in the consent decree.taken together,the circumstances identified in appellants motions suggest that the class members should not bear the burden of counsel failures to meet filing deadlines.in order to avoid a double betrayal of the class members,the district court was required to separate the failures of counsel from the claims of the class members in order to ensure that the opportunity to pursue the claims process established in the consent decree not be foreclosed.id.at.it did not do so,and the court today fails to explain how the district court fulfilled its responsibilities in accordance with the analysis in pigford 
because the district court,in denying the motion for reconsideration,erroneously relied on its finding in its opinion of june,that the critical changed circumstance occurred before the july order deadlines were agreed to without taking into account record evidence demonstrating that the volume of petitions for monitor relevant change in not anticipated at the time the deadlines were agreed to,and in the alternative erred as a matter of law by failing to consider whether class counsel failures to meet the deadlines amounted to an unforeseen obstacle warranting relief,i would reverse and remand the case to the district court to address whether the deadlines were unworkable under rule b.
additionally,the district court failed to inquire whether adequate notice was provided to class members,for whom appellants proffered evidence that these class members had not received notice of the filing deadlines for monitor review,in determining whether relief was warranted under the excusable neglect standard of federal rule of civil procedure b.
the july order modified the consent decree to limit the period within which class members could seek monitor review of denied claims and,as the district court noted,it did not provide for individual notice to unsuccessful track a class members instead,the july order required only that a copy of it be posted in every usda farm services agency county office,and sent by the facilitator to those persons who requested a claim sheet and election form.according to the monitor report,few people eligible to file a petition with the monitor would have received direct notice of the deadline from the mailing,and many claimants would not see a posting in a usda farm services agency county office.see monitor report to the court regarding notice to the class of the deadline to file a petition for monitor review may.the monitor attempted to remedy the situation by mailing additional notices to farmers who had either requested or made telephonic inquiries regarding claim forms.still,appellants proffered evidence that class members had received no notice of the filing deadlines.see,joint appendix at,id.at.
nonetheless,the district court denied relief under the excusable neglect standard of rule b.applying the test of pioneer inv.servs.brunswick assocs,d,the district court found first,that the government would be prejudiced to the tune of almost one million dollars by allowing consideration of late petitions if five percent were successful,and second,that because the july order deadlines were negotiated and agreed to by the appellants,it logically follows that the resulting failure to meet those deadlines had been within the reasonable control of appellants.each finding is problematic given the district court duty to ensure that adequate notice procedures were,in fact,established to provide class members with notice of filing deadlines.the district court made no finding that
