chinese daily news,cdn,a newspaper,appeals the district court judgment in an action brought by some of its employees under the federal fair labor standards act flsa and under california law.the district court certified the flsa claim as a collective action.it certified the claims as a class action under rule b and,alternatively,under rule b.in the class action,it provided for notice and opt out,but subsequently invalidated the opt outs.it granted partial summary judgment to plaintiffs held jury and bench trials entered judgment for plaintiffs awarded attorney fees to plaintiffs and conducted a new process.cdn appeals,challenging aspects of each of these rulings,as well as the jury verdict.we have jurisdiction under and we affirm.
background 
on march,three employees of cdn,lynne wang,yu fang ines kai,and hui jung pao,filed suit against cdn on behalf of current,former,and future cdn employees based in cdn san francisco and monterey park los angeles,california locations.they alleged violations of the flsa,california labor code,and california unfair competition law,cal.bus.they alleged that employees were made to work in excess of eight hours per day and forty hours per week.they further alleged that they were wrongfully denied overtime compensation,meal and rest breaks,accurate and itemized wage statements,and penalties for wages due but not promptly paid at termination.they sought monetary damages,restitution,attorney fees,and injunctive relief.
after plaintiffs narrowed the class definition to include only employees at the monterey park facility,the district court certified the flsa claim as a collective action.as we discuss in greater detail later in this opinion,group claims for violations of flsa are typically maintained as an collective action to which each participant must individually consent.
the district court certified the claims as a class action under rule b.wang chinese daily news.recognizing that rule b certification is not appropriate where claims for monetary relief predominate,the district court held that rule b certification was appropriate because plaintiffs claims for monetary and injunctive relief were on equal footing,and because future compliance by cdn was potentially the remedy of greatest value to plaintiffs.in light of the substantial claims for monetary relief,the district court exercised its discretion to provide class members notice and an opportunity to opt out.the district court later clarified that the opportunity to opt out was restricted to the claims for monetary relief.when it certified the class,the court also concluded,in the alternative,that certification was appropriate under rule b.
after the court approved the form of notice,putative class members were given a period,ending october,to opt in to the flsa action and to opt out of the claims.forms were mailed to individuals,and notice was posted and forms made available at cdn monterey park facility.plaintiffs received back about forms,including from individuals not on the original list of class members.plaintiffs filed a motion to invalidate the opt outs,for curative notice,and to restrict cdn communication with class members.on june,the court granted the motion,finding that the opt out period was rife with instances of coercive conduct,including threats to employees jobs,termination of an employee supporting the litigation,the posting of signs urging individuals not to tear the company apart,and the abnormally high rate of opt outs.wang chinese daily news.the district court deferred any future procedure until after the trial on the merits.
both sides sought summary judgment on the question whether cdn reporters were exempt or employees.employees are entitled to overtime exempt employees are not.the court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs,holding that cdn reporters did not qualify for the creative professional exemption.wang chinese daily news,d see d.plaintiffs were also granted summary judgment on other issues,from which cdn has not appealed.
cdn contended that the district court should adjudicate only the flsa claim and should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims.the court disagreed,exercising its discretion to retain supplemental jurisdiction.cdn twice more objected to the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction,and objected,further,that the claim was preempted by flsa.the district court rejected these objections.
the court held a jury trial starting in november,and the jury returned a special verdict on january.on appeal,cdn challenges the jury finding that cdn did not provide reporters with meal breaks.cdn also challenges the amount of damages awarded on all class claims,contending that the award was based on a class that was too large.
from july,to august,the court held a bench trial on the remaining issues of injunctive relief,penalties,prejudgment interest,and restitution pursuant to the claim.the court concluded,inter alia,that a cause of action under based on violations of flsa was not preempted.it denied an injunction after concluding that cdn had abandoned its unlawful business practices and had taken substantial steps toward compliance,and that plaintiffs remaining injuries could be remedied by money damages.on appeal,cdn contends that the district court erred in permitting salespersons who had not opted in to the flsa collective action to pursue claims for relief under based on flsa violations.
the district court entered judgment,denied cdn motions,and granted plaintiffs motion for attorney fees.on may,the court issued an order establishing a new window to opt out of the class action and appointing a special master to oversee the process and distribution of the award.out of class members to whom notice was sent,opted in,opted out,and did not respond.on june,the district court issued an order providing that distribution of unclaimed shares of the award from class members who had opted in,and the share of the award attributable to those who had opted out,would await the running of the statute of limitations on the filing of individual suits against cdn.
cdn timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
reporters exemption status 
cdn argues that the district court erred in holding on summary judgment that cdn reporters were employees entitled to overtime.specifically,cdn argues that its reporters were subject to the creative professional exemption and were therefore exempt employees not subject to flsa and overtime pay and break requirements.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.bamonte city of mesa,cir.
federal law exempts employers from paying overtime to any employee employed in a bona fide professional capacity.a.to qualify as an exempt professional under federal law,an employee must be compensated at a rate of not less than per week,and his or her primary duty must be the performance of exempt work.a n employee primary duty must be the performance of work requiring invention,imagination,originality or talent in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor as opposed to routine mental,manual,mechanical or physical work.a.the exemption is construed narrowly against the employer who seeks to assert it.cleveland city of los angeles,cir.california wage and hour law largely tracks federal law.see industrial welfare commission order a b defining professional to include an employee who is primarily engaged in the performance of w ork that is original and creative in character in a recognized field of artistic endeavor and the result of which depends primarily on the invention,imagination,or talent of the employee see also id.a e directing that the exemption is intended to be construed in accordance with inter alia,as it existed as of the date of this wage order.
as applied to journalists,the federal department of labor construed the creative professional exemption in a regulation 
journalists may satisfy the duties requirements for the creative professional exemption if their primary duty is work requiring invention,imagination,originality or talent,as opposed to work which depends primarily on intelligence,diligence and accuracy.employees of newspapers,magazines,television and other media are not exempt creative professionals if they only collect,organize and record information that is routine or already public,or if they do not contribute a unique interpretation or analysis to a news product.thus,for example,newspaper reporters who merely rewrite press releases or who write standard recounts of public information by gathering facts on routine community events are not exempt creative professionals.reporters also do not qualify as exempt creative professionals if their work product is subject to substantial control by the employer.however,journalists may qualify as exempt creative professionals if their primary duty is performing on the air in radio,television or other electronic media conducting investigative interviews analyzing or interpreting public events writing editorials,opinion columns or other commentary or acting as a narrator or commentator.
d.unlike the interpretation it replaced,the regulation was promulgated pursuant to notice and comment rulemaking and therefore has the force of law.see.in promulgating the new regulation,the department of labor explained that t he majority of journalists,who simply collect and organize information that is already public,or do not contribute a unique or creative interpretation or analysis to a news product,are not likely to be exempt.id.at.although we have not decided a case applying the creative professional exemption to journalists,other courts have explored the circumstances under which print journalists qualify for the exemption.in reich gateway press,cir,the third circuit concluded that none of the reporters at a chain of nineteen local weeklies was exempt.the newspapers largely contained information about the events of their respective local communities overlooked by the pittsburgh metropolitan daily press.id.at.the reporters primarily generated articles and features using what they knew about the local community,spent of their time accumulating facts,and mostly filed recast press releases or information taken from public records.they wrote a feature article or editorial about once per month.id.at.the court held that they were among the majority of reporters who were.id.at.it noted that the work was not the type of fact gathering that demands the skill or expertise of an investigative journalist for the philadelphia inquirer or washington post,or a bureau chief for the new york times.id.at.
in reich newspapers of new england,cir,the first circuit similarly held that reporters and other employees employed by a small community newspaper were not exempt professionals.the duties of the reporters involved general assignment work covering hearings,criminal and policy activity,and legislative proceedings and business events.employees were not asked to editorialize about or interpret the events they covered.id.at.they,too,were therefore among the majority of reporters who were not exempt,even though their work occasionally demonstrated creativity,invention,imagination,or talent.id.
by comparison,in sherwood washington post,the district court held that a washington post reporter whose job required him to originate his own story ideas,maintain a wide network of sources,write engaging,imaginative prose,and produce stories containing thoughtful analysis of complex issues was exempt.as a investigative journalist who had held multiple positions of prominence at one of the nation top newspapers,the reporter was the sort of elite journalist whom the creative professional exemption was intended to cover.
the parties in this case submitted extensive evidence on summary judgment.reporters stated in their depositions that they wrote between two and four articles per day,and that they very seldom did investigative reporting.the reporters proposed articles,but the editors gave considerate direction and frequently assigned the topics.one reporter explained that with having to write so much,you did have enough time analyze anything.some time was spent rewriting press releases.there were no senior reporters or others with distinctive titles,and each of the reporters performed essentially the same tasks.
editors declarations submitted by cdn,on the other hand,stated that articles include background,analysis and perspective on events and news,that cdn employs some of the most talented reporters in the chinese newspaper industry,and that the reporters have extensive control over their time,pace of work,and ideas for articles to write.they stated that reporters must cultivate sources,sift through significant amounts of information,and analyze complicated issues.several editors stated that they approved more than of the topics suggested by reporters.reporters salaries ranged from to per month.
although the evidence submitted revealed disputes over how to characterize cdn journalists,we agree with the district court that,even when viewing the facts in the light most favorable to cdn,the reporters do not satisfy the criteria for the creative professional exemption.cdn monterey park los angeles operation,with twelve to fifteen reporters and a local circulation of,is not quite as small or unsophisticated as the community newspapers described in the newspapers of new england and gateway press cases.but cdn is much closer to the community newspapers described in those cases than to the new york times or washington post.as the district court explored in detail,the materials submitted on summary judgment make clear that cdn articles do not have the sophistication of the papers at which one might expect to find the small minority of journalists who are exempt.moreover,the intense pace at which cdn reporters work precludes them from engaging in sophisticated analysis.cdn reporters primary duties do not involve conducting investigative interviews analyzing or interpreting public events or writing editorial s,opinion columns or other commentary,d,even if they engage in these activities some of the time.indeed,many cdn articles may be characterized as standard recounts of public information created by gathering facts on routine community events,as opposed to the product of analysis.characterizing cdn journalists as exempt would therefore be inconsistent with the department of labor intent that the majority of journalists are not likely to be exempt.at,and with the requirement that flsa exemptions be construed narrowly.
the evidence before the district court did not create a genuine issue of material fact as to the reporters status.we therefore affirm the district court determination on summary judgment that cdn reporters were employees who were entitled to the protections of the flsa and california law.
class certification order 
the district court certified the class under rule b,and held,in the alternative,that the prerequisites of rule b were also satisfied.a class need satisfy only one of the rule b prongs.dukes stores,cir en banc.
rule b requires a showing that the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.b.claims for monetary relief may be certified as part of a rule b class,but the rule does not extend to cases in which the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or predominantly to money damages.dukes,at quoting.b advisory committee note to amends.
cdn challenges the district court decision to certify the class under rule b,arguing that claims for money damages predominated.we subject class certification decisions to limited review.see id.at a district court decision regarding class certification is not only reviewed for abuse of discretion,but is also subject to very limited review,to be reversed only upon a strong showing that the district court decision was a clear abuse of discretion.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in dukes,we rejected as deficient two approaches that courts have used for determining when a class that includes claims for monetary relief can be certified under rule b the molski approach that focuses on plaintiffs subjective intent,because it is unlikely to yield a precise answer and the allison incidental damages standard that permits certification of claims for monetary relief under rule b only when they are incidental to requested injunctive or declaratory relief,because it is unduly restrictive.see id.at citing molski gleich,cir allison citgo petroleum,cir.
although the district court did not have the benefit of our en banc decision in dukes,it applied a certification standard at least as stringent as what dukes requires.the district court certified the class only after concluding that the monetary relief claims do not predominate in this case but rather appear to be on equal footing with the claims for injunctive relief.wang,at.because dukes interpreted rule b to require only that claims for monetary relief not predominate over claims for injunctive relief,the district court did not err in applying a standard allowing rule b certification when the claims are on equal footing.
nor did the district court abuse its discretion in holding that plaintiffs claims for monetary relief did not,in fact,predominate.there were substantial claims for injunctive relief in this case.plaintiffs sought to enjoin a longstanding set of employment policies and sought monetary relief for current and past employees allegedly injured by those policies.because the claims for monetary and injunctive relief were closely related,the request for monetary relief neither introduce d new and significant legal and factual issues,nor raised particular due process or manageability concerns.see dukes,at.cdn current constitute the vast majority of the to benefit significantly from an award of injunctive relief.as the district court pointed out in its certification ruling,d efendant future compliance with the law may be more valuable to the class than the present claims for back pay.wang,at.
at oral argument,with the benefit of our decision in dukes,cdn contended that the district court erred in determining the suitability of plaintiffs claims for class treatment without inquiring into the merits of those claims.it pointed to the district court citation to blackie barrack,cir,for the proposition that in deciding a class certification motion,the court is bound to take the substantive allegations of the complaint as true.we agree with cdn that in dukes we firmly rejected any suggestion that a district court,in deciding a class certification motion,may not look behind the pleadings to overlapping merits issues.see dukes,at.however,any reference to the incorrect blackie standard by the district court was harmless.in determining whether the requirements of rule were met,the district court appropriately considered and relied upon the evidence submitted by the parties at the class certification stage.for example,in its discussion of rule a numerosity requirement,during which the district court cited blackie at the end of a see also string cite,the court considered several declarations in determining whether the requirement was satisfied.see wang,at.
the district court rule b discussion did rely primarily on the complaint to understand the nature of plaintiffs claims.a district court need not always look beyond the complaint,however,and under the circumstances,it was appropriate for the court to focus on the complaint to determine the relationship between claims for monetary and injunctive relief.see dukes,at the rigorous analysis to ensure that the prerequisites of rule have been satisfied will often,though not always,require looking behind the pleadings to issues overlapping with the merits of the underlying claims.the evidence submitted by both parties at the class certification stage focused on plaintiffs substantive nature of the employees work,working hours and requirements,compensation policies,the provision of meal and rest break periods,and the union campaign and nlrb proceedings.this evidence had little to do with the relationship between the claims for injunctive and monetary relief,and thus would not have been helpful to the district court rule b analysis.
we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in certifying a rule b class.we therefore do not reach the parties arguments regarding whether the alternative rule b certification was appropriate 
and notice order 
cdn objects to the district court decision to invalidate the opt outs,to delay holding a second process until after the trial,and to uphold fully rather than reduce the damages award to account for those who had opted out.we address each of cdn objections in turn.
invalidation of the opt outs 
federal rule of civil procedure d gives district courts discretionary authority,within the bounds of rule,to exercise control over a class action.gulf oil bernard,in re victor techs.sec,cir obviously district courts must have broad discretion,resting on the specific facts of each case,in framing procedures for class actions under.in gulf oil,the supreme court reasoned that because of opportunities for abuse and management challenges in class actions,district courts have both the duty and the broad authority to exercise control over a class action and to enter appropriate orders governing the conduct of counsel and parties.at.
in the face of evidence of coercive behavior by a party opposing a class,district courts may regulate communications with class members related to the notice and processes.in kleiner first national bank of atlanta,cir,which involved a massive,secret effort by the defendant to persuade class members to opt out,the eleventh circuit held that a district court power to manage a class action included the power to prohibit a defendant from making unsupervised,unilateral communications with the plaintiff class.in in re school asbestos litigation,cir,the third circuit drew on gulf oil in holding that upon making a clear record and specific findings,a district court could control communications because m isleading communications to class members concerning the litigation pose a serious threat to the fairness of the litigation process,the adequacy of representation and the administration of justice generally.in in re community bank of northern virginia,cir,the third circuit discussed with approval the procedure undertaken in georgine amchem products,in which the district court remedied misleading communications from counsel by invalidating all requests,providing curative notice,and ordering a second period.
as these cases make clear,rule d gives district courts the power to regulate the notice and processes and to impose limitations when a party engages in behavior that threatens the fairness of the litigation.a district court has especially broad discretion when,as here,notice and the opportunity to opt out are not required by rule but are ordered by the district court in the exercise of its discretion.see dukes,at linney cellular alaska,cir.compare rule c a providing that court may direct appropriate notice to members of a rule b or b class,with rule c b providing that court must direct the best notice that is practicable under the circumstances to members of a rule b class,and enumerating seven items that must be included in such notice.as an appellate court,our task is to determine whether the district court clearly erred in concluding that cdn had in fact engaged in coercive conduct,and whether it abused its discretion in invaliding the first process on that basis.
plaintiffs submitted evidence that class representative hui jung pao was terminated the day before her deposition,about four months after the lawsuit was filed,and that lead class representative lynne wang was terminated during the period.plaintiffs also submitted a declaration from cdn employee jeffrey sun,detailing coercive techniques to which he was subject,and one from wang,detailing and activity in close proximity to the period.both declarations also included hearsay materials that the district court struck,on which we do not rely.plaintiffs also submitted by there was a large sign over the table on which the forms were placed,proclaiming do tear the company apart do act against each other finally,plaintiffs submitted a declaration from the president of a class action notice company explaining that ordinarily rates do not exceed one percent.in this case,the district court found that current employees opted out at a percent rate,whereas former employees opted out at a percent rate.
cdn responded with evidence that wang employment was terminated for cause,detailed an nlrb investigation that supposedly exonerated cdn,and provided more details about the union organizing activity that had taken place.it argued that the high rate of opt outs reflected a strong uncoerced desire by employees not to participate in the suit.cdn also submitted declarations from employees and supervisory personnel attesting that they were not aware of any communications from cdn to class members regarding the lawsuit.in invalidating the opt outs,the court struck several employees declarations because they came from class members with whom cdn counsel should not have communicated.
after reviewing the evidence,the district court found that the opt out period was rife with instances of coercive conduct,including threats to employees jobs,termination of an employee supporting the litigation,the posting of signs urging individuals not to tear the company apart,and the abnormally high rate of opt outs.wang,at.although cdn disputes whether some of this conduct took place,the district court factual findings were supported by the evidence before it and were not clearly erroneous.based on these findings,the district court did not abuse its discretion in invalidating the opt outs and in restricting cdn ability to communicate with class members.
deferral of second procedure until after trial on the merits 
cdn challenges the district court decision to defer holding another process until after the trial on the merits.cdn argues that the process must take place early in the litigation so that members of the putative class can not gauge the progress of the case,or know the result,before choosing whether to opt out.see am.pipe const.utah.
we have repeatedly held that the practice of giving class members notice and an opportunity to opt out exists primarily to protect class members due process rights,since they will otherwise be bound by a final judgment litigated by others on their behalf.see hanlon chrysler,cir valentino,cir in re gypsum antitrust cases,cir.the ordinary procedure is to give notice at the time of class certification.but the rule does not mandate notice at any particular time.see.c.when,as here,there is a need to regulate the notice and processes to maintain the integrity of the action in the face of a party coercive activity,a district court does not abuse its discretion in delaying the process,if necessary,until after the trial on the merits.we reiterate that a district court discretion to manage the notice and processes is particularly broad in a rule b or b class action where notice and the opportunity to opt out are not mandatory.
the district court in this case determined that holding another election immediately would not only delay the trial,but also would not avoid the coercion that had tainted the initial process.the court made these determinations only after it made specific findings regarding cdn coercive behavior.we hold that in these circumstances the district court acted within its discretion to regulate the process to diminish the effects of the prior coercion and to avoid further coercion.
reducing the damages award 
cdn challenges the district court failure to reduce the damages award to account for a smaller actual class size than the size presented to the jury as a basis for awarding damages.this challenge is premature.
cdn may eventually be entitled to a return of excess or unclaimed funds.see six mex.workers.citrus growers,cir r eversion to the defendant may be appropriate when deterrence is not a goal of the statute or is not required by the circumstances.williams commc ns,cir per curiam assuming that when absent class members do not have a calculable interest in unclaimed money,the balance of a fund is returned to defendants.the district court,however,has entered an order providing that it will await the running of the statute of limitations on the filing of individual suits against cdn before calculating any distribution of excess and unclaimed funds.
jury verdict 
california law provides that a n employer may not employ an employee for a work period of more than five hours per day without providing the employee with a meal period of not less than minutes.cal.labor code a.the jury found that cdn did not provide reporters with meal breaks.cdn appeals,arguing that substantial evidence does not support this finding.see eeoc go daddy software,cir explaining that properly presented challenges to a jury verdict are reviewed for substantial evidence.
the parties dispute what it means to provide a meal break.a pair of cases now pending in the california supreme court present the question whether employers need only provide meal breaks in the sense that they do not impede their employees from taking such breaks,or whether employers have an affirmative obligation to ensure that workers are actually relieved of all duties during a meal period.brinkley pub.storage,review granted,cal,brinker rest,review granted,cal,see jaimez daiohs usa,discussing unsettled nature of california law on meal breaks.
we need not resolve this dispute or wait for the california supreme court to do so.even if the california supreme court interprets california law to place only minimal obligations on employers,the evidence presented to the jury was sufficient to support a finding that cdn did not provide reporters with meal breaks.the evidence showed that reporters did not have time to take meal breaks because they worked long,harried hours and faced tight deadlines.there was testimony that reporters were required to carry pagers all the time and be on call from morning until night without ever getting a sustained period.the evidence showed that reporters did not keep time cards and that pay stubs did not reflect time actually worked.several reporters also testified that they could rarely take uninterrupted minute breaks.cdn never told reporters that meal breaks were available and never told them to keep track of meal breaks on a time card.
in short,reporters could not take daily,uninterrupted minute breaks regardless of whether they desired to do so.under either possible reading of california labor code a,cdn did not provide its reporters with meal breaks.substantial evidence therefore supports the jury verdict.
unfair business practices claim 
california business and professions code permits recovery for any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.cal.bus.an action based on this statute borrows violations of other laws and treats these violations,when committed pursuant to business activity,as unlawful practices independently actionable under section.farmers ins.exch,cal th.
plaintiffs claim borrowed flsa as the substantive violation.cdn argues that such a claim is logically impossible,renders the federal scheme meaningless,and allows a federal tail to wag what is in substance a state dog.the district court rejected cdn argument that a cause of action alleging violations of flsa under is preempted by flsa.we review the district court decision regarding preemption de novo.am.trucking ass ns,city of los angeles,cir.the district court also rejected cdn request that it decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims.we review whether the district court had supplemental jurisdiction de novo,trs.of constr.indus.laborers health welfare trust hartford fire ins,cir per curiam,and review its decision to exercise that jurisdiction for abuse of discretion,satey jpmorgan chase,cir.
