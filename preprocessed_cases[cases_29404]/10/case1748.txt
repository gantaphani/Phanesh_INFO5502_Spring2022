plaintiffs eugene levy and sharon battle challenge the judgment entered after the trial court sustained defendant state farm mutual automobile insurance company state farm demurrer to plaintiffs fifth amended complaint without leave to amend,granted state farm motion to strike class action allegations without leave to amend,and granted defendant motion to dismiss battle on the grounds of forum non conveniens.plaintiffs contend they have properly alleged both individual and class claims arising from state farm practice of omitting certain labor and material costs from its repair estimates,and using its own contracted repair shops in its survey to determine the prevailing competitive repair labor rates included in its estimates.
we conclude the trial court properly sustained state farm demurrers without leave to amend.state farm insurance policy obligated it to repair its insureds vehicles to their preaccident condition.the fifth amended complaint fails to describe how following state farm repair estimates would not have restored levy or battle vehicles to their preaccident condition.instead,the complaint alleges state farm repair estimates failed to include items required by industry repair standards.california regulators,however,have not specified any particular repair standards and have not required insurers to follow such standards.moreover,nothing in plaintiffs insurance contracts required state farm to follow the standards preferred by plaintiffs.similarly,no policy provision or law precludes state farm from including its contracted repair shops in determining prevailing competitive repair labor rates.we therefore affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
levy,a california resident,purchased a state farm auto insurance policy that obligated state farm to pay the cost of repair or replacement for covered vehicles if damaged.the policy provides that the cost of repair or replacement is based on one of the following.the cost of repair or replacement agreed upon by the insured and state farm.a competitive bid approved by us or.an estimate written based upon the prevailing competitive price.the prevailing competitive price means prices charged by a majority of the repair market in the area which the car is to be repaired as determined by a survey made by state farm.if you ask,state farm will identify some facilities that will perform the repairs at the prevailing competitive price 
in august,levy car was involved in an accident and suffered damage to its right front wheel,right front fender,right front bumper,steering box,suspension,and lower body.levy brought the damaged vehicle to a state farm facility,where an employee estimated the cost of repair using state farm software.the estimator then offered to pay levy,less the policy deductible,instead of having the vehicle repaired.levy accepted the payment.
battle,an illinois resident,also purchased a state farm auto insurance policy containing a repair or replacement provision similar to levy policy.in january,an accident damaged the left front end and left fender of battle car.battle took her car to a state farm estimating facility,and at state farm request,had her car repaired at a state repair shop.
believing state farm repair estimates were inadequate,levy and battle sued state farm on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated.after several state farm demurrers were sustained with leave to amend,plaintiffs filed their fifth amended complaint,seeking damages,restitution,and declaratory and injunctive relief.the fifth amended complaint alleges that state farm provides its policyholders repair estimates which do not meet industry standards as defined by automobile manufacturers,the conference on auto collision repair,or the national institute for automotive service excellence ase.

the complaint further alleges that state farm contracts with repair shops to follow state farm estimate of necessary repairs,even if the shop professionals might believe additional repairs are required.state farm will not pay for repairs not specified in state farm estimate.the complaint also alleges the labor rates state farm uses in its estimates are below market rates because state farm uses only its own contracted repair shops in conducting the survey that determined the prevailing competitive price required by the insurance contract.
state farm demurred to the fifth amended complaint,moved to strike the class allegations,and sought dismissal of battle claims on the grounds of forum non conveniens.the trial court granted the demurrers without leave to amend,granted the motion to strike,and dismissed battle claims based on forum non conveniens.plaintiffs now appeal.
