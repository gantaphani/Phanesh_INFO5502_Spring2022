introduction 
we are asked to apply the newly enacted code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,which expressly excludes lawsuits from the reach of special motions to strike.
directv sent demand letters to thousands of people who purchased certain devices that can pirate directv television programming,requesting the recipients cease using the devices.plaintiffs,recipients of these demand letters,filed their complaint against directv,alleging that the conduct of mailing the demand letters was an unfair business practice bus,the ucl,a violation of plaintiffs civil rights,and extortion.the trial court granted the special motion of directv to strike code civ,plaintiffs complaint and awarded directv attorney fees.plaintiffs appeal.
plaintiffs contend code of civil procedure section,subdivision b protects their ucl claim from dismissal under the procedure.in the published portion of this opinion parts i ii,we hold plaintiffs ucl claim was not brought in the public interest and therefore is not entitled to protection under section,subdivision b from the special motion to strike with respect to the merits of the motion,the trial court did not err in granting directv motion to strike and dismissing the complaint directv demand letters are absolutely privileged under civil code section,subdivision b.
in the unpublished portion of this opinion part iii,we hold the court did not abuse its discretion in fixing the attorney fee award.accordingly,we affirm the judgment in all respects.
factual and procedural background 
directv provides satellite television programming by subscription or on a basis to millions of households nationwide.to secure its system and prevent unauthorized reception of its programs,directv electronically scrambles,or encrypts,its satellite transmissions.directv also investigates and prosecutes hackers and pirates,those who circumvent the encryption to obtain unauthorized use of the services.
with the aim of protecting its business interests,directv obtained several writs of seizure authorizing the united states marshal to seize and impound products and business records from designers,manufacturers,and distributors of equipment used to decrypt and misappropriate directv satellite signal.during the seizures,directv obtained customer lists identifying individuals who purchased decryption devices in response to advertising aimed at directv subscribers.the devices enable users to steal directv programming.
directv then sent demand letters to thousands of customers thus identified,explaining that use of illegal equipment to gain access to directv programming violated federal law the communications act,et the wiretap act,and seeking cooperation of the letters recipients to stop the pirating.the letters provided the recipients with an opportunity to resolve the matter by way of settlement before commencement of suit.thereafter,directv filed federal lawsuits nationwide against more than people who purchased the pirating devices 
the class action lawsuit.
plaintiffs are recipients of directv demand letters.to solicit plaintiffs for this case,counsel searched internet sites promoting satellite television piracy.plaintiffs complaint against directv alleges three causes of action violation of the ucl,interference with civil rights,and extortion and duress.
the operative complaint alleges the demands constitute extortion.the complaint also alleges the following none of the pieces of electronic equipment triggering the demand letters is contraband or illegal.at most,they are pieces of hardware that have many innocent uses,but which under certain circumstances and if certain other conditions are met,could in knowledgeable hands be used to receive unauthorized satellite transmissions.original italics.directv sent demand letters to every name found on customer lists without first ascertaining whether the letter recipients actually possessed the hardware and used it in some improper fashion.the purpose of the demand letters was to intimidate and coerce the recipients into forfeiting the equipment and to extort money.many of the statements contained in the demand letters were false,misleading,or deceptive.for example,the letter repeatedly implies that,unless the recipient settled,directv would seek monetary damages and the recipient could face civil and criminal prosecution.the demand letters also contained a list of demands which must be met in timely fashion or directv threatened to initiate legal proceedings,and abandon its attempts to negotiate.
the complaint further alleges that a secondary demand letter was sent to some of the plaintiffs several weeks or months later.the second letter reiterated the accusations of piracy and stated that,unless the recipient contacted the sender within days,a lawsuit would be filed based on a draft complaint that was enclosed with the letter.
plaintiffs complaint alleged that the conduct of sending the demand letters violated the ucl,interfered with plaintiffs exercise of their civil right to be from personal insult,defamation,and injury to their personal relations,and constituted extortion and duress.
the special motion to strike pursuant to the statute.
directv filed its special motion to strike the complaint in its entirety pursuant to code of civil procedure section,commonly referred to as the statute.directv asserted first that the complaint arose from directv demand letter,which letter was sent in anticipation of litigation and was thus an exercise of directv constitutional right to petition to seek redress of grievances protected by the statute.second,directv asserted,plaintiffs could not carry their burden to show a reasonable probability of success on the merits of their lawsuit because directv demand letter was immune from liability under the litigation privilege,subd.b.
plaintiffs opposed the special motion to strike by addressing only the second prong of the test under code of civil procedure section.they presented evidence in an attempt to show a prima facie case with respect to all three causes of action.on the issue of directv affirmative defense of the litigation privilege,plaintiffs asserted they had evidence to create a triable issue about its applicability.in particular,they attempted to show that not all of the devices are used for illegal purposes the records that directv seized did not indicate how the devices would be used many demand letters were sent after the statute of limitations had run and the only judgments directv had obtained so far in their federal litigation on the demand letters across the united states were default judgments.
directv responded by submitting,through a request for judicial notice,excerpts from directv,derek trone,et,in which the united states district court for the central district of california granted directv motion for partial summary judgment against a manufacturer and seller of signal theft devices in violation of the communications act e.the court in trone ruled,while the electronic devices might be used for lawful purposes,that the issue under the communications act is whether the defendant knew,or had reason to know,that the devices were primarily of assistance in the unauthorized decryption of satellite system.e.directv also submitted a copy of the writ to the united states marshal to seize any and all devices and a ny other hardware device designed or intended for the purpose of circumventing directv conditional access system.
the trial court ruling.
the trial court granted directv motion.code civ.the court found that all of plaintiffs claims arose from the demand letters,which t he parties agree constitute protected communications in furtherance of directv right of petition under the united states and california constitutions.
the burden then shifted to plaintiffs to show a probability that they would prevail on their claims.the trial court found that directv demand letters were absolutely protected by the litigation privilege,subd.b because the letters were sent in good faith,serious contemplation of litigation.after sending the demand letters,the court noted,directv filed more than lawsuits.accordingly,the trial court granted directv motion.
after the court awarded directv attorney fees in the amount of,plaintiffs appeals ensued.code civ,subd.j.
discussion 
i.the newly enacted exception to the motion code civ.
plaintiffs argue that the newly enacted code of civil procedure section applies to the present case.hence,even if their entire complaint were previously vulnerable to a motion to strike under section,their ucl cause of action is now immune to that procedure 
by way of background,the statute code civ,subjects certain which arise from acts in furtherance of the federal and state constitutional rights of petition or free speech in connection with a public a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b the statute is designed to encourage participation in matters of public significance through the valid exercise of the constitutional rights and to prevent the chilling of such participation by the abuse of the judicial process,subd.a.
based on its finding that there had been a disturbing abuse of section,the legislature enacted code of civil procedure section,to limit application of section to specified types of actions,subd.a.according to the sponsor of code of civil procedure section,senator sheila kuehl,the same types of businesses who used the slapp action were inappropriately using the motion against their adversaries.hence,the legislature expressly designed subdivision b of section to prevent the use of the device against specified public interest actions,among others.assem.com.on judiciary,on bill reg.sess.as amended june.subdivision b of section makes the procedure inapplicable to any action brought solely in the public interest or on behalf of the general public,subd.b,italics added.
however,not all public interest or class actions are intended to be automatically exempt from the law.com.on judiciary,on bill reg.sess.three conditions must exist to invoke the protections of subdivision b of code of civil procedure section.
in particular,subdivision b of section of the code of civil procedure,states section does not apply to any action brought solely in the public interest or on behalf of the general public if all of the following conditions exist 
the plaintiff does not seek any relief greater than or different from the relief sought for the general public or a class of which the plaintiff is a member.a claim for attorney fees,costs,or penalties does not constitute greater or different relief for purposes of this subdivision.
the action,if successful,would enforce an important right affecting the public interest,and would confer a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,on the general public or a large class of persons.
private enforcement is necessary and places a disproportionate financial burden on the plaintiff in relation to the plaintiff stake in the matter.italics added.
the legislature sharply defined the exception of subdivision b of section by reference to the three factors corresponding to the state private attorney general statute so that subdivision b parallels the existing exception for actions by the attorney general and public prosecutors.assem.com.on judiciary,on bill,supra,as amended june.the three conditions of code of civil procedure section,subdivision b through mirror the three elements for determining the eligibility for a fee award under the private attorney general doctrine as codified in section.see woodland hills residents,city council cal d,establishing three elemental criteria for fees under the private attorney general doctrine codified in.
the second and third elements of code of civil procedure section,subdivision b are absent here.accordingly,plaintiffs action does not fall within the new exception to the procedure.
with respect to the second element,there is no question but that plaintiffs ucl claim,if successful,would not enforce an important right affecting the public interest.code civ,subd.b.based on the allegations of the complaint,plaintiffs want to enjoin directv from sending this particular demand letter concerning this specific electronic device to users of this device.they are not seeking to assert some general right not to receive demand letters or notices.nor do they seek a declaration about demand letters in general.notwithstanding the number of the recipients of the letters rank in the thousands,there is no public interest principle being vindicated by this action.woodland hills residents,city council,supra,cal d at.regardless of the outcome of this lawsuit,properly worded demand letters will remain a standard practice designed to avoid the necessity of legal action.fuhrman california satellite systems d.legal practice to communicate promptly with potential adversaries,setting out the claims on them,urging settlement,and warning of alternative of judicial action larmour campanale d.same lerette dean witter organization,d.same.in fact,sometimes notices are required by statute.see,code civ,letter required before filing medical malpractice claim,et notice requirements under tort claims act.therefore,if plaintiff ucl claim were successful,it would establish no ringing declaration of the rights of all purchasers,nor would it lead to a wholesale change in the practice of sending demand letters.family planning specialists medical group,powers th,d,quoting from pacific legal foundation california coastal com.cal d,no enforcement of public right where the plaintiffs enforced solely their own interests.
more important,the third element,the necessity and financial burden factor code civ,subd.b,is absent in this case.it has been said about this element that the less direct or concrete a personal interest someone has,the more likely he or she will satisfy the element and be eligible for fees under the statute.thus,in practice,the necessity and financial burden element of section tends to be analyzed like golf is scored the lower the better.hammond agran th,d.

here,plaintiffs can not satisfy the necessity and financial burden factor of code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.plaintiffs ucl claim is entirely personal to them.plaintiffs seek an accounting to them and restitution to them of moneys they paid to directv.given plaintiffs ucl claim enforces no important public interest,the benefits that would be conferred on plaintiffs,if they were victorious in this lawsuit,far transcend any conceivable benefit to the general public.plaintiffs personal stake in this,not receiving these letters from directv about these exceeds the effect that this lawsuit could possibly have on the public at large.williams san francisco bd.of permit appeals th,d planned parenthood city of santa maria th,d.
our conclusion that plaintiffs in this case can not avail themselves of code of civil procedure section protection from directv special motion to strike comports with the stated purpose behind section,subdivision b.the statute excepts from its sweep actions filed by public prosecutors,and so the amendment was designed to provide a parallel protection when people are acting only in the public interest as private attorneys general,and are not seeking any special relief for themselves.assem.com.on judiciary,on bill,supra,as amended july,italics added.suits motivated by personal gain are not exempted from the motion.this is necessary because there are some abusive uses of the unfair competition law that should be subject to the slapp motion c ases that are motivated by personal gain would not be covered by the exemption,italics added.because this lawsuit is not designed to confer a benefit upon anyone other than plaintiffs,it is only motivated by personal gain.thus,as it only benefits plaintiffs,this ucl action is not covered by section exception.
in arguing that code of civil procedure section,subdivision b applies to this case precluding directv from striking the ucl cause of action,plaintiffs assert that the sheer number of demand letter recipients,and hence the massive size of the alleged class of plaintiffs,demonstrates that the complaint was brought in the public interest.even if,by virtue of the size of the alleged class,success of the lawsuit might affect a large class of persons under the second element of section,subdivision b,the benefit it would confer would not be legally significant.moreover,plaintiffs can not meet the third element,subd.b,and all three factors must be met for the exception to apply,subd.b.no matter how they characterize their complaint,plaintiffs stake is personal to them as recipients of this particular demand letter.they do not seek to protect the public right to use these devices or to be free of demand letters.we are unconvinced by plaintiffs portrayal of themselves as the david against the corporate goliath.the complaint prayer exposes this cause of action as motivated by personal gain.this lawsuit is not protected from the statute by section 
to summarize,code of civil procedure section does not apply to this ucl claim because plaintiffs can not demonstrate the second and third factors of subdivision b.because section,subdivision b does not protect plaintiffs ucl claim,the trial court correctly entertained directv special motion to strike under code of civil procedure section.
ii.the motion and the standard of appellate review.
having established that plaintiffs ucl claim is not protected by the exception of code of civil procedure section,we turn to the merits of directv special motion to strike the complaint.
the purpose of the statute and the burdens of proof.
as noted,the statute subjects a cause of action arising from an act taken in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established a probability of success on the claim.code civ,subd.b set forth ante,at fn.
code of civil procedure section subdivision b involves a process.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity,namely that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,subd.b.if the court finds such a showing has been made,it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.citation.hms capital,lawyers title,supra,th at,d.
in evaluating the special motion to strike and opposition,t he court considers the pleadings and evidence submitted by both sides,but does not weigh credibility or compare the weight of the evidence.rather,the court responsibility is to accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff citation and evaluate the defendant evidence only to determine if it has defeated that submitted by the plaintiff as a matter of law.citations.the trial court merely determines whether a prima facie showing has been made that would warrant the claim going forward.citation.hms capital,lawyers title,supra,th at,d,italics added.
whether plaintiffs have established a prima facie case is a question of law.citation.citation.hms capital,lawyers title,supra,th at,d.on appeal,w e review the trial court rulings on an motion de novo,conducting an independent review of the entire record.citations.ibid.
plaintiffs can not demonstrate a prima facie probability of success in their lawsuit under the second prong of the analysis of code of civil procedure section.
as explained,the threshold task is for directv,as defendant,to show that the challenged cause of action arises from protected activity.hms capital,lawyers title,supra,th at,d.neither in their opposition to the motion,nor on appeal,do plaintiffs argue that directv failed to make this necessary showing.effectively,therefore,plaintiffs have conceded that their lawsuit arises from directv free speech or petitioning activity code civ,subd.b,with the result that their claims are subject to the statute.indeed,plaintiffs can not successfully argue that their complaint does not arise from directv constitutionally protected right to petition for redress of grievances.the entire lawsuit is premised on directv demand letter,sent in advance of,or to avoid,litigation to vindicate its right not to have its programming pirated.
turning then to the second prong,because the lawsuit was subject to scrutiny under code of civil procedure section,the burden shifted to plaintiffs to establish a prima facie probability of prevailing in the litigation.
directv argued,and the trial court agreed,that plaintiffs could not make this showing because the demand letters,which serve as the sole basis for the lawsuit,were absolutely privileged under civil code section,subdivision b.plaintiffs counter that they have presented sufficient evidence for a trier of fact to determine whether the litigation privilege applies in this case.
the litigation privilege protects a publication or broadcast b in any judicial proceeding,subd.b.the privilege applies to any communication made in judicial or proceedings by litigants or other participants authorized by law to achieve the objects of the litigation and to have some connection or logical relation to the action.citations.silberg anderson cal d,aronson kinsella th,d.
it has long been the law that communications that bear some relation to an anticipated lawsuit fall within the privilege.rubin green cal th,d,aronson kinsella,supra,th at,d.the privilege has been broadly applied to demand letters and other prelitigation communications by attorneys.rubin,supra,cal th at,d,knoell petrovich th,d.
a prelitigation statement is protected by the litigation privilege of section,subdivision b when the statement is made in connection with a proposed litigation that is contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration.citation.citations.aronson kinsella,supra,th,d silberg anderson,supra,cal d at,laffer levinson,miller,jacobs phillips th,d fuhrman california satellite systems,supra,d at.t he good faith,serious consideration of litigation test is not a test for malice and it is not a variation of the interest of justice test.aronson kinsella,supra,at,d.rather,it is addressed to the requirement the statements have some connection or logical relation to the action.citations.ibid.thus,if the statement is made with a good faith belief in a legally viable claim and in serious contemplation of litigation,then the statement is sufficiently connected to litigation and will be protected by the litigation privilege.ibid.if it applies,the privilege is absolute.rubin green,supra,cal th at,d.
plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in finding the litigation privilege applies here because there is a triable issue about whether directv sent the demand letters with the good faith belief in a legally viable claim and in serious contemplation of litigation.they argue directv knew it could never possibly sue all of the letter recipients.the sheer number of demand letters sent,the fact that four named plaintiffs who refused to settle have not been sued,and the fact that directv sued only about percent of the letter recipients,plaintiffs argue,all raise the inference that directv was not acting in serious contemplation of litigation 
apart from the fact that directv has initiated numerous lawsuits,which give ris
