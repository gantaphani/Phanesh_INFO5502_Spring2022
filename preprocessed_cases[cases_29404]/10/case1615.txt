factual and procedural background 
on december,pirjada filed a complaint,and on january,a first amended complaint,against pacific national for failure to provide meal and rest periods,failure to pay overtime and straight time wages,collecting or receiving employee wages,failure to timely pay wages,failure to maintain and provide accurate itemized pay statements,and unfair business practices bus,et.the lawsuit,which alleged pirjada had been employed as a security guard by pacific national from may until august,was brought on behalf of all security officers in california who are or were employed by pacific national at any time during the period prior to filing the complaint.
pacific national answered the first amended complaint on february.on march,pirjada served by united states mail on counsel for pacific national a request for production of documents,set one,containing numbered requests,including request all documents and electronic records which set forth the names and the last known addresses for security guards employed by you at any time during the period prior to december,whose employment with you terminated and request all documents and electronic records which set forth the names and last known addresses for security guards employed by you at any time during the period prior to december.pacific national did not object or otherwise respond to the document request within days as required by code of civil procedure section,did not seek an extension of time to respond and did not move for a protective order.
in march joe ramirez,chief executive officer of pacific national,negotiated a settlement of pirjada claims directly with pirjada.according to ramirez declarations submitted in subsequent proceedings in the superior court,pirjada approached him at a hearing for unemployment benefits in january,said he was no longer interested in maintaining the class action lawsuit against pacific national and asked ramirez to contact his attorney about a settlement.ramirez explained he negotiated directly with pirjada only after his efforts to pursue settlement with pirjada lawyers at westrup klick llp were unsuccessful.on march,pirjada signed and sent to westrup klick a letter stating,i have resolved the above case pirjada pacific national security.please immediately dismiss my claims in the above lawsuit with prejudice.enclosed,please find my settlement agreement and a check for your services.
pirjada counsel did not dismiss the lawsuit.instead,on may,relying primarily on best buy stores,superior court th best buy,counsel moved for an order providing notice to members of the proposed class that substitution of a suitable class representative was necessary.the proposed order contemplated use of a administrator to enable counsel to learn the identity only of those putative class members who were willing to be contacted about the lawsuit.
pacific national opposed the motion and separately filed its own motion to dismiss pirjada complaint with prejudice pursuant to rule based on the parties settlement.in its tentative ruling for the hearing on may,the superior court characterized the two motions as,in effect,cross motions seeking alternative relief in light of a settlement reached by the named plaintiff and the defendant,independently of counsel.
as to the motion to dismiss,the court tentative ruling noted,although pirjada had joined in pacific national request to dismiss the action,rule a requires trial court approval before a class action may be dismissed.the court then explained,the fact that a named plaintiff individually settles his claims does not divest him or his counsel of their fiduciary obligations to the putative class members.if the trial court concludes that the named plaintiff can no longer represent the claim,it should at least afford plaintiffs the opportunity to amend their complaint,to redefine the class,or to add new individual plaintiffs,or both,in order to establish a suitable representative,citing la sala,supra,cal d at page.accordingly,the court indicated it would deny the motion to dismiss and grant days leave to amend to add any new plaintiffs as class representatives.
with respect to the motion for class notice,the court distinguished best buy,as well as cashcall,superior court th,because they involved alleged injuries to unsuspecting classes of consumers and there was no practical way to determine which putative class members were injured and capable of replacing the disqualified class representatives,while in this case the putative class of security guards is clearly defined and its members know for themselves whether they were injured and wish to assert claims against defendant.the court emphasized that counsel was free to communicate with anyone who may wish to pursue a claim,citing our decision in parris superior court th,parris,but concluded c notice is neither necessary nor appropriate under the circumstances of this case.
at the hearing on the motion pirjada counsel stated he intended to move to compel responses to the previously served discovery requests that sought contact information for members of the proposed class.counsel for pacific national argued the question of a motion to compel was not before the court and added,since the court had just denied notice to the class,it should certainly deny a motion to compel discovery that was even more expansive.the court declined to comment on the issue of discovery,set august,for an order to show cause regarding dismissal of the complaint and otherwise adopted its tentative ruling as the ruling of the court.
on june,pirjada counsel moved for an order compelling responses to requests and in the first set of requests for production of documents security guard contact information,with a hearing date of july,the moving papers noted pacific national had failed to serve any responses to the entire set of discovery and all objections,therefore,had been waived.counsel explained pirjada had been unable to provide contact information for any other putative class members because he had worked at only one location and was the only guard assigned there.in addition,pirjada had first contacted counsel after his employment had ended.thus,in an effort to fulfill its fiduciary duty to the class and avoid what would be the legal equivalent of a dismissal of the action as to all class members,plaintiff counsel files the instant motion to compel to allow for the discovery of a new class representative.
pacific national opposed the motion to compel,principally arguing pirjada had settled all his claims before the responses to discovery were due therefore,it had no duty to respond to the discovery requests.pirjada counsel had no right and no standing to seek to compel responses because the discovery had been served by pirjada.the motion was,in effect,an impermissible motion for reconsideration of the earlier,unsuccessful motion to compel notice to potential class members.
the court first noted the parties had essentially reargued the motions considered on may,although pirjada counsel now asked for the class identifying information to be provided directly to him,rather than to a administrator.the court then denied the motion,concluding,because pirjada had settled his claims,his discovery is moot.the court also stated it would not reconsider its earlier,may ruling,explaining,by noting in the ruling that plaintiff counsel is free to communicate with defendant employees,the court did not mean to suggest that counsel is entitled to engage in discovery.the court simply meant that before the case is dismissed,plaintiff counsel should be given the opportunity to locate a representative informally,through the names of witnesses,and others already known.
on august,westrup klick,purportedly acting on behalf of pirjada petitioned this court for writ of mandate prohibition and requested an immediate stay of the hearing on the order to show cause regarding dismissal scheduled for august.on august,we stayed the august,hearing and requested that real party in interest pacific national file an opposition to the petition.on september,we issued an order to show cause why the relief requested in the petition should not be granted and set dates for filing a written return to the petition and a reply to the return.
discussion 
governing law 
california courts recognize and preserve the rights of absent class members,even before the issue of certification has been determined.shapell industries,superior court th.the westrup writ petition requires analysis of two related aspects of that judicial protection of the rights of unnamed putative class members case law concerning precertification discovery to identify potential class members,including possible replacements for unqualified lead plaintiffs and case law and related authority governing dismissal of class actions when a named plaintiff can no longer suitably represent the class.
precertification communications and discovery to identify potential class members 
in parris,supra,th,a class action filed on behalf of all current and former nonexempt customer service representatives of lowe,this court held no prior judicial approval is required for precertification communications between the named representatives or counsel for the putative class and potential class members,explaining,absent specific evidence of abuse,an order prohibiting or limiting precertification communication with potential class members by the parties to a putative class action is an invalid prior restraint of protected speech.id.at.however,when the lead plaintiff or putative class counsel seek to enlist the aid of the court in communicating with potential class members for example,as in parris by moving to compel disclosure of the names and contact information of potential class members we held it was appropriate for the trial court to consider the possibility of abuses in litigation.id.at.accordingly,when ruling on a motion to compel disclosure of such information,in addition to applying the normal rules governing discovery motions,the trial court must also expressly identify any potential abuses of the class action procedure that may be created if the discovery is permitted,and weigh the danger of such abuses against the rights of the parties under the circumstances.id.at.
several years after parris the supreme court confirmed that c ontact information regarding the identity of potential class members is generally discoverable,so that the lead plaintiff may learn the names of other persons who might assist in prosecuting the case.pioneer electronics usa,superior court cal th,approving use of administrator procedure to notify customers who had purchased a particular dvd player of their right to participate in a class action see lee dynamex,th,trial court abused its discretion by denying motion to compel disclosure of potential class members through use of an procedure see also belaire west landscape,superior court th,j ust as the dissatisfied pioneer customers could be expected to want their information revealed to a class action plaintiff who might obtain relief for the allegedly defective dvd players citation,so can current and former belaire west employees reasonably be expected to want their information disclosed to a class action plaintiff who may ultimately recover for them unpaid wages that they are owed.
even a lead plaintiff who for some reason is unqualified to serve as a class representative may,in a proper case,move for precertification discovery for the purpose of identifying a new class representative.safeco ins.of american superior court th,accord,best buy,supra,th at see cashcall,superior court,supra,th at putative class representative who never had standing should not necessarily be treated less favorably than class representative who once had but then lost standing the weighing test articulated in parris should apply in either situation to evaluate precertification discovery intended to identify potential class members.yet,as our colleagues in division three of the fourth appellate district explained earlier this year in the context of a headless class action in a procedural posture similar to the case at bar,precertification class discovery is not a matter of right before allowing class counsel to find a viable class representative,trial courts must apply a balancing test and weigh the actual or potential abuse of the class action procedure against the potential benefits that might be gained.starbucks superior court th,writ of mandate issued directing superior court to vacate order permitting precertification discovery that would have harmed the putative class members protected privacy rights.
court approval,an opportunity to amend and notice to potential class members before dismissal of a headless class action 
in la sala,supra,cal d the named plaintiffs filed a putative class action lawsuit against american savings loan association alleging a provision in its form trust deed permitting it to accelerate a loan if the borrower executed a junior encumbrance on the secured property constituted an invalid restraint upon alienation.the lender offered to waive enforcement of that provision for the named plaintiffs.the trial court ruled the named plaintiffs no longer represented the class as a result of this waiver and dismissed the action.id.at.the supreme court reversed,holding,although the named plaintiffs are not members of the class that they purport to represent as the complaint now stands,this fact can not justify a dismissal of the action without affording plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their pleading.ibid.the court explained permissible amendments could either redefine the class or add additional representatives.id.at.the la sala court also held,w henever the dismissal of a class action stems from a defendant grant of benefits to the representative plaintiffs which are not provided to the class as a whole,the court may not dismiss the action without notice to the class.id.at see also id.at if the amendment fails to establish a suitable representative,the court should not dismiss the action on this ground without undertaking such measures as it may direct to notify the members of the class.
in kagan,supra,cal d,a class action lawsuit under the consumer legal remedies act,et,decided more than a dozen years after la sala,the supreme court held a savings and loan association decision to exempt the named plaintiff from the imposition of trustee fees on her individual retirement account did not render her unfit per se to represent the class challenging those fees.kagan,at.nonetheless,the court recognized the trial court retained discretion to decide the plaintiff claims were no longer typical of those of the class or that she could not fairly and adequately protect the class interests.id.at.quoting from la sala,the court held,should the trial court conclude the plaintiff can not suitably represent the class,it should afford her the opportunity to amend her complaint,to redefine the class,or to add new individual plaintiffs,or both,in order to establish a suitable represent
