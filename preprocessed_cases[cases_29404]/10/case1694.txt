petitioner starbucks corporation starbucks petitions for a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order denying starbucks motion for summary judgment,and to enter a new order granting the motion.
real parties in interest eric lords,hon yeung,and donald brown collectively plaintiffs represent a class of some unsuccessful job applicants at starbucks.they allege that the starbucks employment application contains an illegal question about prior marijuana convictions that are more than two years old.they seek statutory damages of per remedy which,by starbucks estimation,could total a whopping million.
plaintiffs lawsuit suffers from two fundamental flaws,either of which provides ample grounds for writ relief.first,starbucks attempted to disclaim an interest in such prohibited information,and two of the plaintiffs understood starbucks not to be seeking it.second,no plaintiff had any convictions to reveal.
nothing in the statutes in question authorizes job applicants to automatically recover per person without proof they were aggrieved persons with an injury the statute was designed to remedy.
factual and procedural background 
starbucks uses the same job application form nationwide for store level employees.the application first page includes a question the convictions question,which asks have you been convicted of a crime in the last seven years it further explains if yes,list convictions that are a matter of public record arrests are not convictions.a conviction will not necessarily disqualify you for employment.
the reverse side of the starbucks application contains various disclaimers for united states applicants,as well as three different states maryland,massachusetts,and california.these disclaimers are located in a paragraph directly above the signature line.the california portion of the disclaimer provides california applicants only applicant may omit any convictions for the possession of marijuana except for convictions for the possessions of marijuana on school grounds or possession of concentrated cannabis that are more than two years old,and any information concerning a referral to,and participation in,any pretrial or post trial diversion program.
in june plaintiffs filed their class action lawsuit on behalf of an estimated starbucks job applicants who sought jobs at some starbucks locations throughout california.plaintiffs contended that the convictions question on the starbucks application is illegal under california law,which prohibits employers from asking about convictions that are more than two years old.plaintiffs sought to recover actual damages or each,whichever is greater,subd.c.
plaintiffs contended that the california disclaimer was buried within a block of type,did not specifically refer to the convictions question,and was placed near the end of the document.they feared that applicants either would overlook the disclaimer,or would not want to go back and cross out their previous responses,or ask for a clean copy.
plaintiffs each applied for a job at starbucks in early by filling out a job application.none had a marijuana arrest or conviction.none was hired.
lords read the entire starbucks application,including the california disclaimer.he understood the clause to mean that he did not need to report a marijuana conviction more than two years old.he truthfully answered no to the convictions question.he had no prior marijuana convictions i never smoked it in my life.lords explained that he was bringing the lawsuit for other people.lords said he did not have a personal stake in the matter,and did not believe that he was not hired because of his truthful answer to the convictions question.
yeung read the entire application,including the california disclaimer,and understood it to mean that he was not required to disclose any information regarding marijuana convictions more than two years old.yeung had no such arrests or convictions.despite this,he wrote the following response to the question regarding convictions i refuse to answer.
brown made a similar response to the convictions question on his starbucks application.although he never had been arrested for a crime,and has never used marijuana,brown responded to the convictions questions,refuse to answer as he explained,i t no one business.
the court certified a class of all california applicants who submitted an employment application to starbucks with the convictions question since june,and who each seeks no more than in damages.the court determined that t he mere offering of the application containing the impermissible question is a violation of the labor code.damages may be calculated simply by multiplying the probable number of applicants during the class period times.
the court denied starbucks motion for summary judgment.the court determined that the convictions question on its face violated sections,subdivision c and,and doubted the legal sufficiency of the california disclaimer.a triable issue of material fact remains whether the location of the limiting language on the application,the size of the font in which the limitation is printed,and the location of the limitation within the block paragraph is sufficient to alert a reasonable job applicant that the question concerning criminal convictions does not apply to marijuana related convictions more than two years old.the court questioned whether an average applicant would see the california disclaimer because the location and font size which the court guessed to be eight point was not effective to draw the attention of the job applicant.
the court concluded that plaintiffs had standing to assert the statutory violation based on the fact they were given the job application containing the offending question when applying for employment with the defendant the plain language of those sections establishes a strict liability standard of conduct where a job applicant seeks to recover only the minimum statutory damage amount of.the court determined that proof of damages was not a necessary element to the plaintiffs ability to recover the statutory minimum of per applicant.
the court granted summary adjudication in favor of starbucks on a separate cause of action for violation of california unfair competition law bus,et the court reasoned that none of the plaintiffs has lost money or property as a result of the alleged unfair or unlawful conduct.citations.plaintiffs offer no evidence or argument that any of them has lost money or property.
starbucks filed a petition for writ of mandate from the order denying summary judgment.starbucks declared that,given the size of the class,this litigation poses such great monetary risks to starbucks at least million that it may be forced to settle rather than risk an adverse judgment.we issued an order to show cause why a summary judgment should not be granted and stayed the proceedings below.
legal sufficiency of the starbucks application 
section was enacted during the as part of comprehensive reform legislation which was designed to distinguish minor marijuana offenses from more serious felony drug offenses and to minimize or eliminate the lingering social stigma flowing from what is now perceived to be a relatively minor form of criminal activity.younger superior court cal d.
california law already had prohibited employers from asking job applicants about arrests that did not result in a conviction.the statute prohibits employers from soliciting such disclosure through any written form or verbally,subd.a.the marijuana reform legislation extended this prohibition to marijuana convictions that are more than two years old.
starbucks says that its employment application,as a matter of law,complies with the california statutory scheme,and can not be construed to ask applicants to disclose information about marijuana convictions it expressly tells them not to disclose.
we disagree.we see no problem with the language of the california disclaimer,but we see significant problems with its placement.had starbucks included the california disclaimer immediately following the convictions question,starbucks would have been entitled to a summary judgment in its favor on the reasonableness of the employment application.see,sanchez bally total fitness th,d release clause in health club agreement clear and unambiguous as a matter of law haynes farmers ins.exchange cal th,d,to be enforceable,limiting language must be conspicuous,plain and clear,and placed and printed so that it will attract the reader attention.
but we can not accept starbucks assurances that this clear and conspicuous test is satisfied by its placement of the california disclaimer at the very end of a paragraph,with a disclaimer,followed by a host of irrelevant provisions from states like maryland and massachusetts starbucks emphasizes that its california disclaimer is placed in boldface type,but so are the,maryland,and massachusetts disclaimers.any value to be gained by emphasis is submerged in a veritable sea of boldface type.
starbucks counsel himself recognized below that the legal issue involved whether a reasonable job applicant would see the caveat.as counsel conceded during argument on class certification now whether somebody could reasonably not read the california disclaimer,and reasonably take the application on its face and believe they were re quired to disclose marijuana convictions,we say no,but we understand that that may be a dispute.italics added.
it seems to us that a reasonable starbucks applicant could look at the convictions question and believe that it meant what it said have you been convicted of a crime in the last seven years we can not say with certainty that such a hypothetical applicant would notice the misplaced california disclaimer on the backside.truthful applicants in our hypothetical situation should be able to recover their actual damages or the statutory minimum,either because they were forced to reveal stigmatizing private information,or because they declined to respond with such information at a possible cost of a lost job opportunity.starbucks interpretation,in contrast,would deny any damage recovery to such applicants.this clearly is contrary to both the letter and intent of sections and.
the unintended consequence of starbucks style for its employment applications is a lack of clarity for which california law strives.we can not say,as a matter of law,that the starbucks application unambiguously directs applicants not to disclose prohibited convictions.
plaintiffs entitlement to recovery 
our determination that the starbucks application may present an ambiguity to the average california job seeker is only the start,not the end,of our inquiry.while a potential violation of the marijuana reform legislation may be in the air because of potential ambiguities in the california disclaimer,the question remains,on summary judgment,whether there are triable issues of fact to bring it down to earth,and to specifically bring plaintiffs,and the tens of thousands of class members they purport to represent,within the class of persons intended to be benefitted by the statutory cause of action in section,subdivision c.
starbucks raises two obstacles to plaintiffs attempts to recover for themselves and the other class members.first,starbucks argues that the california disclaimer,even if ambiguous,was not ambiguous as to plaintiffs,two of whom testified at their depositions to sharing the same understanding of the application as did starbucks.second,starbucks argues that none of the plaintiffs are entitled to an automatic recovery because none had any marijuana convictions to disclose.the points are.
lack of ambiguity as to plaintiffs lords and yeung 
while the wording of the starbucks application may establish a potential ambiguity in the abstract,there is no evidence that it made any difference in how lords and yeung filled out their job applications.there is no evidence that either of them believed that he was being asked to disclose convictions that were more than two years old.
both lords and yeung admitted during their respective deposition testimony that they read the starbucks application,including the california disclaimer,and understood the application did not ask for information about convictions more than two years old.each testified he knew he did not have to disclose information regarding marijuana convictions more than two years old.
the court expressed the view that plaintiffs understanding is immaterial instead,the court took the position that it not a particular finding or state of mind of the job applicant in the particular case.it because the identified social problem that the legislature has sought to address here is the mere asking of the improper question.
the evidence of lords and yeung understanding in their deposition testimony is dispositive of the ambiguity issue as to them since they offered no extrinsic evidence to contradict it.while words frequently mean different things to different people,courts have no problem enforcing provisions as to parties who demonstrated by their actions that they knew what the words meant and were intended to mean.crestview cemetery dieden cal d,see also that is certain which can be made certain.
by analogy,california does not sanction lawsuits for fraudulent misrepresentations brought by persons who,rather than having been deceived,act for the sole purpose of bringing a lawsuit against potential targets for litigation.buckland threshold enterprises,th,d buckland.the maker of a fraudulent misrepresentation is not liable to one who does not rely upon its truth but upon the expectation that the maker will be held liable in damages for its falsity.id.at,d.a ctual reliance for the purpose of fraud by omission occurs only when the plaintiff reposes confidence in the material completeness of the defendant representations,and acts upon this confidence.ibid.
in caro procter gamble th,d,a consumer sought to represent millions of other grocery shoppers in a class action lawsuit based on a company false representations about its citrus hill fresh choice orange juice products,which in fact was reconstituted from frozen concentrate.yet,the consumer own deposition testimony showed that he did not believe the orange juice was fresh.under these circumstances,the court of appeal affirmed the trial court determination that the consumer was not a proper class representative of shoppers who had been deceived into believing they were buying fresh juice.although the consumer alleged the class was deceived into believing defendants product was fresh,the evidence indicated he himself believed the juice was simply premium.because he did not claim to be misled in the manner the class was allegedly deceived,the court could not decide the issue of the rights of such individuals that might possibly exist.id.at,d.
there are practical reasons why lords and young actual understanding is critical.without it,there would be nothing to stop them from freely roaming throughout the state as knights errant amici searching for deficiencies where no harm has been caused them or anyone else as a result rodriguez city of passaic.this could create a whole new category of job seekers,whose quest is to voluntarily find and fill out job applications which they know to be defective solely for the purpose of pursuing litigation.this is not the law in california.buckland,supra,th at,d.
starbucks having carried its initial burden of production on summary judgment to show that lords and yeung were not confused by the starbucks application,these plaintiffs have failed to show the existence of a triable issue of material fact on ambiguity.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
absence of aggrieved plaintiffs 
plaintiffs,who had no marijuana convictions to disclose,are not members of a legally protected group.plaintiffs are not similarly situated to persons whose minor drug histories were wrongly revealed on improper job applications,or who refused to disclose such offenses in response to the convictions question,and who therefore may be entitled to actual damages or the statutory minimum.
where civil liability is predicated upon a legislative provision here,plaintiffs must establish that they fall within the class of persons for whose protection the legislative provision was enacted.the statute must be designed to protect against the kind of harm which occurred.wawanesa mutual ins.matlock th,d statutory prohibition against furnishing tobacco to minors not intended to protect victims of fire caused by dropped cigarette see also capolungo bondi d.yellow curb parking zone intended to provide curb access for loading,not to promote traffic safety.
plaintiffs have not contested the trial court determination that they lost neither money nor property as a result of starbucks allegedly unlawful conduct.instead,they take the position that they,like every person within the class of starbucks job applicants,are automatically entitled to a minimum of simply because they filled out the job application.in their verified return to the petition,plaintiffs assert that they are entitled to receive as a statutory penalty for completing an application that violates labor code section.italics added.later in the same document,plaintiffs describe the recovery as a statutory minimum damage provision for any person who is asked a question violating labor code sections and italics added.
section,subdivision c does not expressly provide that any applicant may recover a minimum of as a statutory penalty for an employer asking a prohibited question on a job application,regardless of any nexus to a marijuana conviction lurking somewhere in his or her past.had the legislature intended to bestow a cause of action for an automatic recovery of upon any applicant,it easily could have done so.instead,the statute ambiguously provides that,for violations of section,the applicant may bring an action to recover from that person actual damages or two hundred dollars italics added.the statute also provides that intentional violations are a misdemeanor,punishable by a fine,entitling applicants to the greater of treble actual damages,or five hundred dollars 
we have examined the language in section,subdivision c,and conclude that plaintiffs do not fall within the class of persons intended to be protected by the marijuana reform legislation.the legislature intended to minimize or eliminate the lingering social stigma flowing from what is now perceived to be a relatively minor form of criminal activity.citation.the intent is to insure that once the offender has paid his prescribed debt to society,he not be further penalized by curtailment of his opportunities for rehabilitation,education,employment,licensing,and business or professional advancement.hooper deukmejian d.hooper.
only an individual with a conviction falls within the class of people the legislature sought to protect.we see nothing in the statute to support plaintiffs claim that the legislature intended to protect the privacy interests of job applicants who had no marijuana convictions in their background.as we explain below,we decline to adopt an interpretation that would turn the statute into a veritable financial bonanza for litigants like plaintiffs who had no fear of stigmatizing marijuana convictions.
under rules of statutory construction,we resolve the ambiguity according to the usual,ordinary import of the language,and to avoid absurd consequences,including an unconstitutionally excessive penalty.it is a maxim of statutory construction that a statute is to be construed in such a way as to render it reasonable,fair and harmonious with its manifest legislative purposes citations,and the literal meaning of its words must give way to avoid harsh results and mischievous or absurd consequences.kinney vaccari cal d,interpreting tenant in a statute that allowed each tenant who was willfully deprived of utility services to recover actual damages,plus per day,to jointly apply to the adult residents of each unit,rather than to the individuals living in each unit see kramer intuit th,d statutes must be read to avoid absurd results.
recently,in jones v.the lodge at torrey pines partnership cal th,d,jones,the california supreme court held that nonemployer individuals were not personally liable for retaliation even though the statute in question used the word person in addition to employer to describe who could be sued.id.at,d.the court concluded that this statutory language was not as plain as it seemed given the potentially severe adverse effects and minimum potential benefits of imposing personal liability on individual supervisory employees.id.at,d.if the legislature intended to impose such drastic results,the court reasoned,the legislature would have done so by language much clearer than that used here.id.at,d.
the leading case involving a statutory penalty is hale morgan cal d,hale.there the california supreme court narrowly construed the term deprived in a statute allowing for a mandatory statutory penalty of per day for tenants who were deprived of utility services.because the statute is penal,we adopt the narrowest construction of its penalty clause to which it is reasonably susceptible in the light of its legislative purpose.id.at.the court refused to sanction an interpretation that was wholly disproportionate to any discernible legislative goal.the exercise of a reasoned discretion is replaced by an adding machine.the challenged statute mandates essentially that a single wrongful act by the landlord,if not corrected,will subject him to potentially infinite penalties,regardless of the circumstances of the violation,the offender,the victim or the damage caused.id.at.

in miller collectors universe,th,d,we interpreted a statute that ambiguously called for liability in a wrongful appropriation case of the greater of seven hundred fifty dollars or the actual damages suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the unauthorized use id.at,d.because the defendant made some separate unauthorized uses of plaintiff name,the plaintiff elected not to prove any actual damages,but argued he was entitled to statutory damages exceeding million based on the statutory multiplier.applying basic precepts of statutory construction,we determined that the statute was based upon the injury to the plaintiff,with the minimum statutory damages intended to remedy the alleged injury to his mental feelings and peace of mind id.at,d.
