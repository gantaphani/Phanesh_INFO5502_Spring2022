facts and procedural history 
efs is a former steel manufacturing company located in erie,pennsylvania.in,its predecessor national forge company adopted the hourly employees insurance plan,national forge company,erie plant hereinafter,the benefits plan.that plan was eventually adopted by efs after it acquired national forge.the summary plan description of the benefits plan provides that t he plan may be terminated at any time by the board of directors of efs.
on or around october,efs adopted the erie forge steel company retiree medical benefit defined dollar structure the dds plan.it was incorporated by reference into an october,collective bargaining agreement between efs and local of the uswa the cba.the dds plan applied to future retirees and employees who retired before with years of service and who elected the dds plan in lieu of their traditional health insurance premium coverage.the dds plan provided that efs could amend or terminate the dds plan at its sole discretion.
on december,efs filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code,et.thereafter,it continued operations as a.at the time of its chapter filing,efs employed approximately salaried,and hourly,workers.the hourly employees are were members of the uswa local affiliates.on january,richard gordon,filed his appearance as counsel on behalf of uswa.he has been counsel of record for the union both in the underlying bankruptcy proceedings and in this appeal.
on or about september,efs informed its retirees that it would be terminating their benefits at the end of october,and on october,efs stopped paying retirees medical benefits.as of that date,all of the appellants were either active employees or they had previously resigned from efs none of them had been receiving retirement benefits under either the benefits plan or the dds plan.
on november,the bankruptcy court approved the sale of substantially all of efs assets to the park corporation.that same day,the debtor laid off substantially all of its work force,including those appellants who were still working at efs.
the debtor plan of reorganization was filed with the bankruptcy court on july,and was confirmed in an order dated august.under the terms of the plan,the park corporation was to continue the business operations of efs as a reorganized debtor free and clear of any claims or encumbrances by efs creditors,including those persons who might have a claim to retirement benefits.the plan required the remaining assets of the estate to be pooled into a liquidating trust for the purpose of funding the claims of efs creditors.
no appeal was taken from the entry of this confirmation order,and the bankruptcy court entered a final decree order on november.meanwhile,pursuant to,on november,efs had filed a motion to reject its collective bargaining agreement cba with the uswa the motion.the union opposed that motion.the union was particularly concerned about unpaid vacation and personal days which its members had accrued in and the committee sought to preclude vacation pay as an allowed administrative claim against the estate.
ultimately,the parties negotiated a settlement of the motion in the form of an omnibus consent order that the bankruptcy court approved and entered on january.pursuant to that consent order,the cba was terminated subject to a reservation of rights by all parties under.the uswa recovered representing of its claims as allowed administrative claims to be paid forthwith to some former hourly employees of efs.a general unsecured claim in the amount of or of the union claims was also allowed.in addition,the union was awarded a general unsecured claim of,representing damages resulting from efs rejection of the cba 
on may,efs filed its motion to determine which,if any,claim would be allowed as a result of its termination of retiree benefits.initially,the union opposed the motion on the grounds that,inter alia,efs had not complied with f a and had failed to show that the union declined the proposal without good cause.the union also maintained that efs unilateral termination of benefits as of november,violated section e and that efs had declined to acknowledge the status of any retiree benefits as an administrative expense as required by.the union initially took the position that the healthcare coverage at issue was the product of collective bargaining which provided for vested,lifetime benefits.
the committee,on the other hand,asserted that the motion was superfluous and that any protections afforded by section were inapplicable because efs had merely exercised its right to unilaterally terminate retiree benefits.the committee maintained that the benefits at issue were not vested and,therefore,no claim could be made against the estate relative to their termination.the liquidating trustee made similar arguments.
despite its initial opposition to the motion,the union subsequently decided to enter into the stipulation with efs,the committee,and the liquidating trustee.the stipulation resolved the section motion by allowing an administrative claim of and an unsecured claim of for each of the retirees or their widows who retired before the october,termination of retiree benefits.the union also agreed that those individuals who,although eligible,were not receiving retirement benefits as of october,would be excluded from any share in the allowed administrative and general unsecured claims.
on january,efs,the committee,the liquidating trustee,and the union filed their joint application for approval of stipulation with hourly employees and motion to bind salaried to terms of stipulation hereinafter,application for approval of stipulation.the application for approval of stipulation was served on hourly and salaried current and future retirees of efs.the cover letter explained that hourly employees would receive allowed administrative and unsecured claims under the stipulation if approved by the bankruptcy court,and that former hourly employees who had not retired as of the november sale would not receive an allowed claim for retiree welfare benefits.the latter employees were told that counsel for the uswa could not represent former hourly employees who might object to the stipulation because the uswa was seeking approval of the settlement certain of the union members were dissatisfied with the stipulation and sought independent legal representation through george schroeck.
on march,schroeck filed a response to the application for approval of stipulation on behalf of former employees of efs.each of those original objectors were union members who had not retired as of october.in their response,those former employees objected to the stipulation and requested a court order requiring efs to continue paying full benefits during the pendency of the chapter proceedings 
schroeck appeared on behalf of the objectors at a march,hearing on the application for approval of stipulation,and claimed that there were disputed issues of fact which precluded the bankruptcy court approval of the stipulation.the court responded by adjourning the hearing to give him an opportunity to present the factual disputes.on april,schroeck submitted a declaration on behalf of the former hourly employees in which he asserted,inter alia,that the employees health benefits were vested by virtue of the dds plan and the relevant cbas.
a second hearing on the application for approval of stipulation was conducted on april,and questions were raised about the scope of schroeck representation.the bankruptcy court opined that gordon represented all hourly employees and retirees but it nevertheless expressed uncertainty as
