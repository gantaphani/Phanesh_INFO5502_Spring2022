civil code section section imposes certain obligations on the parties to a secured real estate loan transaction to promptly clear title to the encumbered property after satisfaction of the loan.as part of this process,section,subdivision c,requires a county recorder to stamp and record within two business days from the day of receipt in proper form and with all required fees a full reconveyance or certificate of discharge confirming the satisfaction of the obligation secured by a deed of trust what does section,subdivision c requirement mean 
contending the legislature intended the county recorder to stamp,record and index a full reconveyance within two business days of receipt of the form,deborah ricketts and joel rosenberg filed putative class action lawsuits on behalf of all persons harmed by the failure of the county of los angeles and its,conny mccormack collectively county,to fulfill their statutory duties.following a bench trial,the trial court rejected ricketts and rosenberg interpretation of the statute and entered judgment in favor of the county.we agree indexing is a distinct function,separate from recording a document,and is not part of section,subdivision c requirement.accordingly,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
alleging the county routinely fails to stamp and record reconveyances presented to them within two business days as required by section,subdivision c,ricketts filed a verified class action complaint on july,seeking issuance of a writ of mandate ordering the county to comply with its statutory duties and the recovery of damages on behalf of all class members and forfeiture of per violation,as authorized by section,subdivision d the complaint contained a separate cause of action,also seeking monetary relief,alleging the county had violated its duty under government code section et to record,index and make available to the public within a reasonable time documents affecting title to real property located in los angeles county.
the trial court dismissed the two causes of action seeking damages and forfeitures based on ricketts failure to comply with the government claims presentation requirement.see,et shortly thereafter,the trial court granted rosenberg motion for leave to file a class action complaint in intervention.rosenberg complaint contained a cause of action petitioning for mandamus relief,similar to ricketts,alleging the county failed to stamp and record reconveyances within two days of receipt.he also attempted to allege a cause of action for imposition of a constructive trust for wrongfully detained statutory penalties.the county successfully demurred to the cause of action for imposition of a constructive trust,leaving essentially identical petitions for mandamus relief as the only claims in the case.
in august ricketts moved for summary judgment on her mandamus claim,arguing the requirement of section,subdivision c,required reconveyances to be entered into the recorder general index within the statutory period,so that they would be readily available to individuals conducting a computerized title search.inexplicably,the county lawyer conceded the requirement included indexing.because indexing was not always completed within the period the court granted the motion and on march,entered a judgment in favor of ricketts for issuance of a writ of mandate commanding the county to record and index reconveyances or certificates of discharge within two business days of receipt.
after associating in new counsel,the county moved for a new trial on the ground the writ of mandate was overbroad.in particular,the county now argued section,subdivision c,required only that the reconveyance be stamped and recorded,not indexed,within the period.on may,the court granted the motion for a new trial.ricketts did not appeal the court ruling.
in december ricketts and rosenberg petitions for a writ of mandate were tried to the court.the county contended a reconveyance is recorded within the meaning of section when it is accepted for recording by the recorder that is,the reconveyance is presented in the correct form and with the proper fee and the recorder applies a permanent recording number.ricketts and rosenberg argued the reconveyance is not recorded until it is indexed and a digital image of the reconveyance document is made available to the public.in a tentative decision issued on may,the court denied the claim,concluding the phrase stamp and record could not reasonably be understood to require indexing within the period prescribed by section,subdivision c.instead,a reconveyance is recorded when the recorder endorses on a reconveyance the order of receipt,the day and time of receipt and the amount of fees paid.
in reaching its decision,the court made the following factual findings about the recorder practices a document examiner reviews the reconveyance to determine whether or not it meets all recording requirements.if the reconveyance does meet those requirements,the document examiner creates an entry for the document in the enterprise recording archive era system.the era system calculates the fees payable and prints out a sheet with a temporary examination number ten and bar code.thereafter,a cashier scans the bar code,bringing up a computer screen displaying the entries for the reconveyance that the examiner made in the era system.the cashier makes sure the check received with the reconveyance matches the fees due as indicated in the era system.if the fees are correct,the cashier accepts the check and generates a lead sheet.the lead sheet includes the following the permanent recording number assigned to the reconveyance,a bar code,the number of pages of the document,the date and time of the transaction,the ten,the amount of fees paid,how the document arrived,counter,mail,a transaction number,the seal of the county of los angeles,and the words in official records recorder office,los angeles county,california.at this point,the recorder considers the recording process to be complete.
moreover,once a lead sheet is generated and the reconveyance is stamped with the legend in official records,a member of the public may obtain a certified copy of the reconveyance.although the trial court viewed this evidence as irrelevant to its conclusion that the county had complied with section,subdivision c,the court also found certified copies of the reconveyance could be obtained from the point of filing if the requestor has the recording number assigned to the document or within hours by reviewing grey film or blotter film pending the entry of a digital image of the document into the indexed database.finally,the trial court found reconveyances are routinely stamped and recorded with very few exceptions within two business days of receipt.
the court tentative decision became final days after it was issued when none of the parties submitted objections.see cal.rules court,rule et judgment was entered in favor of the county on june.
contentions 
ricketts and rosenberg contend the trial court erred in construing section,subdivision c,only to require the recorder to stamp and record reconveyances within two business days,rather than stamp,record and index them within two business days.they also contend the trial court erred in granting the county motion for a new trial following the initial grant of summary judgment in favor of ricketts.
