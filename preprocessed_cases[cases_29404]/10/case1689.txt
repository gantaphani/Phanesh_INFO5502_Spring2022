introduction 
petitioner crab addison,cai seeks a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate two orders granting discovery to real party in interest roberto martinez martinez.we deny the petition.
factual and procedural background 
on september,martinez filed his complaint as a class action,alleging causes of action for violation of the labor code,violation of business and professions code section et unfair business practices act and failure to provide mandated meal periods and rest breaks in violation of the labor code and orders of the industrial welfare commission.martinez alleged that cai engag ed in a uniform policy and systematic scheme of wage abuse against their salary paid employees in california.this scheme involved,inter alia,misclassifying the salaried restaurant employees as exempt employees for purposes of the payment of overtime compensation when,in fact,they were employees according to california law.cai thus deprived its salaried employees of compensation for hours worked in excess of hours per week.additionally,cai denied the salaried restaurant employees mandated meal and rest breaks under california law.martinez sought declaratory and injunctive relief,as well as restitution.
about december,martinez served cai with its first set of special interrogatories.at issue here are three of these special interrogatories.interrogatory asks cai to identify each class member.class member is defined as any person who was is employed in any restaurants owned,operated,acquired by cai in the state of california in a salaried restaurant position between september,and the present date.identification of the class members includes providing their names,addresses and telephone numbers.
interrogatory asks that if cai contend s that this action is not appropriate for class certification then please state all facts that support cai contention.interrogatory asks cai to identify each person who has knowledge of the facts set forth in response to interrogatory number.
cai filed its answer to martinez complaint about february.in addition to denying the allegations of the complaint,cai set forth a number of affirmative defenses.among these were allegations that the case was not appropriate for class certification.
thereafter,about march,cai objected to all three interrogatories on numerous grounds.one ground was that the interrogatories sought confidential and private information.
martinez filed a motion to compel further responses to his special interrogatories about march.this motion was based on cai refusal to disclose the identities of witnesses,including the names and contact information of the putative class members.martinez argued that this information was necessary to meeting his burden of proving class certification was appropriate,he was entitled to the information,and production of the information would not violate the witnesses right to privacy.
cai filed opposition to martinez motion about april.it argued that martinez was not entitled to discovery of the names and contact information of its employees.it argued that its employees had a heightened expectation of privacy as to their contact information based on forms they signed regarding release of their contact information.based on this heightened expectation of privacy,cai claimed,if the court were to consider disclosure of the employees contact information,it should do so subject to an opt in notice requirement.that is,the employees would be contacted and only those who chose to opt in to the lawsuit would have their contact information disclosed to martinez 
in support of its opposition to martinez motion,cai submitted copies of its release forms.these forms read 
release of contact information 
from time to time,joe crab shack the company may be asked to provide your contact information,including your home address and telephone number,to third parties.the company may be asked to provide such information in the context of legal proceedings,including class action lawsuits.
we understand that many employees may consider this information to be private and may not want it released.accordingly,please indicate whether you consent to the disclosure of your contact information by marking the appropriate box.
no,i do not consent to the company disclosure of my contact information to third parties.
yes,i consent to the company disclosure of my contact information to third parties.
i would like to be asked on a basis whether i consent to the disclosure of my contact information to a particular third party,and my contact information should only be provided if i affirmatively consent in writing.
at the bottom of the release forms was the following 
note your response does not create a guarantee that the company will not release your contact information as circumstances may require or warrant it.for instance,the company may be required or compelled by law to disclose your contact information,regardless of whether you consent to such disclosure,or it may determine that it must do so should it determine that you are a witness in a lawsuit or should it be requested by law enforcement officers.in such an event,the company can not be held responsible for disclosing this information even if you have not consented to disclosure or asked for a determination of disclosure.
cai included forms on which the employees checked the first box,indicating they did not want their contact information disclosed,and forms on which the employees checked the third box,indicating they wanted to consider disclosure on a basis.these forms were signed between january,and april.according to the declaration of michael anders,cai director of human resources,most of the salaried employees in california either did not want their contact information disclosed or wanted to consider disclosure on a basis.only a few said that cai could release their contact information.
in response,martinez argued that an opt out procedure should be used.in order to prevent abuse of the employee information,martinez stated that he was willing to enter into a protective order.
prior to the april,hearing,the trial court issued its tentative ruling.it stated that the motion was g ranted on the grounds set forth in the moving papers.this court has weighed the privacy interests of potential class members against the compelling need for discovery of their names and contact information,and finds that plaintiffs are entitled to the requested information subject to an notice,which shall be issued by cai.
at the hearing,the parties argued their positions.in discussing the opt out alternative,the parties discussed having cai contact their employees and give them the opt out option.those who did not opt out would have their contact information given to martinez.the trial court did not issue a final ruling orally at the hearing.
thereafter,by minute order,the trial court ruled that the motion was g ranted on the grounds set forth in the moving papers.the court has signed plaintiff proposed order.the order the court signed required cai to provide martinez with e ach putative class member name,residence address,residence telephone number,occupation,business address,and telephone number.class member means any person who was is employed in california in a salaried restaurant position for cai for any period of time within four years preceding the filing of the complaint in this action up to the present date.
cai then filed an ex parte application to clarify the trial court order and to stay the order pending the filing of a petition for writ of mandate.specifically,cai sought to have the trial court clarify its reason for determining that the putative class members are not entitled to any notice or other protection of their privacy rights prior to disclosure of their contact information to martinez.
at the may,hearing on the ex parte application,the trial court explained that essentially what i thought i was doing is ordering cai to provide the contact information and that martinez counsel contact these people irrespective of any things that might be in their file saying they did not wish to be contacted or in some limited way would not wish to be contacted.because it appears to me that many of those forms that people fill out example,they do want telemarketers to contact do think there anything specific that the employees were told that i do want anybody to contact me regarding possible legal protection of our rights or something along those lines the court declined cai request to explain its detailed thought process.cai counsel complained that the debate that we had last week was a debate about whether there should be a notice.the debate that we had was whether it should be an opt in or an opt out.so we are very confused as to how you got there 
the trial court questioned martinez counsel about what he would do with the contact information obtained from cai.counsel explained options for contacting the employees,adding,we do intend to bother people that do want to be bothered.after further discussion,the trial court denied cai ex parte application with the understanding that cai was going to file a petition for writ of mandate in this court.
while these proceedings were taking place,about april,martinez filed a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories and production of documents.this motion included a request to compel cai to provide the identity of witnesses.cai opposed the motion,again raising the claim that the employee contact information was protected by the right to privacy.
in its tentative ruling,the trial court denied the motion in part and granted it in part,including granting the motion as to the requests for contact information.following the may,hearing on the motion,the trial court adopted its tentative as the final ruling on the motion.
on may,cai filed the instant petition for writ of mandate.
discussion 
standard of review 
interlocutory review of discovery orders by writ of mandate is the only adequate remedy where a court orders production of documents which may be subject to a privilege,since once privileged matter has been disclosed there is no way to undo the harm which consists in the very disclosure.people ex rel.lockyer superior court th,d.we review discovery orders for an abuse of discretion.citation.under this standard,a trial court ruling on a discovery motion will be overturned upon a prerogative writ if there is no substantial basis for the manner in which trial court discretion was exercised or if the trial court applied a patently improper standard of decision.citation.ibid.
the puerto decision 
we recently addressed the conflict between the right to discovery and the right to privacy in a class action suit by employees against their employer in puerto superior court th,d.in puerto,petitioners sued their former employer,wild oats market,alleging wage and hour violations.by interrogatory,petitioners sought to discover the contact information of witnesses.wild oats produced a list of names but objected to production of contact information,in part based on the right to privacy.petitioners filed a motion to compel.the trial court granted the motion with instructions that the parties develop a procedure whereby the witnesses would be notified of the request for contact information and would have to consent in writing to the disclosure of their information.the parties agreed to,and the trial court approved of,having a third party administrator notify the witnesses and give them the opportunity to opt in to the litigation.petitioners then sought to have this court determine whether this procedure should be rejected in favor of disclosure of the requested contact information with appropriate safeguards to protect the witnesses privacy.id.at,d.
we began our discussion of the case with code of civil procedure section,which provides a broad right to discover any relevant information that is not privileged,including the identity and location of witnesses.puerto superior court,supra,th at,d.we explained that t he expansive scope of discovery citation is a deliberate attempt to take the game element out of trial preparation and to do away with the sporting theory of,surprise at the trial.citations.ibid.therefore,discovery statutes are broadly construed in favor of discovery whenever possible in order to aid the parties in preparation for trial.ibid.
we emphasized that c entral to the discovery process is the identification of potential witnesses.the disclosure of the names and addresses of potential witnesses is a routine and essential part of pretrial discovery.citation.indeed,our discovery system is founded on the understanding that parties use discovery to obtain names and contact information for possible witnesses as the starting point for further investigations.puerto superior court,supra,th at,d.
we noted,however,that while the right to discovery is very broad,it is not absolute,particularly where issues of privacy are involved.the right of privacy in the california constitution art.i,protects the individual reasonable expectation of privacy against a serious invasion.puerto superior court,supra,th at,d,quoting pioneer electronics usa,superior court cal th,d.the court must balance the public need against the weight of the privacy right.puerto,supra,at,d.this requires a careful evaluation of the privacy right asserted,the magnitude of the imposition on that right,and the interests militating for and against any intrusion on privacy.ibid.in conducting this evaluation,we must determine whether the person claiming the privacy right has a legally protected privacy interest whether the person has a reasonable expectation of privacy under the particular circumstances,including the customs,practices,and physical settings surrounding particular activities and whether the invasion of privacy is serious rather than trivial.id.at,d.
applying this analysis to the case before us,we stated that wild oats employees unquestionably ha d a legitimate expectation of privacy in their addresses and telephone numbers.puerto superior court,supra,th at,d.this information was given to wild oats as a condition of employment and with the expectation that the information would not be divulged externally except as required to governmental agencies or to benefits providers.this is a reasonable expectation in light of employers usual confidentiality customs and practices.ibid.
while contact information generally is considered private,this does not mean that the individuals would not want it disclosed under these circumstances.puerto superior court,supra,th at,d.while employees would not likely want their contact information broadly disseminated,this does not mean they would want it withheld from plaintiffs seeking relief for violations of employment laws in the workplace that they shared.id.at,d.rather,employees similarly situated to petitioners may reasonably be supposed to want their information disclosed to counsel whose communications in the course of investigating the claims asserted in petitioners lawsuit may alert them to similar claims they may be able to assert.ibid.
in considering the seriousness of the invasion of privacy,we concluded that the trial court implicit finding that a serious invasion of privacy would result unless an notice was used,was unsupported by facts or law.puerto superior court,supra,th at,d.we observed that the requested information,while personal,was not particularly sensitive,as it was merely contact information,not medical or financial details,political affiliations,sexual relationships,or personal information.ibid.the employees had been identified by wild oats as witnesses contact information for witnesses ordinarily is produced during discovery,and it is neither unduly personal nor overly intrusive.id.at,d.we concluded that there was no evidence that disclosure of the contact information for these already identified witnesses was a transgression of the witnesses privacy that was sufficiently serious in its nature,scope,and actual or potential impact to constitute an egregious breach of the social norms underlying the privacy right,quoting hill national collegiate athletic cal th,d.
we observed that it is only under unusual circumstances that the courts restrict discovery of nonparty witnesses residential contact information.puerto superior court,supra,th at,d.these circumstances include where disclosure of the information violates the right to privacy and is unnecessary to the prosecution of the litigation or where it may endanger the witnesses.id.at,d.
we added that the extent of the privacy invasion in the case before us probably appeared significant to the trial court due to the number of employees involved.had there been a smaller number,we doubted that the trial court would have entered a protective order requiring a third party administrator to send notice to the witnesses.puerto superior court,supra,th at,d.
we noted that t he supreme court held in pioneer electronics usa,superior court,supra,cal th at page,d,that when the court concludes that there is no serious invasion of privacy no balance of opposing interests is required.puerto superior court,supra,th at,d.we nonetheless performed that balance,finding it reinforced our conclusion that the trial court abused its discretion in requiring the opt in procedure.ibid.
on the discovery side of the scales,we pointed out that the fundamental public policy underlying california employment laws is implicated here,suggesting that the balance of opposing interests tips toward permitting access to relevant information necessary to pursue the litigation.citation.also at stake is the general public interest in facilitating the ascertainment of truth in connection with legal proceedings citation and in obtaining just results in litigation citation.puerto superior court,supra,th at,d.
considering this latter interest,we opined that the system imposed by the trial court significantly advantage d wild oats by greatly increasing the likelihood that it would be able to retain for its own exclusive use and benefit the contact information citation of potential witnesses to petitioners claims.puerto superior court,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.while wild oats would have easier access to the witnesses,some of whom undoubtedly would have been willing to participate with petitioners in the litigation,petitioners would be unnecessarily hamstrung in the conduct of discovery by making their statutory entitlement to percipient witness discovery entirely dependent on the unreviewable decision of third parties whether they are interested in participating.generally,witnesses are not permitted to decline to participate in civil discovery,even when the information sought from them is personal or private.id.at,d,fn.omitted.use of the notice not only would allow witnesses not to participate,but it imposed on them no obligation to respond or assert their privacy rights,with their failure to respond being interpreted as a denial of consent.id.at,d.
we noted that t he trial court articulated no justification for placing in the hands of witnesses absolute and unreviewable veto power over petitioners access to contact information to permit them to pursue legitimate discovery into their civil claims puerto superior court,supra,th at,d.after performing a privacy analysis,we saw no basis for providing this level of protection to the witnesses contact information.ibid.we added that the supreme court observed that employing mechanisms to protect the constitutional right to privacy endangers the ability to prosecute socially important claims ibid,citing pioneer electronics usa,superior court,supra,cal th at page,d.additionally,the trial court was not without the ability to enter a protective order limiting the dissemination of the witnesses contact information.puerto,supra,at,d.it could require petitioners to keep the information confidential and,if it learned of discovery abuse,limit the ways in which petitioners contacted the witnesses.parris superior court th,d.
we concluded that the procedure selected by the trial court,use of the opt in letter,effectively gave more protection to nonparty witnesses contact information than the discovery act gives to much more sensitive consumer or employment records.we are aware of no logic or authority that would justify such disproportionate protection of this private but under these circumstances relatively nonsensitive information.puerto superior court,supra,th at,d.we therefore found the trial court order to be an abuse of discretion.ibid.
application to the instant case 
there are two significant differences between puerto and the instant case.first,in puerto,the employer voluntarily disclosed the identities of the witnesses but sought to protect addresses and telephone numbers.here,cai seeks to protect identities as well as addresses and telephone numbers.second,in puerto there was no release form like the one utilized by cai.
we attach no great significance to the fact that cai did not voluntarily disclose the identities of the witnesses whose contact information it sought to protect.as noted in pioneer electronics usa,superior court,supra,cal th at page,d,c ontact information regarding the identity of potential class members is generally discoverable,so that the lead plaintiff may learn the names of other persons who might assist in prosecuting the case.citations.such disclosure involves no revelation of personal or business secrets,intimate activities,or similar private information disclosure of witnesses identities involves no greater invasion of privacy or revelation of personal information than the disclosure of their addresses and telephone numbers.therefore,we can find no rationale for refusing to apply our holding in puerto to the instant case.
indeed,since our decision in puerto,we have upheld the right of an employee to obtain contact information in order to identify potential class members.in lee dynamex,th,d,plaintiff sought to bring a class action lawsuit alleging improper reclassification of class members from employees to independent contractors.the trial court denied plaintiff motion to compel discovery of the contact information of potential class members.id.at,d.we held this to be an abuse of discretion relying on puerto and other recent cases holding that this type of discovery should not be restricted unless the trial court is able to identify privacy concerns or potential discovery abuses which outweigh the plaintiff right to discovery.id.at,d.
this brings us to the key question in this case the effect of the release forms.cai argues that these forms gave their employees a heightened expectation of privacy in their contact information,requiring that the contact information be given greater protection and making an opt in notice procedure proper.we are unconvinced by this argument.
we first address the question whether,as a matter of public policy,we should enforce a release form that may have the effect of waiving an employee right to notice of a pending class action lawsuit concerning the employer alleged violations of overtime and wage statutes.while not determinative,the supreme court recent opinion in gentry superior court cal th,d,is instructive.in gentry the court addressed the question whether class arbitration waivers in employment arbitration agreements may be enforced to preclude class arbitrations by employees whose statutory rights to overtime pay under the labor code allegedly have been violated.id.at,d.the court noted the legislature through its enactment in the labor code established a clear public policy that minimum wage and overtime laws should be enforced in part by private action brought by aggrieved employees.id.at,d.so great is the public policy protecting employees right to overtime compensation that the right is unwaivable.ibid.
the question the court had to consider was whether a class arbitration waiver would lead to a de facto waiver of statutory rights,or whether the ability to maintain a class action or arbitration is necessary to enable an employee to vindicate unwaivable rights in an arbitration forum.gentry superior court,supra,cal th at,d.the court concluded that under certain circumstances,a class arbitration waiver would result in a de facto waiver of statutory rights and would impermissibly interfere with employees ability to vindicate unwaivable rights and to enforce the overtime laws.ibid.
the court observed that class arbitration waivers in wage and overtime cases
