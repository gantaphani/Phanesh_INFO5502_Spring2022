defendants,the michigan parole board and the director of the michigan department of corrections,appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs on their ex post facto claim.plaintiffs,inmates in the custody of the michigan department of corrections sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole for offenses committed before october,brought this action to challenge the michigan parole board application of changes to michigan parole laws to plaintiffs parole review.the district court,in determining that application of the changes to plaintiffs violated the ex post facto clause,relied on statistics showing average annual rates of parole and average years served at parole from to,as well as evidence that the reconstituted parole board had curtailed the exercise of its discretion in a wholesale fashion.the district court subsequently entered a permanent injunction and awarded plaintiffs costs and attorney fees.
to the extent that plaintiffs face a risk of increased punishment under the parole laws as compared to the laws in effect when they committed their offenses,we can not conclude that changes to the parole laws caused such an increase.rather,the new board low rates of parole may be attributable largely to the legitimate exercise of discretion in granting fewer paroles.even assuming that changes in the number of paroles did not result from a stricter exercise of discretion,it is not clear that plaintiffs have shown a sufficient risk of increased punishment to prevail on their ex post facto claim.thus plaintiffs were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law,and the summary judgment and grant of injunctive relief must be reversed.
plaintiffs filed this class action lawsuit against the michigan parole board and the director of the michigan department of corrections pursuant to.plaintiffs allege that changes to michigan parole laws in and,as implemented and applied retroactively to their parole review,violate the ex post facto and due process clauses of the united states constitution.the district court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification.the parties later agreed to define the class as 
a ll parolable lifers in the custody of the michigan department of corrections who committed crimes for which they received a parolable life sentence before october,and whose parole the new parole board has denied,passed over,expressed no interest in pursuing,or otherwise rejected or deferred.excluded from this definition are drug lifers who were convicted of distribution or possession of controlled substances,regardless of whether the crime was one originally subject to parolable life or one converted to parolable life at a later time.
parolable lifer is a term used by the parties and the district court to refer to a prisoner sentenced to imprisonment for life for an offense other than first degree murder,first degree criminal sexual conduct,or a few other specific categories of offenses.see.comp.laws.thus the plaintiff class generally includes inmates sentenced to life with the possibility of parole,for crimes.
an inmate sentenced to parolable life for a crime committed before october,comes within the board jurisdiction after he or she has served ten calendar years of the life sentence.comp.laws a.once an inmate comes within the board jurisdiction,the board may parole the inmate at any time,see,although release on parole is discretionary with the parole board,id.at all times relevant to this lawsuit,the statutory discretion has been limited by the requirement that a prisoner shall not be given liberty on parole until the board has reasonable assurance,after consideration of all of the facts and circumstances,including the prisoner mental and social attitude,that the prisoner will not become a menace to society or to the public safety.id.a.if the board decides not to parole an inmate after he or she has served ten years,then the board reviews the inmate for parole periodically thereafter,until the inmate is paroled,discharged,or deceased.id.b.
if the board decides to move forward with the parole process,either at the mark or following an inmate subsequent review,then the board holds a public hearing.id.c.the board must give notice of the hearing to the inmate sentencing judge or that judge successor in office.id.if the sentencing judge files written objections to the granting of the parole within days of receipt of the notice of hearing,then the process comes to an end.id.absent an objection,however,the board ultimately decides whether to grant parole after holding the public hearing.see id.a d.
plaintiffs ex post facto and due process claims are based on the cumulative effect of statutory changes to the structure and composition of the board in and changes to parole procedures in and.from the board establishment in until,board members were within the state civil service.pub.acts at see also.pub.acts at.according to one former director of the michigan department of corrections,serving as a board member was like any other civil service job a member could stay until he or she wanted to leave or was removed for cause.in,however,the michigan legislature repealed the provision that had established the civil service board.pub.acts at,and created instead a board of ten members who shall not be within the state civil service.comp.laws a emphasis added see.pub.acts at.this represented a increase in the size of the board.compare.pub.acts at there is established in the department a parole board consisting of members,with.comp.laws a beginning october,there is established in the department,a parole board consisting of members.as of,board members are limited to terms,although a member may seek reappointment at the end of his or her term.comp.laws a.the law now also requires that a t least members of the parole board shall be persons who,at the time of their appointment,have never been employed by or appointed to a position in the department of corrections.id.
like the structure and composition of the board,the procedure for paroling inmates sentenced to parolable life has also changed over time.until,inmates sentenced to parolable life could expect an initial interview with the board after having served seven years,with subsequent interviews at no greater than intervals following the initial interview,a interview structure.mdoc policy directive,parole board interview and decision criteria,effective,see mdoc policy directive,parole board interview and decision criteria,effective,mdoc policy directive,parole board interview and decision criteria,effective june.in,the michigan legislature amended the law to require the initial interview at the mark with subsequent interviews biennially thereafter,a interview structure.pub.acts at a.the legislature changed the law again a decade later such that,as of,a board member is not statutorily required to interview an inmate sentenced to parolable life before the inmate comes within the board jurisdiction.rather,the initial interview is required only after the inmate has served ten years.comp.laws a see.pub.acts at a.moreover,as of,the inmate could expect to be reinterviewed as infrequently as every five years,a interview structure,not every two or three years as had been the previous practice.pub.acts at a.
in,the legislature eliminated the statutory reinterview requirement altogether.as a result,as of,a board member need only interview an inmate sentenced to parolable life after the inmate has served ten years.see.comp.laws a.pub.acts at a.interviews take place thereafter as determined by the board.comp.laws a.rather than requiring regular reinterview of an inmate,the statute now requires the board to review the inmate paper file at intervals.id.b see.pub.acts at b.at oral argument,however,the board counsel stated that,in practice,the board exercises its discretion to reinterview an inmate every ten years following the initial interview.
legislative changes in also curtailed an inmate right to judicial review of the denial of parole.the legislature had made an inmate right to appeal explicit in by providing that the action of the parole board in granting or denying a parole shall be appealable to the circuit court.pub.acts at.before,the law had provided only that the board action of releasing an inmate was not reviewable if in compliance with law.pub.acts at see.pub.acts at.pub.acts at.as a result of the amendments,only the prosecutor or the victim of an inmate crime has a statutory right to appeal the board decision to grant parole.comp.laws see.pub.acts at.
plaintiffs also allege that in the the board stopped providing written reasons to explain its lack of interest in moving an inmate forward to a public hearing.see mdoc policy directive,parole board interview and decision criteria,effective,setting forth board practice of prepar ing a written summary of board action on all parole denial cases.this change appears to have been within the statutory discretion of the board.since,michigan law has required that w hen the parole board makes a final determination not to release a prisoner,the prisoner shall be provided with a written explanation of the reason for denial.comp.laws see.pub.acts at.the michigan court of appeals in,by interpreting final determination to mean determinations that had progressed through all the steps in the parole eligibility process,refused to require a written explanation at the no interest stage.gilmore parole.while plaintiffs argue that a subtle change in the statutory amendments,dealing with the requirement of a public hearing provided the basis for the board policy change in this regard,the gilmore court did not mention,much less rely upon,that statutory change.
in sum,the statutory amendments that provide the basis for plaintiffs ex post facto challenge altered the structure and composition of the board reduced the frequency of parole reviews after an initial interview substituted paper reviews for interviews eliminated plaintiffs right to appeal a denial of parole and contained new language consistent with the board practice of not giving written reasons for a statement of no interest in moving forward with parole.plaintiffs allege that the board retroactive application of the and changes to the parole laws creates a significant risk that plaintiffs will face greater punishment than they would have faced under the law in place at the time they committed their offenses.
the board initially moved to dismiss plaintiffs complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.the district court granted in part and denied in part the board motion.see rubitschun,wl e.most significant for purposes of this appeal,the district court granted the board motion with regard to plaintiffs due process claim on the ground that plaintiffs do not have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in parole.id.at.moreover,to the extent that plaintiffs sentencing judges assumed that parole procedures would not change over time,this assumption was improper and,therefore,did not amount to a factual error in sentencing that violated due process.id.the district court denied the board motion with respect to plaintiffs ex post facto claim,id.at,and concluded that this court decision in shabazz gabry,cir,did not preclude plaintiffs ex post facto challenge,wl,at.in shabazz,a more comprehensive plaintiff class lost a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the change to a interview structure.the district court determined that,because the michigan legislature had made additional changes to the parole laws in after this court had decided shabazz,the cumulative effect of the and changes to michigan parole laws could not have been litigated in shabazz.id.at.according to the district court,a state can not continuously make minor changes in the parole process that,taken together,create a sufficient risk of an increased penalty but,when looked at alone,would not violate the ex post facto clause.id.at.
following discovery,the parties for summary judgment on plaintiffs ex post facto claim.on october,the district court granted plaintiffs motion and denied the board motion.see rubitschun,wl.the district court determined that the discretionary nature of the board decision whether to grant parole did not preclude plaintiffs ex post facto challenge.id.at.after considering the cumulative effect of the challenged amendments to the parole laws,id.at,the district court concluded that the change in the of the michigan parole board,the board understanding of why the change occurred and how it was to exercise its discretion,its redefining of the eligibility procedure for inmates sentenced to parolable life,and changes to the timing and intervals of the interview and review process,when considered in total have significantly disadvantaged the class and constitute a violation of the ex post facto clause,id.at.
more specifically,the district court found that the,or old,board had treated inmates serving parolable life sentences and inmates serving long indeterminate sentences the same to ensure that inmates who had committed similar who had been similarly serve similar time in prison.id.at.the new board,by contrast,took the position that life means life and,accordingly,treated inmates sentenced to parolable life differently than inmates serving long indeterminate sentences.id.at.in addition,members of the new board focused on the seriousness of an inmate offense as the most relevant factor in deciding whether to grant parole.id.at.the district court found that this myopic view of the relevant factors led to the erosion of the substantive standard for granting parole.id.furthermore,the district court found that,in practice,the new board does not review the file of an inmate sentenced to parolable life any more frequently than every five years,no matter the inmate individual circumstances.id.at.the district court also determined that the value of the interview,all but eliminated from the parole process in,can not be overstated.id.at.
the district court relied in large part on statistical evidence in concluding that,as a result of the and changes to the parole laws,plaintiffs faced a sufficient risk of increased punishment to prevail on their ex post facto claim.id.at.according to the district court,parole rates from until show that inmates sentenced to parolable life were paroled at a steady percent rate,with the average time served steady at years.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court reported that the new board parole rate was,by contrast,just meanwhile,the average number of years served climbed from during,to during.id.the district court assigned credit for the pipeline paroles paroles of inmates whom the old board,near the end of its tenure,moved forward to public hearings but for whom the decision whether to grant parole ultimately rested with the new the old board rather than the new board.id.at.as a result,the district court refused to credit the new board with any paroles during the transition period from to thus,for purposes of the district court analysis,the new board effectively began its tenure in.id.at.the district court also declined to consider the new board numbers,because plaintiffs filed their class action complaint in april.id.
importantly,the district court excused the marked decrease in the old board parole rates from to because the decrease was not due to a change in the parole laws.id.at.rather,the decrease was attributable to a number of other causes,including the governor invocation of the prison overcrowding emergency powers act,which,with each invocation,moved forward by ninety days the release dates for inmates with minimum sentences,thereby increasing the number of inmates eligible for parole and bur ying the board with new cases an overall increase in the prison population and,in particular,an increase in the number of inmates sentenced to parolable life in the these inmates were just coming within the board jurisdiction by the and a statutory amendment that required more frequent parole interviews for inmates sentenced to parolable of,these inmates had a interview structure.id.at.
after granting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,the district court solicited proposed remedial orders from both parties.on february,the district court entered a declaratory judgment holding that the defendants have been and remain in violation of the ex post facto clause of the constitution.the district court also entered a permanent injunction with terms the court deemed the least restrictive it could impose to cure the board ex post facto violation.the district court injunctive order required the board to compile a list of the first quartile of the plaintiff class as soon as practicable and to interview those plaintiffs within five months of the entry of the order.the injunctive order further instructed the board to apply the parole laws,policies,procedures,and standards that were applied by the old parole board in the decades before,to the extent possible,and listed a number of sources the board should consult for guidance.the district court ordered the board to report back with the results of the interviews within six months and to have compiled a list of plaintiffs by that time.
the board has since submitted two progress reports for the district court review.on november,in response to the board second progress report,the district court supplemented its original injunctive order by imposing additional reporting requirements.the district court supplemental order also required the board to make an inmate complete psychological records available for review online by all board members before they vote whether to move the inmate forward to a public hearing.
subsequent to the entry of the initial remedial order,the district court awarded plaintiffs costs and attorney fees.the board now appeals the district court grant of plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,entry of the declaratory judgment and permanent injunction,and award of plaintiffs costs and attorney fees.plaintiffs the dismissal of their due process claim.
after filing notice of their appeal,the board twice moved this court to stay the original injunctive order and all further district court proceedings during the pendency of the appeal.a motions panel of this court denied both motions.following oral argument,however,and in response to the district court november,supplemental order,the board again moved to stay the original injunctive order and all further district court proceedings.this panel granted the board motion with respect to the november,supplemental order but denied the board motion in all other respects.thus the permanent injunction has remained in effect and the board has released a number of plaintiffs on parole during the pendency of this appeal indeed,as of november,three of four quartiles of the plaintiff class had been or were currently going through the review process.
ex post facto claim 
plaintiffs have not shown that they face a significant risk of increased punishment as a result of the challenged statutory changes to michigan parole process rather than as a result of the new board legitimate exercise of discretion in a way that results in fewer paroles.in any event,we are not confident that plaintiffs have even shown a significant risk of increased punishment under the parole regime.accordingly,plaintiffs were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
the ex post facto clause is aimed at laws that retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts.cal.dep t of corr.morales,citations omitted.when an inmate challenges an allegedly ex post facto parole law,this court must examine the relevant law in effect at the time the inmate offense was committed and compare it with the version of the law.shabazz,at.the focus of the ex post facto inquiry is not on whether a legislative change produces some ambiguous sort of disadvantage,but on whether the change increases the penalty by which a crime is punishable.morales,at.where a legislative change is argued to increase the risk of affecting a prisoner punishment,the supreme court has made clear that the appropriate inquiry is whether the version of the parole law produces a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered crimes.id.at.when the version of the law does not by its own terms show a significant risk of increased punishment,the inmate bringing the ex post facto challenge must demonstrate,by evidence drawn from the law practical implementation by the agency charged with exercising discretion,that the law retroactive application will result in a longer period of incarceration than under the earlier version of the law.garner jones.
to the extent that plaintiffs have shown they face a significant risk of increased punishment under the new parole regime,plaintiffs have not shown that this risk is attributable to statutory changes to the parole process and not to a change in the way the board legitimately exercises its discretion.the decision whether to grant parole has always been within the board discretion.see.comp.laws.therefore,from the time plaintiffs committed their offenses,there was always the possibility the board would exercise its discretion in a way that would result in fewer paroles and longer prison terms.as the michigan court of appeals stated in people hill,t here was always a significant risk that plaintiffs would be made to serve their life sentence s.
throughout the time period relevant to this suit,the statutory scope of the board range of discretion has remained the same.parole is within the board discretion,but a prisoner shall not be given liberty on parole until the board has reasonable assurance,after consideration of all of the facts and circumstances,including the prisoner mental and social attitude,that the prisoner will not become a menace to society or to the public safety.comp.laws a.despite the fact that the scope of the board discretion has remained the same,plaintiffs argue that,in practice,the new board applied a harsher standard than the old board when deciding whether to grant parole.however,plaintiffs contentions do not make out an ex post facto violation.
if the parole board decided within its discretion to get tougher,that could hardly amount to an ex post facto violation as long as it was within the parole board discretion to get tougher.this would be true even if the tougher attitude resulted from a change in personnel on the board,even if the board members independently developed a tougher attitude,and even if the board members partook of a general public attitude that parole decisions should be tougher.by analogy,there is no ex post facto violation if a lenient judge is replaced by a strict one in a particular jurisdiction,such that a certain crime,say shoplifting or drunk driving,now regularly gets a sentence well above what was previously the case.without some legal change other than a difference in the proper exercise of discretion,the shoplifter or the drunk driver simply had no ex post interest in the more lenient sentence,as long as the more severe sentence was within the range available to the sentencing judge at the time of the crime.
plaintiffs arguments that the new board members acted in a tougher exercise of their retained discretion thus cut against finding an ex post facto violation.plaintiffs point to evidence that changes to the parole laws in were motivated by the desire to increase public safety by granting fewer paroles.indeed,a report issued by the michigan department of corrections in suggests that,when the legislature overhaul ed the board and the parole process itself in,the intent was to make michigan communities safer by making more criminals serve more time and keeping many more locked up for as long as possible.dep t of,five years after an analysis of the michigan parole board since,at.the report also asserts that one of the most important differences since the overhaul is a parole board that is much less willing to release criminals who complete their minimum much less willing to release criminals at all,forcing many to serve their maximum sentences.id.
plaintiffs contend that the new board,which by statute must include at least four members with no experience in the department of corrections.comp.laws a,placed greater emphasis on an inmate underlying offense and less emphasis on the inmate rehabilitation when deciding whether to grant parole.plaintiffs submitted the sworn statements of several members of the new board to support this contention.for example,gary gabry,a former county prosecutor who chaired the new board from to,recalls 
i often found myself trying to get the focus off the crime and onto the candidate recent record in prison.i pushed the board to focus more on the prisoner behavior,adjustment and future plans and not primarily the sentencing offense,but it nearly always fell on deaf ears with at least five members of the board.
gabry believes that after the addition of school teachers and other professionals to the board,it was just much harder for a prisoner to get out on parole.in gabry opinion,the in paroles was largely a reflection of the new type of people who were appointed to the parole board in.
plaintiffs argue that the new board low rates of parole can only be attributed to its life means life policy.as evidence of the existence of this policy,plaintiffs quote public statements by and on behalf of the new board.for example,when stephen marschke,who served as a member and then as chair of the new board,submitted written testimony in support of proposed changes to the parole laws in,he stated 
it has been a long standing philosophy of the michigan parole board that a life sentence means just in prison it is the parole board belief that something exceptional must occur which would cause the parole board to request the sentencing judge or governor to set aside a life sentence.good behavior is expected and is not in and of itself grounds for parole.
marschke test.in support of proposed legis.
at bottom,plaintiffs evidence shows that the new board exercised its discretion rigorously,resulting in fewer paroles than under the old board.as the united states supreme court has explained in the clearest terms,
t o the extent there inheres in ex post facto doctrine some idea of actual or constructive notice to the criminal before commission of the offense of the penalty for the transgression,we can say with some assurance that where parole is concerned discretion,by its very definition,is subject to changes in the manner in which it is informed and then exercised.the idea of discretion is that it has the capacity,and the obligation,to change and adapt based on experience.new insights into the accuracy of predictions about the offense and the risk of recidivism consequent upon the offender release,along with a complex of other factors,will inform parole decisions.
garner,at citations omitted.the most that can be said here is that,based on experience,the new board discretion was informed and then exercised in a way that made it more difficult for plaintiffs to secure release on parole.
t he ex post facto clause gives an inmate no cause to complain that the board in place at the time of his offense has been replaced by a new,board that is much more parsimonious with parole id.at scalia,concurring.plaintiffs conceded at oral argument that there would be no ex post facto violation if the new board had gradually changed the way it exercises discretion or if board members had been replaced one by one over time.there is,however,no reason to distinguish between gradual change and wholesale change for purposes of this ex post facto analysis.nor is there a constitutional requirement that changes in the exercise of discretion be made over time.thus plaintiffs allegations pertaining to the composition of the new board do not establish an ex post facto violation.
with respect to plaintiffs loss of the right to appeal a denial of parole,any harm resulting from this change to the law is too speculative to contribute to the alleged risk of increased punishment in any significant way.from to,inmates filed appeals from board decisions,but only about four percent of those cases were remanded to the board for reconsideration,and only about of a percent ultimately resulted in parole.jackson jamrog,cir quoting house legislative analysis,first analysis,at.as the board points out,appeals by inmates sentenced to parolable life likely represented only a fraction of those percentages.plaintiffs counter that the right to appeal is important because just one successful case can change the law for all prisoners.although plaintiffs statement is arguably true,it does not change the facts.because the loss of the right to appeal creates only the most speculative and attenuated possibility of producing the prohibited effect of increasing the measure of punishment attached to plaintiffs crimes,morales,at,this change in the law does not contribute in a significant way to the risk of increased punishment alleged as the basis for the ex post facto claim.
plaintiffs have not shown that the remainder of the statutory and regulatory changes to the parole,the change to a interview structure,the substitution of paper reviews for interviews,and the loss of written reasons to explain a statement of no interest in moving forward with practically implemented and applied retroactively,create a sufficient risk of increased punishment to prevail on their ex post facto claim.first,this court decided previously that the change from a or a interview structure to a interview structure does not on its face create a sufficient risk of increased punishment to establish an ex post facto violation.see shabazz,at.second,and more clearly dispositive,to the extent that plaintiffs have shown a decrease in the average annual rate of parole or an increase in the average years served at parole since the new board took office,this court can not isolate the cause of those effects on the record in this case.in other words,there is no way for this court to determine whether any decrease in the parole rate or any increase in the average years served is due to the challenged statutory changes to the parole process or to the board stricter exercise of its discretion.indeed,plaintiffs ex post facto claim is explicitly premised on the cumulative effect of changes to parole policies and procedures in and changes in the way board members exercise their discretion.it is not enough for plaintiffs to show that a legislative change produces some ambiguous sort of disadvantage.morales,at.and plaintiffs can not distinguish the effect of the statutory changes to the interview process from the effect of the board more rigorous,yet still legitimate,exercise of its discretion.therefore,plaintiffs were not entitled to summary judgment on their ex post facto claim.
in any event,we are not even confident the statistics show a significant risk of increased punishment under the parole laws as compared to the laws in effect when plaintiffs committed their offenses.as a preliminary matter,the parties disagree as to how this court should measure the effect of changes to the parole laws.plaintiffs assert that the average annual rate of parole is the relevant measure,and they compare the new board rates to the old board rates in an effort to show that the statutory changes created a significant risk of increased punishment.in contrast to plaintiffs,the board argues that the annual number of paroles is the proper measure and that plaintiffs ex post facto claim is unfounded because the new board number of paroles for the period from to was greater than the old board number of paroles for the period from to.
in fact,the data suggest that the real difference between the tenures of the two boards was in the number of inmates sentenced to parolable life who had served ten years and could thus be considered for parole.this number provides the denominator for plaintiffs parole rate calculations.according to the data plaintiffs provided in their brief on appeal,see pls.br,this number has increased significantly since the early 
despite the increasing number of inmates sentenced to parolable life who could be paroled,according to the figures plaintiffs provided in their brief,pls.br.the new board parole rates did not differ significantly from the old board rates during the final years of its tenure 
these data suggest that the practical implementation of changes to the parole laws did not result in a parole rate significantly lower than the rate that had resulted from th
