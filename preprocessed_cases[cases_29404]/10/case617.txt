this collective action under the fair labor standards act flsa,on behalf of hourly employees of mcwane,mcwane,sought payment for time spent donning and doffing protective gear.the district court granted summary judgment on the basis that at each plant there existed a custom or practice of not compensating pre or post shift time spent putting on and taking off protective gear.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
mcwane operates plants that manufacture cast iron pipe and fittings.the hourly employees at mcwane plants wear protective gear while at work,including hard hats,boots,safety glasses,and ear plugs.this appeal involves hourly workers at ten mcwane plants that operate under collective bargaining agreements cbas.different cbas govern each of the plants,and workers are employed subject to the terms of their respective cba.three of the plants operate under cbas that expressly exclude compensation for pre and donning and doffing of protective gear the other seven cbas do not address pre and time spent putting on and taking off protective gear 
the workers at the plants are paid by the hour,based on shift or line time.line time refers to the practice of measuring the shift as starting when the first item hits the processing line and ending as the last item leaves the processing line.none of mcwane employees at these plants have ever received compensation for pre and changing time.union representatives and the employees attest that they were not aware that the pre and changing time was potentially compensable under the flsa.compensation for such time was never discussed in union meetings or in meetings between union representatives and mcwane,including the meetings where the cbas were negotiated.
collectively,allen filed their collective claim against mcwane,on behalf of over mcwane employees,under and b of the flsa.they sought compensation for time spent putting on and taking off gear before and after their scheduled shifts.the district court conditionally certified the case as a collective action.mcwane moved for summary judgment,and the motion was referred to the magistrate judge.relying on anderson cagle,cir,the magistrate judge recommended that summary judgment should be granted because o of the flsa was applicable.allen filed objections to the magistrate recommendations.the district court considered and overruled allen objections,adopted the magistrate judge recommendations,and granted summary judgment in favor of mcwane.allen timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.mcgavock city of water valley,cir.summary judgment is warranted when the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the moving party has the burden of demonstrating that there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute.harvill westward commc ns,cir.this court resolves any doubts and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.united states ex rel.longhi united states,cir.additionally,we construe the flsa liberally in favor of employees mcgavock,at.
this appeal requires construction of o of the flsa,which allows for the exclusion from the computation of hours worked,under certain circumstances,of time spent changing clothes at the beginning or end of each workday.the controlling issue is whether a o custom or practice of for such time existed.in addition,the parties dispute who has the burden of proof under o and whether material issues of fact exist.
custom or practice of under o 
the fair labor standards act of establishes the general rule that employees must receive overtime compensation at one and times the regular rate for hours worked in excess of hours during a workweek.mcgavock,at a.section a states 
employees engaged in interstate commerce additional applicability to employees pursuant to subsequent amendatory provisions 
except as otherwise provided in this section,no employer shall employ any of his employees who in any workweek is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce,or is employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce,for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and times the regular 
rate at which he is employed.
under o,the time spent changing clothes is to be excluded from the measured working time for purposes of if it has been excluded by custom or practice under a bona fide agreement.bejil ethicon,cir o.section o states 
hours determining for the purposes of sections and of this title the hours for which an employee is employed,there shall be excluded any time spent in changing clothes or washing at the beginning or end of each workday which was excluded from measured working time during the week involved by the express terms of or by custom or practice under a bona fide agreement applicable to the particular 
allen argues that here the facts do not establish a custom or practice under a bona fide agreement that would make changing time allen claims that compensation for the pre and changing time is a right under the flsa,subject to exclusion only if it has been affirmatively bargained away in cba negotiations,negotiation of whether to pay for pre and changing time must be shown before the court may conclude that there was a custom or practice as provided in o.according to allen,there has been no acquiescence or waiver here because the union representatives did not have knowledge of the right to compensation for this pre and changing time,nor any knowledge of or acquiescence to a policy of nonpayment for that time.
this court addressed a related issue in bejil whether employees had a right to compensation for changing time where the union and the employer had discussed that very question during cba negotiations,but the cba ultimately remained silent on the matter.at.we concluded that such silence in the cba,after the parties negotiated over the matter,resulted in a custom or practice of not compensating the employees for the changing time,and therefore o barred claims for back wages for such time.id.here,unlike in bejil,there was no discussion of whether mcwane should compensate the allen plaintiffs for such clothes changing time.
the third and eleventh circuits have considered the specific question of whether o requires the employees and employer to have discussed the issue of compensation for pre and changing time,where the cba is silent on the issue,in order to find that a custom or practice of nonpayment existed pursuant to a cba.the third and eleventh circuits concluded that it was not necessary for the issue to have been raised in negotiations.anderson cagle,cir turner city of philadelphia,cir.
turner presented the following uncontested facts philadelphia had not compensated corrections officers for uniform change time for over years every cba between philadelphia and the officers had been silent as to compensation for change time the union president proposed at labor management meetings with philadelphia labor relations administrator that change time be made compensable,but the union did not make this request in formal cba negotiations the union did,however,ask for and receive a uniform maintenance allowance and the union never filed a grievance or demanded arbitration based on the of change time.turner,at.
the turner plaintiffs made an argument similar to the one articulated by allen,that a custom or practice of can not come into being unless the issue of compensability is specifically raised in formal collective bargaining negotiations,and then dropped by the negotiators.id.at.rejecting this approach,the third circuit held that the plaintiffs and their union had acquiesced to the municipal government policy of not compensating for changing time.id.at.the court explained 
we think that plaintiffs interpret the phrase custom or practice under a bona fide agreement too narrowly,placing undue emphasis on the clause under a bona fide agreement while virtually reading the clause custom or practice out of o.in essence,plaintiffs construe custom or practice under a bona fide agreement as custom or practice established through formal collective bargaining negotiations.to the contrary,we view the phrase as simply restating the principle of labor law that a particular custom or practice can become an implied term 
of a labor agreement through a prolonged period of acquiescence.
id.at.the turner court also rejected the argument that the plaintiffs had an antecedent right to payment under the flsa such that they could not acquiesce to without the issue being negotiated,noting that o itself defines what work time is encompassed by that right to payment.id.at.
in anderson,the employer had not compensated the employees for time spent donning and doffing protective gear for approximately ten years.at.additionally,the court assumed for purposes of its decision that every cba during the relevant time period had been silent as to compensation for changing time,and assumed that the parties had never discussed the policy.id.at.the anderson court followed turner,also rejecting the argument that a custom or practice under o can not exist unless the parties negotiated about the policy.id.at.relying again on a common sense understanding of the statute language,we believe that a policy concerning compensation for clothes changing,written or unwritten,in force or effect at the time a cba was executed satisfies o requirement of a custom or practice under a bona fide cba.id.absence of negotiations can not in this instance equate to ignorance of the policy.rather,it demonstrates acquiescence to it.id.at.
the eleventh circuit noted that the issue in anderson was not controlled by the fifth circuit decision in hoover wyandotte chemicals corporation,cir.in hoover,another action to recover overtime pay under the flsa,this court held that employees were not entitled to additional compensation for the extra eight to ten minutes of clothes changing time that they requested during collective bargaining negotiations,but which was not incorporated into the executed cba.id.at.the custom and practice of the employer for approximately fifteen years had been to pay for fifteen minutes of changing time.during the most recent cba negotiations,pay for minutes of time had been requested but not adopted.hoover held that the request did not change the custom or practice,which was to pay only for fifteen minutes of changing time.id.at.although the employer had agreed to pay for changing time,where the employees raised the issue during cba negotiations but there was no change in practice by the employer or change to the cba on the issue,the relevant custom of for clothes changing time over fifteen minutes remained unaltered.
allen both criticizes the reasoning of turner and anderson and tries to distinguish them.allen observes that in anderson the plaintiffs did not contend that they lacked notice of the relevant compensation policy,whereas here the employees and their union representatives were unaware of the potential for compensation under the flsa.at.however,neither turner nor anderson address the employees awareness of the law,much less find it to be a controlling factor in their holding.anderson merely observed that the plaintiffs were aware that the company had a policy of not paying for pre and clothes changing time.id.similar facts were present in turner.at.both courts concluded that silence by the employees and their union as to the of this time when the cbas were executed meant that a custom or practice of nonpayment was established pursuant to a cba,and thus the time was not to be calculated as hours worked under o.
allen relies heavily on the reasoning employed by kassa kerry,d.in kassa,the defendant moved for summary judgment based on o.the court voiced its agreement with turner,and determined that o may apply even where for changing time was never raised in negotiations.the court then identified three elements as essential to determine the existence of a custom or practice under o time,knowledge,and acquiescence.id.at relying on detroit toledo shore line united transp.union.kassa assigned the burden to the defendant to show that its policy of for time lasted for a sufficiently long time,with sufficient knowledge and acquiescence by the employees,that the policy became an implicit custom or practice under the cba.id.at.in kassa,the record established that the by defendant had occurred for six years and the union had never complained about when executing the cba.id.the district court found this insufficient as a matter of law to establish a custom or practice,and denied summary judgment.
allen also relies on the supreme court statement in barrentine freight system,that flsa rights can not be abridged by contract or otherwise waived barrentine addressed whether employees at a plant operating under a cba could sue their employer for violations of the minimum wage provisions of the flsa.the cba in barrentine required the employees to submit the claim to a grievance committee when they did so,the committee rejected their claims.the court held that the right to sue for the violation of the flsa could not be abridged or waived.id.at.there is a significant distinction between the minimum wage provision at issue in barrentine and the application of o in the instant case the flsa rights at issue in barrentine are independent of the collective bargaining process.id.at.by contrast,under o the right to be paid for pre or changing time may be abridged by bona fide cba.see also livadas bradshaw,addressing question of meaningful bargaining under the national labor relations act,referring to o of the flsa as an example of a narrowly drawn provision,and noting employees have full protection of the minium standard absent any agreement for something different.
we are persuaded by the reasoning of the third and eleventh circuits,and join them in holding that even when negotiations never included the issue of for changing time,a policy of for changing time that has been in effect for a prolonged period of time,and that was in effect at the time a cba was executed,satisfies o s requirement of a custom or practice under a bona fide cba.see anderson,at policy of had been in place for at least ten years turner,at policy of had been in place for thirty years.in such instances,regardless of whether the parties negotiated regarding compensation for changing time,acquiescence of the employees may be inferred.by contrast,where there have been no relevant negotiations and the facts do not demonstrate that a policy of for changing time has been in effect for a prolonged period of time,other evidence of knowledge and acquiescence by the employees will be required.see gatewood koch foods of,d,holding that even in the absence of a tradition of or negotiations for compensation of time spent changing clothes,when employees and union representatives are conclusively aware of the facts surrounding compensation policies for changing clothes at the beginning and end of each workday,and reach an agreement under a cba that does not compensate employees for the time,a practice exists under the cba sufficient to invoke the o defense 
thus,as long as there was a company policy of for time spent changing for a prolonged period of the court to infer that the union had knowledge of and acquiesced to the employer a cba existed,the parties need not have explicitly discussed such compensation when negotiating the cba.mcwane only need prove that the parties had a custom or practice of under the agreement.bejil,at.it is undisputed that mcwane has never compensated its employees for changing time,going as far back as.after more than forty years of,we may safely infer that mcwane employees had knowledge of and acquiesced to the policy of.therefore,we conclude that mcwane has demonstrated a custom of for changing time.
burden of proof on the applicability of o 
allen urges the court to characterize o as an exemption,and argues that the application of an exemption under the flsa is an
