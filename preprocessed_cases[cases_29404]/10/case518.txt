opinion of the court 
this case comes on before this court on an appeal from an order of the district court entered on november,denying a motion for class certification filed by plaintiffs margaret johnston and paul fontaine.the plaintiffs were investors in cinema plus,a limited partnership formed to finance the production of motion pictures.they claim that the defendants made several fraudulent misrepresentations in the marketing of cinema plus,alleging various violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,and state law claims.the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification which the district court,adopting the report and recommendation of a magistrate judge,denied.for the following reasons,we will affirm the district court order denying class certification.
background 
cinema plus,a limited partnership,was formed in delaware in to produce and distribute motion pictures.defendants hbo film management,and entertainment finance services,were general partners of cinema plus and,according to plaintiffs complaint,defendant home box office,was a de facto general partner of cinema plus.defendants kidder,peabody,and smith barney,marketed interests in cinema plus to the public.
the plaintiffs allege that the defendants made material misrepresentations in marketing interests in cinema plus.specifically,the complaint claims that the brokers distributed uniform marketing materials to their sales representatives which,among other things,emphasized michael douglas participation in the production of films,but failed to disclose that he was not under contract to produce any films for cinema plus see app.at amended compl.id.at amended compl.for instance,the marketing materials included such statements as 
hell drivers to be produced by michael phillips,will be the first partnership production.
michael douglas is the hottest name in hollywood today,both as an actor who just won an academy award and a producer.he has just announced his newest production,hell drivers,and we own it that kind of sizzle will get every client attention.
investors could more than double their money or earn a multiple of their investment in three years through films produced by michael douglas,michael phillips,and aaron russo.
you know that michael douglas is one of the hottest producers today in the movie business.but did you know who was going to finance his next production you are.
michael douglas does not realize his profits as a producer until the investor has been made whole.
upside potential is a multiple of investment in three years through films by michael douglas,michael phillips,aaron russo and other top producers.
id.at.similarly,the prospectus wrapper,a summary of information contained in the prospectus distributed to the brokers,included such statements as 
the partnership has already signed three outstanding producers michael douglas,michael phillips and aaron russo.
cinema plus has already contracted with three leading producers michael douglas,michael phillips,and aaron russo 
cinema plus,is committed to working exclusively with successful producers only those with commercial track records will produce the partnership films.the partnership has already signed agreements with michael phillips and michael douglas,through their partnership,films 
the producers already under contract to the partnership are responsible for a succession of hits that have helped fuel revenue growth in the motion picture industry.
id.at id.at.the sales representatives purportedly relied upon these materials and represented to the plaintiffs that michael douglas would produce two to four films for cinema plus.the brokers,however,did not disclose the alleged falsity of their statements.
further,the plaintiffs claim written materials distributed to the investors,namely the prospectus,created a false and misleading impression,not otherwise rebutted,that michael douglas was committed to produce films for cinema plus.the prospectus states,in relevant part,that 
the partnership has contracted for michael phillips and michael douglas to render producing services for a minimum of two and a maximum of four motion pictures for the partnership.
either phillips douglas will be actively involved in a production capacity in all phases of production of all partnership films produced under the agreement.
id.at.the plaintiffs allege they relied detrimentally on their brokers misrepresentations and omissions of material information as well as those in the prospectus,in investing in cinema plus.
in fact,michael douglas did not produce any films for cinema plus,although the limited partnership did finance and market four films.the films were largely unsuccessful financially,however,resulting in a loss for the partnership,and ultimately,this lawsuit.
the plaintiffs original complaint stated four counts,alleging one claim arising under rico,with the predicate offenses of securities fraud,and state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty,negligent misrepresentation and deceptive business practices.the defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint which,in a report and recommendation filed on january,a magistrate judge recommended be granted.after objections were filed,the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendations and granted the defendants motions.the plaintiffs then appealed to this court.
on appeal,we reversed the district court order as we found that the facts alleged in the complaint stated a claim under rico.see johnston hbo film,cir table.in our opinion,we summarized the plaintiffs claims 
in short,plaintiffs allege that the appellees misrepresented that cinema plus was a safe and prudent investment when,in reality,its primary purpose was to generate large commissions and fees and create opportunities for for the defendants and the protection of the assured return of film payments was merely an illusory benefit that obfuscated the risky nature of the investment defendants were marketing.
appellants br.ex.a at magistrate judge report recommendation.we,however,expressly did not address the plaintiffs claims regarding misrepresentations about michael douglas participation in cinema plus,finding them to be outside the scope of our analysis.see id.at.
on remand,the defendants filed renewed motions to dismiss,which the district court denied.thereafter,plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging the same four counts.then,they filed a motion for class certification,which,in a report and recommendation filed october,the magistrate judge recommended be denied.on november,the district court adopted the recommendation and denied the plaintiffs motion.
therefore,on december,plaintiffs filed a petition for permission to appeal from denial of class certification,pursuant to.f.by order dated december,a motions panel of this court denied plaintiffs petition.see app.at.then,on january,plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing.on march,the motions panel vacated its earlier order and referred plaintiffs petition to a merits panel.see id.at.thereafter,on august,in light of our decision in newton merrill,lynch,pierce,fenner smith,at cir,we granted the plaintiffs petition for leave to appeal 
ii.discussion 
in assessing whether the district court erred in denying plaintiffs motion for class certification,we apply the abuse of discretion standard see in re lifeusa holding,cir holmes pension plan of bethlehem steel,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if its decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.newton,at quoting in re motors.truck fuel tank prods.liab,cir.
to obtain class certification,plaintiffs must establish all four elements of rule a along with one provision of rule b.see georgine amchem,cir wetzel liberty mut.ins,cir.rule a requires a showing of numerosity commonality typicality and adequacy of representation see.a amchem,windsor,d.if these requirements are satisfied,the court also must find that the class action is maintainable under rule b,or.see.b.in this case,the plaintiffs sought certification pursuant to rule b,which requires that questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.id.
in analyzing plaintiffs motion,the magistrate judge found that the plaintiffs failed to satisfy the predominance requirement for class certification under rule b.the district court did not address expressly the certification requirements of.a or the superiority element of rule b.nevertheless,because satisfaction of each of the rule criteria is a necessary prerequisite to class certification we address each criterion in turn.
numerosity 
to begin,proper class certification requires a finding of numerosity,or that the putative class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.a.here,inasmuch are there are thousands of potential class members,joinder would be impracticable,thereby satisfying this criteria.
commonality 
second,the district court must find commonality,or that there are questions of law or fact common to the class.a.commonality does not require an identity of claims or facts among class members instead,t he commonality requirement will be satisfied if the named plaintiffs share at least one question of fact or law with the grievances of the prospective class.in re the prudential ins.of am.sales practices,cir baby neal casey,cir.in this case inasmuch as the question of whether the defendants fraudulently misrepresented the role of michael douglas in cinema plus is a factual and legal claim common to the entire class this criterion also is met.
typicality 
third,in a properly certified class,the claims of the class representatives must be typical of the class as a whole.see prudential,at.in considering the typicality issue,the district court must determine whether the named plaintiff s individual circumstances are markedly different or the legal theory upon which the claims are based differs from that upon which the claims of other class members will perforce be based.eisenberg gagnon,cir internal quotations omitted.this criteria does not require that all putative class members share identical claims.indeed,so long as the claims of the named plaintiffs and putative class members involve the same conduct by the defendant,typicality is established regardless of factual differences.newton,at citing barnes am.tobacco,cir baby neal,at commentators have noted that cases challenging the same unlawful conduct which affects both the named plaintiffs and the putative class usually satisfy the typicality requirement irrespective of the varying fact patterns underlying the individual claims.here,because the claims of the plaintiffs and the putative class members all arise from the alleged misrepresentations by the defendants,the claims of the plaintiffs are typical of those of the class.
adequacy of representation 
fourth,class representatives must fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.a.in analyzing this criteria,the court must determine whether the representatives interests conflict with those of the class and whether the class attorney is capable of representing the class.see amchem,at.at.falcon,d newton,at.under the facts as described by the parties,there are no foreseeable conflicts between the named and putative plaintiffs.further,there is no reason to conclude that counsel would not suitably represent the class.accordingly,we find that this criterion,and therefore all of the elements of rule a,are met.
class certification also must satisfy the requirements of rule b,specifically here the predominance and superiority requirements of rule b.predominance requires that questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.b.superiority mandates that the district court determine that the class action is the best method of fairly and efficiently resolving the controversy.see id.to assist the court in analyzing cases for predominance and superiority,rule b includes a nonexclusive list of relevant factors to consider 
a the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions b the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class c the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum d the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.
id.overall,as we have recognized repeatedly,i ssues common to the class must predominate over individual issues,and the class action device must be superior to other means of handling the litigation.newton,at prudential,at.
predominance 
the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for class certification based on its conclusion that individual issues predominated over issues common to the class.see appellants br.ex.a at magistrate judge report recommendation.the court found that while the complaint alleged that the prospectus and prospectus wrapper contained representations that michael douglas would produce between two and four movies for cinema plus,the evidence indicated the plaintiffs claims actually were based on alleged oral misrepresentations see id.the question,then,was whether affirmative misrepresentations were made to particular investors,an inquiry that necessarily involves an individual review of what each investor was told and what information was provided.see id.at.to that end,the case was distinguishable from prudential,where we upheld the certification of a class alleging fraudulent insurance sales practices.see appellants br.ex.a at magistrate judge report recommendation.moreover,because the plaintiffs claimed affirmative oral misrepresentations,as opposed to omissions,determining reliance necessarily required an individualized assessment.see id.finally,because issues of reliance and causation predominated in the case,there would be insurmountable manageability problems if it proceeded to trial.id.at.
the soundness of the district court decision turns on two considerations first,whether it was appropriate to look beyond the plaintiffs pleadings that alleged the defendants made uniform oral and written misrepresentations and determine whether the record supported their claims,and second,whether the court determined correctly that reliance could not be presumed.
as to the first issue,plaintiffs contend that class issues predominate because the defendants made uniform oral and written misrepresentations.specifically,they point to the prospectus and argue that because they,as investors,are presumed to have read these materials,the defendants made uniform misrepresentations to all putative class members.further,they point to the prospectus wrapper and other uniform internal marketing materials distributed to the brokers that also contain misrepresentations,and claim the brokers relied upon them in making substantially similar and misleading sales recommendations.the evidence of record,however,simply does not support the plaintiffs claims.
the issue,then,is whether in making a class certification decision the court must take as true the allegations in the complaint where those allegations are unsupported,and in some instances rebutted,by a record.specifically,we must decide whether the district court erred in finding that notwithstanding plaintiffs claim that the brokers,relying upon uniform sales materials,made materially similar misrepresentations,that plaintiffs case actually is based on individualized misrepresentations.recently,we addressed an issue of this nature in newton and held that i n reviewing a motion for class certification,a preliminary inquiry into the merits is sometimes necessary to determine whether the alleged claims can be properly resolved as a class action.id.at see falcon,at.at stating it may be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question.in newton,faced with claims of a common scheme of misrepresentation constituting a rule private securities fraud claim,we held that the case presented an instance in which the court must probe beyond the surface of plaintiffs allegations.see id.
we began our analysis by examining the elements of the underlying cause of action,noting that such an analysis is critically important to the predominance determination under rule b.see id.at.this is so because 
the elements of the rule claim which remain in dispute,requiring proof of individualized reliance and injury from each member of the proposed plaintiff class effectively would prevent plaintiffs from proceeding with a class action,since individual issues then would overwhelm the common ones.on the other hand,presuming these elements would resolve the problem of balancing the substantive requirement of proof of reliance and injury in securities cases against the procedural requisites of federal rule of civil procedure.if proof of the essential elements of the cause of action requires individual treatment,then class certification is unsuitable.
id.internal quotations and citations omitted.then,in considering the elements of reliance and economic injury,we looked to the parties evidence and concluded,despite plaintiffs allegations that they had suffered economic injury,that the plaintiffs were not entitled to a presumption of injury.see id.at accordingly,we found that because each individual claim would have to be examined to ascertain whether or not there was injury,individual issues overwhelmed common questions among the class.see id.at.we therefore held that class certification inappropriate.see id.at.
our decision in in re lifeusa holding,also is instructive.there,the district court certified a class of plaintiffs who had purchased annuity policies based on the court finding that the gravamen of plaintiffs claims is that defendant sales techniques and advertising constituted an allegedly fraudulent scheme.id.at.however,on appeal and for the first time,plaintiffs argued their claims were not based on the sales presentations made by the defendant agents,but rather were predicated on fraud and misconduct.see id.we therefore vacated the district court certification order and remanded the matter for a redetermination of the issue utilizing the proper fraud allegations.see id.
nevertheless,we addressed the merits of the district court certification decision.see id.at.in doing so,we first focused on whether there was predominance,and therefore commonality,among the plaintiffs claims.see id.at because common questions commonality must be established before predominance can be found,we turn to that element.relying on georgine and barnes,two cases,we noted that class certification was inappropriate in cases that present individualized issues of liability.see id.at citing georgine,at barnes,at.in georgine,which involved certification of a nationwide settlement class of persons exposed to asbestos,we held that the predominance requirement was not satisfied because each individual plaintiff claim raises radically different factual and legal issues from those of other plaintiffs.georgine,at.similarly,in barnes we affirmed the decertification of a class of cigarette smokers who asserted claims against a cigarette manufacturer,finding that the individual issues involved made class treatment inappropriate.see barnes,at.
applying these principles,in lifeusa we found that commonality did not exist,and therefore common questions could not predominate over individual issues.see lifeusa,at.we stated that the plaintiffs claims arose not out of one single event or misrepresentation,but claims allegedly made to over purchasers by over independent agents where the district court found that the sales presentations hence the alleged misrepresentations were neither uniform nor scripted.id.at.
further,we found that the district court reliance on prudential was misplaced and unfortunate as the factual backgrounds,as demonstrated through depositions,affidavits and declarations,were markedly different.id.unlike in prudential,the annuity in lifeusa was not sold according to standard,uniform,scripted sales presentations.compare in re the prudential ins.of am.sales practices,with lifeusa,at.further,the lifeusa annuities were sold by independent agents who learned about the annuity from written materials,some of which were not uniform or generated by the defendant,and from voluntary seminars.see lifeusa,at.moreover,selling agents did not utilize the marketing materials uniformly some agents discarded the materials entirely while others tailored their presentations to each customer objectives.see id.
finally,the plaintiffs testified that if they received information from the sales agents prior to purchasing annuities,they neither relied upon nor recalled its substance.see id.therefore,we found the record to be uncompromising in revealing and individualized sales pitches presented by independent and different sales agents,all subject to varying defenses and differing state laws,thus making certification of individualized issues inappropriate.id.at.thus,we vacated the district court certification order.see id.at.
in szabo bridgeport machines,cir,the court of appeals for the seventh circuit helpfully discussed the issue before us.there,the district court certified a nationwide class of persons who had purchased machine tools manufactured by defendant,alleging that the defendant,through its agents,fraudulently represented the tools abilities and limitations.see id.at.in doing so,the district court assumed that because class determination is made at the pleading stage of the action,the substantive allegations in the complaint are accepted as true for purposes of the class motion.id.at.therefore,the district court rejected the defendant argument that because plaintiff claim was based on oral misrepresentations,which would be different for each potential class member,certification was inappropriate.see id.
on appeal,the court of appeals held that b efore deciding whether to allow a case to proceed as a class action a judge should make whatever factual and legal inquiries are necessary under rule.id.at.the supreme court had recognized in falcon that sometimes it may be necessary for the court to probe beyond the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question a ctual,not presumed conformance with rule a remains indispensable.falcon,at.at.the szabo court found the same to be true for rule b as c ertifying classes on the basis of incontestable allegations in the complaint moves the court discretion to the plaintiff may use it in ways injurious to other class members,as well as ways injurious to defendants.szabo,at.therefore,the court vacated the district court certification order,finding n agging issues of choice of law,commonality,and manageability beset this case as i t is unlikely that dealers in different parts of the country said the same things to hundreds of different buyers.id.
turning to this case,it is apparent that not only was it appropriate,but also necessary,for the district court to examine the factual record underlying plaintiffs allegations in making its certification decision.see newton,at lifeusa,at see also szabo,at.further,applying the framework utilized in newton,it is clear the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the record failed to establish that common issues predominated over individual issues in the case.
similar to newton,this case involves private securities fraud claims under the securities exchange act of,b,although here they are raised as predicate acts under rico.in order to establish their claims,plaintiffs must show that the defendants made misstatements or omissions of material fact,with scienter,in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,and that the plaintiffs injuriously relied on the misstatements or omissions.see,weiner quaker oats,cir kline first gov t securities,cir.as proof of two of these essential elements requires individual treatment,we conclude class certification is unsuitable.see newton,at.
first,plaintiffs allege the defendants made uniform oral and written misrepresentations.they point to the prospectus as evidence of a uniform written misrepresentation made to all plaintiffs.further,relying on the marketing materials and prospectus wrapper,they contend that these uniform written materials establish that the brokers statements were uniform,as the brokers certainly must have relied upon these materials in making their sales presentations.the problem,however,is that the record simply does not support these claims.
when the court made its certification decision it had deposition testimony or affidavits from each of the plaintiffs,several brokers,and a cinema plus investor other than the plaintiffs.at his deposition,plaintiff fontaine testified that he did not know whether he ever had received a prospectus,but that even if he had,he had not read it.see app.at id.at.further,he testified that he made the decision to invest in cinema plus as a result of one to four conversations with his broker,but he does not recall what his broker told him about cinema plus.he testified,i do remember specifically what he said,but he must have mentioned to me about cinema plus,michael douglas,the amount of money i can make,double my money in three or four years.michael douglas was the big guy involved with this.id.at.the deposition continued with defendants counsel asking,so what you remember about what he said concerning michael douglas was that he was the big guy and the person that was going to push this and fontaine answering,i assume that he meant to promote these movies and even act in them,i assumed.id.at.moreover,fontaine denied having heard several representations alleged in the complaint to have been made as part of a uniform script read to investors pertaining to the risks involved in the investment.see id.at.
similarly,plaintiff johnston testified at her deposition that she did not recall whether she received a cinema plus prospectus,and that if she had,she never read it.see id.at id.at id.at.johnston did testify unequivocally,however,that her broker stated that michael douglas was going to produce movies for cinema plus.see id.at.but,she testified that she did not discuss the relative investment risks with her broker because he knew her individual tastes well enough to know that she would not want to take a risk.see id.at.
johnston broker,robert kaiser,testified that he received some,but not all,of the alleged uniform sales materials,but that he did not read from or rely upon these materials in making investment recommendations.see id.at id.at id.at.he testified that instead his typical practice was to make a list of bullet points describing the pros and cons and to go over those with a person,the information for which was derived from marketing materials,scripts and prospectuses.id.at.nevertheless,he testified that he told johnston that michael douglas was going to produce two or more movies,which was an important consideration regarding cinema plus investment potential.see id.at id.at.
there were also affidavits before the court from several brokers who sold units of cinema plus stating that they did not use a standardized script or a uniform presentation in selling shares of cinema plus.see id.at aff.of john jaeger stating his presentation to various customers with respect to cinema plus varied depending on the individual circumstances of the customer and his relationship with that customer.id.at aff.of david sysko same id.at aff.of randall carter same.additionally,their discussions with respect to cinema plus varied from depending on the questions and comments of the customer.see id.
finally,the court considered the affidavit of james gleason,a cinema plus investor.he stated expressly that he did not base his decision to invest in cinema plus on the likelihood that a particular producer would produce movies for the partnership.see id.at.therefore,the record from the plaintiffs viewpoint is at best inconclusive as to whether the defendants made uniform oral representations in selling units of cinema plus.
in cases raising issues similar to those here,it has become that,as a general rule,an action based substantially on oral rather than written communications is inappropriate for treatment as a class action.see,lifeusa,at simon merrill,lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir glick hutton.for example,in seiler hutton,the court rejected as insufficient plaintiffs allegations that the brokers allegedly relied upon uniform marketing materials because the record revealed that individual brokers made individual decisions about upon what to rely and what to say to customers.
therefore,it is clear that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that individual issues overwhelmed issues common to the class with regard to the element of a misstatement or material omission.we reach this conclusion notwithstanding plaintiffs reliance on prudential.the plaintiffs claim that the district court erroneously distinguished prudential on the ground that it did not involve affirmative misrepresentations.indeed,it does appear that the district court took this clearly unsupported view of prudential in distinguishing it from the present case.compare prudential,at finding certification of settlement class was appropriate where allegedly improper sales practices were carried out by use of substantially similar,and sometimes identical oral and written misrepresentations,the required use of written marketing materials,and material omissions,with appellants br.ex.a at magistrate judge report recommendation stating prudential involved only failure to disclose material facts and allegations that specific information was withheld from all investors.nevertheless,the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that prudential was distinguishable.
prudential involved uniform,scripted and standard sales presentations by the defendants.see id.at.indeed,in prudential the district court found specifically that the oral component of the fraudulent sales presentations did not vary appreciably among class members.prudential.at.moreover,the agents in prudential were career agents who worked exclusively for and were trained uniformly by prudential,and who relied on uniform sales materials.see id.at.here,however,the plaintiffs did not establish that cinema plus units were sold according to standard,uniform,scripted sales presentations.this much is apparent from the starkly different accounts of plaintiffs johnston and fontaine as to how and why they came to invest in cinema plus.further,the brokers denied using uniform presentations,and more importantly,there is no evidence that,other than kaiser and fontaine broker,any made the alleged misrepresentation about michael douglas at all.finally,johnston and fontaine both testified that if they received written sales information or prospectuses from defendants prior to purchase,they did not rely on them,nor could they recall their substance.in this sense,this case is very similar to lifeusa,where we held prudential was distinguishable.see lifeusa,at.so,too,do we here.
we have not overlooked our statement in prudential that 
while individual questions may arise during the course of this litigation,we agree with the district court that the presence of individual questions does not per se rule out a finding of predominance.in particular,the presence of individual questions as to the reliance of each investor does not mean that the common questions of law and fact do not predominate.eisenberg gagnon,cir.
prudential,at.here,however,we do not know the content of the individual representations as they were not standard or scripted but were oral and varied.moreover,we do not know whether or to what extent the representations facilitated the sales of cinema plus units.in the circumstances,we can not say that questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.rule b.we emphasize this point to demonstrate that we are in no sense undermining prudential.
in addition to finding this case presented individual questions regarding the alleged misrepresentations,the district court found this case involved individual questions of reliance.the plaintiffs dispute this finding,arguing instead that they are entitled to a presumption of reliance
