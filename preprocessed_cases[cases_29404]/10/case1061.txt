factual and procedural background 
laura zamora jordan obtained a loan to purchase a house in washington state.to secure the loan,jordan executed a deed of trust encumbering the house.nationstar is the beneficiary of the deed of trust secured by jordan home.the deed of trust contains provisions permitting the beneficiary to enter the house and change the locks if the borrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in the deed of trust,or if the borrower abandons the property.in april,after jordan defaulted on her loan,nationstar agents entered jordan home without notice,removed the existing locks,and installed a lockbox.jordan was later permitted to the house to gather her personal belongings.jordan claims that,nationstar still has not commenced foreclosure proceedings against jordan home,which she still owns,and that she has been deprived of the use and fair rental value of her home for over three years.
on april,jordan,as her separate estate,and on behalf of others similarly situated,sued nationstar in washington state court,alleging six causes of action,including violations of the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,et.on january,jordan filed her second amended complaint sac,adding additional allegations and defining the proposed class.jordan did not specify an amount in controversy in the complaint,but requested damages in an amount to be proven at trial,including treble damages the state court certified the proposed class on may.on june,jordan submitted responses to nationstar fifth interrogatories,stating that the total amount of monetary damages is expected to exceed.on june,nationstar filed a notice of removal to federal court pursuant to cafa.
jordan moved to remand the case to state court,arguing that nationstar notice of removal was untimely because it was filed more than two years after jordan initial complaint triggered federal jurisdiction under the fdcpa.see.nationstar countered that removal was timely because jordan answers to nationstar fifth set of interrogatories were the first other paper from which it could be ascertained that the matter in controversy exceed ed,one of the three necessary elements for triggering removal under cafa.nationstar urged the district court to extend the logic of our opinion in durham lockheed martin,cir,and recognize a second and separate ground for removal,even if the initial complaint provided some other ground for removal,thereby reopen ing the removal window.
the district court,conscientiously seeking to follow our circuit case law,remanded the case to state court because it was not persuaded by defendant policy argument not supported by the wording of the statute or case law.the court found that the general principles of removal jurisdiction apply in cafa cases,and the relevant removal date is the date on which the case itself becomes removable,rather than the date on which the case first becomes removable under cafa.because jordan first amended complaint included a federal cause of action,violation of the fdcpa,this rendered the action removable based on federal question jurisdiction,within thirty days of that filing.the district court awarded jordan her attorney fees and costs in the amount of because it found that nationstar did not have an objectively reasonable basis for removal.see martin franklin capital,c.

discussion 
nationstar argues that t he same three reasons durham cited for applying the broad interpretation of removable to federal officer removals apply with equal force to cafa removals.first,congress and the supreme court have instructed that section,like section in durham,should be interpreted broadly in favor of removal.second,both section and section permit a single defendant to remove without the consent of other defendants,and a strict interpretation of removable would effectively eliminate removals.durham,at.finally,as with section,interpreting removable strictly would encourage gamesmanship and defeat the policies underlying cafa.id.
a defendant who is sued in state court may remove the action to federal court on various grounds,such as if the case presents a federal question under,or if the requirements for diversity of citizenship are met under.a,b.section b requires the defendant to file a notice of removal within days after the receipt by the defendant,through service or otherwise,of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief upon which such action or proceeding is based.b.however,
if the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable,a notice of removal may be filed within days after receipt by the defendant,through service or otherwise,of a copy of an amended pleading,motion,order or other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable.
b.the removal of class actions is also governed by section.b.
in,congress passed cafa to permit defendants to remove class actions to federal court if they meet three requirements there must be minimal diversity of citizenship between the parties the proposed class must have at least members and the aggregated amount in controversy must equal or exceed the sum or value of million.d class action fairness act of,stat.the senate report on cafa explains that b ecause interstate class actions typically involve more people,more money,and more interstate commerce ramifications than any other type of lawsuit,the committee firmly believes that such cases properly belong in federal court,at see dart cherokee.at.
in durham,we recognized that there are two plausible ways to construe the term removable in section.the first way to interpret removable is as binary either there so
