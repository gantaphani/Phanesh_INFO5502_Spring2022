this complex political discrimination case was filed by plaintiffs terminated from career employment positions with the municipality of adjuntas in puerto rico.the district court severed the plaintiffs into four groups of twenty and one group of the claims of the first twenty plaintiffs are now before us on defendants appeal from a substantial verdict for plaintiffs.although this case raises many familiar issues,it also presents some unusual questions arising from the court initial severance of the plaintiffs,and its later decision to apply offensive collateral estoppel to the three remaining pieces of the severed litigation.we vacate the court collateral estoppel order,and affirm in all other respects.
on november,current and former employees of the municipality of adjuntas brought suit under,alleging violations of their first,fifth and fourteenth amendment rights arising from a massive layoff of municipal employees in the aftermath of the november mayoral election.every claimant was fired from a career position akin to a civil service job,as opposed to a trust position political appointment,temporary or transitory post,or contract fixed term job.the plaintiffs named three defendants in the vera monroig vera,the mayor of adjuntas sued in both his individual and official capacities irma gonzalez,adjunta director of human resources sued in both her individual and official capacities and the municipality of adjuntas 
on november,the district court issued an order and opinion denying absolute qualified immunity to mayor vera and gonzalez in their individual capacities,and granting in part and denying in part the defendants motion for summary judgment.see,d acevedo i.in an opinion published february,we affirmed the district court order in all respects,ruling inter alia that defendants could not claim the protection of absolute immunity,and that we lacked jurisdiction to review the district court rulings on qualified immunity and municipal liability.see,cir acevedo ii.
our decision in acevedo ii cleared the remaining roadblocks to trial,and the district court undertook the formidable logistical task of arranging to try the multitude of political discrimination,political harassment,and due process claims alleged by the individual plaintiffs to this end,the court issued an order on october,severing the case into four separate trials of twenty,twenty,twenty,and plaintiffs,respectively.to configure the first group of twenty plaintiffs,the order directed each side to choose six plaintiffs with political discrimination and due process claims only for a total of twelve,and four plaintiffs prosecuting political discrimination,due process and political harassment claims for a total of eight.
the trial for this first group began october,and lasted days.at the conclusion of the proceedings,the jury returned a verdict awarding each plaintiff a package of compensatory and punitive damages totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars,summing to a group total of.after a flurry of motions,the court entered judgment on the verdict.it then issued an order on january,applying the doctrine of offensive collateral estoppel to preclude defendants from litigating the defendants liability for political discrimination and denial of the plaintiffs due process rights,d.
defendants filed a timely appeal after this first trial,challenging inter alia the sufficiency of the evidence at the summary judgment stage,the sufficiency of the evidence at trial,the severance of plaintiffs into four groups,the district court denial of qualified immunity,numerous evidentiary rulings,the court active participation at trial,the damage award,and the court application of offensive collateral estoppel.plaintiffs from the district court denial of an injunction ordering the reinstatement of all plaintiffs.
acevedo i and acevedo ii provide a lengthy exposition of the background facts in this case.see acevedo ii,at acevedo i,d at.we summarize those facts here,and supplement our recitation with an overview of the ii developments 
stipulated and undisputed facts 
defendant vera,representing the popular democratic party pdp,won the november mayoral election in adjuntas,and appointed defendant gonzalez,a fellow pdp member,to be the director of human resources on january.vera and gonzalez inherited a municipal government whose ranks were swelled by new hires during the administration of rigoberto ramos,vera predecessor,and a member of the rival new progressive party npp.of those employees,only were affiliated with the pdp.by january,the municipality employed regular employees,and the parties stipulated prior to trial that many departments were so overstaffed that some employees did not have desks.
on april,the puerto rico comptroller office published an audit report,indicating that adjuntas had accrued annual budget deficits of at least from to.after vera took office in january,he commissioned a second financial audit of the municipality by reinaldo ramirez,a certified public accountant.ramirez presented his report on may,informing city officials that the municipality had a budget deficit of over and long term debts totaling more than.anticipating this unwelcome news,vera had previously hired a human resources consulting firm in february to prepare a layoff plan for municipality of adjuntas employees the plan.the consultants completed the plan in march,and it received approval from the adjuntas municipal assembly on april,as required under puerto rico autonomous municipalities act.see laws ann,as amended law.on april,a copy of the plan was circulated to every municipal employee.
in broad strokes,the plan enumerated the steps the municipality was obliged to undertake before firing employees including relocation,retraining,temporary unpaid leave,demotions to vacant positions,and voluntary retirement established an order of priority for laying off municipal workers and established a series of procedures for earmarking particular employees and job classifications for termination,and for providing notice to the affected individuals.the plan was not.instead,it authorized the termination of municipal employees w hen the mayor determines that there are financial problems and that as a result,programs or services are being affected.the mayor made this determination in may after conferring with ramirez and the human resource consultants,and he ordered city officials to implement the plan.when the dust settled on october,employees,including npp members and pdp members,had been fired from their career positions.
since january,the municipality has hired new employees to contract or jobs funded through sources federal and state programs.the most significant of these programs,referred to as law,allows municipalities to present job training proposals to the labor department of the commonwealth of puerto rico,which may then appropriate funds on an annual basis to underwrite the salaries of a certain number of municipal employees that the city could not otherwise afford.only five of the plaintiffs received one of these appointments,the vast majority of which went to pdp members.
contested facts 
the trial featured a contentious dispute regarding the period preceding the october,layoffs.the twenty plaintiffs in the first trial group testified that during this period,the defendants sabotaged their working conditions by denying npp employees and only npp employees basic amenities,including phone privileges,short work breaks for breakfast,access to restroom facilities,and the opportunity to drive municipal vehicles to perform their job functions.many plaintiffs testified that they were removed from their jobs entirely,and sent to random locations where they were either given nothing to do for months on end or else ordered to perform menial tasks outside the scope of their job descriptions.the defendants denied these allegations,contending that prior abuses of telephone privileges and municipal vehicles had contributed to large budget overruns that compelled the municipality to restrict access to these services.according to defendants,the dearth of functioning bathroom facilities was a consequence of plumbing and physical infrastructure deficiencies that were ignored during the previous npp mayoral administrations.
there was also a factual controversy concerning the implementation of the plan.the defendants insisted that the particular layoff scheme developed in accordance with the plan was politically neutral in both its conception and implementation.noting that prior npp administrations had almost exclusively hired npp members to fill over a hundred municipal positions in the preceding years,they claimed it was inevitable that a layoff plan would disproportionately impact npp employees.
plaintiffs presented evidence of a different agenda.in their view,mayor vera manipulated the plan to produce discriminatory results in three ways.first,he contravened provisions of the plan by failing to seriously consider measures short of outright termination,including relocation,retraining,temporary unpaid leave,demotions to vacant positions,and voluntary retirement second,the layoff scheme developed pursuant to the plan tied termination to seniority within job classifications,rather than seniority across the board.hypothetically,under this scheme,an npp librarian with seven years of seniority could be laid off while a pdp office clerk with five years of seniority retained her position.vera scheme thus eschewed the possibility of retraining veteran npp employees to take over the jobs of less senior pdp members with jobs requiring a similar skill set but bearing a different classification,thereby exacerbating the discriminatory impact of the layoffs.third,the seniority system employed by defendants incorporated a fixed years and ten dated back precisely to the end of the previous pdp administration in adjuntas.in other words,any employee with eight years and ten months of seniority or more was immune from the layoffs.accordingly,pdp members hired during that previous administration were insulated from the layoffs,while all employees hired thereafter during the intervening npp administrations were at risk of termination.
finally,there was evidence that vera contrived to shed npp employees with sufficient seniority to withstand the initial round of layoffs by simply eliminating their job category altogether.for example,if an npp member employed as a citizens affairs specialist outranked his pdp colleagues on the seniority scale,the municipality would eliminate the citizens affairs specialist position entirely,and then hire back the former pdp citizens affairs specialists under the auspices of law or some other employment program funded by outside sources.
defendants raised manifold claims of error.we address first the challenges to the rulings,then claims regarding the events at trial,and finally challenges to the rulings.
sufficiency of the evidence at the summary judgment stage 
in partially denying defendants motion for summary disposition of plaintiffs political discrimination claims,the district court offered the following explanation for its ruling 
plaintiffs have put forth sufficient evidence to sustain their initial burden that defendants employment decisions were based on improper and discriminatory motives.defendants have,however,put forth evidence in support of their burden that regardless of plaintiffs political affiliation,the municipal budgetary crisis required the municipality to cut jobs on the basis of seniority the court finds that this proffer of evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that regardless of political affiliation,defendants would have made the same decision in laying off plaintiffs.
acevedo i,d at.defendants contend that this finding mandated the dismissal of plaintiffs political discrimination claims under the rule established in healthy city sch.dis.bd.of educ.doyle,d,and insist that the district court erred in shifting the burden of proof back to plaintiffs to demonstrate that they would not have been fired but for their political affiliation.acevedo i,d at citing,cir monroig,cir.the court compounded its error,in defendants view,by postponing a final ruling on plaintiffs political discrimination claims pending the submission of additional evidence from plaintiffs to demonstrate that they were qualified to fill the new positions created by the municipality after january.defendants argue that the court was obliged to rule in their favor on the basis of the insufficient evidence currently before it.
these objections are unavailing.when a district court assessment of the evidentiary record at the summary judgment stage is subsequently overtaken by a full trial and verdict,it is our practice not to revisit that determination on appeal 
we need not address the merits of a preverdict challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on the motion for summary judgment.such an attack on the denial of defendant motion for summary judgment has been overtaken by subsequent events,namely,a trial and an adverse jury verdict the rationale for this rule has been based on the procedural fact that denial of a motion for summary judgment is merely a judge determination that genuine issues of material fact exist.it is not a judgment,and does not foreclose trial on issues on which summary judgment was sought.hence,a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence adduced on the motion to support the district court conclusion that genuine issues of material fact exist will not lie on appeal.
eastern mountain platform tennis,cir internal citations omitted.accordingly,any sufficiency of the evidence challenge on appeal must be grounded in the record as a whole.here,defendants also argue that the trial record considered in its entirety did not support the jury verdict,and we address that claim later in the discussion.
on october,the district court severed the case into four separate trials,finding that 
it is not practical or just to subject one jury panel to a trial in which plaintiffs with varying claims will be testifying.no single jury panel would be able to remember all of the testimony and evidence or be able to reach a fair and impartial verdict at the end of that time.it is the opinion of this court that severance will most likely result in a just final disposition of this litigation.
the defendants objected on numerous grounds,arguing inter alia that the court proposal precluded defendants from eliciting contradictory testimony among plaintiffs,imposed increased expense and inconvenience on defendants by compelling the examination of expert witnesses and government officials on four occasions rather than one,reduced the likelihood of an impartial jury for the second,third and fourth plaintiff groups,and hampered defendants ability to portray the relevant events to the jury in a comprehensive fashion.on october,the court emphatically rejected these concerns in a written ruling 
the considerations alleged by defendants as to the fact that they would have to present evidence at four different occasions is of secondary importance.a paramount consideration at all times in the administration of justice is a fair and impartial trial to all litigants.considerations of economy of time,money and convenience of witnesses must yield thereto.
quoting in re bendectin litigation,cir.
defendants lodge two objections to the severance on appeal.first,they argue that the district court refusal to try the claims of all plaintiffs at once was inappropriate and unfairly prejudicial.we can dispense with this argument quickly.the decision to separate parties or claims is a case management determination peculiarly within the discretion of the trial court,equitable life assurance,cir,and courts of appeals accord broad latitude to district courts in this area.applewhite reichold,cir new york hendrickson,cir.we would note,however,that we need not rest our affirmance on this deferential standard of circumstances of this case compel the conclusion that the division of plaintiffs was a legitimate and feasible means of efficiently conducting this unwieldy litigation.
defendants second objection is more troublesome,and implicates the particular procedural device employed by the district court to quarter the proceedings.two types of severances or separations of claims are contemplated by the federal rules of civil within the action itself,the other resulting in a second,or new action.official comm.of unsecured creditors shapiro.rule of the federal rules of civil procedure furnishes the mechanism for separating a case into separate actions,severance parties may be dropped or added by order of the court on motion of any party or of its own initiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just.any claim against a party may be severed and proceeded with separately.see charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure trial a severance occurs when a lawsuit is divided into two or more separate and independent or distinct causes.rule b,on the other hand,authorizes courts to divide a single action into separate trials that remain under the umbrella of the original solitary action 
the court,in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice,or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy,may order a separate trial of any claim,counterclaim,or claim,or of any separate issue or of any number of claims,counterclaims,claims,or issues.
b see charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure trial an order for a separate trial keeps the lawsuit intact while enabling the court to hear and decide one or more issues without trying all of the controverted issues at the same hearing.
the salient distinction between these two procedural devices concerns the appealability of an order terminating the proceedings in a partitioned piece of the litigation 
the judgment in a severed action is final,enforceable and appealable when it disposes of all parties and issues.conversely,the order entered at the conclusion of a separate trial is often interlocutory because a final and appealable judgment can not be rendered until all of the controlling issues have been tried and decided.
trial see white abco eng g,cir charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure separate trials usually will result in one judgment,but severed claims become entirely independent actions to be tried,and judgment entered thereon,independently.
courts often confuse these two procedural devices.the procedure authorized by rule b should be distinguished from severance under rule unfortunately,this distinction,clear enough in theory,often is obscured in practice since at times the courts talk of separate trial and severance interchangeably.wright miller,federal practice and procedure see mcdaniel,cir.here,defendants argue that the court committed reversible error by invoking rule b as the basis for partitioning the plaintiffs into four groups while conducting the proceedings as if they had been severed under rule.
the district court addressed the distinction between rule b and rule in its october decision 
in the instant motion,defendants contend that severance of actions is covered by rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,and not by rule b.this distinction is of little consequence because both rules provide the court with wide discretion to order severance the court determination as to whether it should sever the claims of plaintiffs under rule or whether it should order separate trials under rule requires the same considerations,and are within the broad discretion of the district court.
at.although the court accurately observed that it had wide discretion to manage the litigation under either rule,the particular procedural device it employed is of paramount importance in this appeal.because our jurisdiction is limited to all final decisions of the district courts of the united states,united states leichter,cir emphasis added,we can not exercise jurisdiction over an appeal from a separate trial ordained under rule b.see in re licht semonoff,cir a final decision is ordinarily one which disposes of all the rights of all the parties to an action.emphasis added.moreover,since separate trials do not individually produce final judgments,any attempt to apply collateral estoppel to the remaining three trials would be invalid under a rule b regime.see nlrb sportswear,cir noting that one essential element which must be present for the successful application of issue preclusion is that the determination must result in a valid and final judgment.emphasis added griffin burns,cir same restatement second of judgments same.
as defendants concede,this is not a case where the district court intentions were ambiguous.see mcdaniel,at.the district court order of october explicitly states that e ach judgment entered at the end of each of these four trials shall be final and appealable and published and subject to all motions provided by the federal rules of civil procedure,such as new trial,judgment notwithstanding the verdict,additionally,in its opinion rejecting defendants objections to the severance,the court reasoned that 
conducting separate trials wherein the jury verdict from each trial is final and appealable as to each set of plaintiffs facilitates judicial economy and possible settlement in this case by providing the parties with some scale or model upon which to whether further litigation would be prudent or advantageous to their cause.
at.thus,the court references to rule b notwithstanding,its clearly articulated intent was to sever the plaintiffs pursuant to rule.the third circuit observed in white that n othing on the face of rule indicates that it must be explicitly invoked in order to have effect.there must be,however,a strong indication that the judge intended to effect a severance.white,at citing allied elevator.state bank of buna,cir.that intent is manifest from the language of the court october order.accordingly,we find no reversible error in the court severance ruling under rule,and we regard the district court entry of judgment on the verdict below as a final and appealable judgment under 
b.the trial 
evidentiary rulings 
plaintiffs aptly characterize the defendants challenges to the district court evidentiary rulings as rambling,discursive and unrefined.defendants briefs narratively recite a plethora of offending rulings in a scattershot format devoid of legal authority,citations to analogous cases,or any application of law to facts.the briefs also leave uncertain which of the dozens of evidentiary challenges raised on appeal were properly preserved below.see rodriguez del valle,cir.with one possible exception,the evidentiary challenges that survive these defects lack the developed argumentation needed to trigger review on the merits.we have steadfastly deemed waived issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner,not accompanied by developed argumentation.mulvihill golf,cir.
the one evidentiary challenge that arguably merits our attention is the defendants contention that the court improperly admitted evidence about claims not at,political harassment claims filed by particular plaintiffs that the court had earlier dismissed.defendants correctly point out that,in some cases,evidence of previously dismissed claims may have an undue tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis.however,the supreme court has ruled that such evidence is not ipso facto inadmissible,noting that a discriminatory act which is not made the basis for a charge may constitute relevant background evidence in a proceeding in which the status of a current practice is at issue.united air lines,evans,d see city of providence,cir morrison carleton woolen mills,cir.presumably defendants ground their challenge to these rules in federal rules of evidence,which provides that otherwise relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.as this court has previously explained,o nly in extraordinarily compelling we,from the vista of a cold appellate record,reverse a district court judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.freeman package machinery,cir.we find no abuse of discretion in the district court decision to admit this evidence as relevant background to show the atmosphere in which plaintiffs lived and developed since mayor vera was elected mayor.
active participation of the court 
defendants allege that at various junctures during the trial the district court inaccurately and prejudicially commented on the evidence,truncated the defendants of several plaintiffs,and chastised defense witnesses in front of the jury.as we have previously observed,it is well settled that the trial judge has a perfect a right that should be exercised with participate actively in the trial proper.logue dore,cir.a trial judge retains the common law power to question witnesses and to comment on the evidence.united states,cir.in reviewing the portions of the transcripts to which defendants refer,we find no commentary or question by the trial judge,or any exchange involving the trial judge,that exceeds the bounds of acceptable judicial participation.this is especially true given defendants failure to direct our attention to any case law addressing facts analogous to those here.
additionally,a n inquiry into the judge conduct of the trial necessarily turns on the question of whether the complaining party can show serious prejudice.united states,cir.defendants also fail to demonstrate serious prejudice arising from the court participation during plaintiffs case in chief.this was a lengthy and contentious trial featuring dozens of witnesses,numerous sidebar conferences,and a myriad of other procedural delays arising,inter alia,from the inartful labeling and introduction of exhibits,translation difficulties,and a continuing stream of objections from both parties.under these challenging circumstances,the court efforts to accelerate the pace of the trial with infrequent commentary on the evidence and the occasional prodding of witnesses were amply justified and well within its discretion.see gonzalez,cir the civil rules endow judges with formidable authority in exercising this power,trial judges enjoy great latitude.citations omitted.
qualified immunity 
the supreme court has recognized that qualified immunity embodies an entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation,conditioned on the resolution of the essentially legal question whether the conduct of which the plaintiff complains violated clearly established law.mitchell forsyth,d.defendants efforts to invoke the protections of qualified immunity at the summary judgment stage,however,were rejected by the district court,which concluded that p laintiffs proffered evidence of a triable issue of fact regarding a potentially discriminatory application of the layoff plan therefore,defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity for their allegedly discriminatory actions merely because they assert they acted pursuant to the layoff plan.acevedo i,d at.as previously noted,we dismissed defendants interlocutory appeal from this ruling,determining that we lacked jurisdiction to review the factual grounds for the district court denial of qualified immunity.acevedo ii,at.
after the jury returned its verdict,defendants renewed their challenge to the court denial of qualified immunity arguing that in light of the facts elicited at trial,the unlawfulness of implementing a layoff plan duly approved by the municipal legislature according to seniority would not have been apparent to a reasonable official.citing harlow fitzgerald,d.the court once again rejected defendants claim,concluding that the jury findings foreclosed the availability of immunity 
for the record,the prohibition against political discrimination was clearly established in when defendants acted to violate plaintiffs constitutionally protected rights.a jury trial was held wherein plaintiffs presented evidence that supported their allegations of political discrimination.the evidence led the jury to conclude that political affiliation was in fact a substantial or motivating factor for mayor vera monroig and irma gonzalez actions therefore,the qualified immunity argument that defendants now make is simply an attempt to the facts and this case.
defendants allege two errors in the district court denial of qualified immunity.first,they claim that the court erred in failing to deliver two proposed instructions on qualified immunity to the jury 
proposed jury instruction qualified immunity 
government officials performing discretionary functions are granted qualified immunity from civil claims for damages,if their conduct at the time of the alleged acts that give rise to the civil damages does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.the relevant inquiry is the objective question whether a reasonable officer could have believed the actions alleged by the plaintiff herein to be lawful,in light of clearly established law and the information the state official possessed.
proposed jury instruction reach of qualified immunity 
even defendants who violate constitutional rights enjoy a qualified immunity that protects them from liability for damages unless it is further demonstrated that their conduct was unreasonable with respect to clearly established rights and laws at the time of the conduct at issue.
after proposing these instructions,defendants concede that they failed to object on the record to the court refusal to issue the instructions before the jury retired to deliberate.accordingly,we review for plain error only.see chestnut city of lowell,cir en banc failures to object,unless a true waiver is involved,are almost always subject to review for plain error.advisory committee on the federal rules of civil procedure,report of the civil rules advisory committee march,revised,modifying rule of the federal rules of civil procedure to provide for plain error review of challenges to jury instructions where the claim was not properly preserved.
the availability of qualified immunity after a trial is a legal question informed by the jury findings of fact,but ultimately committed to the court judgment.indeed,we have recognized that a certain flexibility exists in the procedures and that in any event the judge is certainly not obliged to submit the ultimate issue to the jury.see singh blue shield of,cir swain spinney,cir.accordingly,there was no error,let alone plain error,in the district court refusal to submit the proposed qualified immunity instructions to the jury.
defendants also contend that the court committed reversible error when it failed to grant a new trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the basis of qualified immunity.they reinforce this second claim of error with two legal arguments.first,they assert that the district court misapplied the second prong of the familiar qualified immunity test 
determining whether qualified immunity is available to a particular defendant at a particular time requires a trifurcated inquiry.we ask,first,whether the plaintiff has alleged the violation of a constitutional right.if so,we then ask whether the contours of the right were sufficiently established at the time of the alleged violation.finally,we ask whether an objectively reasonable official would have believed that the action taken or omitted violated that right.
hatch for children,youth and their families,cir.defendants contend that the court erroneously characterized the constitutional right at issue as plaintiffs right not to be discriminated against on the basis of their political beliefs during the implementation of the layoff plan.they decry the excessive abstractness of this right,citing language from the supreme court decision in anderson creighton,d 
the operation of this standard depends substantially upon the level of generality at which the relevant legal rule is to be identified if referring to the right to due process of law the test of clearly established law were to be applied at this level of generality,it would bear no relationship to the objective legal reasonableness that is the touchstone of harlow.plaintiffs would be able to convert the rule of qualified immunity that our cases plainly establish into a rule of virtually unqualified liability simply by alleging a violation of extremely abstract rights.
id.at.see roman,cir.it is difficult to divine from defendants briefs how they would articulate the right at pertinent discussion is geared exclusively to demonstrating the absence of any clearly established rule regulating the implementation of layoff plans.of course,this approach commits the anderson fallacy in reverse by construing the relevant with such specificity that the predictably scant jurisprudence on point would never satisfy the clearly established threshold.
in the end,their argument is unavailing.the clearly established law both in this circuit and beyond precludes government officials from discharging civil or career employees for reasons.see branti finkel,d elrod burns,d,at agrait,cir.the complexity of the municipality workforce reduction plan suggests that it was conceived by the adjuntas municipal assembly as a politically neutral means of responding to the city fiscal crisis.yet the jury could reasonably have found that while the plan itself was politically neutral,the method of implementation revealed the defendants discriminatory intent.
defendants also raise a challenge under the third prong of hatch,relying on stipulated facts painting a bleak picture of the municipality financial status,see supra,and the conclusory assertion that the aforementioned set of circumstances clearly demonstrate that defendants acted within the reasonable boundaries of their duties under the plan.in limiting their focus to the objective circumstances surrounding the implementation of the plan,defendants misconceive the salient inquiry under the third prong of the qualified immunity analysis.as we observed in tang state of rhode island,cir 
the objective test focuses on the reasonableness of the official conduct independent of motive.it is rarely going to be manifestly unreasonable,judged apart from motive,to take certain action against an employee.but because of special constitutional or statutory protections,some motives can convert those decisions into causes of action.
id.at emphasis in original.indeed,we recognized in acevedo ii that illicit motive is the touchstone of a political discrimination claim the plaintiffs allege that they were terminated because of their political affiliation,a constitutional claim that has no meaning absent the allegation of impermissible motivation.acevedo ii,at see stella kelley,cir.here,as plaintiffs point out,the jury verdict necessarily rejected the claim that the seniority system was a politically neutral method for implementing the layoff plan.
finally,defendants insist that the supreme court decision in saucier katz,d,establishes a margin for errors and expands the zone of protection in discretionary determinations where an official reasonably believed that he acted reasonably although he was later found to have acted unlawfully.the district court aptly disposed of this argument below by distinguishing saucier on its facts 
saucier involved a military police officer mistaken but reasonable belief that excessive force was needed to protect the vice president of the united states from an unknown demonstrator.because high security measures are needed to safeguard a united states vice president,because the degree of danger posed by the demonstrator was unknown,and because law enforcement officers are usually required to make,life and death decisions,the court held that the officer acted reasonably mayor vera monroig and irma gonzalez acted over a period of time.as they had a long period within which to assess the situation,the probability that they could have made a reasonable mistake as in the case of an officer guarding the vice president,is largely diminished.
accordingly,we conclude that the district court did not err in denying defendants request for qualified immunity.
sufficiency of the evidence 
after the jury issued its verdict,defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law under rule b,or in the alternative for a new trial pursuant to rule.the district court denied both avenues of relief,and defendants appealed.a party seeking recourse under either rule faces an uphill battle 
in reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict or for judgment notwithstanding the verdict we must examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and determine whether there are facts and inferences reasonably drawn from those facts which lead to but one there is a total failure of evidence to prove plaintiff case.
cartagena,cir quoting mayo schooner capital,cir.when considering a rule a motion,a district court may set aside a jury verdict and order a new trial only if the verdict is against the demonstrable weight of the credible evidence or results in a blatant miscarriage of justice.sanchez puerto rico oil,cir.
as the district court ably explains,sufficient evidence was before the jury to support its findings for the plaintiffs.see,d at.regarding the political discrimination claims,the plaintiffs testified that they were politically active members of the npp and that the vera administration knew of their political affiliation prior to discharging them.plaintiffs also produced evidence supporting their theory that the termination plan was implemented in a way designed to target members of the npp while sparing most members of the pdp.further,the jury heard evidence that the vast majority of people hired with funds belonged to the pdp.the district court also details the evidence before the jury regarding the four plaintiffs who successfully mounted political harassment claims.see,d at.
defendants are understandably disappointed that the jury did not agree with their version of facts in this case.but,as explained above,courts will only set aside jury verdicts in very unusual circumstances.after viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,as well as considering the inferences that may reasonably be drawn from those facts,we can not say that there is a total failure of evidence to prove plaintiff case.mayo,at.nor are we convinced that the jury verdict represents a blatant miscarriage of justice warranting judicial interference.sanchez,at.
rule e of the federal rules of civil procedure permits a party aggrieved by the jury verdict to move to alter or amend the judgment within ten days after entry of judgment.e.pursuant to rule e,the defendants filed a timely motion seeking reduction or remittitur of the damage award for each plaintiff.where defendants properly preserve a challenge to the amount of compensatory damages awarded by the jury,our inquiry is limited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to set aside the verdict as excessive.anthony airline,cir quoting mcdonald fed,cir.the review of a preserved challenge to a punitive damages award is de novo,and the award will stand unless we find it certain that the amount in question exceeds that necessary to punish and deter the alleged misconduct.romano int l,cir.

the district court issued a strong endorsement of the jury verdict in rejecting defendants rule e motion below 
the court believes that the jury considered all of the evidence presented,and fashioned their award in light of plaintiffs economic damages,and damages resulting from pain and suffering.simply put,the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence.considering the significant disruptions which defendants actions caused the plaintiffs lifestyles,the court does not find that the compensatory and punitive damages award for each individual plaintiff is grossly excessive or inordinate.further,after weighing the evidence,the court finds that the damage award also does not shock the conscience.
d at.on appeal,defendants reiterate their objections to the jury verdict as excessive.they also raise a new argument that was not submitted to the district,that the jury award of compensatory damages for due process violations was duplicative of the political discrimination damages also awarded as part of the verdict.
duplicate damages 
this argument,which is premised on an error of law,has more force than defendants factually grounded claim of excessive damages.before addressing the consequences of defendants failure to preserve this argument below,we examine the merits of the claim itself.
by way of background,the jury award was broken down into five components for the eight plaintiffs alleging discrimination,due process violations and harassment 
due process violations 
political discrimination in the form of harassment 
political discrimination resulting in dismissal causing pain and suffering 
political discrimination resulting in dismissal causing loss of earnings and 
punitive damages 
for the twelve plaintiffs alleging only political discrimination and due process injuries,the jury award contained all of the above components except 
defendants point out that plaintiffs fourteenth amendment due process claims arise from the municipality failure to offer the claimants alternatives to outright termination.the consequences of this denial of due process include the normal injuries associated with removal from a secure earnings,pain and suffering associated with unemployment,lost future income.defendants contend that their alleged violation of defendants first amendment rights resulted in precisely the same harms.because the jury essentially compensated plaintiffs for their unemployment injuries under a first amendment theory and once under a fourteenth amendment argue that the court erred as a matter of law in entering judgment on a double award for the same injury.
it is that double awards for the same injury are impermissible.lewis kendrick,cir freeman package mach,cir.moreover,congress intended for compensatory damages in section cases to remedy only actual injuries caused by a deprivation of constitutional rights,and not the abstract value of due process and first amendment rights.memphis community sch.dist.stachura,d.the supreme court elaborated in stachura that 
when plaintiffs seek damages for violations of constitutional rights,the level of damages is ordinarily determined according to principles derived from the common law of torts congress adopted this system of recovery when it established liability for constitutional torts.consequently,the basic purpose of damages is to compensate persons for injuries that are caused by the deprivation of constitutional rights.
id.at.quoting carey piphus,d.consequently,any duplication problem can not be resolved by conceptualizing first amendment and fourteenth amendment violations as distinct injuries warranting separate compensation.
in defending the jury verdict,plaintiffs argue that the damages awarded for the first amendment violations were retrospective in nature,designed to compensate the claimants for wages lost from the date of dismissal to the date of the verdict.by contrast,the compensatory damages awarded for defendants fourteenth amendment due process were and intended to remedy the plaintiffs lost property in their career employment positions.specifically,plaintiffs argue that 
because career employment carries with it an expectancy of continued income prospectively front pay,retirement and medical insurance lost benefits,and the security of continuing employment terminable only for cause,a deprivation of that right permits an additional award.this award is legally distinguishable in that it represents compensation for prospective losses,from the date of the trial forward,whereas political discrimination damages are calculated retroactively from the date of trial.
we agree with plaintiffs that both front and back pay are valid elements of a compensatory damage award under section.indeed,compensatory damages may include not only loss and other monetary harms,but also such injuries as impairment of reputation,personal humiliation,and mental anguish and suffering.stachura,at.quoting gertz robert welch,d see davet maccarone,cir.
in support of their argument that the jury apportioned its compensatory damage awards between the first amendment and fourteenth amendment violations,plaintiffs refer us to the political discrimination section of the special verdict form,which directs the jury to indicate the amount of back pay to date plaintiff should receive if political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in dismissal emphasis added.yet there is no analogous reference to front pay in either the jury instructions or the due process section of the verdict form,which simply provides that u nder the law you may choose to award damages for a violation of due process.if you answered yes to the previous question addressing liability,state the amount of damages this plaintiff should be awarded from defendants emphasis added.
moreover,plaintiffs theory of apportionment arguably suffers from another flaw.if the jury had found defendants guilty of either a due process violation or a first amendment violation,but not both,plaintiffs would still be entitled to front pay,back pay,and pain and suffering,because the singular violation would still have resulted in the loss of career employment and any secondary harms flowing from that loss.put differently,nothing inherent in the nature of a due process violation limits the resulting economic injury to front pay,and nothing inherent in an act of political discrimination inflicts an injury that is limited to back pay.
finally,we note that the court duplicative damage instruction was worded so as to suggest that the relevant injury that could not be doubly compensated was the violation of a constitutional right,rather than an actual loss or harm.
in awarding damages you should be careful not to award duplicate damages.plaintiffs are entitled to collect full compensation for their injuries if proved,but they must not collect more than once for the same wrong again,each plaintiff is entitled to collect full compensation for his or her injury but the plaintiff must not collect more than once for the same wrong.
emphasis added.the court use of the term wrong,read in conjunction with a special verdict form divided into separate sections for each constitutional violation,may have led the jury to conceptualize the term injury as the violation of a constitutional right vel non,rather than an actual loss caused by the violation of that right.see stachura,at.carey,at.possibly,in the absence of more detailed instructions supporting plaintiffs front pay theory,the jury may have erroneously awarded duplicative damages by compensating plaintiffs for the same actual losses under both a due process and political discrimination theory of liability.we acknowledge,therefore,that the lack of clarity in the court duplicative damages instruction was obvious error which may potentially have resulted in an improper award of double damages.
we must now decide whether defendants are entitled to relief in the face of this error.defendants were on notice throughout the proceedings that plaintiffs were seeking recovery for both due process violations and political discrimination.to the extent that a jury award on both claims would be duplicative,the proper practice is to ensure that the verdict form is structured so as to allow the jury to recompense the plaintiffs injuries just once.as we observed in britton maloney,cir 
the problem of guarding against double recovery is a familiar one when multiple claims exist but separate damages on each would be partly or wholly duplicative.if the parties explicitly agree that the damages should be the same on each claim,then it is easy enough to construct special interrogatories that identify separate bases for liability but have only a single line for damages.on the other hand,when the amounts awarded could conceivably differ depending on the claim but may also involve some overlap,verdict forms sometimes require a separate specification of damages for each claim on which the jury determines liability,leaving it to the judge to make the appropriate adjustments to avoid double recovery.
id.internal citation omitted.defendants could also have requested jury instructions that clearly directed the jury to compensate the plaintiffs unemployment injuries just once.here,defendants failed to lodge a pertinent objection to either the jury instructions or the verdict form.even after the jury delivered its sizeable verdict,defendants never submitted a motion challenging the actual award as duplicative.accordingly,we review the appellants allegation of duplicative damages for plain error only.see chestnut,at verdict form m i heat transfer prods.gorchev,cir jury instructions advisory committee on the federal rules of civil procedure,report of the civil rules advisory committee supra.
we apply the plain error doctrine in exceptional cases or under peculiar circumstances to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice or where the error seriously affected the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.rocafort ibm,cir citing beatty michael bus.machs,cir.our previous cases reflect a marked reluctance to find plain error in civil cases e specially in a civil case this is a very hard test to meet because over and above plain error,it requires a showing both of prejudice and a miscarriage of justice or something of this magnitude.fraser major league soccer,cir citing davis rennie,cir,cert.denied,d.
defendants claim for relief from the alleged double damages founders on the prejudice prong of the plain error standard.in reaching this conclusion,we are in no way trivializing the consequences of this verdict for the municipality of adjuntas and the individual defendants.the jury returned a verdict of,of which the total jury award,excluding punitive damages was against a municipality whose entire annual budget in was only.see exhibit,defendants statement of uncontested facts july.moreover,this figure reflects the damages owed only to the first twenty plaintiffs plaintiffs remain in the queue.but prejudice,as that term is incorporated into the plain error test,requires a strong causal link between the harm to the aggrieved party and the legal error.at best,defendants can only demonstrate the possibility that faulty jury instructions resulted in a duplicative damage award.
indeed,the appellate materials set forth competing explanations for the jury award of damages under both a due process and first amendment theory of liability.appellants argue that the compensatory damages awarded under each theory doubly recompensed claimants for their actual losses,while appellees insist that the jury compensated plaintiffs for their total loss just once,but divided that single award between the due process and first amendment causes of action.nothing in this record precludes that possibility,or rules out other appropriate bases for the jury award.for defendants who fail to protect themselves on the record by requesting jury instructions special verdict forms structured to preclude the possibility of a double damage award,these possibilities are fatal to a request for plain error relief.the prejudice component of the plain error standard implies a stringent demonstration of causation.thus,in chestnut city of lowell,our decision to vacate a punitive damage award on plain error review rested in part on the finding that p rejudice in the sense of affecting the final outcome is obvious had the jury been instructed as to the city immunity from punitive damages there almost certainly would not be a judgment against it today,although conceivably the jury might have somewhat increased the compensatory damages.chestnut,at emphasis added.here,although we can speculate that the court instructions may have led the jury to erroneously award duplicative damages,we have no concrete basis for accepting defendants characterization of the jury award.under these circumstances,we decline to expand the rule of chestnut to encompass cases in which prejudice to the aggrieved party is not manifest on the face of the record.
excessive damages 
defendants meticulously document the economic damages awarded to each plaintiff,and argue mathematically that the totals in every case exceed the lost wages reduced by the appropriate percentage for mitigation.as a threshold matter,the magnitude of the claimed discrepancy is sufficiently small ranging from to to preclude a finding that the verdict was grossly excessive,inordinate,shocking to the conscience of the court,or so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.correa,at segal,at.furthermore,the jury was entitled to consider any secondary economic injuries flowing from the plaintiffs loss of earnings and employment benefits.see stachura,at.davet,at.for example,nearly every claimant testified that they relied entirely on their monthly earnings to cover the expenses of running their household,meet their mortgage obligations,pay their childrens tuition.as a consequence of losing their jobs,plaintiffs were forced to seek additional bank loans,dip into their savings,and make other costly financial adjustments to cover these expenses.
we also decline to set aside the damages awarded in the other three categories pain and suffering resulting from political harassment,pain and suffering resulting from dismissal,and punitive damages.damages for pain and suffering defy exact mathematical computation,lines,amirault,cir and are not susceptible to proof by a dollar amount,maxxam property,cir.the jury awards of compensatory damages and punitive damages were moderate in scope and well within acceptable bounds.the individualized nature of the twenty verdicts reflects the jury careful attention to the peculiar circumstances of each plaintiff,and evinces the jury desire to craft an appropriate award for each claimant 
offensive collateral estoppel 
on january,the district court issued an order precluding the defendants from relitigating with respect to the remaining plaintiffs the following three issues that were determinative of defendants liability in the first trial 
that political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in the implementation of the plan.
that defendants violated plaintiffs due process rights by implementing the plan in a discriminatory fashion.
that plaintiffs were discharged from their career positions with the municipality of adjuntas on account of their political affiliation and other individuals were employed to perform their duties under different titles,and under different programs,in violation of the law.
d at.this ruling,if allowed to stand,would confine the scope of the subsequent three trials to the issue of damages.not surprisingly,defendants vigorously dispute the court application of collateral estoppel,raising a host of objections that we consider in due course.
as a threshold matter,neither party disputes our jurisdiction to review the court application of collateral estoppel.this case presents unique circumstances,however,that call into question the ripeness of the collateral estoppel question.see pustell lynn pub,cir observing that we may raise issues of jurisdiction sua sponte.generally,a court will determine that collateral estoppel is appropriate within the very proceeding where the ruling is to have its preclusive effect.here,the district court announced its attention to apply collateral estoppel at the end of trial,but the court ruling will have no preclusive effect until trials,and,which are not currently before us.because these trials were severed into four independent proceedings pursuant to rule,see supra,any resolution of the collateral estoppel question will have no effect on the rights of the parties as they pertain to trial.see cotter city of boston,cir article iii cases and controversies language prohibits federal courts from issuing advisory opinions.a court may not decide questions that can not affect the rights of litigants in the case before it.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
in the end,however,we conclude that we have jurisdiction to review the district court application of collateral estoppel.the four cases comprising this matter began as a single lawsuit.the boundaries that now divide it into four severed cases are not temporal or transactional in nature.instead,they are a judicial artifice imposed pursuant to the court case management authority under rule to streamline the proceedings in the subsequent three trials.that the court chose to issue its collateral estoppel ruling at the end of trial rather than the beginning of trial in no way attenuates the finality of the order or the force of its preclusive effect.
moreover,neither party disputes that the district same court that is presiding over the subsequent entered a final order decreeing that offensive collateral estoppel will be enforced in the subsequent three cases.the contours of the order are clear from its language,and the attorneys who litigated the issue below and now on appeal are the counsel of record for plaintiffs and defendants in all four matters.the district court order bound the defendants as of its entry of january,and the application of collateral estoppel in the subsequent trials is a certainty beyond any speculation.accordingly,there is no compelling reason for us to delay our review of the collateral estoppel question until the judgment in trial is appealed.if,as a consequence of sidestepping the collateral estoppel issue now,we belatedly reversed the district court estoppel ruling at that late stage,we would unnecessarily void a burdensome litigation that is currently slated to involve twenty plaintiffs and claims.disclaiming jurisdiction over the district court collateral estoppel ruling under these circumstances would vindicate form over substance,to the detriment of both parties and the district court.see schneider lockheed aircraft,the potential future use of collateral estoppel in the remaining cases requires that we address these arguments in the interest of sound judicial administration.
the brand of collateral estoppel applied by the district offensive collateral spawned the greatest misgivings among jurists.prior to the supreme court decision in labs.of,d,many courts adhered to the doctrine of mutuality of estoppel,which ordained that unless both parties or their privies in a second action are bound by a judgment in a previous case,neither party nor his privy in the second action may use the prior judgment as determinative of an issue in a second action.id.at.see triplett lowell.restatement of judgments a person who is not a party or privy to a party to an action in which a valid judgment is rendered a can not directly or collaterally attack the judgment,and b is not bound by or entitled to claim the benefits of an adjudication upon any matter decided in the action.the court determined that the traditional rationales undergirding the mutuality were unavailing in the face of weightier institutional concerns 
in any lawsuit where a defendant,because of the mutuality principle,is forced to present a complete defense on the merits to a claim which the plaintiff has fully litigated and lost in a prior action,there is an arguable misallocation of resources.to the extent the defendant in the second suit may not win by asserting,without contradiction,that the plaintiff had fully and fairly,but unsuccessfully,litigated the same claim in the prior suit,the defendant time and money are diverted from alternative or relitigation of a decided issue.and,still assuming that the issue was resolved correctly in the first suit,there is reason to be concerned about the plaintiff allocation of resources.permitting repeated litigation of the same issue as long as the supply of unrelated defendants holds out reflects either the aura of the gaming table or a lack of discipline and of disinterestedness on the part of the lower courts,hardly a worthy or wise basis for fashioning rules of procedure.
id.at.quoting kerotest fire equip.the excerpted language from endorses the application of defensive collateral estoppel.collateral estoppel is defensive when wielded by a defendant to bar plaintiffs from relitigating an issue s previously decided in his favor in a suit involving other plaintiffs.for the reasons articulated by justice white,permitting litigants to assert collateral estoppel in a defensive pose promotes efficiency by discouraging speculative lawsuits and conserving the resources of defendants.
collateral estoppel may be asserted offensively as well.that is,where,as here,plaintiffs seek to use issue preclusion to tie the defendants hands with an adversely decided issue from a previous case,the use of collateral estoppel is deemed offensive.as the supreme court recognized,the offensive use of collateral raises special concerns 
first,offensive use of collateral estoppel does not promote judicial economy in the same manner as defensive use does.defensive use of collateral estoppel precludes a plaintiff from relitigating identical issues by merely switching adversaries.thus defensive collateral estoppel gives a plaintiff a strong incentive to join all potential defendants in the first action if possible.offensive use of collateral estoppel,on the other hand,creates precisely the opposite incentive.since a plaintiff will be able to rely on a previous judgment against a defendant but will not be bound by that judgment if the defendant wins,the plaintiff has every incentive to adopt a wait and see attitude,in the hope that the first action by another plaintiff will result in a favorable judgment.thus offensive use of collateral estoppel will likely increase rather than decrease the total amount of litigation,since potential plaintiffs will have everything to gain and nothing to lose by not intervening in the first action.
a second argument against offensive use of collateral estoppel is that it may be unfair to a defendant.if a defendant in the first action is sued for small or nominal damages,he may have little incentive to defend vigorously,particularly if future suits are not foreseeable.allowing offensive collateral estoppel may also be unfair to a defendant if the judgment relied upon as a basis for the estoppel is itself inconsistent with one or more previous judgments in favor of the defendant.still another situation where it might be unfair to apply offensive estoppel is where the second action affords the defendant procedural opportunities unavailable in the first action that could readily cause a different result.
parklane hosiery shore,d internal citations and footnotes omitted.notwithstanding these concerns,the supreme court completed its break with traditional collateral estoppel doctrine in parklane hosiery by according district courts broad discretion to apply offensive collateral estoppel 
we have concluded that the preferable approach for dealing with these problems in the federal courts is not to preclude the use of offensive collateral estoppel,but to grant trial courts broad discretion to determine when it should be applied.the general rule should be that in cases where a plaintiff could easily have joined in the earlier action or where,either for the reasons discussed above or for other reasons,the application of offensive estoppel would be unfair to a defendant,a trial judge should not allow the use of offensive collateral estoppel.
significantly,the supreme court apprehensive regard for offensive collateral estoppel is rooted in considerations that are inapposite in a unique case such as this where a court applies collateral estoppel to pieces of a severed action over which it is presiding.in the case at bar,the district court exercised its discretion under rule to mandate the severance of plaintiffs into four trial groups,thereby prohibiting the plaintiffs in groups,and from voluntarily joining the first litigation.once the action was severed,the prospect of multiple trials was eminently foreseeable to the defendants,if not explicitly assured.moreover,with one eye on the impending three trials,and the other on their potentially immense exposure to the first group of twenty plaintiffs,see supra,the defendants had every possible incentive to vigo
