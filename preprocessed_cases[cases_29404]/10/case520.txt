opinion of the court 
the major issue in this appeal is the extent to which piggybacking,a common practice on playgrounds,is permitted in the judicial forum.in july,the communications workers of america,the national,after obtaining a right to sue letter from the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,filed a racial discrimination action in the united states district court for the district of new jersey.the national filed the action under title vii of the civil rights act of,and the new jersey law against discrimination njlad.it alleged that the performance assessment review par program utilized by the new jersey department of personnel,merit systems board the state or new jersey,in making promotions,salary and layoff decisions has a disparate impact upon african american and hispanic employees.
in july,local of the communications workers of america,along with four of its members,cheryl tobin,bessie deleon,regina jackson and arun kaushal collectively,the local successfully intervened.in may,however,the district court dismissed the local complaint as time barred.in august,the district court granted new jersey motion to enforce against the national a prior settlement agreement that had been reached between the national and the state.the local timely appealed from both orders.we affirm.
in december,the national filed a charge with the eeoc alleging that the par program utilized by the state of new jersey in making promotions,salary increment and layoff decisions discriminates against african american and hispanic state employees based upon their race,color and national origin because the system has a disparate impact upon african american and hispanic employees.along with the eeoc charge,the national submitted a transmittal letter,stating that the charge was being filed on behalf of individual members who had been discriminated against by the state evaluation policies.
in april,the eeoc issued a dismissal and right to sue letter,finding that the eeoc is unable to conclude that the information obtained establishes violation of the statutes.in accordance with title vii of the civil rights act of,the national timely instituted an action in the united states district court against new jersey alleging that the par program impermissibly discriminates on the basis of race.the national sought declaratory and injunctive relief,along with such other and further relief as may be proper.apparently,the national complaint did not name any individual employees as plaintiffs.
in the course of intensive collective bargaining negotiations in july,the national reached an agreement with new jersey that resolved the union complaint by revamping the par system,the layoff process,and recognizing the national right to challenge the new system should that system perpetuate discrimination against minority workers.in january,the national informed the local that it had agreed to withdraw the title vii action because of the settlement it had entered into with new jersey and the terms of the settlement.
on january,new jersey and the national,pursuant to the settlement agreement,submitted a signed joint stipulation of dismissal to the district court.dissatisfied with the agreement reached by the national,the local in february moved to intervene and sought to file their own complaint.the state and the national opposed intervention on the ground that there was no action pending in which to intervene.in july,the district court allowed the local to intervene as of right under federal rule of civil procedure.rule a without prejudice to any defenses new jersey might have against the local 
the local acknowledges that the complaint filed by it is identical to the national complaint except that it explicitly seeks compensatory damages and remediation for the effects of past discrimination.it also acknowledges that the par program is no longer used to make layoff determinations because of new regulations that have since become effective.however,it contends that the par program is still used in making promotions and salary increment decisions,albeit under the new par program negotiated by the national.the local main concern under the agreement is that neither the new regulations nor the new par program addresses remedying the cumulative effects of past par ratings on the current status of affected employees in the context of layoffs,promotions and salary increments and does not compensate for those past violations.
subsequently,new jersey filed a motion to dismiss the local complaint as time barred.in may,the district court agreed,and dismissed the local complaint.after the local intervention,the national filed a formal motion to amend its complaint to include the additional remedies sought by the local.new jersey opposed the amendment and filed a to enforce the settlement agreement with the national.in august,the district court agreed with new jersey,ordered the settlement agreement enforced,and found that the national was estopped from denying the existence of the agreement.
the district court reasoned that the national had repeatedly represented to the court that a settlement agreement had been reached as far back as july.the court also stated that the national had opposed the local motion to intervene on the basis of that settlement.in ordering the enforcement of the settlement,the district court denied as moot both the national motion to amend its complaint and the local motion to certify the may dismissal of its complaint as final.the local timely appealed from the may order dismissing its complaint in intervention and from the august order enforcing the settlement agreement between the national and new jersey

under the single filing rule doctrine,a plaintiff who has not filed an eeoc charge within the requisite time period can join a class action without satisfying either and the original eeoc charge filed by the plaintiff who subsequently filed a class action had alleged class based discrimination in the eeoc charge.lusardi lechner,cir.the local does not dispute that it never filed its own charge with the eeoc.rather,it contends that it should be allowed to piggyback on the national eeoc charge and complaint under the single filing rule doctrine.in the context of an age discrimination in employment act,et.adea claim,this court reaffirmed the rule that a plaintiff who intends to rely upon an eeoc charge already filed by another party must allege class based discrimination.lockhart westinghouse credit,cir,partially overruled on other grounds,starceski westinghouse,cir recognizing hazen paper biggins,d as effectively overruling our decision in lockhart on outrageous standard see also lusardi,at stating that although original eeoc charge need not explicitly state that charge is being brought on behalf of others similarly situated,it must allege class based discrimination.
here,new jersey assumes only for argument that the national eeoc charge was broad enough to have alleged class based discrimination.even if so,new jersey contends that the local can not take advantage of the single filing rule doctrine because,as the district court acknowledged,piggybacking has never been allowed when the subsequent action is not a class action.the district court stated that even if the charge alleged class based discrimination,since the subsequent action was not a class action,the local could not satisfy the title vii time limitation for filing the district court action within ninety days from the date of the eeoc right to sue letter.it reasoned that although the eeoc charge may have been broad enough to support the filing of a class action,it is of little use to the local because the national never filed a class action.
