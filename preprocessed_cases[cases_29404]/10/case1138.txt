fayelynn sams appeals the district court order dismissing her putative class claims against with prejudice.sams alleges that violated the stored communications act sca,when it disclosed some of sams noncontent subscriber information to the government pursuant to allegedly invalid subpoenas.sams further argues that even if the subpoenas were valid,failed to comply with their terms when it produced the requested documents prior to the deadline set in the subpoenas.because the sca provides a complete defense to any civil or criminal action where the defendant can demonstrate that it produced documents in good faith reliance on a grand jury subpoena,we affirm the district court order dismissing sams claims.
background 
styles itself as a premier digital media company,whose product offerings include internet search and email.is a delaware corporation,and its principal place of business is located in sunnyvale,california.while maintains an office in georgia,its legal compliance team is located in sunnyvale.
on december,legal compliance team received a facsimile of a grand jury subpoena from the district attorney office for the southern judicial circuit of georgia.the district attorney requested that disclose any and all records regarding the identification of one of its users the user in question was later determined to be sams.the subpoena was signed by both a judge and the clerk of the superior court of lowndes county,georgia,and demanded that produce the requested records at on january.a substantially similar subpoena was faxed to legal compliance team on december,demanding the production of additional documents by the january deadline 
both subpoenas were accompanied by nearly identical cover letters that purported to explain obligations under the subpoenas.those letters read,in relevant part 
as the subpoena indicates,you are required by law to appear and produce the evidence described in the subpoena before the grand jury on the date and time specified.prior to your appearance,you may wish to voluntarily provide copies of this evidence to inv.wendy lain at the district attorney office by voluntarily providing us with copies prior to your scheduled appearance,you will make it possible for us to review the evidence in your possession in advance.this should expedite your appearance before the grand jury and may make it possible for us to put you on call.
produced the requested information sometime before january.consequently,the prosecutor determined that the attendance of a witness was not needed,and no witness testified before the grand jury pursuant to the subpoenas.
based on the above conduct,sams filed a putative class action in the superior court of fulton county,georgia,purporting to represent a class of plaintiffs whose information had allegedly disclosed to law enforcement in violation of the sca.sams claimed that disclosures were unlawful because the subpoenas failed to comply with the requirements of georgia law,and specifically the uniform act to secure the attendance of witnesses from without the state in criminal proceedings uniform act.ann.sams further claimed that disclosures were unlawful because they were voluntarily made before the deadline for compliance set forth in the subpoenas.
successfully removed the action to the united states district court for the northern district of georgia.sams then filed a motion to transfer the case to the northern district of california.agreed that transfer to the northern district of california was the appropriate remedy in light of terms of service,and the case was transferred.

discussion 
consideration of extrinsic evidence and affirmative defenses 
this case comes to us on a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b.at this stage of the litigation,we would usually be confined to reviewing the body of sams complaint,which did not include copies of the two subpoenas.see lee city of los angeles,cir citation omitted.however,we are permitted to consider documents that were not physically attached to the complaint where the documents authenticity is not contested,and the plaintiff complaint necessarily relies on them.id.at citing parrino fhp,cir because the subpoenas are critical to sams lawsuit,and there is no factual dispute as to their contents,we may properly consider the appearance and content of the subpoenas at this stage in the litigation.
similarly,the assertion of an affirmative defense may be considered properly on a motion to dismiss where the allegations in the complaint suffice to establish the defense.jones bock,d see also goddard google,d,noting that affirmative defenses routinely serve as a basis for granting rule b motions where the defense is apparent from the face of the c omplaint internal quotation and citation omitted.
ii.the stored communications act claims 
congress passed the sca in as part of the electronic communications privacy act.the sca was enacted because the advent of the internet presented a host of potential privacy breaches that the fourth amendment does not address.quon arch wireless operating,cir,rev on other grounds,d citation omitted.to address these potential privacy breaches,the sca creates a set of fourth privacy protections by statute,regulating the relationship between government investigators and service providers in possession of users private information.orin kerr,a user guide to the stored communications act,and a legislator guide to amending it,geo.specifically,the statute protects the privacy of electronic communications by placing limits on the government ability to compel network service providers to disclose information they posses about their customers and subscribers,and restricting the ability of network service providers to voluntarily disclose information about their customers and subscribers to the government.violation of these provisions may result in criminal or civil liability,unless one or both of the sca statutory immunity provisions applies.e,e.
c of the sca provides the rules for compelling the production of a subset of noncontent records sometimes known as basic subscriber information that congress has deemed less private than other records under c,the government can obtain basic subscriber information such as the information produced here with a mere subpoena and where a provider,like,discloses basic subscriber information to the government in accordance with the terms of a subpoena,e,or in good faith reliance on a grand jury subpoena,e,the provider is immune from suit.
sams argues that is not entitled to benefit from either immunity provision because her basic subscriber information was produced pursuant to allegedly invalid subpoenas specifically,sams contends that because is not a citizen of georgia,it may only be lawfully subpoenaed in a criminal case pursuant to the provisions of the uniform act.ann.admits that the subpoenas here did not comply with the requirements of the uniform act,but argues that the uniform act does not apply where a foreign corporation maintains a presence in the state.
to our knowledge,no georgia court has determined whether georgia law requires the government to comply with the uniform act in order to obtain the testimony of a foreign corporation that maintains a physical presence within the state of georgia.see generally yeary state.however,we see no reason to be the first appellate court to address this unsettled aspect of georgia law because,regardless of the outcome of that issue,we conclude that is immune from suit under the sca imm
