wilens opened a waterhouse account with webbroker access in and was a frequent trader.on the morning of april,wilens claims he attempted to sell some stocks below the market price through webbroker but was prevented from doing so because his trading privileges had been terminated.he contacted his account officer,as directed,but had to wait about minutes for a broker to answer the phone by that time,the price of the stock had dropped well below the aforementioned order price.waterhouse employees allegedly concluded wilens trading access had been suspended because of a margin call,but admitted the margin call had been resolved the previous day and should not have interfered with his trading ability that morning.when defendants refused to honor the price i would have received over the web site,i mitigated the damage by selling at a slightly more favorable price later in the day.however,i still suffered a loss of,compared to the price i could have gotten initially that morning.wilens claims he received no pretermination notice or even notice contemporaneous with the termination.with such notice,i could have corrected the problem with my account or could have made other arrangements to make the trade without using webbroker such as going to a broker before the market opened to place the trade in person or calling before the market opened and ask ing to be allowed to keep an open line.
in his first amended complaint,wilens alleges that waterhouse right to terminate the webbroker agreement for any reason without notice is an unconscionable contractual provision and constitutes a violation of the consumer legal remedies act,subd.a,unfair competition bus,and breach of contract.he claims to be a member of a similarly situated class of persons,defined as p ersons who have or had waterhouse stock trading accounts within four years preceding the filing of this complaint which are or were enabled for webbroker access and who signed an account agreement containing one or more of the alleged unconscionable provisions.this class includes a subclass of persons whose webbroker access was suspended without cause for some period of time.
wilens claims he and the class members have sustained actual damages,including general damages,by being subjected to a violation of their rights under the consumer legal remedies act severe emotional and psychological distress,anguish,anxiety,and injury,and pain and suffering,for which they are entitled to compensation in an amount to be shown according to proof and special damages consisting of economic loss caused by loss of the ability to enter timely trade orders resulting in less favorable transaction prices,in an amount to be shown according to proof.wilens further alleges that c ertain of the class members qualify to receive enhanced damages in the form of treble damages and a civil penalty up to pursuant to civil code sections and subdivision b of section,respectively.
after waterhouse answered the complaint,the parties conducted discovery regarding class issues.waterhouse had over million webbroker customers as of may.the provision allowing it to terminate a customer access to the service for any reason without notice had been included in the agreement since january,although waterhouse stated it ordinarily makes every attempt to provide a customer with notice before it suspends access to the account.some of the reasons for terminating access include an unsecured debit a new york stock exchange nyse margin call a nyse stock restriction a tdw house call an account transfer the closure of an account notification of a divorce notification of death and a court order.
under court supervision,the parties hired an independent third party to send an communication to webbroker customers,informing them about the class action lawsuit and asking if their access had been interrupted by waterhouse during the previous four years.if so,the customers were asked to fill out a questionnaire about notice,reasons for the interruption,and resulting financial losses.waterhouse provided addresses for of its million webbroker customers.more than people responded,including california residents.about people,including california residents,said their trading access to webbroker had been suspended or terminated without notice,and of those claimed to have suffered losses.
in wilens motion for class certification,he redefined the class as defendants webbroker customers within four years preceding the filing of the complaint to present.this class includes a subclass of persons whose webbroker access was suspended without notice.the class is nationwide as to the breach of contract claim but limited to california residents on the remaining claims.the motion was heard in april.the trial court expressed its concern about certification because there are just too many variables to the individual claims and we would be trying perhaps several hundred separate lawsuits.the parties presented argument,and the trial court ruled t he court finds that the nature of the claims and the possible resultant damages in the nationwide class and any subclass are substantially dissimilar to not warrant a class certification.
discussion 
class actions are designed to adjudicate the claims of many individuals at the same time,thereby eliminating the possibility of repetitious litigation and providing small claimants with a method of obtaining redress for claims that would otherwise be too small to warrant individual litigation.richmond dart industries,cal d.but because group action also has the potential to create injustice,trial courts are required to carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the court.citation.linder thrifty oil cal th,d.on review of a ruling on class certification,we will affirm the trial court so long as the ruling is supported by substantial evidence and is not based on improper criteria or erroneous legal assumptions.richmond dart industries,supra,cal d at.thus,o ur task on appeal is not to determine in the first instance whether the requested class is appropriate but rather whether the trial court has abused its discretion in denying certification.osborne subaru of america,d.
class certification under the consumer legal remedies act 
wilens first contends the trial court erroneously denied certification of the class under the consumer legal remedies act clra.he claims the trial court basis for the the individual claims were substantially dissimilar is not supported by substantial evidence.we disagree.
the clra makes unlawful certain unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices used in the sale of goods or services to a consumer,subd.a.if the consumer suffers damage as a result of an unlawful act,the consumer can bring an action against the defendant for actual damages,punitive damages,injunctive relief or restitution.a
