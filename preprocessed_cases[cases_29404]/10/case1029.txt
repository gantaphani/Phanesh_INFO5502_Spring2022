starla rollins filed this putative class action against her former employer,dignity health,its chief human resources officer,unnamed members of its retirement subcommittee,and other unnamed fiduciaries collectively dignity health,alleging that dignity health has not maintained its pension plan in compliance with the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.dignity health concedes it has not complied with erisa,but contends its plan qualifies for erisa exemption.see id,b.the district court held that a pension plan must have been established by a church,or by a convention or association of churches,to qualify as a church plan.because the district court found that dignity health pension plan was not established by a church,or by a convention or association of churches,the court awarded partial summary judgment to rollins,ruling that dignity health pension plan must comply with erisa.we accepted jurisdiction in this interlocutory appeal to address whether the district court was correct to hold that a church plan must be established by a church or by a convention or association of churches.we affirm the district court answer to that question and remand for further proceedings.
background 
because this appeal comes to us from the district court award of summary judgment to rollins,we relate the facts in the light most favorable to dignity health.see nolan heald,cir.in the early,the sisters of mercy congregations in auburn,california and burlingame,california the sponsoring congregations each established nonprofit hospital systems.in,the sponsoring congregations merged the two systems to form catholic healthcare west chw.employees in the chw system received pension benefits through seven plans,separately maintained either by a sponsoring congregation,by an individual hospital,or by chw.on january,the sponsoring congregations,the hospitals,and chw merged these plans into a single pension plan the plan.on july,chw board of directors adopted a retroactive resolution to treat the plan as a church plan.chw name was later changed to dignity health as a result of corporate restructuring.
from to,plaintiff starla rollins worked as a billing coordinator for san bernardino community hospital,which became affiliated with chw and adopted the plan in august.on november,rollins was sent a summary plan description,notifying her that chw considers the plan to be a church plan and therefore exempt from erisa.rollins became a participant in the plan on january.she will be eligible for pension benefits from the plan when she reaches retirement age.
rollins filed this putative class action against dignity health,alleging that dignity health has violated numerous erisa requirements.the complaint alleges,first,that the plan is not a church plan and,second,that erisa exemption is unconstitutional.rollins seeks declaratory relief,money damages,statutory penalties,injunctive relief,and attorney fees.
dignity health concedes that the plan does not comply with erisa,but contends that the plan need not do so because it qualifies for the exemption under c i for convenience,subparagraph c i.dignity health contends that under subparagraph c i a church plan need not have been established by a church or by a convention or association of churches for convenience,church if it is maintained by a or organization whose principal purpose or function is to provide benefits to church employees for convenience,organization.
the district court granted partial summary judgment against dignity health,holding that,to qualify for the exemption under subparagraph c i,a plan must be established by a church and maintained either by a church or by a organization.see rollins dignity health,supp.cal.see rollins dignity health,supp.cal.the district court did not reach the question whether the exemption is constitutional.
the district court certified its order for interlocutory appeal because the question whether a plan must have been established by a church to qualify as a church plan under c i is a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and because an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.see b.we accepted jurisdiction.the district court stayed proceedings pending appeal.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo rulings on for summary judgment.trunk city of san diego,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when,with the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the party,there are no genuine issues of material fact,so that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.grenning,cir.citation and internal quotation marks omitted fed.civ.a.
iii.discussion 
congress enacted erisa to protect the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries by setting out substantive regulatory requirements for employee benefit plans and to provide for appropriate remedies,sanctions,and ready access to the federal courts.aetna health davila,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.erisa does not require employers to create benefit plans or require the provision of specific benefits once a plan is created.however,erisa does seek to ensure that employees will not be left once employers have guaranteed them certain benefits.lockheed spink.church plans are exempt from erisa regulatory requirements unless the church waives the exemption.b,b see d.
for the reasons that follow,we agree with the district court that,in order to qualify for the exemption under subparagraph c i,a plan must have been established by a church and maintained either by a church or by a organization.
statutory text 
in interpreting a statute,w e look first at the plain language,examining not only the specific provision at issue,but also the structure of the statute as a whole,including its object and policy.if the statutory language is unambiguous,our inquiry is at an end.if the language is ambiguous,then we examine legislative history,and also look to similar provisions within the statute as a whole and the language of related or similar statutes to aid in interpretation.gladstone bancorp,cir.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.two statutory provisions are directly relevant to this appeal.
first,church plans are exempt from otherwise applicable requirements of erisa the provisions of this subchapter shall not apply to any employee benefit plan if such plan is a church plan as defined in section of this title.b.
second,a church plan is defined as follows 
a the term church plan means a plan established and maintained by a church or by a convention or association of churches.
c for purposes of this paragraph 
i a plan established and maintained for its employees or their beneficiaries by a church or by a convention or association of churches includes a plan maintained by an organization the principal purpose or function of which is the administration of funding of a plan or program for the provision of retirement benefits or welfare benefits,or both,for the employees of a church or a convention or association of churches,if such organization is controlled by or associated with a church or a convention or association of churches.
emphasis added.
to make our discussion easier to follow,we describe the essential structure of the foregoing provisions paragraph b provides that a church plan is exempt from erisa.paragraph a provides that in order to qualify for the exemption,a plan must be both established and maintained by a church.subparagraph c i provides that a plan established and maintained by a church includes a plan maintained by a organization.
there are two possible readings of subparagraph c i.first,the subparagraph can be read to mean that a plan need only be maintained by a organization to qualify for the exemption.under this reading,a plan maintained by a organization qualifies for the exemption even if it was established by an organization other than a church.second,the subparagraph can be read to mean merely that maintenance by a organization is the equivalent,for purposes of the exemption,of maintenance by a church.under this reading,the exemption continues to require that the plan be established by a church.
we conclude that the more natural reading of subparagraph c i is that the phrase preceded by the word includes serves only to broaden the definition of organizations that may maintain a church plan.the phrase does not eliminate the requirement that a church plan must be established by a church.the other circuit courts that have considered the question agree with this reading.see kaplan saint peter healthcare,cir.stapleton advocate health care network,cir.the third circuit provides the following helpful illustration a ny person who is disabled and a veteran is entitled to free insurance a person who is disabled and a veteran includes a person who served in the national guard.kaplan,at.it is reasonably clear from context that a person who served in the national guard satisfies the requirement that he or she be a veteran,but that this person qualifies for free insurance only if he or she is also disabled.similarly,in subparagraph c i,it is reasonably clear from context that a plan maintained by a organization satisfies the requirement that it be maintained by a church,but that the plan qualifies as a church plan only if it was also established by a church.
legislative history 
our reading is supported by legislative history.as originally enacted in,erisa defined the term church plan as follows 
a the term church plan means 
i a plan established and maintained for its employees by a church or by a convention or association of churches which is exempt from tax under section of the internal revenue code of,or 
ii a plan described in subparagraph c.
c a plan in existence on january,shall be treated as a church plan if it is established and maintained by a church or convention or association of churches for its employees and employees of one or more agencies of such church or convention or association,and if such church or convention or association and each such agency is exempt from tax under section of the internal revenue code of.the first sentence of this subparagraph shall not apply to any plan maintained for employees of an agency with respect to which the plan was not maintained on january.the first sentence to this subparagraph shall not apply with respect to any plan for any plan year beginning after december.
a,c.the parties dispute would have been easily resolved under erisa originally enacted text,which unambiguously provided that a church plan must have been established by a church.but this text was amended in the multiemployer pension plan amendments act of mppaa,to provide the current text of c i iii.
dignity health contends that the current subparagraph c i eliminated the requirement that a plan be established by a church if a plan is maintained by a organization.as the party contending that legislative action changed settled law,dignity health has the burden of showing that the legislature intended such a change.green bock laundry mach.
dignity health argues that subparagraph c ii supports its interpretation of subparagraph c i.this subparagraph provides in relevant part 
ii the term employee of a church or a convention or association of churches includes 
i a duly ordained,commissioned,or licensed minister of a church in the exercise of his ministry,regardless of the source of his compensation 
ii an employee of an organization,whether a civil law corporation or otherwise,which is exempt from tax under section of title and which is controlled by or associated with a church or a convention or association of churches and 
iii an individual described in clause v.
dignity health contends that this subparagraph shows that congress intended in subparagraph c i to eliminate the requirement that a plan be established by a church whenever a plan is administered by a organization.in particular,dignity health argues in its brief that,if a church plan may cover employees of a organization,and a organization may maintain the plan,congress had no reason to insist that the church itself must establish the plan.internal quotation marks omitted.this argument is based on a misreading of the legislative history.
congress reason for enacting subparagraph c ii is clear from the legislative record.before erisa was enacted,many churches had allowed employees of organizations,such as hospitals and schools,to participate in the churches pension plans.as originally enacted,erisa allowed plans covering the employees of such organizations to qualify as church plans only until december.after that date,plans including employees of such organizations would either have had to comply with erisa or divide into separate plans.separation would have imposed significant hardships,including increased plan maintenance costs and limitations on the free movement of employees between a church and its associated organizations.see cong.rec.may,statement of talmadge.in response to this concern,congress eliminated the sunset provision of former paragraph c and added subparagraph c ii to expand the definition of employees who were eligible to participate in a church plan.after the adoption of subparagraph c ii,employees of organizations became eligible to participate.
congress reason for enacting subparagraph c i was different.subsection c,as it existed until,required that a church plan be maintained by a church.in codifying this requirement,congress inadvertently excluded plans maintained,administered by or pension boards rather than by churches themselves.see,cong.rec.may,statement of talmadge.congress relaxed this requirement by adding the language in subparagraph c i that specifies that a plan maintained by a or organization,such as a pension board,qualifies as a plan maintained by a church.the legislative history is clear that subparagraph c i addressed only the problem of maintenance by or pension boards.see,cong.rec.may,statement of talmadge our legislation retains the definition of church plan as a plan established and maintained for its employees by a church or by a convention or association of church es exempt from tax under section.id.at no church plan administered or funded by a pension board would be disqualified merely because it is separately incorporated.cong.rec.july,talmadge may i ask whether the bill would enable a church pension board to maintain a church plan long yes.labor hum.resources com.on,noting that the former definition of a church plan would be continued and only clarified to include plans maintained by a pension board maintained by a church com.on,exec,at june,the definition of a church plan would also be expanded to include church plans which rather than being maintained directly by a church are instead maintained by a pension board maintained by a church.
thus,subparagraph c ii,on the one hand,and subparagraph c i,on the other,addressed two quite different problems.there is nothing in the legislative history of subparagraph c ii to suggest that congress intended,in expanding the definition of eligible employees,to eliminate the requirement that a church plan be established by a church.nor is there anything in the legislative history of subparagraph c i to suggest that congress intended,in broadening the definition of organizations that are authorized to maintain a church plan,to eliminate that same requirement.
related statutes 
dignity health maintains that language in three federal statutes enacted after mppaa supports its reading of subparagraph c i.as defined in these three statutes,the terms church plan and r etirement income account provided by a church do not require that a plan or account be established by a church.dignity health contends that we must presume that congress intended the term church plan in erisa to have the same meaning as in these statutes.see hawaiian airlines,norris.we disagree.

for purposes of sections a and b of the internal revenue code of,any retirement plan maintained by the ymca retirement fund as of january,shall be treated as a church plan within the meaning of section e of such code which is maintained by an organization described in section e a of such code.
