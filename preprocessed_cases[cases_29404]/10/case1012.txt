we deal with provisions of the class action fairness act cafa to ensure that large class action cases are heard in federal court.d.the issue before us is whether plaintiffs may amend their complaint,after a case has been removed to federal court,to change the definition of the class so as to eliminate minimal diversity and thereby divest the federal court of jurisdiction.we hold plaintiffs may not do so and clarify that the range of amendments permitted under our prior opinion in benko quality loan service,cir,upon which the district court relied,is very narrow.
plaintiff,a california restaurant,filed this action in california state court against visa and related corporations claiming that visa is violating the state antitrust laws by fixing rates and preventing merchants from applying a surcharge for the use of credit cards.the complaint described the class as all california individuals,businesses and other entities who accepted cards in california since january,defendant companies visa are citizens of california and delaware.plaintiff class as described in the original state court complaint included both california and citizens.broadway grill is the named plaintiff and is a california corporation.visa removed to federal district court because cafa minimal diversity requirement was satisfied.under cafa there is sufficient diversity to establish federal diversity jurisdiction so long as one class member has citizenship diverse from that of one defendant.d a.since many merchants doing business in california,and members of the class as originally described,are not citizens of california,the requirement was met.
after visa removed to the district court for the northern district of california,broadway grill moved to remand on the theory that the case qualified as one of cafa exceptions to the exercise of federal jurisdiction.the relevant exception is the local controversy exception for cases in which of the class members are citizens of the state of filing and a significant defendant is a citizen of that state as well.d.the district court correctly denied the motion to remand because the class,on its face,included many of california,and broadway grill could not establish were california citizens.
it was at this point that broadway grill sought leave to amend the complaint to change plaintiff class to include only california citizens,in order to eliminate minimal diversity.the district court granted leave to amend and ordered the case remanded to the state court.while the district court acknowledged the general rule that jurisdiction is determined at the time of removal,and amendments can not eliminate jurisdiction,the court relied on an exception,apparently unique to our circuit,permitting amendment in limited circumstances to add allegations of underlying facts that clarify the nature of the claims for purposes of determining cafa jurisdiction.see benko,at holding that in certain circumstances plaintiffs should be permitted to amend a complaint to clarify issues pertaining to federal jurisdiction under cafa.in benko,the plaintiffs were permitted to set out the percentage of claims that were against the defendant in order to show it was a significant defendant within the cafa exception to federal jurisdiction.
benko has created some uncertainty in the district courts as to when amendments may be allowed.see lopez aerotek,wl,at cal,not allowing an amendment that added a new defendant to potentially qualify for the local controversy exception rossetti stearn prod,wl,at cal.june,not allowing an amendment that would change the class from a national class to a california citizen class chen ebay,wl,at cal,effectively allowing amendment and ordering remand of a complaint that restricted a class to citizens of california,rather than residents in re anthem.data breach,cal.allowing amendment of a complaint so that a class represented only missouri citizens rather than residents and ordering remand.
the basic jurisdictional provisions of cafa are simple.under d,d,the matter in controversy must exceed,the number of plaintiffs must be or more and diversity is established when any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a state different from any defendant.thus,unlike other civil actions,where there must be complete diversity between named plaintiffs and defendants,cafa requires only what is termed minimal diversity.the law provides minimal diversity is to be determined as of the time of removal.d.
congress intent to broaden federal court class action jurisdiction is illustrated by the provision for expedited appellate review when a district court orders remand.c.such appeals must be decided within sixty days.we have appellate jurisdiciton pursuant to that provision.we have held our review of remand orders is de novo.blue cross of,cir.
in exercising that appellate jurisdiction,the circuits have unanimously and repeatedly held that whether remand is proper must be ascertained on the basis of the pleadings at the time of removal.the rule goes back to pullman jenkins.our leading case in the cafa context is mondragon capital one auto,cir.see also doyle onewest bank,fsb,cir.t he district court should have determined the citizenship of the proposed plaintiff class based on doyle complaint as of the date the case became removable.internal quotation omitted.the other circuits are in complete agreement.as the seventh circuit has said,removal cases present concerns about forum manipulation that counsel against allowing a plaintiff amendments to affect jurisdiction.in re burlington northern santa fe,cir.see also hargett revclaims,llc,wl,at cir,in touch concepts,cellco,cir.cedar lodge plantation,cshv fairway view i,cir.allowing cedar lodge to avoid federal jurisdiction through a amendment wold turn the policy underlying cafa on its head.this unanimity seems firmly to establish that plaintiffs attempts to amend a complaint after removal to eliminate federal jurisdiction are doomed to failure.
in benko,however,this court allowed plaintiffs to amend the complaint after removal,in order to clarify jurisdiction.we did so when the amendment did not alter the definition of the class,but,rather,had the effect of explaining the impact of the complaint allegations on one of the defendants.this impact was jurisdictionally significant because cafa contains an exception to the exercise of jurisdiction on the basis of minimal diversity,where a local defendant will be especially impacted,the local controversy exception.see benko,at.our opinion in benko explained that the amendment served only to provide some amplification,for federal jurisdictional purposes,of the nature of plaintiffs allegations.the amendment provided estimates of the percentage of total claims asserted against the defendant in order to show that the defendant was significant,for purposes of d.id.
the amendment in this case,however,did not provide an explanation of the allegations,but changed the definition of the class itself.instead of being composed of all the merchants in the state of california,regardless of citizenship,the class,as defined in the amended complaint,became exclusively composed of california citizens.we conclude such an amendment is outside the exception recognized in benko and thus can not affect the removability of the action.
benko itself recognized that cafa favors federal jurisdiction and that only certain issues,such as whether a particular defendant was significant,that were highly unlikely to be addressed in a state court complaint,justified allowing amendments.id.at.it was only under those limited circumstances,where the plaintiffs can provide a federal court with the information that amendments that could potentially affect jurisdiction were allowed.id.a class definition,however,will always be present in any class action complaint,state or federal.the amendment in this case did not merely provide relevant information.it changed the nature of the action.
we have not found any other circuit decisions permitting amendment of the complaint to affect the existence of federal jurisdiction and certainly none permitting alteration of the make up of the class.a very recent decision of
