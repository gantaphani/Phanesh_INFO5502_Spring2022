in congress passed legislation that acknowledged the fiduciary duties that the secretaries of the departments of the interior and defendants in this to beneficiaries of individual indian money iim accounts.frustrated by delay in the fulfillment of these duties,plaintiffs filed a class action in on behalf of present and past beneficiaries of the accounts.since that time,the district court has drawn on a range of its powers in an effort to ensure that defendants live up to their duties as the accounts trustees.one such duty required defendants to complete a historical accounting of all trust fund assets.this past february,the district court reissued an injunction that set out,in great detail,the means by which they were to fulfill this duty.the defendants argue that reissuance of the injunction was an abuse of discretion.even the plaintiffs agree that the injunction should not stand because they believe it to be impossible to perform.in short,no party believes that the injunction should survive in its present form.we agree.
the trust relationship at issue here dates back to the passage of the general allotment act of,ch,stat.the act allotted land to individual indians and provided that the government would hold the land thus allotted,for the period of years subject to discretionary extension by the president,in trust for the sole use and benefit of the indian to whom such allotment shall have been made.id.whenever the government authorized transactions,such as leasing allotted lands or selling timber rights,it was supposed to hold the revenue in individual accounts for the indian owners of the beneficial interests in the lands.see cobell norton,cobell xiii cobell norton,cobell vi.legislation passed in halted the process of allotting additional land but indefinitely extended the trust period for the lands that had already been allotted.indian reorganization act of,stat.codified as amended at et.a separate statute enacted in authorized the secretary of the interior to transfer trust funds from the united states treasury to banks or to invest them in government or securities.an act to authorize the deposit and investment of indian funds,stat.codified as amended at.the department of the interior estimates that approximately billion has flowed into iim accounts since,and about billion has been distributed from them,leaving an overall balance of million as of december.declaration of james cason,associate deputy secretary,department of the interior,in support of motion for emergency stay pending appeal,at filed,march cason declaration.
the legislative enactments that initially made the federal government a trustee and then extended the trusteeship said little as to how the government was to fulfill its fiduciary obligations except to indicate the range of permissible investments.but it is not disputed that the government failed to be a diligent trustee.in the two decades leading up to plaintiffs initiation of their lawsuit,report after report excoriated the government management of the iim trust funds.see cobell vi,at describing reports by the general accounting office,the interior department inspector general,and the office of management and budget,among others.embarrassed by this record,congress in passed legislation reaffirming the government obligation to account for the daily and annual balance of all funds held in trust by the united states for the benefit of an indian tribe or an individual indian which are deposited or invested pursuant to the act to authorize the deposit and investment of indian funds.american indian trust fund management reform act of,stat.codified as amended at et act.
addressing plaintiffs claim under the administrative procedure act,and the declaratory judgment act,the district court found that the defendants had unlawfully delayed the congressionally mandated accounting and remanded the case to the defendants with instructions to bring themselves into compliance with their trust duties.cobell babbitt,d.we affirmed the district court order.cobell vi,at.
following our affirmance and a trial,the district court issued an opinion holding interior secretary gale norton and assistant secretary of interior for indian affairs neal mccaleb in contempt of court.cobell norton,d.on appeal from the contempt citations,we overturned each of the five separate specifications articulated by the district court for charging the individuals with contempt.cobell norton,cobell viii.
in spite of our decision reversing the district court contempt citations,the court made clear that it considered its findings of facts undisturbed.cobell norton,d,cobell x.without making any additional findings of fact on the need for broader injunctive relief,it initiated another bench trial to evaluate the parties competing plans for bringing the defendants into compliance with their fiduciary obligations.see id.at the trial conclusion the court issued a comprehensive and detailed injunction specifying how the defendants were to go about the accounting.see id.at.
the district court injunction expanded the scope of the accounting well beyond that of the plan submitted by the defendants.among other differences,the injunction required coverage of the accounts of deceased beneficiaries and accounting for transactions prior to,and it completely precluded the use of statistical sampling.the defendants had proposed to use such sampling for verification of the accuracy of the transactions underlying entries for individual accounts.in an exhibit attached to their motion to stay the injunction pending appeal,the defendants estimated that the ultimate cost of complying with the injunction would range from billion,as opposed to the million estimated cost of the defendants plan.declaration of james cason,associate deputy secretary,department of the interior,in support of motion for stay pending appeal,at filed,november cason declaration.a more recent submission identified interior current best estimate as billion.march cason declaration,at.
on appeal,defendants raised a number of specific objections to the injunction,as well as a challenge based on a fiscal year appropriations bill passed in november.the bill stated that nothing in the act,or in any other statute,and no principle of common law,shall be construed to require the department of the interior to commence or continue historical accounting activities with respect to the individual indian money trust until either congress passed legislation amending the act to delineate the defendants specific historical accounting obligations or the date december,had passed,stat.we did not reach any of the specific objections because this last challenge trumped the others we held that by enacting that provision,congress provided interior temporary relief and bought itself some time to come up with a legislative solution.cobell xiii,at.as it turned out,congress passed no amending legislation before its deadline.on december,however,the president signed into law an appropriations bill that limited the funds available for purposes in fiscal year to million,stat.
the district court,and not any of the parties to this litigation,made the next move.on february,without holding a hearing and without making any modifications to the prior injunction content,the district court reissued its injunction 
of course,december,has come and gone,and no legislative solution to the issues in this litigation is available or in the offing.therefore,the court is bound,by its findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth in its september,memorandum opinion,to reissue without modification the historical accounting provisions of its structural injunction.

we review the district court reissuance of the injunction for abuse of discretion and its underlying legal conclusions de novo.katz georgetown university.in cobell xiii we explained that any injunction issued by the district court must be grounded not only in the defendants statutory trust duties,but also in specific findings that interior breached those duties.at.we examine first the consistency of the district court injunction with these two requirements,a
