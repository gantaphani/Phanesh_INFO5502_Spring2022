the last recession put the garrett group,a commercial real estate company,into serious financial trouble.in,garrett informed its largest creditor,cvb financial corporation cvb,that it could not make payments on its loans.after the loans were restructured,garrett informed cvb in early that it again could not make the required payments and was contemplating bankruptcy.
cvb nonetheless represented in and filings with the securities and exchange commission sec that there was no basis for serious doubt about garrett ability to repay its borrowings.in,the sec served a subpoena on cvb,seeking information about its loan underwriting methodology and allowance for credit losses.the day after cvb announced receipt of the subpoena,its stock dropped,and analysts noted the probable relationship between the subpoena and cvb loans to garrett,its largest borrower.a month later,cvb wrote down million in loans to garrett and placed the remaining million in its category.
in this putative class action,jacksonville police fire pension fund jacksonville alleges violations of section b of the securities and exchange act of,b,and rule promulgated thereunder,b.the district court granted cvb motion to dismiss,holding that the second amended complaint sac failed to plausibly allege that any of the statements by cvb challenged in the pleading were either knowingly or recklessly false or caused a loss to shareholders.
we affirm in part and reverse in part,finding that the sac stated a claim as to two alleged misrepresentations.in doing so,we hold that the announcement of an sec investigation related to an alleged misrepresentation,coupled with a subsequent revelation of the inaccuracy of that misrepresentation,can serve as a corrective disclosure for the purpose of loss causation.see loos immersion,cir reserving this question.
a.the september meeting and subsequent loans 
in late august or early september,garrett board of advisors,including its chief operating officer coo,met to discuss an upcoming meeting with cvb.according to the coo,whom the sac does not otherwise identify,the board was told that management planned to inform cvb that garrett had laid off twenty people,reduced salaries,and could not make payments on its loans.at the time,garrett was cvb largest borrower.
cvb officials and garrett executives paul garrett and kirk wright,garrett chief executive officer,met about two weeks later,in the fall of.two weeks after that meeting,wright confirmed to the board that cvb had been informed of the layoffs and salary reductions and told that garrett could not meet its current obligations,including its loan payments to cvb.
cvb subsequently made an additional million loan to garrett,secured by an interest in rent in fifteen properties.when the new loan closed,garrett was ninety days delinquent on its loan payments to cvb.garrett used a quarter of the new loan to get current with cvb.garrett coo recalled that cvb was trying to keep the house of cards standing.other garrett employees confirmed that garrett financial situation in and early was rotten,with rental properties vacant for years,and that garrett had considered bankruptcy.
in march,cvb provided garrett with million in refinancing.cvb also made other modifications to garrett loans in.
b.the november representations 
on november,cvb issued a quarterly report,known as a form q,for the period ending september.the q listed troubled loans and then stated that cvb was not aware of any other loans as of september,for which known credit problems of the borrower would cause serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with their loan repayment terms,or any known events that would result in the loan being designated as at some future date.the loans to garrett were not listed.
c.the january meeting 
by the end of,garrett again became delinquent with cvb.according to garrett coo,in late december or early january,wright told his board that garrett needed to meet with cvb to address this situation.
the meeting with cvb occurred one week later,in early january.a week after that,wright reported back to the garrett board.wright reported that garrett told cvb it would file for bankruptcy unless the loans were modified.garrett also discussed two other options with cvb selling assets or bringing on a new equity partner.it also provided cvb with the financial projections and presentation it had used in unsuccessful attempts to woo new investors.wright told the board that garrett had pleaded with cvb for more time to resolve the loan situation,but that no agreement had been reached.
cvb and garrett continued negotiations about the loans throughout.garrett never again became current on its obligations to cvb.
d.the march and may representations 
on march,cvb filed a form k for calendar year.the k stated that cvb was not aware of any other loans as of december,for which known credit problems of the borrower would cause serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with their loan repayment terms.as with the previous q,this statement appeared after a list of or loans.that list did not include the garrett loans.
cvb made a nearly identical no serious doubts statement in a q filed on may.that statement differed from the previous no serious doubts statements only in that it was as of march.
e.the alleged disclosures 
in may and june,an anonymous blogger suggested with its loans to garrett and others,often restructuring the loans at the end of the quarter or year,before fdic audits.but,other analysts did not credit these blog posts,and neither did the market at large cvb stock price rose,climbing to on july.
on july,cvb received a subpoena from the sec.on august,after the stock market closed,cvb filed a form q for the second quarter of,which disclosed receipt of the subpoena,stating 
the subpoena requests information regarding our loan underwriting guidelines,our allowance for credit losses and our allowance for loan loss calculation methodology,our methodology for grading loans and the process for making provisions for loan losses,and our provision for credit losses.in addition,the subpoena requests information regarding presentations we have given or conferences we have attended with analysts,brokers,investors or prospective investors.
the next day,cvb stock fell,from to per share,a loss of million in market capitalization.
several analysts commented on the subpoena.the blogger claimed that it appear s to validate our overall concerns with the bank.dow jones specifically noted a connection to the garrett loans 
discussion of cvb financial centers on its largest exposure,loans to a property company called the garrett group.skeptics believe this exposure is backed by collateral whose market value is well below that of the loan amount.some also question whether cvb extended a new loan to garrett to help it pay existing loans,something myers denies.he said the garrett group was current on its loans at the end of the second quarter,but the bank had reserves against the exposure.
credit suisse observed that the investigation appeared to pertain to the adequacy of cvb reserves,including those for its largest borrower,garrett,and the adequacy of cvb disclosures.and,on august,fig partners wrote 
it appears the sec is looking into whether cvb misled the street by hiding the true performance of loans the company said were performing.in doing so,the sec is also implying that company management hid the true nature of the loan portfolio from the fdic and california department of financial institutions the bank primary regulators.
the information sought in the sec subpoena is very similar to stories in the press recently that the company was overstating credit quality.
a month later,after the market closed on september,cvb announced that garrett was unable to pay its loans as scheduled the bank charged off million in garrett loans and characterized the remaining million as nonperforming and impaired.cvb announced that it had million in reserves for credit losses and was recording an additional million to account for the million.cvb also announced that it had only an equity interest,and no direct liens,on the fifteen properties that served as collateral for the largest loan to garrett,which had a balance of million,and that it was discounting the value of its ucc filings on those properties to zero.
the next day,credit suisse published an analysis of cvb announcement 
more importantly,in our view,cvb announced that it was placing its largest and most controversial loan on status,and writing it down to its recent appraisal less assumed oreo costs.
while the sec subpoena remains outstanding,we believe the announcement removes a major component of uncertainty in regards to problem loans for which the subpoena also seeks to address to a certain extent.
consistent with that analysis,cvb stock dropped only slightly on september,from to a closing price of.by the next week the stock had risen above,and it never again fell below that price.as another analyst wrote on september,
the company share price plummeted by to on august,which was the day after it disclosed the sec investigation.since then,the share price has drifted down by an additional to on september.there was only a modest decline of following the earnings preannouncement as further deterioration in credit quality and uncertainty surrounding the sec investigation are already reflected in the share price.
in january and february,cvb recorded notices of default on million of garrett loans.despite the sec subpoena,no formal agency proceedings were instituted against cvb.
procedural history 
in,two securities fraud actions were filed against cvb in the united states district court for the central district of california.the district court consolidated the suits and appointed jacksonville as lead plaintiff.the court then dismissed in turn,each time with leave to amend,the consolidated complaint,a first amended complaint,and the sac.jacksonville declined to further amend its complaint and requested that the district court enter judgment.the court did so,and jacksonville timely appealed.
ii.standard of review 
we review a dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo,accepting all allegations as true.metzler inv.gmbh corinthian,cir.securities fraud claims must satisfy the exacting pleading standards of federal rule of civil procedure b and the private securities litigation reform act pslra.or.pub.emp.ret.fund apollo,cir.
ii.discussion 
the sac alleged that cvb,myers,and cvb former chief financial officer,edward biebrich collectively,cvb violated section b of the securities and exchange act of and rule the elements of a private securities fraud action under section b and rule are a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant scienter a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission economic loss and loss causation.erica john fund,halliburton,citation omitted.
the complaint must plead specific facts indicating why any alleged misrepresentation was false or any omission rendered a representation misleading.b metzler,at.to plead scienter adequately,the complaint must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference,b a,that defendants engaged in knowing or intentional conduct,which includes deliberate recklessness,ferry lp,killinger,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.the inference of scienter must be at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.tellabs,makor issues rights.
the sac alleges four general categories of false and misleading statements 
cvb touting of its loan underwriting culture,credit metrics,and the quality of its loan portfolio.
cvb statement that the deteriorating real estate market could harm its borrowers ability to repay.
cvb financial statements,which allegedly violated generally accepted accounting principles gaap.
cvb assurance in its sec filings that it was not aware of any other loans for which known credit problems of the borrower would cause serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with their loan repayment terms.
we analyze these alleged misrepresentations to determine whether the sac includes detailed allegations compelling the inference that each statement was false and made with the requisite scienter.see tellabs,at ferry,at.
a.the first three categories of statements 
first,the sac alleges that cvb committed securities fraud by boasting that t he overall credit quality of the loan portfolio is sound cvb credit metrics are superior to those of its peers strong credit culture and underwriting integrity remain paramount at cvb and cvb culture has limited its exposure to problem credits.the district court dismissed the claims based on these boasts,characterizing them as puffery.that decision was correct.these vague,optimistic statements by cvb officials are not actionable.see in re cutera sec,cir 
jacksonville next argues that cvb committed securities fraud by describing the southern california real estate market in several sec filings simply as a risk factor that could affect the ability of loan customers to repay in the future,when in fact that risk had already come to fruition.but,in context,there is nothing misleading about these statements,which were accompanied by information about cvb credit losses and and a warning that w e may be required to make additional provisions for loan losses and charge off additional loans in the future.
jacksonville also alleges that there were gaap violations in cvb published accounting figures.but,the mere publication of inaccurate accounting figures,or a failure to follow gaap,without more,does not establish scienter.dsam glob.value fund altris software,cir quoting in re software toolworks,cir.to raise a strong inference of scienter,the sac must allege facts demonstrating that defendants knowingly and recklessly engaged in an improper accounting practice,for example,that a company external auditors counseled against a practice or that a company cfo was aware that the practice was improper.metzler,at.the sac contains no such allegations.nor does it allege the role of the individual defendants in preparing the company accounting statements or what knowledge they had of gaap principles.accordingly,the district court correctly dismissed the gaap claims.
b.the sec filings 
the sac alleges that,in november,march,and may,cvb sec filings falsely assured investors that garrett had no known credit problems that would cause serious doubts as to its ability to repay.we examine each filing in turn.
the november q 
jacksonville argues that the statement in the q filed in november that there was no basis for serious doubts about garrett ability to pay was false because,in september,garrett had expressly told cvb of its financial difficulties.but by november,garrett had been current on its loans for about a year,and the sac does not allege that garrett gave cvb any cause for concern during that year.a meeting a year earlier that led to restructuring does not compel the inference that the november statement was false.
the sac also alleges that garrett personnel continued to be concerned about the company financial position in.but it does not allege that these concerns were communicated to cvb.the sac also alleges that,in march,cvb restructured million of garrett loans by providing million in a second mortgage and million in a loan,for which it obtained security interests in at least eleven parcels of property,at least two of which already had tax liens.additionally,it alleges that cvb provided garrett with million in refinancing on september.the fact that cvb gave garrett additional loans in,even if some later turned out to be unwise,does not show that cvb had a basis for serious doubts about garrett ability to repay in november if anything,it points to the contrary.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of jacksonville claims based on the november 
the k and the may,q 
by late december,garrett was again delinquent on its loan payments to cvb and had no liquidity to meet its ongoing obligations.the sac alleges that garrett told cvb in early january that unless modifications to loan terms were made,garrett could not meet its obligations and might file for bankruptcy.
