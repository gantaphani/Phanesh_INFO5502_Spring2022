the state labor law enforcement labor and workforce development agency lwda and its constituent departments and authorized to assess and collect civil penalties for specified violations of the labor code committed by an employer,authorizing labor commissioner to recover civil penalties as part of a hearing or civil action to recover unpaid wages and penalties for violations of,and with a stated goal of improving enforcement of existing labor code obligations,the legislature adopted the labor code private attorneys general act of act et,permitting,as an alternative,an aggrieved employee to initiate a private civil action on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former employees to recover civil penalties if the lwda does not do so.the penalties collected in these private civil actions are to be distributed percent to the state and percent to the aggrieved employee.before an employee may file an action seeking to recover civil penalties for violations of any of the labor code provisions enumerated in section,however,he or she must comply with the act administrative procedures as set forth in section,subdivision a,which include providing notice to the lwda and the employer and waiting a prescribed period of time to permit the lwda to investigate and to decide whether to cite the employer for the alleged violations.
in this case aggrieved employees,on behalf of themselves individually and as putative class representatives,filed a action against their former employer seeking,among other remedies,civil penalties for violations of several of the labor code provisions specified in section.the employees did not allege they had satisfied the act notice and exhaustion requirements before initiating their lawsuit and their operative complaint does not mention the act,let alone request remedies under it.can this putative class action complaint survive a demurrer despite plaintiffs failure to plead compliance with section,subdivision a administrative prerequisites to filing suit the trial court held it could.we agree,albeit for a different reason,but only in part.
section,subdivision a notice and exhaustion requirements broadly apply to employee actions seeking civil penalties that may be assessed by the lwda for any alleged violation of dozens of labor code provisions enumerated in section.nothing in the statute exempts an aggrieved employee whose complaint avoids any reference to the act or seeks remedies in addition to civil penalties from complying with section,subdivision a.accordingly,caliber demurrer should have been sustained without leave to amend as to the causes of action seeking only civil penalties the ninth,eleventh and twelfth causes of action on the ground plaintiffs failed to plead compliance with section,subdivision a.as to those causes of action seeking civil penalties as well as unpaid wages and statutory penalties payable to the employee the first,third and fourth causes of action,the demurrer was properly overruled because only those portions of the causes of action seeking civil penalties are objectionable based on plaintiffs failure to plead compliance with section,subdivision a.nevertheless,because plaintiffs can not pursue civil penalties absent compliance with section,subdivision a,the portions of the first,third and fourth causes of action seeking civil penalties are ordered stricken.finally,the demurrer also was properly overruled as to the second,fifth through eighth and tenth causes of action,which do not seek civil penalties at all,and as to the thirteenth cause of action under business and professions code section section.
factual and procedural background 
hector herrera,carlino giordano,shawn sommer and michael kolenda collectively plaintiffs are all former employees of caliber bodyworks,doing business as caliber collision centers.they filed a complaint for violations against caliber bodyworks,and corporate officers matthew ohrnstein and daniel pettigrew collectively caliber on behalf of themselves individually and as putative class representatives,alleging caliber is failing to properly compensate its employees in violation of numerous provisions of the labor code and,as a result,committing unlawful and unfair business practices under section 
specifically,plaintiffs allege caliber violated the labor code by failing to comply with the state requirement first cause of action indemnify employees for losses incurred in the direct consequence of the discharge of their duties and properly itemize deductions from wages second cause of action compensate for overtime and all hours worked third and fourth causes of action pay earned wages to former employees upon discharge fifth cause of action provide required meal and rest periods sixth and seventh causes of action properly compensate employees for working split shifts eighth cause of action and maintain required employee time records ninth cause of action.in the tenth cause of action plaintiffs seek penalties and in the eleventh and twelfth causes of action civil penalties for violations alleged in earlier counts.in the thirteenth cause of action plaintiffs allege caliber violations constitute unlawful and unfair business practices under section and seek equitable relief.
caliber demurred to the complaint on the ground the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the matter because plaintiffs had failed to plead compliance with the administrative prerequisites to filing suit contained in section,subdivision a.according to caliber,plaintiffs had an obligation to provide notice to the lwda and caliber and wait the prescribed time period for a response before filing suit because the first causes of action in the first amended complaint seek penalties for alleged violations of labor code provisions in section and the thirteenth cause of action under section is expressly premised on some of the same violations.
the trial court overruled the demurrer,finding the act expressly preserves an employee right to pursue claims under existing state and federal law,either separately or concurrently with a suit under the act,and neither the language of section,nor its legislative history,clearly required notice to the lwda for claims based on statutes enumerated in section that had authorized a private cause of action prior to the effective date of the act.
after caliber petitioned this court for a writ of mandate compelling the trial court to vacate its order,we issued an order to show cause why the requested relief should not be granted 
contentions 
caliber contends plaintiffs failure to plead compliance with the notice and exhaustion prerequisites to filing suit in section,subdivision a,is fatal to all causes of action in the first amended complaint and,therefore,the trial court should have sustained its demurrer.

the labor code private attorneys general act of 
responding to a shortage of state funds and staffing to enforce state labor laws,the legislature adopted the act in,effective january,to prescribe a civil penalty for existing labor code sections for which no civil penalty has otherwise been established and to allow aggrieved employees,defined as any person who was employed by the alleged violator and against whom one or more of the alleged violations was committed,to bring a civil action to collect civil penalties for labor code violations previously only available in enforcement actions initiated by the state labor law enforcement agencies former,subds.a,c e,stats,ch.as explained at pages to of the june,analysis by the assembly committee on the judiciary on senate bill reg.sess,as amended may,s ome labor code provisions allow for private actions for money damages,including attorneys fees e mployers are also subject to civil penalties and criminal prosecution for some labor code violations.thus,the primary change effected by this bill would be to add the specified civil penalties to private actions for violations of the labor code.the assembly analysis also noted,generally,civil penalties are recoverable only by prosecutors,not by private litigants,and the monies are paid directly to the government.however,recovery of civil penalties by private litigants does have precedent in the law in this bill,allowing private recovery of civil penalties as opposed to statutory damages would allow the penalty to be dedicated in part to public use to the general fund and the lwda instead of being awarded entirely to a private plaintiff.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess,as amended may.
the act was amended shortly after its effective date,as of august,to,among other things,require exhaustion of administrative procedures before an action may be filed to allow the lwda the initial opportunity to investigate and cite employers for labor code violations according to its legislative history,the amendment was the result of an agreement reached between the lwda,business and labor representatives and improves the act by allowing the lwda to act first on more serious violations such as wage and hour violations and give employers an opportunity to cure less serious violations.rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july.
as amended the act provides,notwithstanding any other provision of law,any provision of the labor code that provides for a civil penalty to be assessed and collected by the lwda or any of its departments,divisions,commissions,boards,agencies,or employees,for a violation of this code,may,as an alternative,be recovered through a civil action brought by an aggrieved employee on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former employees pursuant to the procedures specified in section,subd.a.for violations of all provisions of the labor code except those for which a civil penalty is specifically provided,the act establishes a default penalty and a private right of action for an aggrieved employee to bring a civil action to enforce those provisions,subject to the procedures in section,subds.f g.nothing in the act limit s an employee right to pursue or recover other remedies available under state or federal law,either separately or concurrently with an action taken under this part,subd.g.
section,subdivision a,provides the administrative procedures that must be followed before an aggrieved employee may file a civil action to recover civil penalties under section for violations of any of the labor code provisions identified in section a civil action by an aggrieved employee pursuant to subdivision a or f of section alleging a violation of any provision listed in section shall commence only after the following requirements have been met the aggrieved employee or representative shall give written notice by certified mail to the lwda and the employer of the specific provision of this code alleged to have been violated,including the facts and theories to support the alleged violation,subd.a.within calendar days of that notice,the lwda must notify the employer and the aggrieved employee or representative whether it intends to investigate the alleged violation,subd.a a.if the lwda notifies the aggrieved employee it does not intend to investigate,or fails to give notice within the prescribed time period,the aggrieved employee may commence a civil action under section.ibid.if the lwda chooses to investigate,it has an additional days to do so and issue any appropriate citation if,after investigation,the lwda provides notice that no citation will issue or fails to give timely or any notification,the aggrieved employee may then file suit,subd.a b.
section,subdivision a administrative procedures apply to actions to recover civil penalties for alleged violations of the dozens of labor code provisions specifically identified in section.in particular,they apply to civil penalties that may be assessed and collected for alleged violations of sections wages upon discharge statutory penalties for failure to timely make discharge payments duty to provide itemized statements mandated meal and rest periods overtime compensation duty to maintain employment records minimum wage maximum hours of work and indemnification for employee expenses and losses in discharging duties.
the lwda has the initial right to prosecute and collect civil penalties for alleged labor code violations no action may be brought under section by an aggrieved employee if the lwda or any of its departments,divisions,commissions,boards,agencies,or employees,on the same facts and theories,cites a person within the timeframes set forth in section for a violation of the same section or sections of the labor code under which the aggrieved employee is attempting to recover a civil penalty on behalf of himself or herself or others or initiates a proceeding pursuant to section with the assistance of the labor commissioner,subd.h.
portions of plaintiffs first amended complaint seek civil penalties subject to the act notice and exhaustion requirements 
plaintiffs contend the act administrative prerequisites to filing suit do not apply in this case because their putative class action does not seek civil penalties,include claims or make any allegations whatsoever under the act.according to plaintiffs,nothing in the act modifies or restricts the right of an employee to remedy violations of the labor code through a class action lawsuit against his or her employer when the employee is not suing under the act itself.caliber,on the other hand,argues that the entire complaint must be dismissed because each of plaintiffs causes of action seeks penalties for violations of statutes listed in section.application of the act to plaintiffs first amended complaint is not as simple as either side maintains.
not all statutory penalties are civil penalties covered by the act 
caliber is correct that each of plaintiffs causes of action under the labor code,save only the eighth cause of action,which requests only unpaid wages for alleged violation of compensation rules,seeks recovery of penalties for caliber alleged violations of labor code provisions enumerated in section.however,in both its demurrer and its petition for writ of mandate,caliber fails to distinguish between a request for statutory penalties provided by the labor code for employer violations,which were recoverable directly by employees well before the act became part of the labor code,and a demand for civil penalties,previously enforceable only by the state labor law enforcement agencies.an example of the former is section,which obligates an employer that willfully fails to pay wages due an employee who is discharged or quits to pay the employee,in addition to the unpaid wages,a penalty equal to the employee daily wages for each day,not exceeding days,that the wages are unpaid see,mamika barca th,d a proper reading of section mandates a penalty equivalent to the employee daily wages for each day he or she remained unpaid up to a total of days.examples of the latter are section,which provides,in addition to any other penalty that may be assessed,an employer that unlawfully withholds wages in violation of certain specified provisions of the labor code is subject to a civil penalty in an enforcement action initiated by the labor commissioner in the sum of per employee for the initial violation and per employee for subsequent or willful violations and section,which authorizes the labor commissioner to impose a civil penalty in an amount not exceeding days pay as waiting time under the terms of section.
in sum,an employer is potentially liable for unpaid wages and interest,statutory penalties and civil penalties for many violations of labor code provisions.for example,an employee not fully paid upon discharge or layoff as required by section one of the labor code provisions identified in section may be entitled to recover not only his or her unpaid wages but also the statutory penalty provided by section another provision listed in section and the civil penalty provided by section.an action seeking the first two categories of damages,although requesting statutory penalties,is not subject to the act notice and exhaustion requirements an action seeking the third category of recoverable damages,whether alone or in combination with a prayer for other remedies,is to be subject to the act,the employee cause of action must allege a violation of one of the provisions listed in section,subd.a and seek recovery of a civil penalty assessable by the lwda,subds.a f.
plaintiffs complaint includes requests for civil penalties 
as we read the first amended complaint,the causes of action alleged fall into four,analytically distinct categories causes of action seeking only civil penalties for violations of labor code provisions specified in section hybrid causes of action seeking unpaid wages and statutory penalties,as well as civil penalties for violations of labor code provisions specified in section causes of action seeking only unpaid wages or statutory penalties or both and a section cause of action seeking equitable relief.
the first category,causes of action seeking only civil penalties,includes the ninth,eleventh and twelfth causes of action.the ninth cause of action alleges caliber violated section,one of the provisions specified in section,by failing to properly maintain employee records and seeks a civil penalty under section for that violation the eleventh cause of action,entitled simply penalties,alleges violations of section,which requires payment of wages on regular paydays and which is identified in section,and seeks civil penalties as provided in section for violations of section.finally,the twelfth cause of action,expressly entitled civil penalties,seeks civil penalties under section for caliber alleged violations of section also included in section,requiring meal periods of specified intervals 
the second category,hybrid causes of action seeking unpaid wages,statutory penalties and civil penalties,includes the first,third and fourth causes of action.the first cause of action alleges violations of section,which makes unlawful the payment of a wage less than the minimum wage and which is included in section,and seeks in paragraph of the first amended complaint unpaid wages and penalties,including not only statutory penalties payable directly to the employee but also the civil penalties authorized by section.the third cause of action alleges failure to pay overtime compensation in violation of section,also among the provisions listed in section,and seeks in paragraph unpaid wages and penalties,again including the civil penalties authorized by section.finally,the fourth cause of action alleges failure to compensate for all hours worked also in violation of section and seeks in paragraph unpaid wages and penalties,including civil penalties pursuant to section.
the third category,causes of action seeking only unpaid wages or statutory penalties or both,consists of the second,fifth through eighth and tenth causes of action.in the second cause of action plaintiffs allege violations of section,which requires an employer to indemnify its employee for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties.section is included in section.however,although plaintiffs seek in paragraph unpaid wages and penalties,unlike their allegations in the first,third and fourth causes of action discussed in the preceding paragraph,plaintiffs include no request for relief under section or any other labor code provision for civil penalties.similarly,the fifth cause of action alleges violations of section,which requires an employer to pay an employee all earned wages on the employee termination date,and seeks payment of the statutory penalty provided in section for willful violations of section,but does not seek a civil penalty under section,or any other provision for civil penalties assessable by the lwda.the sixth and seventh causes of action allege caliber violated industrial welfare commission iwc wage orders regarding meal and rest periods and seek recovery of the statutory penalties provided in section for those violations but do not include either an express request for civil penalties or citation to any provision of the labor code imposing civil penalties.the eighth cause of action,which alleges caliber failed to comply with iwc wage orders requiring employers to compensate an employee who works a split shift a work schedule interrupted by,periods established by the employer one hour at the minimum wage for each day the employee worked a split shift.the eighth cause of action seeks only the unpaid wages,not statutory or civil penalties.the tenth cause of action,entitled penalties,repeats the allegations of the fifth cause of action regarding violations of section,adds an alleged violation of section,which specifies the required time for payment of wages to an employee not having a written contract for a definite period who quits his or her employment,and,as in the fifth cause of action,seeks the statutory penalty provided by section for willful violations but does not request imposition of any civil penalty.
the fourth and final category is the section cause of action the thirteenth cause of action,which alleges caliber labor code violations,as specified in the underlying causes of action,constitute unfair and unlawful business practices for which plaintiffs are entitled to equitable relief.
caliber demurrer to the first amended complaint should have been sustained without leave to amend as to the causes of action seeking only civil penalties but was properly overruled as to the other causes of action 
a.the first category causes of action seeking only civil penalties 
plaintiffs characterization of their first amended complaint notwithstanding,the first category of causes of action seeking only civil penalties the ninth,eleventh and twelfth causes of action falls squarely within the act.aggrieved employees,on behalf of themselves and other current and former employees of caliber,are pursuing causes of action in a lawsuit to recover civil penalties that could otherwise be assessed and collected by the lwda,subd.a.according to the act explicit language,such claims must be brought pursuant to the procedures specified in section,subd.a.
interpreting this statutory framework according to its plain language lennane franchise tax bd.cal th,d,ralphs grocery superior court,supra,th at,d,plaintiffs were required to comply with section,subdivision a administrative procedures before pursuing causes of action for civil penalties based on violations of labor code provisions specified in section.their failure to plead compliance as to the causes of action seeking only civil penalties is fatal to those claims.see,subd.a civil action by an aggrieved employee pursuant to subdivision a or f of section alleging a violation of any provision listed in section shall commence only after the following requirements have been met italics added see also weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group,prelawsuit notice requirement is an essential element of the cause of action,and must be affirmatively alleged in the complaint and proved at trial.the absence of any reference to the act in plaintiffs first amended complaint does not absolve them of their duty to comply with the administrative prerequisites to filing suit.pitman city of oakland d.plaintiff can not,by artful drafting of the complaint,avoid the clear intent of the statute.
plaintiffs contend the act does no more than create a private right of action for employees to enforce labor code provisions that did not previously contain such a right and impose civil penalties under the default provision in section,subdivision f,for violations that did not previously provide for such penalties and argue the act does not apply in this case because they are not attempting to invoke either aspect of the act.but by its express terms the act applies when an aggrieved employee seeks civil penalties for a violation of any provision of the labor code that provides for a civil penalty to be assessed and collected by the state,subd.a.the act requirements,including its administrative prerequisites to filing suit in section,subdivision a,therefore,are triggered when an aggrieved employee seeks civil penalties for violation of a labor code provision that previously provided for recovery of a civil penalty by the labor commissioner,including those that existed for years prior to the act effective date.indeed,the expansive list of labor code provisions in section to which the act administrative procedures are applicable belies plaintiffs restrictive reading of the act section includes many labor code provisions that,prior to the act,contained a private right of action.including,for example.accordingly,notwithstanding plaintiffs observation that wage and hour disputes and others in the same general class routinely proceed as class actions prince cls transportation,th,d,plaintiffs seeking civil penalties recoverable by the state in such suits for violations of any labor code provision specified in section must now plead compliance with section,subdivision a administrative procedures 
in sum,because plaintiffs failed to plead compliance with the act notice and exhaustion requirements in section,subdivision a,they are not entitled to pursue their causes of action seeking only civil penalties.accordingly,the trial court should have sustained caliber demurrer to plaintiffs ninth,eleventh and twelfth causes of action 
b.the second category hybrid causes of action seeking both civil penalties and unpaid wages 
in addition to demanding unpaid wages and statutory penalties,plaintiffs first,third and fourth causes of action seek civil penalties for alleged violations of labor code provisions specified in section.under the plain language of the act,plaintiffs can not pursue civil penalties for those violations without complying with the notice and exhaustion requirements of section,subdivision a.
plaintiffs attempt to avoid application of the act to these hybrid causes of action based on the last sentence of section,subdivision g,which provides,nothing in th e act shall operate to limit an employee right to pursue or recover other remedies available under state or federal law,either separately or concurrently with an action taken under th e act.according to plaintiffs,because they seek other remedies,such as unpaid wages and statutory penalties,they are pursuing an action separately from the act and can do so without complying with section,subdivision a administrative procedures.
plaintiffs correctly note these three causes of action seek other remedies in additional to civil penalties,which is permissible under section,subdivision g.nevertheless,to the extent they seek civil penalties,compliance with the notice and exhaustion requirements of the act is mandatory.allowing plaintiffs in cases to circumvent the act merely because they seek other remedies in addition to civil penalties would vitiate the legislature express intent that the lwda have the initial right to investigate and cite an employer for labor code violations see,subd.h,see also stats,ch,act ensur es that state labor law enforcement agencies enforcement actions have primacy over any private enforcement efforts undertaken pursuant to this act rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july,purpose of amendment to act to allow the lwda to act first on more serious violations such as wage and hour violations and would give no effect to the amendment to the act requiring section,subdivision a administrative procedures be followed before an aggrieved employee can pursue a civil action for civil penalties for violations of labor code provisions specified in section.stafford realty bond service cal d,legislature presumed not to have engaged in idle acts in amending statute rather every statute should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect see also,fair employment housing com.cal d,statutes are to be given a reasonable and commonsense interpretation consistent with the apparent legislative purpose and intent and which,when applied,will result in wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity.citation.flannery prentice cal th,d,courts avoid any construction of a statute that will produce absurd consequences.
although the fact plaintiffs seek unpaid wages and statutory penalties as well as civil penalties does not exempt them from compliance with section,subdivision a administrative procedures,only the portions of the hybrid causes of action seeking civil penalties are objectionable.a demurrer is not the appropriate vehicle to challenge a portion of a cause of action demanding an improper remedy.kong city of hawaiian gardens redevelopment agency th,d a demurrer can not rightfully be sustained to part of a cause of action or to a particular type of damage or remedy ph ii,superior court th,d ph ii demurrer does not lie to a portion of a cause of action grieves superior court d.petitioners punitive damage allegations not subject to real parties demurrers see also weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial,supra,a general demurrer challenges only the sufficiency of the cause of action pleaded,and must be overruled if any valid cause of action is pleaded a demand for improper relief does not vitiate an otherwise valid cause of action.citations.thus,caliber demurrer to plaintiffs first,third and fourth causes of action was properly overruled.
the appropriate procedural device for challenging a portion of a cause of action seeking an improper remedy is a motion to strike.as stated by the court in ph ii,we recognize that in some cases a portion of a cause of action will be substantively defective on the face of the compliant.although a defendant may not demur to that portion,in such cases,the defendant should not have to suffer discovery we conclude that when a substantive defect is clear from the face of a complaint,such as a violation of the applicable statute of limitations or a purported claim of right which is legally invalid,a defendant may attack that portion of the cause of action by filing a motion to strike.citation.ph ii,supra,th at,d see also grieves superior court,supra,d at.adequacy of punitive damage allegations could have been tested by motion to strike.
