the class action fairness act of cafa confers jurisdiction on federal courts over certain class actions in which any defendant and any class member are citizens of different states.d.cafa further enables any defendant to remove a qualifying class action to federal court.id.b.under cafa local controversy exception,however,a federal court must decline jurisdiction if certain conditions are met,including that a of the members of the putative class and at least one significant defendant are from the state in which the class action was originally filed.d a.this appeal addresses,as issues of first impression,the meaning of two provisions within cafa local controversy exception.
plaintiffs in this case originally filed their class action complaint in the superior court of new jersey,monmouth county,against six automobile insurance providers.after the case was removed to the united states district court for the district of new jersey pursuant to cafa,the district court granted plaintiffs motion to remand based on cafa local controversy exception,d a.government employees insurance company geico,allstate new jersey insurance company allstate nj,and liberty mutual fire insurance company liberty collectively,the defendants,petitioned for permission to appeal under c.the defendants challenge the district court interpretation of two provisions in cafa local controversy,the significant basis provision,d a i ii bb,and the principal injuries provision,d a i iii.for the reasons set forth below,we reject defendants interpretations of these provisions.nevertheless,we will vacate in part the judgment of the district court and remand the case for the district court to reconsider its significant basis analysis,which erroneously relied on generic market share numbers instead of focusing on the conduct alleged in the complaint.
prior to congress enactment of cafa in,many class actions were excluded from federal courts even if those actions implicated matters of national importance affecting millions of parties from many different states.this was the result of the rule,which requires that no plaintiff be a citizen of the same state as any defendant and the rule against aggregating claims,which requires that each plaintiff individually seek at least the jurisdictional amount in controversy 
one purpose of cafa was to provide for f ederal court consideration of interstate cases of national importance under diversity jurisdiction.cafa,stat.pursuant to cafa,federal courts have jurisdiction over class actions in which the amount in controversy exceeds in the aggregate,d,any class member and any defendant are citizens of different states,d a,and there are at least members in the putative class,d b.
cafa also contains two mandatory exceptions from federal jurisdiction,d a b.these two exceptions require a district court to decline jurisdiction when the controversy is uniquely local and does not reach into multiple states.subsection a,the local controversy exception,may apply when at least one significant defendant and more than of the members of the putative classes are local.subsection b,the exception,may apply when the primary defendants and at least of the members of the putative classes are local.specifically,d provides 
a district court shall decline to exercise jurisdiction under paragraph 
a i over a class action in which 
i greater than of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate are citizens of the state in which the action was originally filed 
ii at least defendant is a defendant 
aa from whom significant relief is sought by members of the plaintiff class 
bb whose alleged conduct forms a significant basis for the claims asserted by the proposed plaintiff class and 
cc who is a citizen of the state in which the action was originally filed and 
iii principal injuries resulting from the alleged conduct or any related conduct of each defendant were incurred in the state in which the action was originally filed and 
ii during the period preceding the filing of that class action,no other class action has been filed asserting the same or similar factual allegations against any of the defendants on behalf of the same persons or 
b or more of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate,and the primary defendants,are citizens of the state in which the action was originally filed.
in this appeal,we consider two questions first,whether the significant basis provision,d a i ii bb,requires that every class member must assert a claim against the local defendant and second,whether the principal injuries provision,d a i iii,requires that principal injuries resulting from the alleged conduct and any related conduct of each defendant must be incurred in the state in which the action was originally filed.no other court of appeals has yet considered these two questions.
on november,nine representative plaintiffs plaintiffs filed a class action complaint against six insurance companies in the superior court of new jersey.plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed three new jersey insurers in july so that,presently,only allstate nj,geico,and liberty remain in the action.allstate nj is a new jersey citizen,but geico and liberty are not 
plaintiffs allege that they purchased automobile insurance from defendants and plead three causes of action breach of contract breach of an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing and violation of the new jersey consumer fraud act,stat.ann.et.the crux of plaintiffs claims is that an automobile loses value if it is damaged in an accident,notwithstanding its complete repair.this loss in value is known in the insurance business as diminished value.plaintiffs allege that defendants do not pay their insureds for diminished value insurance claims.they assert that defendants either expressly exclude diminished value from coverage,or their insurance policies are silent as to such coverage.in any event,plaintiffs contend that defendants practices violate new jersey law and the insurance contracts.
in addition to compensatory and punitive damages,plaintiffs seek reformation of the insurance contracts to establish coverage and an injunction that would compel defendants to cover diminished value claims require defendants to notify their insureds of the coverage and claims processing procedures and require defendants to adhere to these contractual obligations in the future.
the complaint also seeks class action status.without specifying the type of class action plaintiffs seek to maintain,their complaint includes language that might support a b,b,or b class action.see fed.civ.pro.b.plaintiffs define the putative equitable relief class to include all persons currently insured by defendants under a policy issued in new jersey and the damages to include all persons currently or previously insured by defendants and who submitted,at any time within six years prior to the complaint,a claim for damage and who did not receive compensation for diminished value.significantly,in defendants view,each class member would assert claims against only one defendant that underwrote the class member automobile insurance.thus,the putative class and would actually be comprised of three separate and distinct groups of members geico insureds liberty insureds and allstate nj insureds.
after geico timely removed the action to the district court pursuant to cafa,d and,plaintiffs filed a motion to remand based on cafa local controversy exception,d a.on september,the district court determined that the local controversy exception applied and remanded the action to the superior court of new jersey.defendants timely petitioned for review of the remand order.c.we granted their petitions 
we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to c and review issues of subject matter jurisdiction and statutory interpretation de novo.morgan gay,cir citing kia motors,cir.
the parties do not dispute cafa threshold jurisdictional requirements we must nevertheless satisfy ourselves that federal subject matter jurisdiction exists in the first instance.see,at.we require the party seeking to remove to federal court to demonstrate federal jurisdiction.frederico home depot,cir see also morgan,at under cafa,the party seeking to remove the case to federal court bears the burden to establish that the amount in controversy is satisfied.in removal cases,we begin evaluating jurisdiction by reviewing the allegations in the complaint and in the notice of removal.frederico,at.
geico notice of removal indicates geico and plaintiffs are from different states maryland and new jersey,respectively,and that the complaint seeks class action status for a class comprising thousands of individuals.the notice of removal also asserts that the amount in controversy exceeds,exclusive of interest and costs.although the complaint does not quantify the relief plaintiffs seek,it enumerates damages including compensatory damages and interest,punitive damages in accordance with the new jersey punitive damages act,attorney fees,and the costs of suit,in addition to injunctive relief.plaintiffs do not dispute that the amount in controversy exceeds.
in frederico,we reiterated that when relevant facts are not in dispute or findings have been made,the test applies.id.under the test,federal jurisdiction exists unless it appears,to a legal certainty,that the plaintiff was never entitled to recover the jurisdictional amount.see id.plaintiffs complaint purports to implicate hundreds of thousands of insurance policies issued to consumers in new jersey by each defendant,individually.given the categories of damages damages,in particular,which may amount to as much as the greater of five times compensatory damages or we are unable to conclude to a legal certainty that plaintiffs are not entitled to recover the jurisdictional amount.therefore,jurisdiction exists under d.
notwithstanding jurisdiction under d,the district court decided to remand the action based on the local controversy exception,d a.defendants do not dispute that plaintiffs meet several requirements of this exception.they do not contest that more than of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate are citizens of new jersey,as required by d a i i.defendants also do not dispute that during the period preceding the filing of the action,no other class action has been filed asserting the same or similar factual allegations against any of the defendants on behalf of the same persons,in accord with d a ii.rather,the argument focuses on whether the significant basis provision,d a i ii bb,and principal injuries provision,d a i iii,are met.
for the significant basis provision to apply,a local defendant whose alleged conduct forms a significant basis for the claims asserted by the proposed plaintiff class must be named.d a i ii bb.the principal injuries provision requires that principal injuries resulting from the alleged conduct or any related conduct of each defendant were incurred in the state in which the action was originally filed.d a i iii.the district court determined these requirements were satisfied.it rejected defendants interpretation of each provision.in its analysis,however,the district court did not focus only on the defendants presently in the action.it also considered three new jersey insurers which were named in the original complaint but subsequently dismissed.the district court erred in that regard.as explained below,the local controversy exception applies only to the defendants remaining in an action.
it is true that under a rule,federal diversity jurisdiction is generally determined based on the circumstances prevailing at the time the suit was filed.see mullan torrance,wheat.marshall,j urisdiction of the court depends upon the state of things at the time of the action brought,and that,after vesting,it can not be ousted by subsequent events.this rule represents a policy decision that the sufficiency of jurisdiction should be determined once and for all at the threshold and if found to be present then should continue until final disposition of the action.wright,miller,cooper,federal practice and procedure internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the rule serves to increase certainty and minimize repeated challenges to federal jurisdiction that might undermine efficiency.id.
but the rule admits exceptions in cases where the parties change,in contrast to cases in which the circumstances attendant to those parties change.see grupo dataflux atlas global group,d recognizing exceptions to the rule in cases where parties change see also kabakjian united states,cir same.class actions,of course,often involve more parties than traditional bipolar litigation and thus a greater likelihood that some parties will change.in fact,d accounts for this aspect of class actions by explicitly providing that class member citizenship may be determined even after the 
citizenship of the members of the proposed plaintiff classes shall be determined for purposes of paragraphs through as of the date of the filing of the complaint or amended complaint,or,if the case stated by the initial pleading is not subject to federal jurisdiction,as of the date of service by plaintiffs of an amended pleading,motion or other paper,indicating the existence of federal jurisdiction.
in a similar vein,we conclude that the local controversy exception requires consideration of the defendants presently in the action.indeed,a key condition of the local controversy exception is the presence in the action of at least one significant local defendant.applying the exception when no local defendant remains in the action,as could occur under the rule,would not comport with the exception focus on discerning local controversies based,in part,on the presence of a significant local defendant.
in the instant case,three of the initial defendants,all local,were dismissed.currently,three defendants remain in the action geico,liberty,and allstate nj.of these,only allstate nj is a possible significant local defendant,and it was substituted into the action to replace a jersey defendant only after the complaint had been filed.also,plaintiffs have stipulated that they will file an amended complaint to account for the changed parties,once jurisdiction is resolved and the proper forum is known.
yet in analyzing the significant basis provision,the district court identified one of the dismissed defendants,new jersey manufacturers njm,as the local defendant the district court focus on njm was erroneous because njm was no longer in the action.application of the local controversy exception must focus on defendants which remain in the action.
we also conclude that the district court correctly assigned to plaintiffs the burden of establishing that the local controversy exception applies.although a question of first impression in this court,other courts of appeals have uniformly concluded that once cafa jurisdiction has been established,the burden shifts to the party objecting to federal jurisdiction to show that the local controversy exception should apply.see serrano connect,cir o nce federal jurisdiction has been established under d,the objecting party bears the burden of proof as to the applicability of any express statutory exception under d a and b.hart fedex ground package,cir same frazier pioneer ams.llc,cir same evans walter,cir same.
as explained in hart and serrano,this approach is justified by analogy to practice under the removal statute,a.serrano,at hart,at.in,the removal statute was amended to its present form,and now states except as otherwise expressly provided by act of congress,any civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction,may be removed by the defendant or the defendants a emphasis added.considering this statute,the supreme court stated that s ince,therefore,there has been no question that whenever the subject matter of an action qualifies it for removal,the burden is on a plaintiff to find an express exception.breuer jim concrete of brevard,d.
under breuer,the a plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating an exception to from the structure of a statute providing for removability absent an express exception.hart and serrano extrapolated from breuer the rule that the party objecting to cafa jurisdiction has the burden of establishing an exception,once the conditions exist under which t he district courts shall have original jurisdiction pursuant to d.in the view of hart and serrano,the structure of d mirrors that of a,with the exceptions of d d being express exceptions.see,hart,at it is reasonable to understand these as two express exceptions to cafa normal jurisdictional rule,as the supreme court used that term in breuer.hart explained,t he case might be different if congress had put the and local controversy rules directly into the jurisdictional section of the statute,d,but it did not.id.although the analogy to removal is not perfect,breuer reasoning persuades us to join our sister circuits in concluding that the party seeking remand has the burden of showing that the local controversy exception applies.
we now turn to the significant basis provision.this provision requires that the class action include at least one local defendant whose alleged conduct forms a significant basis for the claims asserted by the proposed plaintiff class.d a i ii bb.geico and allstate nj argue that,under this provision,every member of the proposed plaintiff class must assert a claim against the local defendant.because only allstate nj insureds can assert claims against allstate only local defendant presently in the members of the proposed plaintiff class would not assert claims against the local defendant in this case.consequently,were we to adopt defendants interpretation,plaintiffs could not satisfy the significant basis provision.
geico and allstate nj make a textual argument to support their interpretation.they explain that,based on the language of the provision,the proposed plaintiff class must assert claims against the local defendant.because the term class is defined as all of the class members in a class action,d a,the phrase the proposed plaintiff class refers to all the members of the proposed plaintiff class.
geico and allstate nj further contrast cafa use of the term class,as opposed to members,to emphasize that cafa uses different terms to distinguish between all class members and a subset of those class members.for example,a provision in the local controversy exception requires that the class action include at least one local defendant from whom significant relief is sought by members of the plaintiff class.d a i ii aa emphasis added.similarly,the exception provides an exception to cafa jurisdiction when or more of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate,and the primary defendants,are citizens of the state in which the action was originally filed.d b emphasis added.according to geico and allstate nj,these textual differences confirm that cafa deliberately referenced the entire proposed plaintiff class,rather than a subset of that class,in the significant basis provision.digiacomo teamsters pension trust fund of philadelphia,cir i t is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely when it includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.defendants further observe that the significant basis provision does not say that the local defendant conduct should be a basis for some claims asserted by members of the proposed plaintiff class it says the local defendant conduct should form a significant basis of the claims asserted by the proposed plaintiff class.thus,in their view,the provision requires every class member to assert a claim against the local defendant.the district court rejected defendants interpretation.
in interpreting a statute,the court looks first to the statute plain meaning and,if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,the inquiry comes to an end.bank germain,d rosenberg xm ventures,cir.when the statutory language is not clear on its face,the statute must be construed to give effect,if possible,to every word and clause.see cooper,aviall,d.in addition,when the plain meaning can not be derived,the provision at issue must be viewed in the context of the statute as a whole.see dolan postal,d.
we agree with geico and allstate nj that the claims asserted by the proposed plaintiff class means the claims asserted by all the class members in the action.the term class plainly refers to all the members of the proposed plaintiff class.additionally,the definite article preceding the term claims indicates that the claims asserted means all the claims asserted.see frazier,cir determining that,in d a,the presence of the definite article in the primary defendants means the clause refers to all the primary defendants.thus,we agree that the significant basis provision requires at least one local defendant whose alleged conduct forms a significant basis for all the claims asserted in the action.
but this conclusion does not imply that the significant basis provision requires every member of the proposed plaintiff class to assert a claim against the local the provision certainly does not state such a requirement.instead,it requires that at least local defendant is a defendant whose alleged conduct forms a significant basis for the claims asserted by the proposed plaintiff class.d a i ii emphasis added.the plain text of this provision relates the alleged conduct of the local defendant,on one hand,to all the claims asserted in the action,on the other.the provision does not require that the local defendant alleged conduct form a basis of each claim asserted it requires the alleged conduct to form a significant basis of all the claims asserted.while assessing the quantity of claims based on the local defendant alleged conduct may be useful to the analysis,the significant basis provision does not establish an absolute quantitative requirement.nor is it necessary to imply such a quantitative requirement to make sense of the provision,for a party conduct may form a significant basis of an entire set of claims even if some claims within the set are not based on that conduct.
in relating the local defendant alleged conduct to all the claims asserted in the action,the significant basis provision effectively calls for comparing the local defendant alleged conduct to the alleged conduct of all the defendants.indeed,all the claims asserted by the plaintiffs reflect the alleged conduct of all the defendants.if the local defendant alleged conduct is a significant part of the alleged conduct of all the defendants,then the significant basis provision is satisfied.whether this condition is met requires a substantive analysis comparing the local defendant alleged conduct to the alleged conduct of all the defendants.we therefore reject the interpretation proposed by geico and allstate nj 
although no other court of appeals has considered whether the significant basis provision requires every member of the plaintiff class to assert a claim against the local defendant,in evans walter industries,cir,the eleventh circuit had occasion to otherwise apply the provision.the reasoning in evans suggests that the eleventh circuit would not interpret the provision as geico and allstate nj propose.in that case,numerous defendants were accused of polluting the environment over many years.the eleventh circuit concluded that plaintiffs failed to show that the local defendant played a significant role in the alleged contamination,so the significant basis provision was not satisfied.id.at.the accused facilities of the local defendant had either ceased operations by or were not near the location of the class members and the other defendants,so that the evidence d id not indicate that a significant number or percentage of putative class members m ight have a claim against the local defendant,or indeed that any plaintiff ha d such a claim.id.thus,it appears that,in the view of the eleventh circuit,the significant basis provision could be satisfied even if not every member of the putative class had a claim against the local defendant,as long as a significant number or percentage of putative class members did have such a claim.our conclusion here is consistent with evans.
although the district court correctly declined to adopt defendants interpretation,its significant basis analysis is flawed.the district court anal
