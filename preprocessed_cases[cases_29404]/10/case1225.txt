a.the complaint

the other five causes of action are brought under california statutory and common law.doe and doe bring these claims on behalf of the putative of aol members who are california residents.they allege aol violated the following california statutes the california consumers legal remedies act clra which prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices resulting in the sale of goods or services the california customer records act which requires businesses to destroy customers records that are no longer to be maintained,and requires businesses to maintain security procedures to protect customers personal information california false advertising law and california unfair competition law which prohibits unfair,unlawful,and fraudulent business practices.these california plaintiffs also allege aol committed the tort of public disclosure of private facts under california common law.

we review a district court order enforcing a contractual forum selection clause and dismissing a case for improper venue for abuse of discretion.argueta banco mexicano,cir.where the interpretation of contractual language in a forum selection clause does not turn on the credibility of extrinsic evidence but on an application of the principles of contract interpretation,we review the district court interpretation de novo.hunt wesson foods,supreme oil,cir.
a motion to enforce a forum selection clause is treated as a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b pleadings need not be accepted as true,and facts outside the pleadings may be considered.argueta,at.
as a threshold matter,the parties dispute the meaning of the forum selection clause,specifically the phrase exclusive jurisdiction resides in the courts of virginia.aol claims the phrase courts of virginia refers to state and federal courts in virginia,while plaintiffs claim it refers to virginia state courts only.we agree with plaintiffs interpretation.
we apply federal law to the interpretation of the forum selection clause,gucci,cir.when we interpret a contract under federal law,we look for guidance to general principles for interpreting contracts.klamath water users protective ass patterson,cir.
contract terms are to be given their ordinary meaning,and when the terms of a contract are clear,the intent of the parties must be ascertained from the contract itself.whenever possible,the plain language of the contract should be considered first.id.internal citation omitted.we apply the primary rule of interpretation that the common or normal meaning of language will be given to the words of a contract unless circumstances show that in a particular case a special meaning should be attached to it.hunt wesson foods,at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.we read a written contract as a whole,and interpret each part with reference to the whole.klamath water users protective ass n,at.that the parties dispute a contract meaning does not render the contract ambiguous a contract is ambiguous if reasonable people could find its terms susceptible to more than one interpretation.id.
the district court,without discussion,interpreted the forum selection clause to refer to state and federal courts of virginia.we determine the meaning of the phrase courts of virginia de novo,hunt wesson foods,at,and look first to its plain meaning.we have not previously addressed the meaning of a forum selection clause designating the courts of,rather than in,a state.we hold that the forum selection clause at issue the courts of the state courts of virginia only it does not also refer to federal courts in virginia.
the clause use of the preposition of rather than in is determinative.black law dictionary defines of as a term denoting that from which anything proceeds indicating origin,source,descent,and the like black law dictionary ed.thus,courts of virginia refers to courts proceeding from,with their origin in,the state courts of virginia.federal district courts,in contrast,proceed from,and find their origin in,the federal government 
our interpretation finds support among opinions by our sister circuits who have addressed the meaning of forum selection clauses designating the courts of a of whom have interpreted such clauses to refer to the state courts of the designated state,and not also to the federal courts in the designated state.see am.soda,llp filter wastewater group,cir interpreting courts of the state of colorado to mean colorado state courts the clause refers to sovereignty rather than geography dixon tse int l,cir interpreting courts of texas,to mean texas state courts f ederal district courts may be in texas,but they are not of texas lfc lessors,pac.sewer maint,cir interpreting forum selection and choice of law clause stating the contract shall be interpreted according to the law,and in the courts,of the commonwealth of massachusetts to designate the state courts of massachusetts the word of as it appears in the phrase in question must have been intended to restrict the meaning of both law and courts to those that trace their origin to the state.
accordingly,we hold the plain meaning of the forum selection clause designation of the courts of virginia is the state courts of virginia it does not include federal district courts located in virginia 
having interpreted the aol forum selection clause to designate virginia state courts,we turn to the enforceability of the clause.
plaintiffs contend the forum selection clause so construed is unenforceable as a matter of federal law,because it violates california public policy against waivers of class action remedies and rights under the california consumers legal remedies act.aol,however,steadfastly has asserted the forum selection clause permits plaintiffs to maintain an action in federal court in virginia,where plaintiffs could pursue their consumer class action remedies.aol has raised no contention that the forum selection clause,construed to mean only virginia state courts,nevertheless is enforceable and does not violate california public policy.
we apply federal law to determine the enforceability of the forum selection clause,at.a forum selection clause is presumptively valid the party seeking to avoid a forum selection clause bears a heavy burden to establish a ground upon which we will conclude the clause is unenforceable.bremen zapata,d.under the directives of the supreme court in bremen,we will determine a forum selection clause is unenforceable if enforcement would contravene a strong public policy of the forum in which suit is brought,whether declared by statute or by judicial decision.id.at.emphasis added.
california has declared by judicial decision the same aol forum selection clause at issue here contravenes a strong public policy of applied to california residents who brought claims under california statutory consumer law in california state court.in america online,superior court of alameda county mendoza,th,d,mendoza,a california resident and member of aol,brought a putative class action on behalf of aol members in california state court,alleging violations of california state law,to wit the california consumers legal remedies act,the california unfair business practices act,and common law conversion and fraud.mendoza,d at.
aol moved to dismiss mendoza action based on its forum selection clause designating the courts of virginia.id.at.the state trial court denied aol motion,holding the forum selection clause was unenforceable because it diminished the rights of california consumers,and remedies available in virginia were not comparable to those in california id.at.
aol filed a petition for writ of mandamus.the california court of appeal denied the writ,thereby leaving in place the trial court denial of aol motion to dismiss.relevant to the instant appeal,the california court of appeal held the aol forum selection clause was unenforceable,because the clause violated california public policy on two grounds enforcement of the forum selection clause violated california public policy that strongly favors consumer class actions,because consumer class actions are not available in virginia state courts,id.at and enforcement of the forum selection clause violates the provision of the consumer legal remedies act clra,id.at,which states a ny waiver by a consumer of the provisions of this title is contrary to public policy and shall be unenforceable and void.cal.the state court of appeal held the forum selection clause,together with the choice of law provision,effect a waiver of statutory remedies provided by the clra in violation of the provision,as well as california strong public policy to protect consumers against unfair and deceptive business practices.mendoza,d at.
we agree with plaintiffs that mendoza is the kind of declaration by judicial decision contemplated by bremen.mendoza found a california public policy against consumer class action waivers and waivers of consumer rights under the clra that california public policy applies to california residents bringing class action claims under california consumer law.as to such california resident plaintiffs,mendoza holds california public policy is violated by forcing such plaintiffs to waive their rights to a class action and remedies under california consumer law.
accordingly,the forum selection clause in the instant member agreement is unenforceable as to california resident plaintiffs bringing class action claims under california consumer law 
reversed and remanded 
plaintiffs doe and have alleged sufficient facts to invoke california public policy.california courts have made clear that they will refuse to defer to the selected forum if to do so would substantially diminish the rights of california residents in a way that violates our state public policy.mendoza,th,d,emphasis added.in this case,plaintiffs,who allege that they were california residents at the time of the filing of the complaint,are bringing claims under california consumer protection statutes,while the defendant seeks to enforce the same aol contract by relying on the exact contract prov
