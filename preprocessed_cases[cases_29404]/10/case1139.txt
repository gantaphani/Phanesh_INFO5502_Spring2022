this appeal involves a putative class action by former students of a failed school who seek broad injunctive relief against the bank that originated their student loans and the loan servicer.the central issue is whether the district court should have compelled arbitration.we hold that this case does not fall under the narrow public injunction exception to the federal arbitration act we recognized in davis myers,cir,and remand with instructions to compel arbitration.

matthew kilgore and william fuller plaintiffs were ssh students,who each borrowed over from keybank.the oakland school failed before they could graduate.after the school demise,plaintiffs brought this putative class action suit against keybank and great lakes collectively,defendants in california superior court,seeking to enjoin defendants from reporting loan defaults to credit agencies and from enforcing notes against former students the gravamen of the complaint was that defendants had violated the california unfair competition law ucl,cal.bus,because the note and ssh contracts with students failed to include language specified in the federal trade commission holder rule.

plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by dismissing their third amended complaint,and defendants argue that the district court erred by refusing to compel arbitration.under the federal arbitration act,if defendants are correct,the district court should never have reached the merits of plaintiffs claims.see requiring stay of civil action during arbitration.therefore,we begin with whether the district court erred in declining to compel arbitration,a decision we review de novo.chalk t mobile usa,cir.
the federal arbitration act faa makes an agreement to arbitrate valid,irrevocable,and enforceable.the faa was intended to overcome an anachronistic judicial hostility to agreements to arbitrate,which american courts had borrowed from english common law,mitsubishi motors soler chrysler plymouth,d,that resulted in courts refusals to enforce agreements to arbitrate,allied bruce terminix dobson,d.recent opinions of the supreme court have given broad effect to arbitration agreements.see,marmet health care,brown,d per curiam upholding arbitration provision despite state law prohibiting agreements to arbitrate personal injury and wrongful death claims at t mobility llc concepcion,d holding that the faa preempted a california rule that made class action waivers unconscionable circuit city stores,adams,d confining faa exemption for workers engaged in interstate commerce to transportation workers.
the faa mandates that district courts shall direct the parties to proceed to arbitration on issues as to which an arbitration agreement has been signed.dean witter reynolds,byrd,d.the basic role for courts under the faa is to determine whether a valid agreement to arbitrate exists and,if it does,whether the agreement encompasses the dispute at issue.chiron ortho diagnostic,cir.
section of the faa contains a savings clause,which provides that arbitration agreements are enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.this savings clause preserves generally applicable contract defenses.concepcion.at.plaintiffs advance two theories as to why the faa savings clause defeats the arbitration clause in the note.we find neither availing.
under the faa savings clause,state law that arose to govern issues concerning the validity,revocability,and enforceability of contracts generally remains applicable to arbitration agreements.doctor,casarotto,d quoting perry thomas,d.thus,generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening.casarotto,at.
under california law,a contractual provision is unenforceable if it is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.armendariz found.health psychcare,cal th,d,cal.t he more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.id.
substantive unconscionability focuses on the or overly harsh effect of the contract term or clause.harper ultimo,th,d.plaintiffs claimed below that the note ban on class arbitration is unconscionable under california law,but that argument is now expressly foreclosed by concepcion.at plaintiffs assertion that students may not be able to afford arbitration fees fares no better.see green tree fin.randolph,d the risk that a plaintiff will be saddled with prohibitive costs is too speculative to justify the invalidation of an arbitration agreement.and nothing else in the arbitration clause in the note suggests substantive unconscionability armendariz,d,at holding unilateral arbitration provision substantively unconscionable harper,d at explaining substantive unconscionability of arbitration damages limit.
nor is the arbitration provision procedurally unconscionable.procedural unconscionability focuses on the factors of surprise and oppression harper,d at.the arbitration clause allows students to reject arbitration within sixty days of signing the note.this provision is more forgiving than the one in circuit city stores,ahmed,where we found thirty days a sufficient period in which to consider whether to opt out of arbitration,cir.nor was the arbitration clause buried in fine print in the note,but was instead in its own section,clearly labeled,in boldface.a m produce fmc,d,finding procedural unconscionability of consequential damage provision contained in middle of last page of an agreement in inconspicuous font.
the ucl authorizes broad injunctive relief to protect the public from unfair business practices.cal.bus.the supreme court has suggested that claims arising from a statute whose underlying purpose creates an inherent conflict with the federal policy favoring arbitration may be exempt from the faa gilmer lane,d.relying on gilmer,the california supreme court has found an inherent conflict between the faa policy favoring arbitration and california statutes authorizing public injunctive relief.broughton cigna healthplans of,cal th,d,cal.
the broughton plaintiffs were covered by medical,which had negotiated a contract with cigna for health care coverage.id.at.they sued cigna under california consumer legal remedies act clra,cal,seeking damages for medical malpractice and injunctive relief against cigna allegedly deceptive advertising.broughton,d,at.the california supreme court held the damages claim subject to the arbitration clause in the cigna policy because s uch an action is primarily for the benefit of a party to the arbitration,even if the action incidentally vindicates important public interests.id.at.but the court also found that because the plaintiffs were functioning as a private attorney general,enjoining future deceptive practices on behalf of the general public,id.at,their injunction claims were not arbitrable,id.at.
the california supreme court expanded upon broughton in cruz pacificare health systems,cal th,d,cal.plaintiff there alleged that pacificare had fraudulently induced its customers to enroll in health care programs while at the same time discouraging primary care physicians from providing services to enrollees.id.at.the complaint sought injunctive and monetary relief under the ucl,cal.bus,which prohibits unfair business practices,and under section of the same,which prohibits untrue or misleading statements designed to mislead the public.cruz,d,at.pacificare invoked the arbitration clause in its contract with enrollees.id.at.
as in broughton,the california supreme court in cruz held that the plaintiff claims for monetary relief were subject to arbitration,because any public benefit from such relief would be incidental to the private benefits obtained from those bringing the restitutionary or damages action.id.at.extending the reasoning of broughton to claims brought under the ucl and business and professions code,the cruz court found the request for injunctive relief is clearly for the benefit of health care consumers and the general public and therefore not subject to arbitration.id.at.
we applied the broughton cruz framework in davis,at.there,an employer adopted and distributed to its employees a new dispute resolution program drp that culminated in final and binding arbitration of most claims by and against its employees.id.at.the drp prohibited the filing of both judicial and administrative actions.id.at.citing the gilmer dictum,we noted that employment rights under the fair labor standards act and california labor code were analogous to substantive statutory rights established for a public reason.id.at internal quotations and citations omitted.because the davis plaintiffs sought to vindicate these statutory rights through public injunctions,we found the drp unenforceable to the extent that it barred claims for public injunctive relief.id.
defendants argue that davis was vitiated by concepcion,and the broughton cruz rule no longer exempts a public injunction claim from arbitration.we need not reach that broad argument.even assuming the continued viability of the broughton cruz rule,plaintiffs claims do not fall within its purview.
public injunctive relief is for the benefit of the general public rather than the party bringing the action.broughton,d,at.a claim for public injunctive relief therefore does not seek to resolve a private dispute but to remedy a public wrong.id.at.whatever the subjective motivation behind a party purported public injunction suit,the broughton rule applies only when the benefits of granting injunctive relief by and large do not accrue to that party,but to the general public in danger of being victimized by the same deceptive practices as the plaintiff suffered.id.
the claim for injunctive relief here does not fall within the narrow exception to the rule that the faa requires state courts to honor arbitration agreements.cruz,d,at.the third amended complaint seeks an injunction prohibiting defendants from reporting of a note by putative class members to credit agencies,from enforcing a note against any class member,and from disbursing the proceeds of any loans to a seller whose consumer credit contract did not include holder rule language.the requested prohibitions against reporting defaults on the note and seeking enforcement of the note plainly would benefit only the approximately putative class members.the requested injunction against disbursing loans to sellers who do not include holder rule language in their contracts,while ostensibly implicating third parties,also falls outside the broughton cruz rule.the third amended complaint expressly notes that keybank had completely withdrawn from the private school loan business and does not allege that the bank is engaging in other comparable transactions.the injunctive relief sought thus,for all practical purposes,relates only to past harms suffered by the members of the limited putative class.
the central premise of broughton cruz is that the judicial forum has significant institutional advantages over arbitration in administering a public injunctive remedy,which as a consequence will likely lead to the diminution or frustration of the public benefit if the remedy is entrusted to arbitrators.broughton,d,at.that concern is absent here,where defendants alleged statutory violations have,by plaintiffs own admission,already ceased,where the class affected by the alleged practices is small,and where class affected by the alleged practices is small,and where there is no real prospective benefit to the public at large from the relief sought 
for the reasons above,we vacate the district court dismissal of plaintiffs claims,reverse the denial of defendants motion to compel arbitration,and remand with instructions to the district court to compel arbitration.

silver state helicopter school did not do a good job training helicopter pilots,placing them in jobs,or managing its own finances.but it did make a convincing sales pitch.silver state promised its students that they would get the training required to get good paying jobs as commercial helicopter pilots.
at flashy career fairs around california,silver state worked hard to sign up prospective students for its helicopter pilot training program.former silver state student,mathew kilgore,declared under penalty of perjury 
the seminar was very impressive and glitzy.there were numerous helicopters onsite and the school appeared to be very professional.silver state ceo,jerry airola was very convincing and portrayed silver state as a top flight school.the presentation made clear that silver state was very selective about which students would be chosen to attend the school airola emphasized that all of the tuition to fund the entire silver state education could be obtained through silver state partner lender,keybank.airola also emphasized that the loans would only cost the students about a hundred dollars a week at interest.
airola claims were not true.silver state accepted almost all applicants who could get their loans approved.silver state lacked sufficient equipment or instructors to properly train its students.the variable rate interest on the loans would rise far above four percent matthew kilgore,william fuller,and the other putative class members believed what airola told them and signed up.they took out loans,which keybank promptly forked over to silver state before students took a single class.
but silver state knew it was headed for a crash landing.by,silver state had racked up ten million dollars in debt against fifty thousand dollars in assets.moreover,despite silver state alluring promises,there was no significant demand for helicopter pilots with a silver state degree.and it was just the school that knew it.defendant keybank knew it,too.
keybank,an lending giant,participated in the fraud that silver state perpetrated on unwitting students.from to keybank financed percent of the tuition students paid to silver state.keybank printed up lengthy loan papers that lacked the federal trade commission holder rule notice.the holder rule required the loan contracts to notify students that keybank was subject to the same claims and defenses as silver state.id.the holder rule protects borrowers,such as the student
