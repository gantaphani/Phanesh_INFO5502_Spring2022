plaintiff janis mclean,a retired deputy attorney general,appeals from a judgment of dismissal after the trial court sustained the demurrer of defendants the state of california and the california state controller office to her class action seeking waiting time penalties under labor code section for the failure to comply with the prompt payment requirements of section.she contends the trial court erred in ruling that the term quits in sections and does not apply to employees who quit to retire.
as we will explain,in the context of sections and,we agree with mclean that requirements applying to employees who quit also apply to employees who quit to retire.we therefore reverse the judgment as to the state of california.however,because we hold that it was unnecessary to name the california state controller office as a defendant,we affirm the judgment of dismissal as to the controller office.
background 
the complaint 
the operative pleading is the first amended complaint fac.it alleges that mclean worked for the state of california until she retired from the attorney general office on november.she separated from service the same day she retired.she did not receive her final wages on her last day of employment or within hours of that date.the correct amount of her wages for unused leave and vacation time were not transferred into her supplemental retirement plan within days of the last day of her employment,as she requested.she did not receive wages that she had elected to defer to by february.
the fac alleged,on information and belief,that defendants failed to make prompt payments required by section to the plaintiff class.the plaintiff class was defined as all employees employed by the state who resigned or retired from their employment november through march,who did not receive prompt payment of wages as required by section 
the fac alleged that on june,mclean filed a claim with the california victim compensation and government claims board on behalf of herself and the plaintiff class.the board rejected the claim.
the fac contained one cause of action titled for violations of california labor code section and relief under california labor code section.it alleged that section required defendants to do the following for employees who resigned or retired pay final wages within hours,or immediately at the time of resignation if given hours notice of the employee intent to resign transfer wages for unused leave and vacation time to a state sponsored supplemental retirement plan within days of the employee last day of employment,if the employee so requested and transfer any wages that the employee elects to defer to the following calendar year by february of that next year.the fac alleged defendant did not promptly pay mclean her full wages when she retired and that defendants did not timely pay final wages to the plaintiff class.
the fac sought penalties,costs of suit and expenses,and reasonable attorney fees.
defendants demurrer 
defendants demurred on the ground that the fac failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.specifically,defendants contended that since mclean retired,rather than quit,which is the relevant descriptive word actually used in the statute,there was no basis for her claim for penalties under section and she had not stated a claim for a violation of section.defendants argued that section applied only to an employee who quits,and,by retiring,mclean did not quit.further,defendants claimed that neither the state of california nor the california state controller office was mclean employer rather,she was employed by the department of justice.defendants moved to strike considerable portions of the fac.
defendants requested judicial notice of two documents the legislative history of assembly bill,which approved a memorandum of understanding between the state and state bargaining unit,the association of california state attorneys and administrative law judges,and amended section and provisions of the state administrative manual regarding payrolls upon employee separations.
mclean requested judicial notice of the legislative counsel digest of assembly bill,which amended section to make sections and applicable to the state.she also requested judicial notice of a different provision of the state administrative manual concerning the controller payroll functions.
ruling and judgment 
at the hearing on the demurrer,mclean indicated that if the trial court were to affirm its tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer,she would prefer that the demurrer be sustained without leave to amend,so she could immediately seek appellate review.
the trial court granted the requests for judicial notice.it sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,finding that section does not authorize penalties for employees who have retired.the motion to strike was dropped as moot.
the court entered judgment in favor of defendants.mclean appealed.
discussion 
istandard of review 
because the function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of a pleading as a matter of law,we apply the de novo standard of review in an appeal following the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend.citation.we assume the truth of the allegations in the complaint,but do not assume the truth of contentions,deductions,or conclusions of law.citation.it is error for the trial court to sustain a demurrer if the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory,and it is an abuse of discretion for the court to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff has shown there is a reasonable possibility a defect can be cured by amendment.citation.california logistics,state of california th.we will affirm the trial court decision to sustain the demurrer if it was correct on any theory.stonehouse homes llc city of sierra madre th.

statutory interpretation 
resolution of this case requires interpretation of various provisions of the labor code.our fundamental task in construing a statute is to ascertain the legislature intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th.the first step in the interpretative process is to examine the words of the statute,because statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.ibid.we give the words of a statute their ordinary and usual meaning and construe them in the context of the statute as a whole.ibid.courts should give meaning to every word of a statute if possible,and should avoid a construction making any word surplusage.citation.arnett dal cielo cal th.
ordinarily,if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,there is no need for judicial construction.citation.nonetheless,a court may determine whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose.citation.we need not follow the plain meaning of a statute when to do so would frustrate the manifest purposes of the legislation as a whole or lead to absurd results.citations.california school employees governing board cal th.
when the plain meaning of the statutory language is insufficient to resolve the question of interpretation,we proceed to the second step of statutory construction.in this step,we may consider various extrinsic aids to help us ascertain the lawmakers intent,including legislative history,public policy,settled rules of statutory construction,and an examination of the evils to be remedied and the legislative scheme encompassing the statute in question.citation.mcallister california coastal com th.both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent.citations.dyna med,fair employment housing com.cal d,accord,mejia reed cal th.finally,the court may consider the impact of an interpretation on public policy,for w here uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.citation.mejia,at.

prompt payment laws 
the prompt payment of wages due an employee is a fundamental public policy of california.gould maryland sound industries,th.public policy has long favored the full and prompt payment of wages due an employee.citation.wages are not ordinary debts because of the economic position of the average worker and,in particular,his dependence on wages for the necessities of life for himself and his family,it is essential to the public welfare that he receive his pay promptly.citation.pressler donald bren cal d.
the labor code contains several provisions governing the payment of wages to an employee who terminates service with his employer.section requires immediate payment of earned and unpaid wages to an employee who is discharged.there are special rules for temporary service employees,employees engaged in the production or broadcasting of motion pictures,employees engaged in the business of drilling oil,and employees employed at venues that host live theatrical or concert events.
section,one of the sections at issue here,provides in relevant part as follows 
a if an employee not having a written contract for a definite period quits his or her employment,his or her wages shall become due and payable not later than hours thereafter,unless the employee has given hours previous notice of his or her intention to quit,in which case the employee is entitled to his or her wages at the time of quitting 
b notwithstanding any other provision of law,the state employer shall be deemed to have made an immediate payment of wages under this section for any unused or accumulated vacation,annual leave,holiday leave,sick leave or time off,provided at least five workdays prior to his or her final day of employment,the employee submits a written election to his or her appointing power authorizing the state employer to tender payment for any or all leave to be contributed on a pretax basis to the employee account in a supplemental retirement plan provided the plan allows those contributions.the contribution shall be tendered for payment to the employee k,b,or plan account no later than days after the employee last day of employment 
c notwithstanding any other provision of law,when a state employee quits,retires,or disability retires from his or her employment with the state,the employee may,at least five workdays prior to his or her final day of employment,submit a written election to his or her appointing power authorizing the state employer to defer into the next calendar year payment of any or all of the employee unused or accumulated vacation,annual leave,holiday leave,sick leave to which the employee is otherwise entitled due to a disability,retirement,or time off to which the employee is entitled by reason of previous overtime work where compensating time off was given by the appointing power 
payments shall be tendered under this section no later than february in the year following the employee last day of employment emphasis added.
section,subdivision a provides if an employer willfully fails to pay,without abatement or reduction,in accordance with sections,and,any wages of an employee who is discharged or who quits,the wages of the employee shall continue as a penalty from the due date thereof at the same rate until paid or until an action therefor is commenced but the wages shall not continue for more than days.emphasis added.

quits as used in sections and.plain meaning 
mclean contends the plain meaning of the term quits,as used in the phrase an employee who quits in sections and,includes an employee who retires.mclean reasons that the terms quits and retires both refer to a voluntary separation from service and an employee must quit before she can retire.she contends the undeniable overlap of the two terms requires that quits includes retires.she argues the penalties provided in section apply to the failure to pay wages timely to employees who terminate their service with the employer,whether the termination is initiated by the employer a discharge,or by the employee a quit.she posits there is no reason to believe the legislature intended to treat employees who planned to retire upon separation of service differently than those who were discharged or who quit for other employment.
the parties and the trial court offer a variety of dictionary definitions to support their positions.relying on the edition of new webster dictionary,the trial court defined retire as to go from a company or a public place into privacy or to withdraw from business or active life,while quit in the employment context means to resign,which means to give up,as an office or post.mclean relied on the merriam webster online dictionary,which defined quit as to leave a job or to stop working as of,and retire as to stop a job or career because you have reached the age when you are not allowed to work anymore or do not need or want to work anymore.http.as of defendants contend dictionary definitions are of little aid,but note that black law dictionary defines retire as to terminate employment or service upon reaching retirement age.black law dict.ed.a later edition,however,defines retirement more broadly as termination of one employment or career,esp.upon reaching a certain age or for health reasons.black law dict.ed.
like defendants,we find these dictionary definitions are not dispositive.however,we note that all of the definitions of the term quit seem to encompass the definitions describing retirement,as all the definitions speak to leaving a job.
defendants contend the issue in this case must be understood in the context of civil service employment as mclean and the members of the class she purports to represent are civil service employees.they assert we need not determine how section applies to any separation from service other than a civil service retirement.defendants argue that in the civil service context it is well recognized that a quit is different from a retirement.see gore reisig th,at the point in time that an employee leaves employment,he or she falls into one of three categories a resigned employee,a terminated employee,or a retired employee.lucas state of california th,civil service statutes expressly distinguish separation from a civil service position by resignation and separation by service retirement.
defendants contend that in the civil service,a quit is clearly distinguishable from retirement,and this distinction is reflected in the language of subdivision c of section section c when a state employee quits,retires,or disability retires from his or her employment with the state.according to defendants,this language distinguishes between a quit and a retirement,and adds a third category,a disability retirement.
while the instant case involves civil service employees,section,subdivision a section a and section are not so limited.these statutes apply to all employers and employees not otherwise excluded such as city and county employees,who are excluded under subdivision b of section,including those in the private sector.nothing in the language of either statute permits an in
