in this class action lawsuit,telemarketers who sold newspaper subscriptions alleged violations of federal and state labor laws.the principal issues on appeal are whether a federal fair labor standards act flsa claim may serve as the predicate act for a california business and professions code section section cause of action whether the employees qualified for the commission exemption from california overtime laws and whether the employer lawfully deducted points employees had earned from a sale if the customer later cancelled the subscription.finding the flsa does not preempt the section claim,we conclude the trial court improperly sustained the demurrer to that cause of action.we find triable issues of material fact exist as to the remaining claims and reverse the judgment as to those causes of action.

discussion 
appellants argue that the trial court erred in sustaining respondents demurrer on the unfair competition cause of action,which alleged violation of federal overtime laws.they assert that an flsa violation may serve as the predicate act for a section claim.respondents argue that the claim is preempted by the flsa because traditional class actions are available under the california law,while,under flsa,class members must opt in.
on appeal from an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.zelig county of los angeles cal th,d.
the cause of action at issue is a claim for unpaid federal overtime pursuant to united states code section.this section requires potential class members to affirmatively join the action no employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.b.the flsa establishes a floor for requirements,but expressly contemplates that other laws may increase those minimum requirements.a savings clause provides that nothing in the flsa shall excuse noncompliance with any federal or state law or municipal ordinance establishing a minimum wage higher than the minimum wage established under this chapter or a maximum workweek lower than the maximum workweek established under this chapter.a.
appellants eighth cause of action was based on section,which allows recovery for any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice an action based on this state statute borrows violations of other laws when committed pursuant to business activity.farmers ins.exchange superior court cal th,d.
at the time this case was filed,section permitted representative actions.the statute was amended in november by proposition.it now requires that relief may be sought only by persons who have themselves suffered injury,and a representative claim requires class certification under the code of civil procedure section.bus.the retroactivity of proposition is currently pending before the supreme court in branick downey savings loan d,review granted april.see cal th,d.the issue was not before the trial court and was discussed only in a footnote in the argument before us.assuming but not deciding that proposition does not affect the present controversy,we proceed to the merits.
the supremacy clause of the united states constitution requires courts to find federal preemption of state law where it is clear that congress,in exercising its constitutional power,intended to eclipse the historic police powers of the state,art.vi,cl.gibbons ogden wheat.crosby national foreign trade council,d.there are three generally recognized types of preemption.express preemption occurs where congress expressly defines the extent to which a federal provision preempts state law.see crosby national foreign trade council,supra,at.courts also find preemption when federal regulation of an area is so broad and pervasive that it appears congress intended federal law to occupy the field.united states locke,d.finally,conflict preemption occurs where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both a state and federal requirement,or the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the congressional objectives.freightliner myrick,d.to determine whether federal law preempts state law,we look to the express or implicit intent of congress.tidewater marine western,bradshaw cal th,d.
respondents assert that conflict preemption is applicable here,since it is impossible to comply with both the provision of flsa and the requirement of section.we disagree congress amended the flsa to prohibit any employee from pursuing an flsa claim unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.b.the legislative history clearly indicates that the purpose of the amendment was to protect employers from facing financial ruin and prevent employees from receiving windfall payments,including liquidated damages.a see also roche sperling,d congressional intent behind flsa procedure was to limit private plaintiffs due to an influx of litigation.these concerns,however,are absent in a section action limited to restitution.we have found no federal opinion questioning this rationale.in fact,the weight of federal authority supports appellants contention that the section claim is not preempted by flsa.we may consider the opinions of federal courts when construing federal statutes flynt california gambling control com.th,d,and even unpublished federal opinions have persuasive value in this court,as they are not subject to california rules of court,rule,which bars citation of unpublished california opinions.city of hawthorne ex rel.wohlner h c disposal th,d.
appellants rely on an apparently unreported recent case,bahramipour citigroup global markets,no.c cw wl,which is expressly on point.a former securities broker filed a claim against her employer under section based upon violations of the flsa.she sought restitutionary damages for violations.the court rejected the employer argument that the class certification procedure sought by the plaintiff in her section claim was preempted by the flsa requirements.it reasoned that the section procedure does not conflict with the congressional purpose in enacting the flsa,as amended by the act,because legislative concerns about liquidated damages and large payments are obviated in a section suit limited to restitution.bahramipour citigroup global markets,supra,wl at pp.
appellants also rely on barnett washington mutual bank,no.c crb wl,another unreported district court decision.in that case,bank personnel who sold home mortgage loans over the telephone claimed violations of section predicated on state and flsa labor regulations.on the preemption issue,the court held that,to the extent it was based on violations of the flsa,the claim was not preempted in light of the flsa savings clause and in the absence of a clear indication from congress to the contrary.barnett washington mutual bank,supra,wl at.the court reasoned that the flsa is not an exclusive remedy for claims duplicated by or equivalent of rights covered by the flsa.ibid.the court also noted that the claim could be characterized as a state wage claim and hence fall within the flsa savings clause.
stokes saga int holidays,dealt only with the constitutionality of section.employees alleged violations of the flsa,california labor code provisions,and section,the california unfair competition law.the defendants claimed that a representative action pursuant to section offends due process because it fails to provide notice to the unnamed plaintiffs.the court rejected this claim,holding that the court may resolve any due process concerns by implementing protections on a basis.stokes,supra,at.
in kelley sbc wage hour cas d bna,the plaintiffs brought two causes of action for overtime under the flsa and another under the labor code.they also alleged a violation of section.the court dismissed the unfair competition cause of action because,at that time,section authorized only restitution or injunctive relief,not damages for unpaid wages.in granting the plaintiffs request for class certification on the pendent state law claims under the labor code,the court rejected the defendants argument that federal rules of civil procedure,rule is inapplicable to actions under the flsa because that rule contains provisions while the flsa specifies an provision.the court reasoned that because the two causes of action were similar,the classes would not alter the substance of the litigation nor unduly complicate the process.kelley,supra,at.the result was that two separate classes coexisted in one lawsuit,one asserting federal claims and one asserting state claims.
similarly,in aguayo oldenkamp,no.cv f asi ljo wl,the court allowed the certification of two classes,one for flsa claims and one for unfair competition claims.the court rejected defendant preemption argument,holding that section did not stand as an obstacle to accomplishment of congressional objectives.the court explained that section promotes the flsa purpose to protect workers from labor violations.tomlinson indymac bank,d,presents similar facts and reasoning.there,the district court held that an flsa claim under section was not barred by the procedural requirement because the section remedy was limited to restitution,and therefore did not frustrate the legislative purpose behind the prevent financial ruin for employers and windfall payments to employees.the court found no legislative intent to forbid states from permitting claims for overtime wages by employees who have not opted into a representative class.
federal courts are split as to whether to extend supplemental jurisdiction in the context of class action lawsuits involving a federal class and a state class.appellants point to cases extending jurisdiction over an entire state law class,regardless of whether each individual member has opted into the flsa class.see,ansoumana gristede operating court exercised supplemental jurisdiction over federal flsa claims and state minimum wage claims ramirez nutrasweet,c wl court certified class on breach of contract claim where other claims were under flsa and state minimum wage act krueger new york telephone,rejected by bayles american medical response of colorado.court authorized collective action for flsa claims and certified second class for other state and federal claims leyva buley same.
appellants cite additional cases in their reply brief.in bureerong uvawas,the court held that the flsa does not preempt a claim for unfair business practices under section,where the claim included violations of federal and state labor laws.the court referenced the savings clause in support of its decision.appellants also rely on several employment contract cases avery city of talladega,cir,state law contract claim not preempted by flsa because the contract incorporated flsa and therefore provided no greater rights hammond lowe home centers,d breach of contract claim not preempted by flsa where employer agreed to provide more protection than flsa requires,as the statute of limitations for a contract claim is longer than for an flsa claim.
in light of the federal authority discussed above,we hold that a single cause of action alleging violations of the flsa under section is not preempted by the flsa requirement.therefore,we shall reverse the order dismissing this cause of action.
appellants argue the trial court erred in granting summary adjudication on the overtime cause of action because they raised a material issue of fact as to whether they were subject to the commission exemption from california overtime protections.

the california law mandates that all employees who work in excess of eight hours in one workday or in excess of hours in one workweek receive overtime pay,subd.a.this provision does not apply to any employee whose earnings exceed one and the minimum wage if more than half of that employee compensation represents commissions.regs,tit,subd.d,italics added.a commission is compensation paid for services rendered in the sale of property and services,and based proportionately upon the amount or value thereof.in ramirez yosemite water cal th,d,ramirez,the supreme court defined two essential requirements for finding that a compensation scheme involves commissions that the employees are involved in selling a product or service,and that the amount of compensation is a percent of the price of the product or service.t he assertion of an exemption from the overtime laws is considered to be an affirmative defense,and therefore the employer bears the burden of proving the employee exemption.id.at,d.
there is no dispute that appellants sold a to ibd.whether all or part of their compensation may be characterized as a commission depends on whether they were paid on the basis of a percentage of the price of subscriptions sold.the employees were paid on a point system based on the number of points earned.employees received a certain number of points for each type of subscription sold.for example,an employee received points for a subscription.employees also received points for winning sales contests,called spiffs,and were eligible for fixed monetary bonuses if they sold a specified number of points at certain levels.as employees earned more points,the value of the points increased.employees were paid per point for the first points earned,for the next to points,and so on.the point values were not tied to the price of the subscription sold.
appellants presented the declaration of an expert,dean barron,to demonstrate that the point system was not a commission compensation scheme.based on a random sample of out of approximately time cards,barron concluded that the employees were paid on a combination of sales points,incentive points spiff,adjustment points,an apparent qualitative point adjustment less points ovr,commission,daily graphs,adjustment amount,bonus,carried over deductions,and other factors.he also stated that a true commission basis would characteristically fea
