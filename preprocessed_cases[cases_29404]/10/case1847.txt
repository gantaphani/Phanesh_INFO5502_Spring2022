factual and procedural synopsis 
i.the complaint 
the operative pleading,the second amended complaint sac,alleged nine causes of action based upon violations of the beverly hills municipal code bhmc and common statutory law.the complaint is based on two theories valet parking at the hotel violated certain provisions of the bhmc that govern the size and very specific location of signs for parking charges at a vehicle parking facility and independent of the bhmc,the hotel failed to provide plotkin notice of the a night charge for valet parking during his stay at the hotel.
ii.first summary adjudication motion 
the sac is based in part on alleged violations of bhmc section and section.section provides that a vehicle parking facility shall display at least two very specific rate signs,in very specific locations,and that a patron can not be charged a fee in excess of the amount designated on the sign.
at the time the original complaint was filed,section b defined vehicle parking facility as an facility used for the parking of motor vehicles.plotkin alleged that the hotel valet station was subject to regulation as a vehicle parking facility as set forth in sections and.
on may,after the original complaint was filed,the beverly hills city council passed an ordinance amending section b the amended ordinance.the amended ordinance stated 
b vehicle parking facility shall mean an parking facility,where the primary use of the property is to accommodate the parking of motor vehicles by members of the public.a vehicle parking facility does not include an parking facility that accommodates the parking of motor vehicles by the occupants,customers,clientele and employees of an or adjacent structure where the primary use of that structure is for office,retail or hotel purposes.
the amended ordinance also states it is declarative of existing law and does not alter the meaning of section b as adopted on march.
the legislative history of the amended ordinance is found in the official agenda statement of the city council prepared by the city attorney.the agenda statement notes that there had been complaints about the signage at several beverly hills hotels and that the amended ordinance was to instruct the city code enforcement personnel on whether the ordinance applied to hotels and whether the warning letters the enforcement personnel had just issued should be withdrawn.according to the agenda statement,the city attorney office determined that section was intended to apply solely to parking lots where parking is the primary use of the site and t he city attorney office does not believe that the provisions of section were ever intended to apply to the vehicular entrances to hotels.
after the city council passed the amended ordinance,the hotel moved for summary adjudication on the grounds it had no duty under,and had committed no wrongful act with respect to,the bhmc and its signage requirements.the motion was directed to the sac.in opposition,plotkin argued the gravamen of the sac was that those persons parking were never given notice of the fact that there would be a fee to have their cars parked by the valet.plotkin admitted the issue of whether the bhmc applied to hotels was not dispositive of any cause of action.
the court ruled that despite the express language,the amended ordinance was not declarative of existing law but rather effected a change in the law.the court then ruled the city council intended the amended ordinance to apply retroactively.after further briefing,the court assumed plotkin had an independent,vested right to sue for damages under the bhmc and ruled there was no due process barrier to retroactive application and no substantial impairment of the contract right.the court then granted summary adjudication ruling the amended ordinance applied retroactively so the hotel had no duty to comply with the signage provisions.
iii.second summary adjudication motion 
the hotel moved for summary adjudication on the grounds that as a matter of law,plotkin was given notice of the valet parking charge,and as the court had previously granted summary adjudication on plotkin other theory of liability,the two motions disposed of his entire case.
in support of the motion,the hotel proffered the following facts,which were undisputed.plotkin was an overnight guest of the hotel at the time he parked his car,plotkin received a valet parking ticket for his car which stated there was a charge to use the valet parking services and what that charge was and a copy of the actual notice,the ticket,which plotkin had attached as an exhibit to the sac.
based on the undisputed facts,the court ruled the parking ticket was sufficient notice of the parking charge and the public was not likely to be deceived by the practice of providing notice via the parking ticket.the court granted summary judgment and entered judgment in favor of the hotel.
plotkin filed a timely notice of appeal.

i.the amended ordinance was intended to operate retroactively.
subsequent to this appeal,in riley hilton hotels th,d,a sister division of this district held the amended ordinance did not apply retroactively.respondent argues that riley is not binding precedent on this court,it misapplied the law,and it failed to analyze important evidence in the record.we are not persuaded by the reasoning in riley.
a.the beverly hills city council clearly indicated its intention that the amendment to bhmc section b apply retroactively.
a statute or ordinance has retroactive effect if it substantially changes the legal effect of past events.century ins.garamendi cal th,d,kizer hanna cal d,aktar anderson th,d.statutes do not operate retroactively unless the legislative body enacting the measure clearly indicates its intent that they do so.western security bank superior court cal th,d,evangelatos superior court cal d,see,no part of the civil code is retroactive unless expressly so declared.a legislative body intent with regard to prospective or retroactive application may be determined either from the language in the statute itself or,if the extrinsic sources are sufficiently clear,legislative history.western security bank,supra,at,d,evangelatos,supra,at.the general presumption against retroactive application of statutes is subordinate to the transcendent canon of statutory construction that the design of the legislature be given effect.in re marriage of bouquet cal d.
both the text of amended bhmc section b,defining vehicle parking facility to exclude hotel parking structures,and the legislative history of the amended ordinance clearly indicate the beverly hills city council intent that the may,amendment apply to alleged violations of the city signage regulations that had occurred prior to the amendment effective date.
first,the amended ordinance expressly states that it is declarative of existing law and does not alter the existing m
