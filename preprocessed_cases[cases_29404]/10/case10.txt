respondents,current or former employees of petitioner,sought judgment against the company for injunctive and declaratory relief,punitive damages,and backpay,on behalf of themselves and a nationwide class of some million female employees,because of alleged discrimination against women in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of.they claim that local managers exercise their discretion over pay and promotions disproportionately in favor of men,which has an unlawful disparate impact on female employees and that refusal to cabin its managers authority amounts to disparate treatment.the district court certified the class,finding that respondents satisfied federal rule of civil procedure a,and rule b requirement of showing that the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.the ninth circuit substantially affirmed,concluding,inter alia,that respondents met rule a commonality requirement and that their backpay claims could be certified as part of a b class because those claims did not predominate over the declaratory and injunctive relief requests.it also ruled that the class action could be manageably tried without depriving of its right to present its statutory defenses if the district court selected a random set of claims for valuation and then extrapolated the validity and value of the untested claims from the sample set.
the certification of the plaintiff class was not consistent with rule a.
a rule a requires a party seeking class certification to prove that the class has common questions of law or fact.their claims must depend upon a common contention of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.here,proof of commonality necessarily overlaps with respondents merits contention that engages in a pattern or practice of discrimination.the crux of a title vii inquiry is the reason for a particular employment decision,cooper federal reserve bank of richmond,and respondents wish to sue for millions of employment decisions at once.without some glue holding together the alleged reasons for those decisions,it will be impossible to say that examination of all the class members claims will produce a common answer to the crucial discrimination question.
b general telephone of southwest falcon,describes the proper approach to commonality.on the facts of this case,the conceptual gap between an individual discrimination claim and the existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same injury,at,must be bridged by s ignificant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination,at.such proof is absent here.announced policy forbids sex discrimination,and the company has penalties for denials of equal opportunity.respondents only evidence of a general discrimination policy was a sociologist analysis asserting that corporate culture made it vulnerable to gender bias.but because he could not estimate what percent of employment decisions might be determined by stereotypical thinking,his testimony was worlds away from significant proof that operated under a general policy of discrimination.
c the only corporate policy that the plaintiffs evidence convincingly establishes is policy of giving local supervisors discretion over employment matters.while such a policy could be the basis of a title vii claim,recognizing that a claim can exist does not mean that every employee in a company with that policy has a common claim.in a company of size and geographical scope,it is unlikely that all managers would exercise their discretion in a common way without some common direction.respondents attempt to show such direction by means of statistical and anecdotal evidence falls well short.
respondents backpay claims were improperly certified under rule b.
a claims for monetary relief may not be certified under rule b,at least where the monetary relief is not incidental to the requested injunctive or declaratory relief.it is unnecessary to decide whether monetary claims can ever be certified under the rule because,at a minimum,claims for individualized relief,like backpay,are excluded.rule b applies only when a single,indivisible remedy would provide relief to each class member.the rule history and structure indicate that individualized monetary claims belong instead in rule b,with its procedural protections of predominance,superiority,mandatory notice,and the right to opt out.
b respondents nonetheless argue that their backpay claims were appropriately certified under rule b because those claims do not predominate over their injunctive and declaratory relief requests.that interpretation has no basis in the rule text and does obvious violence to the rule structural features.the mere predominance of a proper b injunctive claim does nothing to justify eliminating rule b procedural protections,and creates incentives for class representatives to place at risk potentially valid monetary relief claims.moreover,a district court would have to reevaluate the roster of class members continuously to excise those who leave their employment and become ineligible for classwide injunctive or declaratory relief.by contrast,in a properly certified b class action for backpay,it would be irrelevant whether the plaintiffs are still employed at.it follows that backpay claims should not be certified under rule b.
c it is unnecessary to decide whether there are any forms of incidental monetary relief that are consistent with the above interpretation of rule b and the due process clause because respondents backpay claims are not incidental to their requested injunction.is entitled to individualized determinations of each employee eligibility for backpay.once a plaintiff establishes a pattern or practice of discrimination,a district court must usually conduct additional proceedings to determine the scope of individual relief.teamsters united states.the company can then raise individual affirmative defenses and demonstrate that its action was lawful,at.the ninth circuit erred in trying to replace such proceedings with trial by formula.because rule can not be interpreted to abridge,enlarge or modify any substantive right,b,a class can not be certified on the premise that will not be entitled to litigate its statutory defenses to individual claims.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
we are presented with one of the most expansive class actions ever.the district court and the court of appeals approved the certification of a class comprising about one and a half million plaintiffs,current and former female employees of petitioner who allege that the discretion exercised by their local supervisors over pay and promotion matters violates title vii by against women.in addition to injunctive and declaratory relief,the plaintiffs seek an award of backpay.we consider whether the certification of the plaintiff class was consistent with federal rules of civil procedure a and b.
petitioner is the nation largest private employer.it operates four types of retail stores throughout the country discount stores,supercenters,neighborhood markets,and sam clubs.those stores are divided into seven nationwide divisions,which in turn comprise regions of to stores apiece.each store has between and separate departments and to staff positions.in all,operates approximately stores and employs more than one million people.
pay and promotion decisions at are generally committed to local managers broad discretion,which is exercised in a largely subjective manner.nd cal.local store managers may increase the wages of hourly employees within limits with only limited corporate oversight.as for salaried employees,such as store managers and their deputies,higher corporate authorities have discretion to set their pay preestablished ranges.
promotions work in a similar fashion.permits store managers to apply their own subjective criteria when selecting candidates as support managers,which is the first step on the path to management.admission to management training program,however,does require that a candidate meet certain objective criteria,including an performance rating,at least one year tenure in the applicant current position,and a willingness to relocate.but except for those requirements,regional and district managers have discretion to use their own judgment when selecting candidates for management training.promotion to higher office,assistant manager,or store manager is similarly at the discretion of the employee superiors after prescribed objective factors are satisfied.
the named plaintiffs in this lawsuit,representing the million members of the certified class,are three current or former employees who allege that the company discriminated against them on the basis of their sex by denying them equal pay or promotions,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,stat,as amended,et 
betty dukes began working at a pittsburgh,california,in.she started as a cashier,but later sought and received a promotion to customer service manager.after a series of disciplinary violations,however,dukes was demoted back to cashier and then to greeter.dukes concedes she violated company policy,but contends that the disciplinary actions were in fact retaliation for invoking internal complaint procedures and that male employees have not been disciplined for similar infractions.dukes also claims two male greeters in the pittsburgh store are paid more than she is.
christine kwapnoski has worked at sam club stores in missouri and california for most of her adult life.she has held a number of positions,including a supervisory position.she claims that a male manager yelled at her frequently and screamed at female employees,but not at men.the manager in question told her to doll up,to wear some makeup,and to dress a little better.app.
the final named plaintiff,edith arana,worked at a store in duarte,california,from to.in,she approached the store manager on more than one occasion about management training,but was brushed off.arana concluded she was being denied opportunity for advancement because of her sex.she initiated internal complaint procedures,whereupon she was told to apply directly to the district manager if she thought her store manager was being unfair.arana,however,decided against that and never applied for management training again.in,she was fired for failure to comply with timekeeping policy.
these plaintiffs,respondents here,do not allege that has any express corporate policy against the advancement of women.rather,they claim that their local managers discretion over pay and promotions is exercised disproportionately in favor of men,leading to an unlawful disparate impact on female employees,see k.and,respondents say,because is aware of this effect,its refusal to cabin its managers authority amounts to disparate treatment,see a.their complaint seeks injunctive and declaratory relief,punitive damages,and backpay.it does not ask for compensatory damages.
importantly for our purposes,respondents claim that the discrimination to which they have been subjected is common to all female employees.the basic theory of their case is that a strong and uniform corporate culture permits bias against women to infect,perhaps subconsciously,the discretionary decisionmaking of each one of thousands of managers thereby making every woman at the company the victim of one common discriminatory practice.respondents therefore wish to litigate the title vii claims of all female employees at stores in a nationwide class action.
class certification is governed by federal rule of civil procedure.under rule a,the party seeking certification must demonstrate,first,that 
the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,there are questions of law or fact common to the class,the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class paragraph breaks added.
second,the proposed class must satisfy at least one of the three requirements listed in rule b.respondents rely on rule b,which applies when the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.
invoking these provisions,respondents moved the district court to certify a plaintiff class consisting of a ll women employed at any domestic retail store at any time since december,who have been or may be subjected to challenged pay and management track promotions policies and practices.at quoting plaintiff motion for class certification in case nd cal,doc.as evidence that there were indeed questions of law or fact common to all the women of,as rule a requires,respondents relied chiefly on three forms of proof statistical evidence about pay and promotion disparities between men and women at the company,anecdotal reports of discrimination from about of female employees,and the testimony of a sociologist,william bielby,who conducted a social framework analysis of culture and personnel practices,and concluded that the company was vulnerable to gender discrimination,en banc.
unsuccessfully moved to strike much of this evidence.it also offered its own countervailing statistical and other proof in an effort to defeat rule a requirements of commonality,typicality,and adequate representation.further contended that respondents monetary claims for backpay could not be certified under rule b,first because that rule refers only to injunctive and declaratory relief,and second because the backpay claims could not be manageably tried as a class without depriving of its right to present certain statutory defenses.with one limitation not relevant here,the district court granted respondents motion and certified their proposed class 
a divided en banc court of appeals substantially affirmed the district court certification order.the majority concluded that respondents evidence of commonality was sufficient to raise the common question whether female employees nationwide were subjected to a single set of corporate policies not merely a number of independent discriminatory acts that may have worked to unlawfully discriminate against them in violation of title vii.at emphasis deleted.it also agreed with the district court that the named plaintiffs claims were sufficiently typical of the class as a whole to satisfy rule a,and that they could serve as adequate class representatives,see rule a,at.with respect to the rule b question,the ninth circuit held that respondents backpay claims could be certified as part of a b class because they did not predominat e over the requests for declaratory and injunctive relief,meaning they were not superior in strength,influence,or authority to the nonmonetary claims,at internal quotation marks omitted 
finally,the court of appeals determined that the action could be manageably tried as a class action because the district court could adopt the approach the ninth circuit approved in hilao estate of marcos.there compensatory damages for some class members were calculated by selecting claims at random,referring those claims to a special master for valuation,and then extrapolating the validity and value of the untested claims from the sample set.see,at.the court of appeals s aw no reason why a similar procedure to that used in hilao could not be employed in this case.at.it would allow to present individual defenses in the randomly selected sample cases,thus revealing the approximate percentage of class members whose unequal pay or nonpromotion was due to something other than gender discrimination.emphasis deleted.
we granted certiorari.
the class action is an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.califano yamasaki.in order to justify a departure from that rule,a class representative must be part of the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.east.motor freight system,rodriguez,quoting schlesinger reservists comm.to stop the war.rule a ensures that the named plaintiffs are appropriate representatives of the class whose claims they wish to litigate.the rule four requirements numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequate representation effectively limit the class claims to those fairly encompassed by the named plaintiff claims.general telephone of southwest falcon,quoting general telephone of northwest eeoc.
the crux of this case is commonality the rule requiring a plaintiff to show that there are questions of law or fact common to the class.rule a that language is easy to misread,since a ny competently crafted class complaint literally raises common questions.nagareda,class certification in the age of aggregate proof.for example do all of us plaintiffs indeed work for do our managers have discretion over pay is that an unlawful employment practice what remedies should we get reciting these questions is not sufficient to obtain class certification.commonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class members have suffered the same injury,falcon,supra,at.this does not mean merely that they have all suffered a violation of the same of law.title vii,for example,can be violated in many ways by intentional discrimination,or by hiring and promotion criteria that result in disparate impact,and by the use of these practices on the part of many different superiors in a single company.quite obviously,the mere claim by employees of the same company that they have suffered a title vii injury,or even a title vii injury,gives no cause to believe that all their claims can productively be litigated at once.their claims must depend upon a common contention for example,the assertion of discriminatory bias on the part of the same supervisor.that common contention,moreover,must be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.
what matters to class certification is not the raising of common questions even in droves but,rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.dissimilarities within the proposed class are what have the potential to impede the generation of common answers.nagareda,supra,at.
rule does not set forth a mere pleading standard.a party seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with the rule that is,he must be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties,common questions of law or fact.we recognized in falcon that sometimes it may be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question,at,and that certification is proper only if the trial court is satisfied,after a rigorous analysis,that the prerequisites of rule a have been satisfied,at see,at a ctual,not presumed,conformance with rule a remains indispensable frequently that rigorous analysis will entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff underlying claim.that can not be helped.t he class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff cause of action.falcon,supra,at quoting coopers lybrand livesay,some internal quotation marks omitted nor is there anything unusual about that consequence the necessity of touching aspects of the merits in order to resolve preliminary matters,jurisdiction and venue,is a familiar feature of litigation.see szabo bridgeport machines,easterbrook.
in this case,proof of commonality necessarily overlaps with respondents merits contention that engages in a pattern or practice of discrimination that is so because,in resolving an individual title vii claim,the crux of the inquiry is the reason for a particular employment decision,cooper federal reserve bank of richmond.here respondents wish to sue about literally millions of employment decisions at once.without some glue holding the alleged reasons for all those decisions together,it will be impossible to say that examination of all the class members claims for relief will produce a common answer to the crucial question why was i disfavored.
this court opinion in falcon describes how the commonality issue must be approached.there an employee who claimed that he was deliberately denied a promotion on account of race obtained certification of a class comprising all employees wrongfully denied promotions and all applicants wrongfully denied jobs,at.we rejected that composite class for lack of commonality and typicality,explaining 
conceptually,there is a wide gap between a an individual claim that he has been denied a promotion or higher pay on discriminatory grounds,and his otherwise unsupported allegation that the company has a policy of discrimination,and b the existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same injury as that individual,such that the individual claim and the class claim will share common questions of law or fact and that the individual claim will be typical of the class claims.at.
falcon suggested two ways in which that conceptual gap might be bridged.first,if the employer used a biased testing procedure to evaluate both applicants for employment and incumbent employees,a class action on behalf of every applicant or employee who might have been prejudiced by the test clearly would satisfy the commonality and typicality requirements of rule a.at.second,s ignificant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination conceivably could justify a class of both applicants and employees if the discrimination manifested itself in hiring and promotion practices in the same general fashion,such as through entirely subjective decisionmaking processes.ibid.we think that statement precisely describes respondents burden in this case.the first manner of bridging the gap obviously has no application here has no testing procedure or other companywide evaluation method that can be charged with bias.the whole point of permitting discretionary decisionmaking is to avoid evaluating employees under a common standard.
the second manner of bridging the gap requires significant proof that operated under a general policy of discrimination.that is entirely absent here.announced policy forbids sex discrimination,see app,and as the district court recognized the company imposes penalties for denials of equal employment opportunity,at.the only evidence of a general policy of discrimination respondents produced was the testimony of william bielby,their sociological expert.relying on social framework analysis,bielby testified that has a strong corporate culture,that makes it vulnerable to gender bias.at.he could not,however,determine with any specificity how regularly stereotypes play a meaningful role in employment decisions at.at his deposition bielby conceded that he could not calculate whether percent or percent of the employment decisions at might be determined by stereotyped thinking.nd cal.the parties dispute whether bielby testimony even met the standards for the admission of expert testimony under federal rule of civil procedure and our daubert case,see daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,the district court concluded that daubert did not apply to expert testimony at the certification stage of proceedings,at.we doubt that is so,but even if properly considered,bielby testimony does nothing to advance respondents case.w hether percent or percent of the employment decisions at might be determined by stereotyped thinking is the essential question on which respondents theory of commonality depends.if bielby admittedly has no answer to that question,we can safely disregard what he has to say.it is worlds away from significant proof that operated under a general policy of discrimination.
the only corporate policy that the plaintiffs evidence convincingly establishes is policy of allowing discretion by local supervisors over employment matters.on its face,of course,that is just the opposite of a uniform employment practice that would provide the commonality needed for a class action it is a policy against having uniform employment practices.it is also a very common and presumptively reasonable way of doing business one that we have said should itself raise no inference of discriminatory conduct,watson fort worth bank trust.
to be sure,we have recognized that,in appropriate cases,giving discretion to supervisors can be the basis of title vii liability under a theory since an employer undisciplined system of subjective decisionmaking can have precisely the same effects as a system pervaded by impermissible intentional discrimination.at.but the recognition that this type of title vii claim can exist does not lead to the conclusion that every employee in a company using a system of discretion has such a claim in common.to the contrary,left to their own devices most managers in any corporation and surely most managers in a corporation that forbids sex discrimination would select,criteria for hiring and promotion that produce no actionable disparity at all.others may choose to reward various attributes that produce disparate impact such as scores on general aptitude tests or educational achievements,see griggs duke power.and still other managers may be guilty of intentional discrimination that produces a disparity.in such a company,demonstrating the invalidity of one manager use of discretion will do nothing to demonstrate the invalidity of another.a party seeking to certify a nationwide class will be unable to show that all the employees title vii claims will in fact depend on the answers to common questions.
respondents have not identified a common mode of exercising discretion that pervades the entire company aside from their reliance on bielby social frameworks analysis that we have rejected.in a company of size and geographical scope,it is quite unbelievable that all managers would exercise their discretion in a common way without some common direction.respondents attempt to make that showing by means of statistical and anecdotal evidence,but their evidence falls well short.
the statistical evidence consists primarily of regression analyses performed by richard drogin,a statistician,and marc bendick,a labor economist.drogin conducted his analysis,comparing the number of women promoted into management positions with the percentage of women in the available pool of hourly workers.after considering regional and national data,drogin concluded that there are statistically significant disparities between men and women at and these disparities can be explained only by gender discrimination.at internal quotation marks omitted.bendick compared data from and competitive retailers and concluded that promotes a lower percentage of women than its competitors.ibid.
even if they are taken at face value,these studies are insufficient to establish that respondents theory can be proved on a classwide basis.in falcon,we held that one named plaintiff experience of discrimination was insufficient to infer that discriminatory treatment is typical of the employer employment practices.at.a similar failure of inference arises here.as judge ikuta observed in her dissent,i nformation about disparities at the regional and national level does not establish the existence of disparities at individual stores,let alone raise the inference that a policy of discrimination is implemented by discretionary decisions at the store and district level.at.a regional pay disparity,for example,may be attributable to only a small set of stores,and can not by itself establish the uniform,disparity upon which the plaintiffs theory of commonality depends.
there is another,more fundamental,respect in which respondents statistical proof fails.even if it established as it does not a pay or promotion pattern that differs from the nationwide figures or the regional figures in all of stores,that would still not demonstrate that commonality of issue exists.some managers will claim that the availability of women,or qualified women,or interested women,in their stores area does not mirror the national or regional statistics.and almost all of them will claim to have been applying some,criteria whose nature and effects will differ from store to store.in the landmark case of ours which held that giving discretion to supervisors can be the basis of title vii liability under a theory,the plurality opinion conditioned that holding on the corollary that merely proving that the discretionary system has produced a racial or sexual disparity is not enough.t he plaintiff must begin by identifying the specific employment practice that is challenged.watson,at accord,wards cove packing atonio,approving that statement,superseded by statute on other grounds,k.that is all the more necessary when a class of plaintiffs is sought to be certified.other than the bare existence of delegated discretion,respondents have identified no specific employment practice much less one that ties all their million claims together.merely showing that policy of discretion has produced an overall disparity does not suffice.
respondents anecdotal evidence suffers from the same defects,and in addition is too weak to raise any inference that all the individual,discretionary personnel decisions are discriminatory.in teamsters united states,in addition to substantial statistical evidence of discrimination,the government as plaintiff produced about specific accounts of racial discrimination from particular individuals.see,at.that number was significant because the company involved had only employees,of whom were minorities,at,and the class itself consisted of around persons,united states,overruled on other grounds,teamsters,supra.the anecdotes thus represented roughly one account for every eight members of the class.moreover,the court of appeals noted that the anecdotes came from individuals spread throughout the company who for the most part worked at the company operational centers that employed the largest numbers of the class members,at,and.here,by contrast,respondents filed some affidavits reporting experiences of discrimination about for every class members relating to only some out of stores,at ikuta,dissenting.more than half of these reports are concentrated in only six states alabama,california,florida,missouri,texas,and wisconsin half of all states have only one or two anecdotes and states have no anecdotes about operations at all,at,and.even if every single one of these accounts is true,that would not demonstrate that the entire company operate s under a general policy of discrimination,falcon,supra,at,which is what respondents must show to certify a companywide class 
the dissent misunderstands the nature of the foregoing analysis.it criticizes our focus on the dissimilarities the putative class members on the ground that we have blend ed rule a commonality requirement with rule b inquiry into whether common questions predominate over individual ones.see post,at ginsburg,concurring in part and dissenting in part.that is not so.we quite agree that for purposes of rule a e ven a single common question will do,post,at,quoting nagareda,the preexistence principle and the structure of the class action,colum.we consider dissimilarities not in order to determine as rule b requires whether common questions predominate,but in order to determine as rule a requires whether there is e ven a single common question.and there is not here.because respondents provide no convincing proof of a companywide discriminatory pay and promotion policy,we have concluded that they have not established the existence of any common question 
in sum,we agree with chief judge kozinski that the members of the class 
held a multitude of different jobs,at different levels of hierarchy,for variable lengths of time,in stores,sprinkled across states,with a kaleidoscope of supervisors male and female,subject to a variety of regional policies that all differed.some thrived while others did poorly.they have little in common but their sex and this lawsuit.at dissenting opinion.
we also conclude that respondents claims for backpay were improperly certified under federal rule of civil procedure b.our opinion in ticor title ins.brown,per curiam expressed serious doubt about whether claims for monetary relief may be certified under that provision.we now hold that they may not,at least where as here the monetary relief is not incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief.
rule b allows class treatment when the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.one possible reading of this provision is that it applies only to requests for such injunctive or declaratory relief and does not authorize the class certification of monetary claims at all.we need not reach that broader question in this case,because we think that,at a minimum,claims for individualized relief like the backpay at issue here do not satisfy the rule.the key to the b class is the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.nagareda,at.in other words,rule b applies only when a single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class.it does not authorize class certification when each individual class member would be entitled to a different injunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant.similarly,it does not authorize class certification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary damages.
that interpretation accords with the history of the rule.because rule stems from equity practice that predated its codification,amchem products,windsor,in determining its meaning we have previously looked to the historical models on which the rule was based,ortiz fibreboard.as we observed in amchem,c ivil rights cases against parties charged with unlawful,discrimination are prime examples of what b is meant to capture,at.in particular,the rule reflects a series of decisions involving challenges to racial segregation conduct that was remedied by a single classwide order.in none of the cases cited by the advisory committee as examples of b antecedents did the plaintiffs combine any claim for individualized relief with their classwide injunction.see advisory committee note,citing cases,potts flax,brunson board of trustees of of school dist,clarendon,per curiam frasier board of trustees of,supp,nc court,aff.
permitting the combination of individualized and classwide relief in a b class is also inconsistent with the structure of rule b.classes certified under b and b share the most traditional justifications for class treatment that individual adjudications would be impossible or unworkable,as in a b class or that the relief sought must perforce affect the entire class at once,as in a b class.for that reason these are also mandatory classes the rule provides no opportunity for b or b class members to opt out,and does not even oblige the district court to afford them notice of the action.rule b,by contrast,is an adventuresome innovation of the amendments,amchem,at internal quotation marks omitted,framed for situations in which treatment is not as clearly called for,at quoting advisory committee notes,ed.it allows class certification in a much wider set of circumstances but with greater procedural protections.its only prerequisites are that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.rule b.and unlike b and b classes,the b class is not mandatory class members are entitled to receive the best notice that is practicable under the circumstances and to withdraw from the class at their option.see rule c b.
given that structure,we think it clear that monetary claims belong in rule b.the procedural protections attending the b class predominance,superiority,mandatory notice,and the right to opt out are missing from b not because the rule considers them unnecessary,but because it considers them unnecessary to a b class.when a class seeks an indivisible injunction benefitting all its members at once,there is no reason to undertake a inquiry into whether class issues predominate or whether class action is a superior method of adjudicating the dispute.predominance and superiority are.but with respect to each class member individualized claim for money,that is not so which is precisely why b requires the judge to make findings about predominance and superiority before allowing the class.similarly,b does not require that class members be given notice and optout rights,presumably because it is thought rightly or wrongly that notice has no purpose when the class is mandatory,and that depriving people of their right to sue in this manner complies with the due process clause.in the context of a class action predominantly for money damages we have held that absence of notice and violates due process.see phillips petroleum shutts.while we have never held that to be so where the monetary claims do not predominate,the serious possibility that it may be so provides an additional reason not to read rule b to include the monetary claims here.
against that conclusion,respondents argue that their claims for backpay were appropriately certified as part of a class under rule b because those claims do not predominate over their requests for injunctive and declaratory relief.they rely upon the advisory committee statement that rule b does not extend to cases in which the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or predominantly to money damages.at emphasis added.the negative implication,they argue,is that it does extend to cases in which the appropriate final relief relates only partially and nonpredominantly to money damages.of course it is the rule itself,not the advisory committee description of it,that governs.and a mere negative inference does not in our view suffice to establish a disposition that has no basis in the rule text,and that does obvious violence to the rule structural features.the mere predominance of a proper b injunctive claim does nothing to justify elimination of rule b procedural protections it neither establishes the superiority of class adjudication over individual adjudication nor cures the notice and problems.we fail to see why the rule should be read to nullify these protections whenever a plaintiff class,at its option,combines its monetary claims with a request even a predominating request for an injunction.
respondents predominance test,moreover,creates perverse incentives for class representatives to place at risk potentially valid claims for monetary relief.in this case,for example,the named plaintiffs declined to include employees claims for compensatory damages in their complaint.that strategy of including only backpay claims made it more likely that monetary relief would not predominate.but it also created the possibility if the predominance test were correct that individual class members claims would be precluded by litigation they had no power to hold themselves apart from.if it were determined,for example,that a particular class member is not entitled to backpay because her denial of increased pay or a promotion was not the product of discrimination,that employee might be collaterally estopped from independently seeking compensatory damages based on that same denial.that possibility underscores the need for plaintiffs with individual monetary claims to decide for themselves whether to tie their fates to the class representatives or go it alone a choice rule b does not ensure that they have.
the predominance test would also require the district court to reevaluate the roster of class members continually.the ninth circuit recognized the necessity for this when it concluded that those plaintiffs no longer employed by lack standing to seek injunctive or declaratory relief against its employment practices.the court of appeals response to that difficulty,however,was not to eliminate all former employees from the certified class,but to eliminate only those who had left the company employ by the date the complaint was filed.that solution has no logical connection to the problem,since those who have left their jobs since the complaint was filed have no more need for prospective relief than those who left beforehand.as a consequence,even though the validity of a b class depends on whether final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole,rule b emphasis added,about half the members of the class approved by the ninth circuit have no claim for injunctive or declaratory relief at all.of course,the alternative and logical solution of excising plaintiffs from the class as they leave their employment may have struck the court of appeals as wasteful of the district court time.which indeed it is,since if a backpay action were properly certified for class treatment under b,the ability to litigate a plaintiff backpay claim as part of the class would not turn on the irrelevant question whether she is still employed at.what follows from this,however,is not that some arbitrary limitation on class membership should be imposed but that the backpay claims should not be certified under rule b at all.
finally,respondents argue that their backpay claims are appropriate for a b class action because a backpay award is equitable in nature.the latter may be true,but it is irrelevant.the rule does not speak of equitable remedies generally but of injunctions and declaratory judgments.as title vii itself makes pellucidly clear,backpay is neither.see g b i and ii distinguishing between declaratory and relief and the payment of backpay,see g a.
in allison citgo petroleum,the fifth circuit held that a b class would permit the certification of monetary relief that is incidental to requested injunctive or declaratory relief,which it defined as damages that flow directly from liability to the class as a whole on the claims forming the basis of the injunctive or declaratory relief.in that court view,such incidental damage should not require additional hearings to resolve the disparate merits of each individual case it should neither introduce new substantial legal or factual issues,nor entail complex individualized determinations.ibid.we need not decide in this case whether there are any forms of incidental monetary relief that are consistent with the interpretation of rule b we have announced and that comply with the due process clause.respondents do not argue that they can satisfy this standard,and in any event they can not.
contrary to the ninth circuit view,is entitled to individualized determinations of each employee eligibility for backpay.title vii includes a detailed remedial scheme.if a plaintiff prevails in showing that an employer has discriminated against him in violation of the statute,the court may enjoin the respondent from in such unlawful employment practice,and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate,including reinstatement or hiring of employees,with or without backpay or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.g.but if the employer can show that it took an adverse employment action against an employee for any reason other than discrimination,the court can not order the hiring,reinstatement,or promotion of an individual as an employee,or the payment to him of any backpay.g a.
we have established a procedure for trying cases that gives effect to these statutory requirements.when the plaintiff seeks individual relief such as reinstatement or backpay after establishing a pattern or practice of discrimination,a district court must usually conduct additional proceedings to determine the scope of individual relief.teamsters,at.at this phase,the burden of proof will shift to the company,but it will have the right to raise any individual affirmative defenses it may have,and to demonstrate that the individual applicant was denied an employment opportunity for lawful reasons.at.
the court of appeals believed that it was possible to replace such proceedings with trial by formula.a sample set of the class members would be selected,as to whom liability for sex discrimination and the backpay owing as a result would be determined in depositions supervised by a master.the percentage of claims determined to be valid would then be applied to the entire remaining class,and the number of presumptively valid claims thus derived would be multiplied by the average backpay award in the sample set to arrive at the entire class recovery without further individualized proceedings,at.we disapprove that novel project.because the rules enabling act forbids interpreting rule to abridge,enlarge or modify any substantive right,b see ortiz,at,a class can not be certified on the premise that will not be entitled to litigate its statutory defenses to individual claims.and because the necessity of that litigation will prevent backpay from being incidental to the classwide injunction,respondents class could not be certified even assuming,arguendo,that incidental monetary relief can be awarded to a b class.
the judgment of the court of appeals is

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice ginsburg,with whom justice breyer,justice sotomayor,and justice kagan join,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
the class in this case,i agree with the court,should not have been certified under federal rule of civil procedure b.the plaintiffs,alleging discrimination in violation of title vii,et,seek monetary relief that is not merely incidental to any injunctive or declaratory relief that might be available.see ante,at.a putative class of this type may be certifiable under rule b,if the plaintiffs show that common class ques tions predominate over issues affecting individuals,qualification for,and the amount of,backpay or compensatory damages and that a class action is superior to other modes of adjudication.
whether the class the plaintiffs describe meets the specific requirements of rule b is not before the court,and i would reserve that matter for consideration and decision on remand the court,however,disqualifies the class at the starting gate,holding that the plaintiffs can not cross the commonality line set by rule a.in so ruling,the court imports into the rule a determination concerns properly addressed in a rule b assessment.
rule a establishes a preliminary requirement for maintaining a class action t here are questions of law or fact common to the class.the rule does not require that all questions of law or fact raised in the litigation be common,newberg conte,newberg on class actions,to ed.indeed,e ven a single question of law or fact common to the members of the class will satisfy the commonality requirement,nagareda,the preexistence principle and the structure of the class action,colum.see advisory committee notes on fed.rule civ.proc,citing with approval cases in which there was only a question of law or fact common to the class members.
a question is ordinarily understood to be a subject or point open to controversy.american heritage dictionary ed.see also black law dictionary ed.defining question of fact as a disputed issue to be resolved at trial and question of law as a n issue to be decided by the judge thus,a question common to the class must be a dispute,either of fact or of law,the resolution of which will advance the determination of the class members claims 
the district court,recognizing that one significant common to the class may be sufficient to warrant,nd cal,found that the plaintiffs easily met that test.absent an error of law or an abuse of discretion,an appellate tribunal has no warrant to upset the district court finding of commonality.see califano yamasaki,m ost issues arising under rule are committed in the first instance to the discretion of the district court.
the district court certified a class of a ll women employed at any domestic retail store at any time since december.at internal quotation marks omitted.the named plaintiffs,led by betty dukes,propose to litigate,on behalf of the class,allegations that discriminates on the basis of gender in pay and promotions.they allege that the company r eli es on gender stereotypes in making employment decisions such as promotion s and pay.app.permits those prejudices to infect personnel decisions,the plaintiffs contend,by leaving pay and promotions in the hands of a nearly all male managerial workforce using arbitrary and subjective criteria.ibid.further alleged barriers to the advancement of female employees include the company requirement,as a condition of promotion to management jobs,that employees be willing to relocate.at.absent instruction otherwise,there is a risk that managers will act on the familiar assumption that women,because of their services to husband and children,are less mobile than men.see of labor,federal glass ceiling commission,good for business making full use of the nation human capital.
women fill percent of the hourly jobs in the retailer stores but make up only percent of management employees.at.t he higher one looks in the organization the lower the percentage of women.at.the plaintiffs largely uncontested descriptive statistics also show that women working in the company stores are paid less than men in every region and that the salary gap widens over time even for men and women hired into the same jobs at the same time.ledbetter goodyear tire rubber,ginsburg,dissenting.
the district court identified systems for promoting employees that were sufficiently similar across regions and stores to conclude that the manner in which these systems affect the class raises issues that are common to all class members.at.the selection of employees for promotion to management is fairly characterized as a tap on the shoulder process,in which managers have discretion about whose shoulders to tap,at.vacancies are not regularly posted from among those employees satisfying minimum qualifications,managers choose whom to promote on the basis of their own subjective impressions.ibid.
compensation policies also operate uniformly across stores,the district court found.the retailer leaves open a band for every position hourly pay rate.provides no standards or criteria for setting wages within that band,and thus does nothing to counter unconscious bias on the part of supervisors.see,at.
supervisors do not make their discretionary decisions in a vacuum.the district court reviewed means used to maintain a carefully constructed corporate culture,such as frequent meetings to reinforce the common way of thinking,regular transfers of managers between stores to ensure uniformity throughout the company,monitoring of stores on a close and basis,and tv,broadcas t into all stores.at internal quotation marks omitted.

finally,the plaintiffs presented an expert appraisal to show that the pay and promotions disparities at can be explained only by gender discrimination and not by neutral variables.at.using regression analyses,their expert,richard drogin,controlled for factors including,inter alia,job performance,length of time with the company,and the store where an employee worked,at the results,the district court found,were sufficient to raise an inference of discrimination.at.
the district court identification of a common question,whether pay and promotions policies gave rise to unlawful discrimination,was hardly infirm.the practice of delegating to supervisors large discretion to make personnel decisions,uncontrolled by formal standards,has long been known to have the potential to produce disparate effects.managers,like all humankind,may be prey to biases of which they are unaware the risk of discrimination is heightened when those managers are predominantly of one sex,and are steeped in a corporate culture that perpetuates gender stereotypes.
the plaintiffs allegations resemble those in one of the prototypical cases in this area,leisner new york,supp,sdny.in deciding on promotions,supervisors in that case were to start with objective measures but ultimately,they were to look at the individual as a total individual.at internal quotation marks omitted.the final question they were to ask and answer is this person going to be successful in our business ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.it is hardly surprising that for many managers,the ideal candidate was someone with characteristics similar to their own.
we have held that discretionary employment practices can give rise to title vii claims,not only when such practices are motivated by discriminatory intent but also when they produce discriminatory results.see watson fort worth bank trust.but see ante,at p roving that a discretionary system has produced a disparity is not enough.in watson,as here,an employer had given its managers large authority over promotions.an employee sued the bank under title vii,alleging that the discretionary promotion system caused a discriminatory effect based on race,at internal quotation marks omitted.four different supervisors had declined,on separate occasions,to promote the employee,at.their reasons were subjective and unknown.the employer,we noted had not developed precise and formal criteria for evaluating candidates i t relied instead on the subjective judgment of supervisors.ibid.
aware of the problem of subconscious stereotypes and prejudices,we held that the employer undisciplined system of subjective decisionmaking was an employment practic e that may be analyzed under the disparate impact approach.at.see also wards cove packing atonio,recognizing the use of subjective decision making as an employment practic e subject to attack.
the plaintiffs allegations state claims of gender discrimination in the form of biased decisionmaking in both pay and promotions.the evidence reviewed by the district court adequately demonstrated that resolving those claims would necessitate examination of particular policies and practices alleged to affect,adversely and globally,women employed at stores.rule a,setting a necessary but not a sufficient criterion for certification,demands nothing further.
the court gives no credence to the key dispute common to the class whether discretionary pay and motion policies are discriminatory.see ante,at re citing questions like is giving managers discretion over pay an unlawful employment practice is not sufficient to obtain class certification.what matters,the court asserts,is not the raising of common questions,but whether there are d issimilarities within the proposed class that have the potential to impede the generation of common answers.ante,at quoting nagareda,class certification in the age of aggregate proof,some internal quotation marks omitted.
the court blends rule a threshold criterion with the more demanding criteria of rule b,and thereby elevates the a inquiry so that it is no longer easily satisfied,moore et,moore federal practice,ed.rule b certification requires,in addition to the four a findings,that questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members and that a class action is superior to other available methods for adjudicating the controversy.
