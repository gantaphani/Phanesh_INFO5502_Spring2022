the issue in this case is whether products produced by defendant challenge dairy products,and sold by defendant the kroger corporation in its supermarkets,which combine butter with canola oil or olive oil,are mislabeled under state and federal law.in her opening brief,plaintiff mary simpson claims the products are not butter and that they were mislabeled in violation of federal and state law by being labeled spreadable butter with either canola oil or a combination of canola and olive oil.in her reply brief,plaintiff changes her theory and asserts that her claim is that the additional oils are not identified with requisite prominence on the labels.defendants argue that the california food labeling statutes under which plaintiff sues are preempted by federal food labeling standards.they contend that under controlling federal law,the products are properly labeled with their usual and common names,butter with canola oil or with olive and canola oil.
we conclude that the labeling requirements of the california milk and milk products act of food,et,mmpa are not identical to the applicable federal labeling requirements and therefore plaintiff claims under the mmpa are preempted that plaintiff mislabeling claims under the california sherman food,drug and cosmetic law health,et.sherman law are not preempted by federal law and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend to allege claims based on violation of the sherman law because,as a matter of law,plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that a reasonable consumer would be misled by the labels on the products.
factual and procedural summary 
in october,plaintiff purchased a tub of one of the relevant products at her local ralphs supermarket she alleges that she purchased the product because she was already familiar with whipped butter products that are spreadable.only when she got home did she realize that the product she purchased was not in fact butter,but contained edible oils and other ingredients.the action concerns two challenge butter products,but the complaint does not state which was purchased by plaintiff.

challenge tuscan style spreadable butter is sold in a tub with similar labeling.the label on the top of the tub is a color backdrop depicting white buildings with red roofs against a rolling pastoral landscape.the label challenge butter appears at the top of the landscape in white lettering on a red banner.below and to the left is a blue ribbon banner stating in yellow type with olive oil in smaller print.below that,on the blue ribbon,and in smaller white type appears garlic italian herbs.in the center bottom of the top label in red lettering on a gold banner are the words tuscan style in larger type.immediately below is a blue banner with smaller white lettering stating spreadable butter withcanola olive oil.centered below that statement is the word spread in the same size type.the side panel is the same,but the word spread is omitted.the bottom panel on the tub lists the ingredients pasteurized cream derived from milk,canola oil,olive oil,roasted garlic puree,natural flavors,garlic puree,dried garlic,spices,sea salt,vitamin a palmitate,beta carotene.
the operative pleading in this case is the first amended complaint,a putative class action alleging causes of action for unfair competition bus,et,false advertising bus,et,and violation of the consumer legal remedies act,et.plaintiff sought damages,a permanent injunction prohibiting the sale of margarine,spread,or dairy spread if not in compliance with the provisions of the mmpa,costs and fees.
defendants jointly demurred to the complaint on the ground that the products were properly labeled under the mmpa.they also argued the mmpa is expressly and impliedly preempted by the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca.et in opposition,plaintiff argued that the products are a spread rather than butter under the definitions of the mmpa.in arguing that her claims under the mmpa are not preempted by the fdca,plaintiff cited a provision of the sherman law which incorporates federal drug administration fda regulations regarding the branding of food health,subd.a.but she did not seek leave to amend to allege a cause of action under the sherman law.
the trial court agreed with defendants,finding that plaintiff california claims were preempted.the court found that the products are nonstandardized butter,for which there is a federal labeling requirement,but no comparable california labeling requirement.the court denied leave to amend because an amendment could not address the legal issues on which its ruling was based.the action was dismissed with prejudice.an order of dismissal with prejudice was entered.plaintiff appeals from the order of dismissal.we apply a de novo standard of review because this case was resolved on demurrer citation and because federal preemption presents a pure question of law citation.farm raised salmon cases cal th,fn.
discussion 
the labeling of food products is heavily regulated by both federal and state law.the gravamen of the first amended complaint is that the labels on the products at issue violate the mmpa.on appeal,the thrust of plaintiff argument shifted.her primary argument became that she should have been granted leave to amend to allege the labels violated the sherman law,rather than the mmpa,a claim which she argues is not preempted.she also argues that her mmpa claims are not preempted.we address both the mmpa and the sherman law as a basis for plaintiff claims.
under both the fdca and the sherman law,foods fall into two broad groups those for which a definition and standard of identity has been created by federal regulation,and those not defined by federal regulation.under the fdca,regulations may be promulgated fixing and establishing for any food,under its common or usual name so far as practicable,a reasonable definition and standard of identity.butter is expressly excepted from this no definition and standard of identity and no standard of quality shall be established for butter.
we refer to the first group as standardized foods and the second as nonstandardized foods.the parties disagree as to whether the food products at issue here are standardized or nonstandardized foods.as we discuss,this categorization of foods impacts the preemption analysis.
the fdca prohibits the misbranding of any food.b.a food shall be deemed to be misbranded under the fdca if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular a.farm raised salmon cases,supra,cal th at.in the fdca was amended by the nutrition labeling and education act of nlea with the purpose of creat ing uniform national standards regarding the labeling of food and to prevent states from adopting inconsistent requirements with respect to the labeling of nutrients.citation.id.at pp.to that end,the nlea included an explicit preemption provision in the form of section a citation,which provides that no state or political subdivision of a state may directly or indirectly establish under any authority or continue in effect as to any food in interstate commerce any requirement for the labeling of food of the type required by section k of this title that is not identical to the requirement of such section a,italics added.id.at.
there is no private right of action under the fdca.merrell dow pharmaceuticals,thompson.under section,states may establish their own requirements so long as they are identical to those in the fdca.farm raised salmon cases,supra,cal th at,quoting,under fda regulations,if the state requirement is identical to federal law,there is no issue of preemption.
the fdca defines butter to mean the food product usually known as butter,and which is made exclusively from milk or cream,or both,with or without common salt,and with or without additional coloring matter,and containing not less than percentum by weight of milk fat,all tolerances having been allowed for.cream is defined in the code of federal regulations as the liquid milk product high in fat separated from milk,which may have been adjusted by adding thereto milk,concentrated milk,dry whole milk,skim milk,concentrated skim milk,or nonfat dry milk.cream contains not less than percent milkfat.a.specific definitions and standards of identity have been adopted for other milk and cream products,such as sour cream,and yogurt.there is no specific federal definition or standard of identity for butter combined with canola or olive oil.
section of the fdca governs labeling of margarine.the definition of margarine for purposes of section is stated in title united states code section f as including all substances,mixtures,and compounds which have a consistence similar to that of butter and which contain any edible oils or fats other than milk fat if made in imitation or semblance of butter.italics added.margarine is a standardized product under fda regulations,defined as food in plastic form or emulsion,containing not less than percent fat produced from a number of specified optional agreements,which include edible fats and oils,milk or milk products,and flavoring substances.any flavoring substance which imparts a flavor other than in semblance of butter must be declared as part of the name of the food.b.each ingredient used in margarine must be declared on the label.d.
section i regulates labeling of nonstandardized foods.it requires the label to bear the common or usual name of the food,and if two or more ingredients are included,the common or usual name of each food except spices and flavorings must be on the label.
the mmpa defines butter as the product made by gathering the fat of fresh or ripened milk or cream into a mass,which also contains a small portion of other milk constituents.food.cream is defined as that portion of milk,rich in milk fat,which rises to the surface of milk that is left standing or which is separated from milk by centrifugal force.food.section of the mmpa defines flavored butter butter flavored with spices,condiments,garlic,chives,herbs,or other flavoring may be sold in whipped or solid form,provided the product meets the following requirements a the butter,before flavoring,meets all of the requirements for usda score aa grade butter.b the principal flavor is identified on the container with equal prominence with the word butter.c the principal display panel has a list of all ingredients in the descending order of predominance,and identifies the name and address of the manufacturer.d the product is processed in a licensed milk products plant.e the product contains no preservative.food,italics added.
milk product or dairy product means any product which is prepared or manufactured from milk,for which product a standard of composition is established by this division,and any new milk product or combination milk and food product for which a temporary standard of composition is established pursuant to chapter commencing with section of part.milk product or dairy product does not include products resembling milk products as defined in section.food.nondairy product means a product resembling a milk product,but which nondairy product contains no milk or milk solids.food.
the mmpa also defines margarine,dairy spread,and spread.plaintiff makes no argument that the products here constitute either margarine or dairy spread contending only that they are a spread under the mmpa.
spread is defined as a substitute for butter consisting of mixtures of compounds which may include milk and edible oils and fats that is made in imitation or semblance of butter and does not meet the definition for margarine or dairy spread.food.in opposition to defendants demurrer,plaintiff noted that defendants had conceded that their products did not fit the definitions for margarine or dairy spread.
under the mmpa,i t is unlawful for any person to sell any margarine,dairy spread,or spread,unless there is printed upon the label of each and every package,or other container all of the following a the words oleomargarine,margarine,dairy spread,or spread,as the case may be in letters which are at least as large as any other type or lettering on the label.the word oleomargarine,margarine,dairy spread,or spread,shall be of a color in strong contrast to the color of the container.d a full and accurate statement of all the ingredients which are contained in the substance in the package.food,italics added.margarine,dairy spread,or spread may not be sold under the name of butter,under the pretense that it is butter,or that it is a dairy product.food.
sherman law 
like the fdca,the sherman law broadly prohibits the misbranding of food,which is defined as labeling that is false or misleading in any particular.farm raised salmon cases,supra,cal th at see also health.t he sherman law incorporates a ll food labeling regulations and any amendments to those regulations adopted pursuant to the fdca as the food labeling regulations of this state.health,subd.a.id.at.
under the sherman law,a food is misbranded if it is offered for sale under the name of another food,or if it is an imitation of another food for which a definition and standard of identity has been established by regulation and its label does not bear,in type of uniform size and prominence the word imitation,and immediately following,the name of the food imitated.health.a food also is misbranded if it purports to be,or is represented as,a food for which a definition and standard of identity has been established under section and the label fails to bear the name of the food specified in the standard or otherwise fails to conform to the definition and standard.health.any food for which no standard of identity exists is misbranded unless it bears a label clearly stating the common or usual name of the food.health.
any food is misbranded if its labeling does not conform with the requirements for nutrient content or health claims set forth in section r r of the federal act and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto.health.any food is misbranded if any word,statement,or other information required pursuant to this part to appear on the label or labeling is not prominently placed upon the label or labeling with conspicuousness,as compared with other words,statements,designs,or devices in the labeling and in terms as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.health.
preemption is an issue in this case principally because of the express preemption provision added to the fdca in by adoption of the nlea.section a provides except as provided in subsection b of this section,no state or political subdivision of a state may directly or indirectly establish under any authority or continue in effect as to any food in interstate commerce any requirement for a food which is the subject of a standard of identity established under section of this title that is not identical to such standard of identity or that is not identical to the requirement of section q of this title italics added.section a applies to any requirement for the labeling of food of the type required by section i that is not identical to the requirement of such section similarly,section a applies to any requirement for labeling of food of the type required by section i that is not identical to the requirement of that section.
section i sets the requirements for labeling of foods where there is no representation that a definition and standard of identity has been created for that food,nonstandardized foods as we have defined them.it requires that a nonstandardized food have a label bearing the common or usual name of the food,if any there be,and in case it is fabricated from two or more ingredients,the common or usual name of each such ingredient except that spices,flavorings,and colors not required to be certified under section c of this title may be designated as spices,flavorings,and colorings without naming each i.
the impact of section a,read with section i,is that the express preemption clause of the fdca applies to labeling of nonstandardized food products.in addition,section a extends express preemption to any food offered for sale under the name of another food.see b.
the california supreme court addressed whether section preempted california laws regulating the labeling of farm raised salmon fed food containing artificial color additives in farm raised salmon cases,supra,cal th.fda regulations allowed the use of color additives in salmon feed,but required that it be declared in labeling.id.at.the court first concluded that the sherman law labeling requirements were identical to those in section k of the fdca,which addresses the labeling of foods containing artificial coloring.the sherman law used language identical to section k to require disclosure of the additives in labels.the supreme court also relied on the sherman law express incorporation of all food labeling regulations of the fdca as the food labeling regulations of this state.health,subd.a.farm raised salmon cases,at pp.
the party who claims preemption has the burden of demonstrating that it applies.farm raised salmon cases,supra,cal th at.the analysis of a preemption question must take into account the strong presumption against preemption.ibid.the presumption applies to the existence as well as the scope of preemption.ibid.the court in farm raised salmon cases concluded that this presumption applied with particular force in that case because laws regulating the proper marketing of food,including the prevention of deceptive sales practices,are within the states historic police powers.ibid.
in farm raised salmon cases,the defendants asserted only that the plaintiffs claims were impliedly preempted because they created an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objective of congress in enacting the fdca.farm raised salmon cases,supra,cal th at.unlike the case before us,there was no claim of express preemption because the state and federal requirements were identical.the supreme court held that congress had not expressly preempted private claims predicated on state laws imposing requirements identical to those contained in the fdca ibid.the court concluded accordingly,the state requirements at issue here are explicitly permitted by section.see consumer justice center olympian labs,th,s tates can enforce labeling rules which are identical original italics.id.at.the supreme court said that while congress clearly intended to allow states to establish their own identical laws,it said nothing about limiting the range of available remedies states might provide for violation of those laws,such as private actions.ibid.it found nothing in the legislative history suggesting a sweeping preemption of private actions predicated on requirements contained in state laws.ibid.
the court in farm raised salmon cases found support in an uncodified provision of nlea section c further undermining defendants interpretation is the fact that congress made clear that the preemptive scope of section was to sweep no further than the plain language of the statute itself.in nlea section c an uncodified provision,congress provided that t he nlea shall not be construed to preempt any provision of state law,unless such provision is expressly preempted under section of the fdca,c,stat.farm raised salmon cases,supra,cal th at.the court found that this uncodified provision signified an intent to allow state and federal regulation to coexist.where congress establishes a regime of dual regulation,analysis must be applied sensitively so as to prevent the diminution of the role congress reserved to the states while at the same time preserving the federal role.citations.viva international voice for animals adidas promotional retail operations,cal th.id.at pp,fn.omitted.the court also found the uncodified provision significant because it informs our analysis of the existence of any implied preemption a n express definition of the reach of a statute implies,supports a reasonable inference that congress did not intend to other matters citation.id.at.it concluded that deference should be paid to congress detailed attempt to clearly define the scope of preemption under the fdca.citation.ibid.
the supreme court recognized that congress enacted numerous specific express preemption provisions in the fdca.citation.farm raised salmon cases,supra,cal th at.it concluded that in combination with section,these provisions demonstrated congress care in deciding what to preempt and what to allow.section is notable both for the number of misbranding provisions it deals with approximately and for the detailed nature of its preemptive scope.the language of section and the nlea express preemption provision is further evidence that congress chose carefully the manner with which it preempted certain state labeling laws.farm raised salmon cases,at,fn.omitted.
in farm raised salmon cases,supra,cal th,the supreme court concluded that congress intended to allow states to establish their own requirements so long as they are identical to those contained in section of the fdca id.at,italics added.it also concluded that congress did not intend to limit the scope of state remedies for violations of state laws identical to the fdca.id.at.the preemption issue,therefore,turns on whether the labeling requirements of california law are identical to those of the fdca.
the cornerstone of plaintiff argument is that the trial court should have allowed her leave to amend to allege violations of the sherman law labeling requirements because they are identical to those under section of the fdca and are therefore not preempted.she contends that she should be allowed to raise this issue even though it was not the focus of her complaint or her demurrer opposition.we may consider new theories on appeal from the sustaining of a demurrer kruss booth th,fn,citing code civ,subd.a,italics omitted when any court makes an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend the question as to whether or not such court abused its discretion in making such an order is open on appeal even though no request to amend such pleading was made.
sherman law claims 
plaintiff argues that a misbranding claim based on health and safety code section part of the sherman law can not be preempted because it is identical to section a of the fdca,which is not included under the preemption provision of section of the fdca.section a provides that food shall be misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular plaintiff cites health and safety code section,a similarly broad misbranding statute which defines misbranding as false or misleading labeling in any particular.plaintiff claims that the labels on these products were misleading or false because the representation suggested by the combination of words and statements on the label is that the product is butter,when in fact it is not.
while it is true that the federal and state statutes cited by plaintiff are identical,the argument is too simplistic.it ignores the specific preemption provisions of section which we have cited.plaintiff cites chavez blue sky natural bev,as a case in which the court held that a plaintiff claims under california statutes based on mislabeling were not preempted by the fdca.in chavez,the key was that the plaintiff claims did not fall within the express preemption provisions of section.id.at.therefore,its analysis is relevant here only if non
