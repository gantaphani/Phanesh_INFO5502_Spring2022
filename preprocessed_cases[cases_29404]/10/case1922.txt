this action originated with a tender offer by general william lyon lyon of per share for the outstanding shares of lyon homes,a delaware corporation.on the same day the tender offer was announced,plaintiff alaska electrical pension fund alaska filed a class action suit in the superior court of california.two days later,individual stockholders filed two separate class actions in the delaware court of chancery.all three suits alleged similar breaches of fiduciary duty and disclosure claims relating to the tender offer.lyon and the other defendants reached an initial settlement with the delaware plaintiffs,agreeing to,inter alia,increase the offer price from to.alaska refused to join in the initial settlement.the tender offer was eventually increased by lyon to per share.alaska filed a motion to intervene in the delaware action to recover its attorneys fees and costs.the court of chancery refused to award alaska any fees after finding that defendants and the delaware plaintiffs have rebutted the presumption that alaska and its attorneys were a cause of the second price increase.alaska and its attorneys did not in any way contribute to the higher price.
alaska makes two arguments on appeal.first,it contends that the defendants did not rebut the presumption of causation in its favor which we previously held to apply in this case specifically,we held it is defendants burden to establish that the pending alaska lawsuit did not in anyway contribute to the second price increase alaska argues it is entitled to an award of attorneys fees and costs because the court of chancery erroneously applied this demanding standard.second,and in the alternative,it contends the court of chancery erred in permitting the defendants to shield three emails from discovery under the privilege.we conclude that the court of chancery applied the proper legal precepts in placing the burden on the defendants to demonstrate that alaska was in no way a cause of the tender offer increase.although the presumption of causation is a demanding one,it is rebuttable.because the record supports the vice chancellor finding that defendants carried their burden of proof,the court of chancery did not abuse its discretion in denying alaska application for attorneys fees and costs.we also find no abuse of discretion by the vice chancellor in denying alaska motion to compel discovery.accordingly,we affirm.
facts and procedural history 
lyon homes is a delaware corporation,headquartered in california,that designs,builds and sells single family homes.before the tender offer that precipitated this litigation,lyon was lyon homes chairman,chief executive officer and largest stockholder.lyon owned approximately of the company stock and controlled slightly more than half of its voting power.on march,lyon announced a tender offer to acquire the remaining stock for per share.
the same day that the tender offer was announced,alaska,a lyon homes stockholder,filed a complaint in the superior court of california.a few days later,individual stockholders filed two separate lawsuits in the delaware court of chancery.the three actions purported to be class actions brought on behalf of all lyons homes public stockholders,alleging similar breaches of fiduciary duty and disclosure claims relating to the tender offer.the court of chancery consolidated the two delaware actions and granted expedited discovery.after alaska moved for expedited discovery in the california action,the california superior court directed alaska to coordinate its discovery with that being conducted by the delaware plaintiffs.
on april,the delaware plaintiffs entered into a memorandum of understanding with lyon and the other defendants the original settlement,agreeing,inter alia,to increase the offer price from to per share and to provide additional disclosures.lyon also agreed not to oppose an attorneys fee award of up to million and the delaware plaintiffs agreed not to seek more than that amount.
despite an invitation from the parties to the memorandum,alaska declined to join the original settlement.alaska participated in the confirmatory discovery conducted by the delaware plaintiffs,and on april,sought a temporary restraining order in california to prevent consummation of the tender offer.the california superior court denied alaska motion.
between april and april,a major stockholder of lyon homes,chesapeake partners limited partnership chesapeake,began discussions with lyon about the tender offer price.chesapeake participation in the tender offer was important to lyon because without chesapeake,he would be unable to acquire of the outstanding stock to complete a merger.at some point during those negotiations,chesapeake contacted alaska to determine its position.alaska told chesapeake that the revised offer price of per share was too low and that a fair price would be between and per share.subsequently,chesapeake agreed with lyon to tender its shares at per share,which became the final tender offer price.
on june,after the tender offer was completed,the parties to the delaware action filed a stipulation of settlement the final settlement.before the final settlement hearing,delaware plaintiffs requested an award of the agreed upon million in attorneys fees,based solely on the disclosures obtained and the price increase from to.on july,alaska moved to intervene in the delaware action for the purpose of presenting its own fee application.alaska requested of any fee ultimately awarded,on the theory that it was responsible for the price increase to,responsible for the additional disclosures,and responsible for the price increase to.the court of chancery approved the final settlement,awarded million to the delaware plaintiffs,and denied alaska fee request.
alaska appealed to this court the denial of its attorneys fees request,arguing that it was entitled to a presumption that its litigation contributed to the beneficial outcome achieved for the class.we held that the court of chancery acted well within its discretion in concluding that alaska was not entitled to any fees with respect to the original settlement,but that alaska was entitled to a presumption of causation related to the subsequent increase from per share to per share,which it was not afforded by the court of chancery we remanded for further proceedings 
on remand,the parties conducted additional discovery,including document production,interrogatories,and depositions.following the completion of document discovery but before the depositions,alaska moved to compel the production of three emails that defendants withheld,citing the privilege.the court of chancery denied alaska motion to compel,holding that although the emails may be discoverable,examination of the emails was not yet required because alaska had an upcoming opportunity to depose the lyon defendants and their defense counsel.following this ruling,the depositions were taken.
general lyon testified at his deposition that his solitary goal was to obtain enough shares to satisfy the majority of the minority condition and complete the tender offer.accomplishment of that goal had nothing to do with alaska counsel or the california action.general lyon and his son,william lyon,asserted the privilege when questioned regarding communications with their counsel leading up to the price increase.alaska neither renewed its motion to compel the emails nor did it otherwise seek the intervention of the court of chancery to overrule the lyon defendants privilege objections discovery was completed and a hearing was held on alaska motion for attorneys fees and costs.
the vice chancellor found that defendants and the delaware plaintiffs have rebutted the presumption that alaska and its attorneys were a cause of the second price increase.alaska and its attorneys did not in any way contribute to the higher price.regarding alaska allegations of discovery violations,the vice chancellor held that if there was a problem with the discovery,the appropriate course would have been to seek the court assistance in resolving it.the court of chancery denied alaska application for attorneys fees and costs and this appeal followed.
