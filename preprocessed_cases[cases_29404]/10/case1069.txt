factual background 
knutson day trial subscription to sirius xm radio 
sirius xm is a satellite radio service that broadcasts channels to more than million subscribers.sirius xm has arrangements with many major automakers,including toyota,to install satellite radio receivers in new vehicles.under these arrangements,automakers,including toyota,include a trial subscription to sirius xm for some fixed period of time with the purchase or lease of a vehicle.in november,knutson purchased a toyota tacoma truck,which came with a day trial subscription to sirius xm satellite radio.knutson sirius xm account was activated on november,for a trial period ending february.
on november,sirius xm mailed a welcome kit to knutson.the welcome kit arrived in the mail on or about december,over a month after knutson satellite receiver was activated.the welcome kit contained a sirius xm customer agreement.
ii.sirius xm customer agreement 
the sirius xm customer agreement sets out the terms and conditions of use during a day trial subscription.the agreement states that failure to cancel the subscription within three business days of activation legally binds the customer to the agreement 
by accessing or using the site or the service,you agree to be legally bound by this agreement.please do not use the site or the service if you do not agree with this agreement.
if you do not accept these terms,please notify immediately and we will cancel your subscription.if you do not cancel your subscription within business days of activation of your receiver,it will mean that you agree to this agreement which will be legally binding on you.
a separate section entitled,cancellation,provides you may cancel your subscription at any time by notifying listener care.your cancellation will become effective on your next subscription cycle date.
sirius xm also retains the right to modify the customer agreement by unilateral amendment and the posting of such amended version on the sirius xm website.section of the agreement reserves sirius xm right to change the terms of the agreement at any time,and makes the changes effective once sirius xm posts the revised terms on its website.customers are also advised to review the website from time to time to check for revisions.
the arbitration provision 
the arbitration provision of the customer agreement states that any dispute may be resolved by binding arbitration.by agreeing to arbitration,you are hereby waiving the right to go to court,including the right to a jury.the agreement requires that t he party initiating arbitration must follow the rules and procedures of the american arbitration association aaa and the parties agree that the arbitration shall be administered by the aaa.a copy of the aaa rules did not accompany the customer agreement in the welcome kit.
parties also waive their right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis.the customer does not have the right to act as a class representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any claim submitted to arbitration class action waiver.the class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes and is nonseverable from this agreement to arbitrate.but the validity and effect of the class action waiver must be decided by a court.
whoever files for arbitration pays the initial filing fee,unless that party obtains a fee waiver.if the customer prevails,sirius xm will reimburse the filing fee.if there is a hearing,sirius xm will pay the arbitrator fees for the first day of the hearing,and other fees will be allocated as provided by the rules of the arbitration firm and applicable law.the customer will not be required to reimburse sirius xm for any arbitration filing,administrative,or hearing fees in an amount greater than what their court costs would have been if the claim had been resolved in a state court with jurisdiction.each party bears its own costs,regardless of which party prevails,but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator,applying applicable law,so determines.
if any portion of the arbitration agreement or the class action waiver is limited,voided or can not be enforced,then the parties agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding.the parties have the right to appeal the limitation or invalidation of the class action waiver.the limited or voided portion of the arbitration agreement would then be severed,and the rest of the arbitration agreement will continue to apply.if the entire arbitration agreement is declared null and void,then the parties agree that any actions shall be brought in the state or federal courts of new york,new york.
knutson did not read the customer agreement when it arrived in the mail because he did not think that any of the documents contained therein were a contract governing the terms of sirius service.knutson stated,
i did not realize that there was an arbitration clause in the customer agreement until my attorneys so informed me i was not given an opportunity to review the arbitration clause or even the customer agreement itself at the time that my receiver was activated given that the customer agreement was not provided to me at that time.
knutson neither contacted sirius regarding his subscription,nor asked to end his trial subscription.
during the day trial period,knutson received three telemarketing calls from sirius xm.knutson alleges that these calls were unauthorized and unsolicited,and violated the telephone consumer protection act.knutson then sought to become a representative plaintiff in a nationwide class action asserting violations of the telephone consumer protection act.
procedural background 
in february,knutson brought a class action suit against sirius xm,alleging violations of the federal telephone consumer protection act.in response to knutson class action complaint,sirius xm filed a motion to compel arbitration on april.sirius xm asserted that the customer agreement is a binding contract that governs the parties relationship.thus,the customer agreement requires knutson to arbitrate on an individual basis and waive any right to participate as a class representative with respect to any claim against sirius xm.
on may,knutson filed an opposition to sirius xm motion to compel arbitration.knutson responded that the customer agreement was not binding because sirius xm mailed the agreement over a month after the designated period in which knutson could reject the terms of the agreement.therefore,knutson argued,there was no mutual assent to the terms.knutson also claimed that enforcement of the arbitration clause would limit his potential remedies,specifically his statutory right to seek damages under the telephone consumer protection act.in addition,knutson alleged that sirius xm customer agreement is unenforceable as it is an unconscionable adhesion contract.
on may,district judge anthony battaglia held that there was a binding contract requiring arbitration because the terms of the customer agreement are conspicuous,and the contract is enforceable even though knutson received the agreement over one month after the service was activated.although the arbitration provision in the customer agreement had elements of procedural unconscionability for failing to provide a copy of the aaa rules,the agreement contains all the hallmarks of substantive conscionability.the district court granted sirius xm motion to compel arbitration,and dismissed knutson case.the instant appeal followed.

discussion 
the federal arbitration act faa provides that arbitration agreements generally shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable.but where grounds exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,courts may decline to enforce such agreements.id.this provision reflects both a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration,and the fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract.at t mobility llc concepcion,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.under the faa,the basic role for courts is to determine whether a valid agreement to arbitrate exists and,if it does,whether the agreement encompasses the dispute at issue.chiron ortho diagnostic,cir see also at t,commc ns workers of,d.
as explained below,applying principles of contract law,we conclude that no valid agreement to arbitrate exists between knutson and sirius xm because knutson never assented to the customer agreement.
no valid agreement exists between knutson and sirius xm.
sirius xm,as the party seeking to compel arbitration,has the burden of proving the existence of an agreement to arbitrate by a preponderance of the evidence.rosenthal great fin.sec,cal th,d.
a rbitration is a matter of contract.at t,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.state contract law controls whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate.circuit city stores,adams,cir noting that although the faa preempts state laws that are only applicable to arbitration agreements,general contract principles and defenses grounded in state contract law,may operate to invalidate arbitration agreements citing doctor,casarotto,d.
a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf nav,d.it is undisputed that under california law,mutual assent is a required element of contract formation.mutual assent may be manifested by written or spoken words,or by conduct,binder aetna life ins,th,d,and acceptance of contract terms may be implied through action or inaction,see carnival cruise lines,shute,d.thus,an offeree,knowing that an offer has been made to him but not knowing all of its terms,may be held to have accepted,by his conduct,whatever terms the offer contains.windsor mills,collins aikman,d.courts must determine whether the outward manifestations of consent would lead a reasonable person to believe the offeree has assented to the agreement.meyer benko,d.
knutson contends that there was no mutual assent to enter into the customer agreement because he was never given the opportunity to accept or reject the agreement.sirius xm asserts that after knutson received the customer agreement,he had an opportunity to both review it and to notify sirius xm if he wished to cancel his subscription,but knutson did neither.instead,sirius xm argues,knutson continued using sirius xm service,which indicated his acceptance of the customer agreement,and thus a valid contract between the parties was formed.accordingly,we consider whether a reasonable person in knutson position would understand that he had assented to the arbitration provision in the sirius xm customer agreement when he purchased the vehicle from toyota,and whether failure to cancel the trial subscription to sirius xm after he received the customer agreement constituted an objective manifestation of his assent to the arbitration provision.
a n offeree,regardless of apparent manifestation of his consent,is not bound by inconspicuous contractual provisions of which he was unaware,contained in a document whose contractual nature is not obvious.windsor mills,d at.this principle of knowing consent applies with particular force to provisions for arbitration.id.if a party wishes to bind in writing another to an agreement to arbitrate future disputes,such purpose should be accomplished in a way that each party to the arrangement will fully and clearly comprehend that the agreement to arbitrate exists and binds the parties thereto.com.factors kurtzman,d,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.that is not the case here.
when knutson purchased his vehicle from toyota,he did not receive any documents from sirius xm,and he did not know that he was entering into a contractual relationship with sirius xm by using the service.instead,he believed that sirius xm trial subscription was a complimentary service provided for marketing purposes.
as far as knutson was concerned,then,he had not entered into an agreement for service with sirius xm when he purchased the vehicle.he was,as far as he knew,only in a contractual relationship with toyota.a reasonable person in knutson position could not be expected to understand that purchasing a vehicle from toyota would simultaneously bind him or her to any contract with sirius xm,let alone one that contained an arbitration provision without any notice of such terms.n either expressly or impliedly,neither directly or indirectly,did the parties ever discuss arbitration or bargain about it,and certainly they reached no agreement thereon.com.factors,d at.
sirius xm argues nevertheless that although there was a delay between the activation of the service and knutson receipt of the customer agreement,knutson continued use of its service after that receipt constituted his assent to be bound to the customer agreement.sirius xm cites golden eagle ins.foremost ins,which states that a s a general rule,silence or inaction does not constitute acceptance of an offer.there are several exceptions to this rule.acceptance of an offer may be inferred from inaction in the face of a duty to act and from retention of the benefit offered.th,d citations omitted see also cal.a voluntary acceptance of the benefit of a transaction is equivalent to a consent to all the obligations arising from it,so far as the facts are known,or ought to be known,to the person accepting.
nothing in the record,however,indicates that sirius xm offer was clearly and effectively communicated to knutson by mailing him the customer agreement.knutson would only have had notice of his opportunity to cancel his subscription,or the effect of his continued use of the service,if he opened the welcome kit from sirius and read all of the documents therein,which in view of his lack of awareness of any contractual relationship with sirius he had no reason to do.he could not be obligated to act where there was no effective notice that action was required.accordingly,knutson continued use of the service after his receipt of the customer agreement did not manifest his assent to the provisions in the customer agreement.
sirius xm further argues that its customer agreement is a valid shrinkwrap agreement where the consumer purchases prior to getting the detailed terms of the contract.meridian project,hardin const,llc,d.as a general rule,a party can not avoid the terms of a contract by failing to read them before signing.see marin storage trucking benco contracting eng g,th,d.yet a n exception to this general rule exists when the writing does not appear to be a contract and the terms are not called to the attention of the recipient.in such a case,no contract is formed with respect to the undisclosed term.id.that is what happened her
