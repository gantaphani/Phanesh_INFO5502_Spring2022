this appeal stems from the merger of the union pacific railroad company union pacific with the southern pacific rail corporation and its subsidiaries collectively southern pacific.acting on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated,james spaulding spaulding,lyn swonger swonger,donald inman and william nance have brought suit against their union,the united transportation union union,and union pacific.plaintiffs a collective term used here to embrace the entire putative class,not just the named plaintiffs are former employees of southern pacific now employed by union pacific.they charge that union breached its duty of fair representation in negotiating implementation agreements associated with the merger and that union pacific colluded in that breach and wrongfully interfered with plaintiffs contractual rights.
after reviewing the parties submissions on defendants motions for summary judgment under.rule,the district court granted those motions as to all claims.plaintiffs now appeal,asserting two grounds for reversal 
their claims as to the kansas city and saint louis hubs are not barred by the statute of limitations.
as to the salinas hub,the district court had,and we now have,subject matter jurisdiction to hear their claims.

standard of review 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as did the district court gossett oklahoma ex rel.bd.of regents for langston,cir.under rule c summary judgment is appropriate only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law celotex catrett,d thiessen capital,cir.for that purpose,familiar rule principles impose on defendants as movants the initial burden of establishing the lack of a genuine issue of material fact celotex,at.if that burden is met,plaintiffs as nonmovants must then come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial matsushita indus.zenith radio,d quoting rule e but adding emphasis.on that score an issue is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party anderson liberty lobby,d.finally,in making our determination we,like the district court,are required to examine all of the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiffs as nonmovants thiessen,at.
background 
we begin by rehearsing the complex factual background,essential to a full understanding of the current dispute.this case has its factual beginnings in when the chicago,rock island and pacific railroad company rock island filed for bankruptcy.plaintiffs were originally employed by rock island and later became employees of the louis southwestern railway company ssw after it purchased a portion of rock island trackage known as the tucumcari line in.currently plaintiffs are employees of union pacific as a result of its merger with southern pacific and its subsidiary ssw.they are also members of union,their federally recognized collective bargaining organization.
seniority,prior rights and the new york dock conditions 
at the core of this action are the system seniority dates that railroad employees use to bid on particular jobs and schedules.normally the date on which an employee took his or her first compensated trip for his or her current employer is the seniority date.if two employees bid on the same job,the one with the earlier seniority date normally wins the bid.but if a less senior employee retains a prior right at a particular job location,he or she could prevail at that location over a more senior bidder who has more seniority with the employer but who lacks such a locational prior right.
seniority dates and prior rights are a major source of contention in railroad mergers.to fulfill its statutory obligation of safeguarding affected workers while still facilitating implementation of beneficial mergers,the surface transportation board board often imposes the new york dock conditions as a condition of merger approval those provisions require carriers to provide affected employees with economic protections significant in both amount and duration.
prior litigation 
ssw purchase of rock island tucumcari line in was pursuant to an agreement executed on march,march agreement that provided for preferential hiring of the rock island employees by ssw and other carriers taking over rock island trackage.to effectuate the march agreement,ssw and union entered into an implementing agreement in implementing agreement,which provided among other things that former rock island employees hired by ssw before that agreement would receive a system seniority date of march,while the seniority dates of those hired after the implementing agreement would coincide with their actual dates of hire by ssw.
federal litigation then ensued when a class of former rock island employees brought suit,alleging that the implementing agreement violated their preferential hiring rights and their rights to retain their rock island seniority dates as established in the march agreement.after protracted litigation and a settlement,volkman united transp.union,rev in part on other grounds,cir established that no entitlement to retain rock island seniority dates derived from the march agreement.instead march,was confirmed as the system seniority date for former rock island employees,including plaintiffs,hired by ssw before the implementing agreement.at.volkman also established that the former rock island employees were entitled to prior rights at their ssw terminal of first hire id.at,but those prior rights would be subject to future modification through collective bargaining volkman.july.
in board approved a merger between union pacific and southern.one consequence was that the former rock island employees on the tucumcari line would again be displaced.to protect those and other affected workers,board required that union pacific comply with the new york dock conditions in implementing the merger.pursuant to new york dock conditions art.i,union pacific gave notice to union on october,january,and june,of its intention to establish three operational hubs in the same order as those notification dates,saint louis,missouri kansas city,kansas and salina,kansas.extensive negotiations were undertaken,seeking to design mutually satisfactory implementation plans for the three hubs,including the seniority systems to be used for commingling the union pacific and southern pacific workforces.those negotiations are the genesis of the present action.
union const.requires that in effectuating a merger general committees of adjustment shall arrange for a fair and equitable division of the work and that p rior seniority rights of employees to service on their former seniority district or territory shall be preserved to the extent possible.union maintains that the integration of seniority lists in the event of a railroad merger is best accomplished by dovetailing,and it sought to use that method in creating a consolidated seniority roster at each of the three hubs.dovetailing accomplishes consolidation by using the seniority date of each employee on the properties involved in the merger.
throughout the extended negotiations union held to the position that the former rock island employees would retain their prior rights on the tucumcari line as to ssw employees,but that they would gain no prior rights with respect to union pacific employees.as for seniority,union officials repeatedly asserted at a series of local meetings and negotiation planning sessions that former rock island employees would be assigned their ssw seniority dates rather than their rock island dates for dovetailing purposes that is,employees hired by ssw before the implementing agreement would receive a seniority date of march,rather than their earlier dates of hire by rock island.plaintiffs union representative,associate general chairman don hollis hollis,specifically inquired whether the rock island seniority date would be granted,and he was repeatedly told that it would not.employees affected by that negative answer contend that the failure to make such assignment violated the provisions of volkman.
implementing agreements 
after that series of negotiations,union and union pacific executed implementing agreements on july and,for the louis and kansas city hubs.those agreements provided that dovetailing would be effected by using each employee current seniority date on the line on which he or she was currently employed and that each employee would be assigned new prior rights in abrogation of all existing prior rights,although it was provided that the prior rights held by the former rock island employees on the tucumcari line would be retained other ssw employees.in accordance with union constitution,those agreements were put to a ratification vote and were approved by a majority of all the local chairmen.
union pacific and affected union representatives conducted a workshop between september and,to consolidate the seniority rosters for the two hubs.once again the issue of seniority dates for the former rock island employees was raised,and once again it was made clear that those employees would be assigned their ssw seniority date of march.plaintiffs told union pacific and union representatives at that time that they did not agree to that provision.
meanwhile plaintiffs had continued objecting to the proposal that their seniority dates after merger implementation would correspond to their dates of hire by ssw rather than by rock island.in august hollis again questioned that position with union officials.union president little scheduled a september,meeting in seattle,washington to discuss the union position was once again reconfirmed.
on november,union pacific began to operate the saint louis hub under the terms of the implementing agreement.then on november union pacific served notice of its intent to establish a negotiated implementing agreement for the salina hub with terms similar to those of the kansas city and saint louis agreements.another workshop to construct a consolidated seniority roster was conducted from november.
on december,union and union pacific held a meeting to address hollis continuing concerns as well as other implementation issues in kansas city and saint louis.there it was again reiterated that the former rock island employees would not be permitted to use their original rock island seniority dates for the dovetailed rosters and that they would retain prior rights on the tucumcari line other ssw employees.despite the repeated rejection of his position,on december,hollis refused to sign the salina implementing agreement.because union constitution requires the approval of all general chairmen in affected jurisdictions before such agreements may be submitted for ratification,on january,union pacific invoked arbitration under new york dock conditions art.i,to procure an implementing agreement for the salina hub.
next in the chronology,the kansas city hub was implemented on january.arbitration as to the salina hub began shortly thereafter on february.despite plaintiffs arguments that they were wrongfully being denied the right to use their rock island hire dates,on march,the arbitrator ruled to adopt the proposed salina implementing agreement.pursuant to the new york dock conditions,spaulding and swonger appealed that decision to board,and they moved to stay implementation of the salina hub pending resolution of the appeals process.board denied that request for a stay,and the salina hub was implemented on may.
plaintiffs had meanwhile written letters to various union officials expressing their dissatisfaction with the negotiated seniority arrangement.on february,spaulding sought to obtain a hearing before the union board of appeals regarding plaintiffs seniority rights by mailing a letter to union general secretary and treasurer.that request was denied by union president on march.
on june,plaintiffs filed the present action,contending primarily that by accepting the implementing agreements both union and union pacific had abandoned the seniority rights to which plaintiffs were entitled.more specifically,union is charged with breaching its duty of fair representation and union pacific is accused of colluding in the breach and interfering with plaintiffs contractual rights.as stated earlier,both defendants filed motions for summary judgment on all that the district court granted on december,on the grounds that claims regarding the saint louis and kansas city hubs were barred by the statute of limitations and it lacked jurisdiction to hear claims regarding the salina hub.
while defendants summary judgment motions were pending,board declined plaintiffs petition for review of the decision in the salina arbitration on may.plaintiffs sought judicial review of that decision in this court on june,and another panel of this court rejected their arguments in swonger surface transp,cir.
kansas city and saint louis hub of limitations 
plaintiffs concede that a statute of limitations applies to their claim under the railway labor act,as well as to any directly linked breach of contract claim against union pacific,pursuant to delcostello int l of teamsters,d and such delcostello progeny as repstine burlington,cir.but they urge that such a limitations period was tolled by either the doctrine of equitable estoppel or their pursuit of internal union appeals.it will be recalled that plaintiffs filed this suit on june.because we explain below that their claim accrued before december,and thus more than six months before they brought suit,their claim is time barred unless the statute of limitations was tolled.
it has long been established that a claim accrues and the limitation period begins to run when an employee knows or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known or discovered the acts constituting the union alleged violations edwards int l union,united plant guard workers of,cir,quoting lucas mountain states,cir per curiam.as for plaintiffs claims regarding negotiation of the saint louis and kansas city implementing agreements,they were clearly aware of any alleged union malfeasance by july and,when the agreements expressly rejecting their position were executed.and as the district court correctly held,plaintiffs were on notice of their claims at the latest by september,when the consolidated seniority rosters were constructed with the use of their ssw seniority dates.moreover,the agreements were ratified by a majority vote of the local chairmen in september with even hollis signing the agreements.there is thus no question that plaintiffs claim as to those two hubs accrued well before december,and hence more than six months before suit was filed rucker louis sw ry,cir landry air line pilots ass int l,cir zapp united transp.union,cir.
equitable estoppel 
but plaintiffs waited nearly a year after the implementing agreements were executed,and over eight months after the consolidated seniority roster was constructed,before they brought an action asserting their fair representation claim.they attempt to avert the bar of untimeliness by invoking the doctrine of equitable estoppel and arguing that union misrepresentations led them to delay filing.equitable estoppel prevent s a party from taking a legal position inconsistent with an earlier statement or action that places his adversary at a disadvantage penny giuffrida,cir.there are four elements of a traditional estoppel claim id.at 
the party to be estopped must know the facts the party to be estopped must intend that his conduct will be acted upon or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel has the right to believe that it was so intended the party asserting the estoppel must be ignorant of the true facts and the party asserting the estoppel must rely on the other party conduct to his injury.
and mere reliance is not reliance on an adversary misrepresentations must have been reasonable in that the party claiming the estoppel did not know nor should it have known that its adversary conduct was misleading heckler cmty.health,d emery mining sec y of labor,cir.
plaintiffs argue that the conduct of union officials misled them into believing that their seniority was still an open issue.they cite several statements that assertedly indicated either that their rock island seniority dates would be used or that the issue was unresolved.for example,at least three plaintiffs declare that hollis told them they would be granted their rock island seniority date when the hub implementing agreements went into effect,thereby inducing them to vote to approve the implementing agreements.indeed,one plaintiff contends the kansas city plaintiffs were initially told that the implementing agreements allowed them to use their rock island dates.but even when all of those claims are credited,they lose effect because all of the statements were made before the consolidated seniority rosters were constructed.once the rosters were put together by using ssw dates,plaintiffs could not reasonably believe the agreements allowed them to use their rock island dates.so those claimed representations can not toll the limitations period.
plaintiffs further assert that even after roster construction hollis continued to represent that they would receive their rock island seniority dates.they claim they were told that the seniority issue would be resolved at the december,meeting in cleveland.they also contend they were told that union would use the arbitration regarding the salina hub as a guise to address saint louis and kansas city seniority.
even if it were assumed that those remarks amounted to misrepresentation and that union officials had reason to believe plaintiffs would rely on the statements to delay filing their claim,the district court correctly found that plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate such reliance was reasonable.indeed,it was patently unreasonable for plaintiffs to rely on hollis repeated assurances that their seniority was still an open issue.they should have known they could not count on any suggestion by hollis that he could singlehandedly alter previously executed implementing agreements indeed,signed by hollis himself as well as all other general chairmen and that union had not settled on its that scenario could not justify their sitting back without taking the action required to advance their claim.
nor did hollis later reversal of his own support for the implementing agreements in his october,letter to a union pacific at all indicate that union position had changed.to the contrary,union unwaveringly held the same position it had held all along.in sum,any claimed reliance on hollis lone wolf promises made in defiance of union consistent rejection of his rejection of which plaintiffs were admittedly simply not reasonable.
as for plaintiffs awareness,swonger and spaulding have both declared that at the december,meeting hollis was not successful in dissuading the utu and the up from following the course they had previously set.that of course is an admission to having known that union position on the issue was settled before the december meeting.as the district court aptly noted 
p laintiffs may have reasonably hoped that hollis could convince the union to change its previous position,but they could not reasonably believe the union had not taken a position.
as for plaintiffs profoundly unspecific assertion that union itself somehow represented that the december meeting would resolve the seniority issue,even with the benefit of favorable,we repeat,must be can not be said that union knew the seniority issue was conclusively resolved but nevertheless misled plaintiffs as to the status of the issue.because plaintiffs have presented no evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that reliance on that purported union representation was reasonable,summary judgment is appropriate anderson,at.richmond oneok,cir.
as plaintiffs would have it,some unspecified time and through some unspecified made a statement that seniority would be resolved at the december meeting.it was to negate the use of just such amorphous claims to avert summary judgment that the supreme court said in the first of its trilogy of cases construing rule,matsushita,at.
second,the issue of fact must be genuine.fed.rules civ.proc.c,e.when the moving party has carried its burden under rule c,its opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.
in the face of the overwhelming abundance and consistency of union statements and conduct confirming that the issue was already conclusively resolved to plaintiffs detriment,no tenable support justifies plaintiffs delay in filing a claim.
unwilling to acknowledge the compelling force of the wealth of evidence refuting their contention,plaintiffs urge that the district court improperly resolved disputed issues of material fact as to what representations were made and whether plaintiffs reliance was reasonable.that simply mischaracterizes the district court reasoning.instead of resolving disputed factual issues,it assumed all of plaintiffs allegations to be true and found that their uncontroverted knowledge that the executed implementing agreements rejected the use of their rock island seniority dates rendered reliance on any contrary representations unreasonable.without reasonable reliance there can be no estoppel emery mining,at.we review the district court refusal to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel for abuse of discretion arnold air midwest,cir,and we find the district court ruling an indisputably proper exercise of its sound discretion.
internal appeals 
caselaw here as elsewhere teaches that pursuing internal union appeals can also toll the statute of limitations even if the appeals ultimately prove futile volkman,at.but plaintiffs fatal difficulty in that respect is that no such appeal was taken in accordance with union constitution.
union const.provides in relevant part 
any local or member of a local affected by action or decision of a chairperson,sub general committee or general committee,or by the decision of the international president with respect to this article may appeal such action or decision to the board of appeals,provided such appeal is filed with the general secretary and treasurer within ninety days from the date of the action or decision.the chairperson,sub general committee,general committee,or international president,as the case may be,shall be allowed thirty days from the date the appeal is filed in which to reply to the appeal.the parties involved in an appeal shall exchange copies of the appeal and reply to the appeal.
it is uncontroverted that hollis failed to file a formal appeal with union general secretary and treasurer as article requires.and his informal objections and correspondence with union and union pacific officials could not serve as proxy for the prescribed dispute resolution procedures cohen flushing hosp.med,cir pantoja holland motor express,cir.as the seventh circuit has prudently noted quoting pantoja in part,if the rule were otherwise plaintiffs could toll the statute indefinitely by making repeated informal requests to different union officials for further review christiansen apv crepaco,cir.
in an effort to overcome that fatal defect,plaintiffs argue on appeal that a general chairman talking to and corresponding with union leaders actually constitutes an alternate method of pursuing a formal appeal under union constitution.they point to this earlier language in const.
disputes arising under this article which can not be resolved by the general committee or general committees shall be referred to the international president.the international president shall promptly assign an officer to assist the general committee or general committees involved in resolving the dispute.failing to resolve the dispute the officer shall make a complete report and recommendation to the international president who,in turn,shall decide the dispute.
but that position is equally flawed,for it is plain that the quoted procedure was not involved in the situation at issue.it will be remembered that hollis further effort sought instead to obtain reconsideration of a decision that
