the fourth district court of appeal has certified the following question to us as one of great public importance 
does the florida contraband forfeiture act preempt local governments from adopting ordinances imposing forfeiture of personal property for misdemeanor offenses 
mulligan city of hollywood,so d,dca the fourth district answered this question in the affirmative.we rephrase the question as follows 
does the florida contraband forfeiture act fcfa,sections,florida statutes,preempt a municipality from adopting an ordinance that authorizes the seizure and impoundment of vehicles used in the commission of certain misdemeanor offenses 
we answer this rephrased question in the negative.we hold that the fcfa does not preempt a municipality from using its home rule powers to enact such an ordinance.therefore,we quash the decision of the fourth district and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
this case arose from a suit brought by colon bernard mulligan mulligan against the city of hollywood city challenging the validity of the city vehicle impoundment ordinance,section,hollywood,florida,code of ordinances.mulligan was arrested by city police officers for soliciting a prostitute in violation of section,florida statutes,a misdemeanor offense.because mulligan was in his vehicle at the time of the solicitation,the police officers seized and impounded his vehicle pursuant to the city ordinance.
as provided by the ordinance,mulligan appeared before a special master and argued that the seizure was not supported by probable cause.the special master disagreed.finding probable cause to support the seizure,the special master imposed the sanction as provided for in the ordinance.the special master ordered mulligan to either pay a administrative fine or forfeit the bond he had previously posted.mulligan paid the administrative fine,and the vehicle was returned to him.
mulligan then brought suit against the city seeking a declaratory judgment that the ordinance is invalid.the action was certified as a class action,and mulligan was named class representative.mulligan and the city filed for summary judgment.the trial court granted the city motion for summary judgment.
on appeal,the fourth district reversed.finding that the ordinance effects a criminal forfeiture of the vehicles seized and is therefore a forfeiture scheme,mulligan,so d at,the fourth district held the ordinance is preempted by or,in the alternative,is in conflict with the fcfa.id.at.
ii.analysis 
as stated earlier,we hold that the fcfa does not preempt municipalities from adopting ordinances authorizing the seizure and impoundment of vehicles used in the commission of enumerated misdemeanor offenses.after we explain our rationale for this holding on the primary question of preemption,we turn to the alternative basis the fourth district relies on to invalidate the ordinance.this alternative basis is that the fcfa and the ordinance conflict.as we explain,the ordinance does not conflict with the fcfa.however,in this discussion,we do note our agreement with the fourth district that the ordinance raises significant constitutional concerns.finally,we explain the distinction between an impoundment and a forfeiture which prompted our rephrasing of the certified question.
a.the fcfa does not preempt the adoption of municipal ordinances authorizing the seizure and impoundment of vehicles 
in analyzing the preemption question,we describe the city ordinance highlight the law of preemption discuss the fcfa and,finally,apply the law of preemption to the ordinance and the fcfa.as for our standard of review,the fourth district ruling on the validity of the ordinance is a question of law subject to de novo review by this court.see state,so d,finding that rulings on the constitutionality of several ordinances should be reviewed de novo citing city of miami mcgrath,so d.
the city ordinance 
section of the hollywood,florida,code of ordinances is entitled vehicle impoundment.this ordinance was enacted on may,as part of ordinance its purpose is to aid the city law enforcement in deterring crimes related to drugs and prostitution.the ordinance authorizes the seizure and impoundment of motor vehicles whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains cannabis or a controlled substance under chapter of the florida statutes was used to purchase or attempt to purchase cannabis or a controlled substance or was used to facilitate the commission of an act of prostitution,assignation,or lewdness pursuant to section,florida statutes.a,ord.significantly,each of the offenses enumerated in the ordinance is a misdemeanor crime,and,by its express terms,the ordinance does not apply when a vehicle is subject to seizure under the fcfa.c,ord.
the ordinance requires that upon seizing and impounding a vehicle for one or more of the enumerated misdemeanor offenses,the city police officers must follow a number of procedures.the officer must provide written notice to the owner of the vehicle or the person in control of the vehicle that the vehicle is being impounded by the city of hollywood police department and that there is a right to request a preliminary hearing.b,d,ord.this notice must be delivered either by hand or,if the owner or operator is not available,by certified mail within five days.id.an owner or operator may request a preliminary hearing,and,if requested,the hearing must be held within hours.this preliminary hearing is held before a code enforcement official called a special master who,according to the city,is appointed pursuant to chapter,florida statutes,in lieu of appointing a local government code enforcement board.see.stat.the city bears the burden of showing that the seizure was supported by probable cause.d,ord.if probable cause is shown,the owner can regain possession of the vehicle only by paying an administrative fee of up to plus towing and storage costs or by posting a bond in the same amount.id.if probable cause is not shown,the vehicle is released,and the vehicle owner is not liable for any costs.id.
if the owner does not request a preliminary hearing,or if the special master finds probable cause for the seizure at the preliminary hearing,the city schedules a final hearing and notifies the vehicle owner.e,ord.the final hearing must occur no later than days after the date that the vehicle is impounded.id.at the final hearing,the city must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was properly impounded pursuant to the ordinance and that the owner of the vehicle either knew or should have known that the vehicle was used or was likely to be used in violation of the ordinance.id.if the city fails to establish either of these elements,the vehicle is returned to the owner without penalty.id.if the special master finds that the vehicle is subject to impoundment,an order is then entered finding the record owner of the vehicle civilly liable to the city for an administrative fee,not to exceed,as well as towing and storage costs.id.the vehicle remains impounded until the administrative fees are satisfied.the funds recovered are allocated,first,as reimbursement to the police department for costs incurred in enforcing the ordinance towing and storage,and second,as surplus to the city general fund.g,ord.unclaimed vehicles are subject to florida provisions for the disposition of lost or abandoned property contained in chapter,florida statutes.f,ord.
the law of preemption 
in florida,a municipality is given broad authority to enact ordinances under its municipal home rule powers.art.viii,b,c.stat.under its broad home rule powers,a municipality may legislate concurrently with the legislature on any subject which has not been expressly preempted to the state.wyche state,so d,citing city of miami beach rocio,so d,dca see also barragan city of miami,so d,stating that the municipal home rule powers act limits cities from legislating on any subject expressly preempted to state government by general law.preemption essentially takes a topic or a field in which local government might otherwise establish appropriate local laws and reserves that topic for regulation exclusively by the legislature.phantom of clearwater,pinellas county,so d,dca.express requires a specific statement the can not be made by implication nor by inference.league of cities,dep t of ins.treasurer,so d,dca quoting bd.of trs.dulje,so d,dca see also phantom of clearwater,so d at express preemption must be accomplished by clear language stating that intent.edwards state,so d,dca an express reference is one which is distinctly stated and not left to inference.however,t he preemption need not be explicit so long as it is clear that the legislature has clearly preempted local regulation of the subject.barragan,so d at citing tribune cannella,so d.
the fourth district held that the city ordinance is preempted by the fcfa.it based this holding upon the language of the fcfa policy statement as found in section,florida statutes.we examine this holding by looking at the history and language of the fcfa,in particular section.
the florida contraband forfeiture act 
in,one year after the adoption of the municipal home rule powers act,the legislature adopted the florida uniform contraband transportation act.ch,laws of,codified at.stat.in,the name of this act was changed to the florida contraband forfeiture act fcfa the fcfa was later renumbered to sections and,in,section was amended to include a policy statement.in,this policy statement was amended to its current form 
it is the policy of this state that law enforcement agencies shall utilize the provisions of the florida contraband forfeiture act to deter and prevent the continued use of contraband articles for criminal purposes while protecting the proprietary interests of innocent owners and lienholders and to authorize such law enforcement agencies to use the proceeds collected under the florida contraband forfeiture act as supplemental funding for authorized purposes.the potential for obtaining revenues from forfeitures must not override fundamental considerations such as public safety,the safety of law enforcement officers,or the investigation and prosecution of criminal activity.it is also the policy of this state that law enforcement agencies ensure that,in all seizures made under the florida contraband forfeiture act,their officers adhere to federal and state constitutional limitations regarding an individual right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures,including,but not limited to,the illegal use of stops based on a pretext,searches,or a search based solely upon an individual race or ethnicity.
stat.emphasis added.
relying on this policy statement in section,the fourth district held that the city ordinance is expressly preempted by the fcfa.specifically,the fourth district reasoned that because section provides that law enforcement agencies shall utilize the provisions of the fcfa when forfeiting contraband articles used for criminal purposes,the legislature had expressly preempted municipal criminal contraband forfeiture laws to the state.so d at.the fourth district further found that under section a of the fcfa,the legislature had expressly limited the forfeiture of vehicles to felony offenses.id.
in her special concurrence,judge may disagreed with this finding.she opined that because the fcfa is limited to felonies,the fcfa does not expressly preempt a municipality from legislating with regard to misdemeanors under its municipal home rule powers.id.at may,concurring specially.we agree with judge may on this point.
application of law of preemption to the fcfa and the ordinance 
contrary to the fourth district findings,the words shall utilize alone do not express preemption.this phrase should be read in context and with an eye toward its plain meaning.we have recognized as axiomatic the principle that all parts of a statute must be read together in order to achieve a consistent whole.when possible,we must give full effect to all statutory provisions and construe related statutory provisions in harmony with one another.clines state,so d,citation omitted quoting forsythe longboat key beach erosion control,so d.
in section,the legislature provides that i t is the policy of this state that law enforcement agencies shall utilize the provisions of the florida contraband forfeiture act to deter and prevent the continued use of contraband articles for criminal purposes.the term contraband is a defined term under the fcfa.in pertinent part,the fcfa defines contraband as 
a ny personal property,including any vehicle of any kind which was used or was attempted to be used as an instrumentality in the commission of,or in aiding or abetting in the commission of,any felony,whether or not comprising an element of the felony 
a.stat.emphasis added.when this statutory definition of contraband is placed in the fcfa policy statement,that statement reads as follows 
it is the policy of this state that law enforcement agencies shall utilize the provisions of the fcfa to deter and prevent the continued use of contraband articles,any personal property,including any vehicle of any kind which was used or was attempted to be used as an instrumentality in the commission of,or in aiding or abetting in the commission of,any felony,whether or not comprising an element of the felony for criminal purposes.
a.stat.emphasis added.read in this manner,the fcfa policy statement refers to contraband articles,such as vehicles,as those articles that are connected with the commission of felony offenses.stated otherwise,for purposes of preemption,when the statutory definition of contraband is applied to the policy statement in section,the fcfa does not express any intent to preempt seizure and forfeiture in the context of nonfelony offenses 
furthermore,when the fcfa and the question of preemption are considered in light of the municipal home rule powers act,the absence of an express legislative intent to preempt the field of forfeiture in enacting the fcfa becomes more significant.as of,the law in florida was that the subject of forfeiture is a field preempted to the legislature,and a municipality had to expressly be given the authority to legislate in that field.city of miami miller,so d,however,a change in this law occurred in when the municipal home rule powers act was enacted.this act removed all general limitations on a municipality power to legislate in a particular field.see.stat.passed the year before the original version of the fcfa,the municipal home rule powers act does not reserve to the legislature the power to legislate in the field of forfeiture.one can not lightly disregard this omission because the legislature did retain field preemption in other areas.for example,in chapter itself,the legislature preempted the field in regard to ammunition sales.see.stat.no municipality may adopt any ordinance relating to the possession or sale of ammunition.and since,the legislature has continued to use similar preemptive language in other contexts.for instance,regarding the lottery,the legislature stated that a ll matters relating to the operation of the state lottery are preempted to the state,and no county,municipality,or other political subdivision of the state shall enact any ordinance relating to the operation of the lottery authorized by this act.stat.see also.stat.the regulation of manufactured homes installers or mobile home installers is preempted to the state.
given the forgoing analysis,we determine that the fcfa does not preempt to the legislature the field of vehicle seizure and forfeiture,much less impoundment,for misdemeanor offenses.accordingly,in answering the certified question as rephrased,we hold that the fcfa does not preempt a municipality from adopting an ordinance that authorizes the seizure and impoundment of vehicles used in the commission of certain misdemeanors.
b.the ordinance is not in conflict with the fcfa 
as an alternative basis for its decision,the fourth district held that even if the ordinance is not preempted by the fcfa,the ordinance is in conflict with the fcfa because it does not meet the procedural due process requirements of the fcfa.so d at citing dep t of law enforcement real,so d.we disagree.in addition to the absence of preemption,there i
