as a central part of its business,fedex ground package system,fedex,contracts with drivers to deliver packages to its customers.the drivers must wear fedex uniforms,drive vehicles,and groom themselves according to fedex appearance standards.fedex tells its drivers what packages to deliver,on what days,and at what times.although drivers may operate multiple delivery routes and hire third parties to help perform work on those routes,they may do so only with fedex consent.
fedex contends its drivers are independent contractors under oregon law.plaintiffs,two classes of fedex drivers in oregon,contend they are employees.we agree with plaintiffs.
background 
factual background 
named plaintiffs,former fedex drivers,represent two classes comprising approximately individuals who were delivery drivers for fedex in oregon at any time between and.plaintiff class members worked for fedex two operating divisions,fedex ground and fedex home delivery.fedex ground deals primarily with deliveries,while fedex home delivery deals primarily with residential deliveries.the differences between the two divisions do not matter to this appeal.
fedex characterizes its drivers as independent contractors.fedex operating agreement oa governs its relationship with the drivers.the oa background statement provides 
t his agreement will set forth the mutual business objectives of the two parties but the manner and means of reaching these results are within the discretion of the driver,and no officer or employee of fedex shall have the authority to impose any term or condition on the driver which is contrary to this understanding.
a provision of the oa,titled discretion of contractor to determine method and means of meeting business objectives,states 
n o officer,agent or employee of fedex shall have the authority to direct the driver as to the manner or means employed for example,no officer,agent or employee of fedex shall have the authority to prescribe hours of work,whether or when the driver is to take breaks,what route the driver is to follow,or other details of performance.
fedex relationship with its drivers also is governed by various policies and procedures prescribed by fedex.
job requirements 
the oa requires fedex drivers to pick up and deliver packages within their assigned primary service area s.drivers must deliver packages every day that fedex is open for business and must deliver every package they are assigned each day.they must deliver each package within a specific window of time negotiated between fedex and its customers.after each delivery,drivers must use an electronic scanner to send data about the delivery to fedex.fedex does not require drivers to follow specific delivery routes.however,fedex tells its managers to design and recommend to its drivers routes that will reduce travel time and minimize expenses and maximize earnings and service.
fedex does not expressly dictate working hours,but it structures drivers workloads to ensure that they work between and hours every working day.if a driver manager determines that the driver has more work than he or she can reasonably be expected to handle in a to hour day,the manager may reassign part of the driver workload to other drivers.drivers are compensated according to a somewhat complex formula that includes and components.drivers are expected to arrive at their delivery terminals each morning,and they are not supposed to leave the terminal until all of their packages are available for.fedex instructs managers to make sure that drivers properly fill out their paperwork and prepare their packages for delivery.each terminal sets a time by which all drivers must return at the end of the day.if drivers want their trucks loaded by fedex,they must leave their trucks at the terminal overnight.
the oa gives fedex the authority to reconfigure a driver service area upon five days written notice.drivers have the right to propose a plan to avoid reconfiguration,using means satisfactory to fedex.fedex may,in its sole discretion,reject a plan that does not provide reasonable means to continue the driver service area.should a driver service area be reconfigured in such a way that the driver gains customers,fedex may reduce that driver pay to compensate other drivers who lost customers in the reconfiguration.
fedex trains its drivers on how best to perform their job and to interact with customers.the oa provides that,during the first days of the contract term,fedex shall familiarize drivers with various quality service procedures developed by fedex.the oa requires drivers to conduct themselves with integrity and honesty,in a professional manner,and with proper decorum at all times.they must f oster the professional image and good reputation of fedex.
a driver managers may conduct up to four performance evaluations each year,to verify that the driver is meeting the standards of customer service required by the oa.managers are supposed to observe and record small details about each step of a delivery,including whether a driver uses a dolly or cart to move packages,demonstrates a sense of urgency,and p laces his or her keys on the pinky finger of his or her hand after locking the delivery vehicle.after finishing a evaluation,managers are supposed to give immediate feedback to drivers about the quality of their work.fedex contends in this litigation that this feedback constitutes mere recommendations that drivers are free either to follow or disregard.
drivers must follow fedex safe driving standards.these standards prohibit illegal conduct such as d riving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs and u sing a motor vehicle in the commission of a felony.they also forbid some legal conduct,including driving a motor vehicle in a speed exhibition,contest or drag race and c arrying passengers not authorized by fedex.
the oa allows drivers to operate more than one vehicle and route,but only with the consent of fedex and only if consistent with the capacity of the driver terminal.drivers may also hire third parties to help perform their work.helpers must be qualified pursuant to applicable federal,state and municipal safety standards and fedex safe driving standards.they must be fully trained and must conform fully with the oa.drivers in good standing under the oa may assign their rights and obligations to replacement drivers,but any such replacement must be acceptable to fedex.
drivers enter into the oa for an initial term of one,two,or three years.at the end of the initial term,the oa provides for automatic renewal for successive terms if neither party provides notice of their intent not to renew.the oa may be terminated by the parties mutual agreement for cause,including a breach of any provision of the oa if fedex stops doing business or reduces operations in all or part of the driver service area or upon thirty days written notice by the driver.the oa requires drivers to submit claims for wrongful termination to arbitration.
equipment and appearance requirements 
fedex requires its drivers to provide their own vehicles.vehicles must not only meet all applicable federal,state and municipal laws and regulations,but also must be specifically approved by fedex.the oa allows fedex to dictate the identifying colors,logos,numbers,marks and insignia of the vehicles.all vehicles must be painted fedex white,a specific shade of sherwin williams paint,or its equivalent.they must be marked with the fedex logo and maintained in a clean and presentable fashion free of body damage and extraneous markings.fedex requires vehicles to have specific dimensions,and all vehicles must also contain shelves with specific dimensions.fedex requires that a typical package van have 
two shelves per side,full length of the body.they should be,deep with a to pitch and a front lip not to exceed height.top shelf to bottom of roof or roof bow should be minimum.the lower shelf lip to the bottom of the top shelf should be.aluminum is the preferred material,however marine grade plywood is acceptable.
managers may refuse to let drivers work if their vehicles do not meet these requirements.
drivers must provide maintenance at their own expense and must bear all costs and expenses incidental to operation of the vehicle.drivers authorize fedex to pay for vehicle licensing,taxes,and fees,and to deduct these costs from the drivers pay.the oa gives fedex 
such exclusive possession,use,and control of the vehicle as required by applicable regulations,but fedex shall have no right or authority to operate the vehicle for any purpose except for incidental yard movement and positioning unless the vehicle is driven either by the driver or by an operator engaged by the driver.
the oa requires that while vehicles are in the service of fedex,they must be used exclusively for the carriage of the goods of fedex and for no other purpose.drivers may use their vehicles for other commercial or personal purposes when they are not in the service of fedex,but only if all identifying numbers,marks,logos and insignia are removed or covered.
fedex offers a business support package,which provides drivers with uniforms,scanners,and other necessary equipment.fedex deducts the cost of the equipment from drivers pay.purchase of the package is ostensibly optional,but more than percent of drivers purchase it.the scanners that drivers must use to send delivery information to fedex are not readily available from any other source.
the oa requires drivers to comply with standards and to wear a fedex uniform maintained in good condition.the required uniform includes a uniform shirt with the fedex logo,uniform pants or shorts,dark shoes and socks,and,if the driver chooses to wear a jacket or cap,a uniform jacket and cap with the fedex logo.drivers must keep their personal appearance consistent with reasonable standards of good order as promulgated from time to time by fedex.drivers must be clean shaven,hair neat and trimmed,free of body odor.managers may refuse to let drivers work if they are improperly dressed or groomed.
procedural history 
this consolidated appeal involves two class actions originally filed in the district of oregon slayman fedex ground package system,and leighter fedex ground package system.the basis for both cases is plaintiffs claim that fedex improperly classified its drivers as independent contractors,thereby forcing them to incur business expenses and depriving them of benefits otherwise owed to employees under oregon law.except where the differences matter to our holding,we do not distinguish between the two cases.
the slayman plaintiffs brought claims for illegal deductions from wages under,fraud,rescission of the oa,and declaratory relief.the leighter plaintiffs brought claims for illegal deductions from wages under,rescission of the oa,declaratory relief,injunctive relief,unpaid overtime under.and or.admin,and unpaid wages.the named plaintiffs in slayman are edward slayman,dennis mchenry,and jeremy brinker.the named plaintiffs in leighter are jon leighter and david spicer.all the named plaintiffs except leighter had stopped driving for fedex before the complaints were filed.leighter stopped driving for fedex two months after the leighter complaint was filed.
between and,similar cases were filed against fedex in approximately forty states.the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation consolidated these fedex cases,including slayman and leighter,for multidistrict litigation mdl proceedings in the district court for the northern district of indiana the mdl court.plaintiffs moved for class certification.they represented to the mdl court that their claims would rely only on common proof applicable to members of the class as whole.the mdl court certified classes in both slayman and leighter,except for plaintiffs claims for rescission of the oa.the mdl court certified the slayman plaintiffs damages claim under federal rule of civil procedure b and their claim for declaratory relief under rule b.the mdl court certified the leighter plaintiffs damages claims as two subclasses under rule b and their claims for injunctive and declaratory relief under rule b.
plaintiffs in all the mdl cases moved for partial summary judgment,seeking to establish their status as employees as a matter of law.in most cases,fedex for summary judgment.however,fedex did not move for summary judgment in either slayman or leighter.the mdl court denied nearly all of the mdl plaintiffs motions for summary judgment and granted nearly all of fedex motions.in slayman and leighter,the mdl court granted summary judgment sua sponte to fedex,holding that plaintiffs were independent contractors as a matter of law.
the mdl court remanded slayman and leighter to the district court to resolve the drivers rescission claims,for which class certification had not been granted.the district court granted summary judgment to fedex on those claims and entered final judgment.plaintiffs timely appealed,challenging only the mdl court denial of their partial motion for summary judgment and its grant of summary judgment to fedex.fedex conditionally,arguing that if we reverse the mdl court grant of summary judgment to fedex,we should also reverse the mdl court decisions.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court decision whether to grant summary judgment,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party.fichman media,cir.a grant of summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.albino baca,cir en banc quoting.a.we review the district court decisions for abuse of discretion.ellis costco wholesale,cir.
iii.discussion 
certification to the oregon supreme court 
as an initial matter,plaintiffs request that we certify the question of their status to the oregon supreme court.we decline to do so because controlling precedent is available to guide us.fields legacy health,cir citation omitted.this case does not raise an unsettled question of substantive state law.it simply requires us to apply legal tests that oregon courts have applied many times in prior cases.see kremen cohen,cir.
summary judgment on employment status 
the mdl court granted summary judgment to fedex,holding that plaintiffs are independent contractors as a matter of law.plaintiffs argue that,at a minimum,summary judgment for fedex was inappropriate.they argue further that the district court should have granted their motion for partial summary judgment because they are employees as a matter of law.we agree that plaintiffs are employees as a matter of law.accordingly,we reverse the mdl court and remand to the district court with instructions to enter summary judgment for plaintiffs on the question of employment status.
the parties agree that oregon law controls this dispute.plaintiffs claims under.are governed by oregon test.see cejas commercial interiors,torres lizama.the leighter plaintiffs claims for unpaid overtime under.and or.admin.are governed by oregon test.id.at.
we conclude that summary judgment for plaintiffs is appropriate in this case.the facts are largely undisputed.fedex and plaintiffs agree that their working relationship is controlled by the oa and fedex policies and procedures.they dispute only the extent to which those documents give fedex the right to control its drivers.in oregon,the meaning of a contract such as the oa is a question of law,unless it is ambiguous and there is competing extrinsic evidence from which a jury could resolve the ambiguity in favor of either party.dial temp.help,dlf int l seeds.here,much of the oa is not ambiguous.to the extent it is ambiguous,the extrinsic evidence supports a conclusion that fedex has the right to control its drivers.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to fedex,we conclude that plaintiffs are employees under both the and tests.
right to control test 
oregon test requires courts to weigh four factors direct evidence of the right to,or exercise of,control the furnishing of tools and equipment the method of payment and the right to fire.stamp dep t of consumer bus.we address each factor in turn,considering only evidence applicable to all class members.
direct evidence of the right to control 
direct evidence of the right to control is the most important factor under oregon law.see great am.ins.ins.of,or stamp,at.fedex argues that the oa creates an relationship.oregon law is clear that a contract recitation of an relationship is not dispositive.see schaff ray land sea food,or wallowa valley stages,oregonian publ g,or.what matters is what the contract,in actual effect,allows or requires.see jenkins aaa heating cooling,or.the oa and fedex policies and procedures unambiguously allow fedex to exercise a great deal of control over the manner in which its drivers do their jobs.therefore,this factor strongly favors plaintiffs.
first,fedex can and does control the appearance of its drivers and their vehicles.fedex controls its drivers clothing from their hats down to their shoes and socks.it requires drivers to be clean shaven,hair neat and trimmed,and free of body odor.fedex detailed appearance requirements clearly constitute control over its drivers.ruiz affinity logistics,wl,at cir.june,finding right to control under california law where a delivery company controlled every exquisite detail of the drivers appearance,including the color of their socks and the style of their hair huggins fedex ground package,cir holding,under missouri law,that fedex appearance requirements show the extent of fedex control over drivers work.further,fedex requires drivers to paint their vehicles a specific shade of white,to attach fedex decals,and to keep their vehicles clean and presentable and free of body damage and extraneous markings.these requirements go well beyond those imposed by federal regulations.see.fedex dictates the vehicles dimensions,including the dimensions of their package shelves and the materials from which the shelves are made.managers may prevent drivers from working if they are improperly dressed or groomed,or if their vehicles do not meet specifications.
second,fedex can and does control the times its drivers can work.the oa does not allow fedex to set its drivers specific working hours down to the last minute,but it is clear from the oa that fedex has a great deal of control over their hours.fedex structures drivers workloads so that they have to work to hours every working day.fedex argues that,because drivers can hire helpers to do their work for them,they are free to complete a full day work in less than hours.but managers may adjust drivers workloads to ensure that they never have more or less work than can be done in to hours.drivers are not supposed to leave their terminals in the morning until all of their packages are available,and they must return to the terminals no later than a specified time.if drivers want their vehicles loaded,they must leave them at the terminal overnight.the combined effect of these requirements is substantially to define and constrain the hours that fedex drivers can work.see bowser state indus.accident comm n,or finding employee status where a could not load his truck before or after the time when the employer loading crew arrived or left.
third,fedex can and does control aspects of how and when drivers deliver their packages.it assigns each driver a specific service area,which it may,in its sole discretion,reconfigure.it tells drivers what packages they must deliver and when.it negotiates the time window for deliveries directly with its customers.compare salem decorating,council on comp,finding that installers were employees where their employer negotiated contracts with customers,with pam carpet,emp t,finding that installers who negotiate d directly with the customer were independent contractors.the oa requires drivers to comply with standards of service,including requirements to f oster the professional image and good reputation of fedex and to conduct all business activities with proper decorum at all times.
fedex notes that there are details of its drivers work that it does not control.for instance,it does not require drivers to follow specific routes or to deliver packages in a specific order.taking the evidence in the light most favorable to fedex,it does not require drivers to follow managers recommendations after evaluations.but the test does not require absolute control.see rubalcaba nagaki farms,or noting that the oregon supreme court has found employee status despite mixed evidence of control castle homes,whaite,finding employee status where the employer did not,in fact,exercise control over many of the details of the employee work,but did exercise control in certain significant respects.fedex lack of control over some parts of its drivers jobs does not counteract the extensive control it does have the right to exercise.
fedex argues that it controls its drivers only with respect to the results it seeks,not the manner in which drivers achieve those results.see great am.ins,at the test of right to control does not refer to the right to control the results of the work but rather to the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result.we agree with fedex that results,reasonably understood,refers in this context to timely and professional delivery of packages.some but not all of fedex requirements go to the results of its drivers work so understood.most obviously,no reasonable jury could find that the result sought by fedex includes every exquisite detail of the delivery driver fashion choices and grooming.ruiz,wl,at see id.and no reasonable jury could find that the results fedex seeks include having all of its vehicles containing shelves built to exactly the same specifications.other aspects of fedex control such as limiting drivers to a specific service area with specific delivery locations also are not merely control of results under oregon law.
in bowser,the oregon supreme court found that a log hauler furnishing his own truck and hauling logs for a logging company was an employee of the company.at.the court emphasized that the company told its haulers to deliver specific loads to specific locations.it held that the company control over what load its drivers are going to take strongly tends to establish the relationship of employer and employee.id.at.the oregon supreme court reaffirmed bowser in rubalcaba,which involved a hauler who transported vegetables for a farmer.the hauler owned his own truck and could work for other farms.at.nevertheless,the court held that the farmer had the right to control the hauler,finding the case virtually identical to bowser.id.at.the farmer exercised a degree of control over the system for loading its product into the trucks.id.the farmer harvesting crew loaded haulers trucks and directed haulers to the field that was being harvested and indicated where to take the produce that had been loaded.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the court wrote,as in bowser,there is no suggestion that the hauler here had any choice over which load he was going to take.id.
in contrast to the facts in bowser and rubalcaba,a heating company salespeople in jenkins were free to keep such hours,work such territory,and make as many or as few calls as they saw fit.at.the oregon supreme court held on these facts that the salespeople were independent contractors.id.similarly,the oregon supreme court held in schaff that a company salespeople were independent contractors where they determin ed when and how to work and selected and established their own routes.at see also avanti press.emp t dep t tax section,holding that a saleswoman was an independent contractor where she set her own work schedule and decided how frequently to visit customers.
fedex treats its drivers more like the haulers in bowser and rubalcaba than like the salespeople in jenkins and schaff.fedex requires its drivers to load and unload packages at fedex terminals every working day.it assigns each driver a specified service area and tells drivers where in their service area to deliver packages.as in bowser and rubalcaba,fedex drivers have no control over which packages they deliver.this strongly tends to establish the relationship of employer and employee.rubalcaba,at quoting bowser,at internal quotation marks omitted see also stamp,at finding right to control where the employer directed when and where the employee worked hdg enters.council on comp,holding that providing work orders,blueprints an
