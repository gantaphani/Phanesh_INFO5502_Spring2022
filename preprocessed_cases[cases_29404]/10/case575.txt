alton piester,llc the company petitions this court for review of a decision of the national labor relations board the board finding that the company violated a of the national labor relations act the act,see a west.the board for enforcement of its order.for the reasons stated below,we deny the company petition for review and grant the board for enforcement.
section of the national labor relations act the act guarantees employees not only the right to,to form,join,or assist labor organizations,and to bargain collectively,but also the right to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of mutual aid or protection.west.section a implements these guarantees by making it an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with,restrain,or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section.a.
the complaint in this case alleged that the company violated a on january,by impliedly threatening to discharge its employees if they continued to engage in protected,concerted activity,and on april,by impliedly threatening to then actually darrell chapman for engaging in protected,concerted activity.an administrative law judge dismissed the allegations,and the general counsel filed exceptions to each of the dismissals.
the board,acting through a quorum found the following facts 
the company is a trucking company.on january,the company owner,alton piester,announced a proposed change to its billing and bookkeeping practices regarding fuel surcharges the fuel surcharge change.the change would decrease the drivers net pay.though many drivers protested,piester told them that his mind was made up and that the change would proceed regardless of their objections.piester told the objecting drivers that if they did like it,they could clean out their truck and move to another job.
clean out your truck has a special meaning for the company and its drivers.a driver will typically leave personal items in a truck if he expects to use it again.therefore,a supervisor statement to a driver to clean out your truck,conveys the message that the driver will no longer be operating that truck,that he is discharged.
after the january meeting,and up to the time of chapman discharge,employees frequently complained among themselves about the fuel surcharge change.employees also complained directly to piester and the company secretaries,although only chapman continued to complain to the company after january.on several occasions,however,adger mcalister informed piester that the drivers continued to complain among themselves about the unfairness of the fuel surcharge change.
on april,chapman spoke with derrick,the company secretary,who also had various accounting duties.chapman repeated the complaint he and others had voiced about the fuel surcharge change,and asked that the surcharge change be reflected on his paycheck stub.during this conversation,chapman spoke loudly,then went into piester adjoining office to further discuss his concerns.derrick followed chapman into the office.
chapman reiterated to piester the same complaint and request he made to derrick,at which point derrick interjected that if chapman was unhappy working there,he should clean out his truck.chapman protested that derrick did not have authority to discharge him.chapman became louder,got up from his chair,and stepped toward derrick.piester then told chapman to clean out his truck,which,as piester acknowledged at the hearing,meant that chapman was discharged.
piester testified that chapman shouting on april was the latest in a series of misconduct,and was the last straw in deciding to discharge him.however,piester did not mention any prior misconduct to chapman,and the only reason listed for chapman discharge on the form filed with the south carolina employment security commission was disorderly conduct in office.on that form,piester directly linked chapman april conduct to the january meeting by stating that meet part of jan that fuel surcharge would be taken out due to customer did want share.
footnotes omitted.
regarding piester january statement that the drivers could clean out their trucks if they did not like the surcharge change,the board noted that the alj had found that the drivers were engaged in protected,concerted activity that day when they protested the change and that the company had not excepted to this finding.the board also determined that piester statement constituted an implied threat to discharge the employees for their protected,concerted activity,and,that even if it meant only that the drivers were free to leave if they did not like the new system,it was still unlawfully coercive.
as for derrick april suggestion to chapman that he should clean out his truck if he was unhappy,the board noted that the alj had found that derrick was acting as the company agent when she made the statement and that the company did not except to that finding.the board found that the remark,like piester similar january statement,constituted an implied threat of discharge.the board also determined that derrick remark was directed at chapman april protected activity,for reasons that the board discussed in detail in its analysis of the company discharge of chapman.the board found,therefore,that the statement was unlawfully coercive.
regarding the discharge itself,the board found that chapman conduct on april amounted to a continuation of the earlier concerted employee complaints about the adverse change to the fuel surcharge.the board cited testimony from secretary sherry marntin,piester,and derrick in support of its finding and found that piester,from his conversations with mcallister,knew that the employees continued to oppose the surcharge change.the board was not swayed by the fact that chapman was the only driver who requested that the surcharge be shown on his pay stub.it noted that other drivers had requested that the surcharge calculation be included on worksheets showing how their pay was calculated and that chapman unique request was made in the context of his general reiteration of the shared complaint that the policy was unfair.the board also found that piester himself viewed chapman april conduct as an extension of the january concerted activity,as evidenced by the fact that derrick statement was almost identical to piester january response and the fact that piester linked the january and april events in the explanation he gave for chapman discharge on the south carolina employment security commission form.the board further found that chapman protected conduct was a motivating or substantial factor for his discharge and that the company had not proven that it would have discharged chapman absent the protected,concerted activity.
finally,the board found that chapman did not forfeit the act protection by speaking loudly to derrick and taking a step in her direction.applying the test set out in atlantic steel,the board found that all four factors favored a conclusion that chapman did not lose the protection of the act the incident took place in an office where no unit employee witnessed it,the subject of the discussion related to protected activity,the nature of the outburst was relatively mild and brief,and the outburst was provoked by derrick unlawful statement.the board thus concluded that the company discharge of chapman constituted a a violation.on that basis,the board ordered the company to offer chapman full reinstatement or the substantial equivalent,as well as backpay.
the company first argues that the board erred in finding that piester statement at the january meeting constituted a a violation.although the company does not dispute that its employees were engaged in protected,concerted action at the meeting by protesting the surcharge change,it contends that piester statement was merely intended to convey that he had made up his mind regarding the surcharge change and that any further complaints by the drivers would be fruitless the company further argues that was the meaning piester intended and that no evidence showed that anyone at the meeting interpreted it otherwise.
section e of the act states that t he findings of the board with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive.e west.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.nlrb wood preserving,cir internal quotation marks omitted.

the board has often found employers statements to be unlawfully coercive when they have invited employees to quit their jobs in response to employees conduct.see,house calls,finding violation when employer told employees who protested their late paychecks that they could quit if they did not like it.such statements have been determined to be coercive because they tend to imply that continuing to engage in protected activity is incompatible with continued employment and would be looked upon with disfavor by the employer.see conley nlrb,cir per curiam rogers elec.we see no reason not to defer to the board similar conclusion here.as we have explained,the test to be applied by the board was an objective one.thus,neither piester intentions nor the reactions of those who heard his statement are dispositive.
the company argues that the board decision amounts to a rule that an employer acts illegally any time he suggests that his employees can quit if they do not like an decision.the board did not purport to base its decision on such a broad rule,however.it simply determined that on the facts before it,where the statement was made in response to the drivers concerted protest of the company new policy,the statement had the potential to coerce employees.we conclude that substantial evidence supports the board decision.
the company next challenges the board finding that piester discharge of chapman constituted a a violation.specifically,the company contends that no substantial evidence supported the determination that chapman was engaged in protected,concerted activity on april.we disagree.
whether particular conduct constitutes concerted activit y,as that term is used in is a question for the board specialized expertise,and we review the board determination only for reasonableness.see nlrb city disposal.the term concerted activit y is not defined in the act but it clearly enough embraces the activities of employees who have joined together in order to achieve common goals.id.at.to be engaged in concerted activity,employees need not combine with one another in any particular way.id.at.if a single employee,acting alone,participates in an integral aspect of a collective process,the conduct may be found to be concerted.id.in this regard,a conversation involving only a speaker and a listener may constitute concerted activity.krispy kreme doughnut nlrb,cir.to do so,however,it must appear at the very least that the conversation was engaged in with the object of initiating or inducing or preparing for group action or that it had some relation to group action in the interest of the employees.id.quoting mushroom transp.nlrb,cir.courts have held that t he lone act of a single employee is concerted if it stems from or logically grew out of prior concerted activity.nlrb mike yurosek son,cir quoting ewing nlrb,cir.and even if the speaker was never selected as a spokesperson,individual protests of a management decision may properly be characterized as concerted action so long as those disagreeing with the decision considered that they had a grievance and decided,among themselves,that they would take it up with management.coop,cir see hugh wilson nlrb,cir.
as we have explained,the company does not challenge the fact that chapman and other drivers engaged in protected,concerted activity by collectively taking up their grievance with management at the january meeting.the company takes issue,however,with the board finding that chapman april conduct amounted to a continuation of the drivers january complaints 
in challenging this determination,the company first attacks the board underlying factual finding that,in addition to asking that the surcharge be shown on his paycheck stub,chapman reiterated the shared employee complaint about the fuel surcharge change in the company office on april.we conclude that the finding is supported by substantial evidence.
the board cited testimony from piester,marntin,and derrick in finding that chapman complained about the surcharge that day.see piester testimony that chapman mentioned the fuel surcharge situation on april,marntin testimony that chapman was complaining about the fuel surcharge when he came into her office on april and that he went into piester office and started discussing the fuel surcharge derrick testimony that when chapman came in on april,he was complaining about the fuel surcharge and wanted it show n on his check stub.the company contends,however,that the testimony,viewed as a whole and in conjunction with chapman testimony,makes clear that chapman was not complaining on april about the surcharge but was instead asking how his deduction was calculated and asking that the surcharge deduction show up on his paycheck.brief of appellant,at.we disagree.
marntin and chapman both testified that chapman had complained to the secretaries on multiple occasions about the surcharge change between january and april.marntin testified that she believed chapman was substantially mistaken concerning the amounts being taken out of his paychecks as a result of the change 
chapman,along with a couple of other drivers,had c o me in and complained to me about the fuel surcharge.i had recalculated the worksheet as though there was no fuel surcharge and told chapman he was losing anywhere from twelve to fifteen dollars per load alone.i never understood why he was thinking he lost between two and three hundred dollars until i the worksheets and realized he was counting a hundred percent of what the truck makes and the driver ca do that.
marntin testified that although she had repeatedly tried to explain to chapman that the surcharge was not costing him nearly as much as he thought,he still believed that his check was down several hundred dollars when he entered the company office on april.
marntin testified that when chapman came in,he was complaining about the fuel surcharge.he had told derrick that he was wanting it to show on his check stub.derrick also testified that when chapman came in that day,he was complaining about the fuel surcharge and wanted it show n on his check stub.
chapman account of the complaints he made when he came in to the office on april appears largely consistent with marntin and derrick testimony.he testified,
marntin was in the office doing the payroll.i started talking to her about it.and i asked her if she pull my record up showing me how things were being paid.and i said marntin,there no way that that work.and she said,what do you mean,and i said,i ca figure it out.from what you told me,this is what happening,i can figure it up it not working.so,marntin called derrick.and so i walked over to derrick,and i said,derrick,just tell me how you all are doing our payroll,how you doing the surcharge on our checks.and she said,this is how we do it.i said,but that do amount up to what you all is telling us that would be coming out of our checks,it do amount up.she said,what do you mean i said,i figured it up and every time i figuring,i not coming up with that.she said,well,chapman,that how we do it.
chapman testified that at that point,he went into piester office and told piester i can not keep making it like this right here my check is way less than what it used to be this fuel surcharge is killing us there no way i can make it like that.internal quotation marks omitted.chapman testified that in response,piester got a pencil and paper out and he started doing some figuring,after which derrick walked in and told piester that chapman had requested that his surcharge be shown on his paycheck stub.
piester testimony regarding the substance of his april conversation with chapman was largely consistent with chapman account.he testified that on april,chapman mentioned the fuel surcharge situation and i did have any problems with that.and i tried to explain the thing to him again.
from all of this testimony,several facts are clear.first,since the january meeting,chapman had repeatedly complained,including on april,about what he believed to be the substantial effect that the surcharge was having on his income.second,in the context of that protest,chapman had been engaging in an ongoing debate with the company concerning exactly how much was being taken from his paycheck as a result of the surcharge change.and third,as this debate continued on april,chapman claimed that the company figures did not add up.
what is unclear is whether chapman was asserting that the company was taking more than piester said on january would be taken or whether he was asserting that the company was taking more than piester and his secretaries claimed to be taking during the ongoing debate that continued after january.if chapman was making the former assertion,then it would appear that he was raising a complaint distinct related complaint raised by the drivers at the january meeting.but,if he was merely rejecting the company claim that the change did not have as large a financial impact as he believed,then it would appear that his primary objection was the one that he and the other drivers had expressed on january,namely,that the surcharge change was unfair and too costly to the drivers.
in our view,none of the testimony clearly resolves this question.the best testimony for the company would seem to be derrick answer to the question of whether chapman felt the company was taking out more than it should have from his check.derrick responded,yes.yes,i believe he thought we were taking out was coming up with a different figure somehow.this answer is less than clear,however,and piester description of chapman complaints he mentioned the fuel surcharge situation,and i did have any problems with that,more consistent with the notion that chapman had repeated the familiar shared general complaint about the surcharge derrick response that chapman should clean out his truck if he was unhappy working for the company also seems a more likely response to a reiteration of the january complaint than to the complaints the company claims chapman was making.in the end,we conclude that this is simply a very close factual issue,and,regardless of how we would have resolved it in the first instance,substantial evidence supports the board finding that chapman was reiterating the shared employee complaint.
relying on manimark nlrb,cir,the company next argues that even if chapman did repeat his opposition to the surcharge change in the company offices on april,his actions were not protected because he was acting only on his own behalf,not on behalf of other drivers.in manimark,the court determined that an employee action was not concerted within the meaning of,even though the employee had raised concerns to his employer that were shared by other employees.see manimark,at.we do not find manimark to have much bearing on the result here,however.critical to the manimark court decision was the fact that the conversation between the employee and employer took place because the employer had summoned the employee to discuss a separate matter that affected only the employee.see id.at.after disagreeing with the employer concerning that matter,the employee brought up the unrelated complaint at issue only as an afterthought.id.also important in manimark was the fact that while the complaint at issue was one shared by other employees,there was nothing to indicate that the employees had decided to act upon those complaints.id.at.
in contrast to manimark,here it is undisputed that the drivers acted in concert in jointly protesting the surcharge change at the january meeting.the narrow question for the board,therefore,was whether chapman april conduct was a continuation of that action.we conclude that the board was on firm ground in finding that it was.the board found as a fact that after the drivers jointly presented their complaints on january,the controversy had continued unabated prior to april as the drivers continued to repeatedly discuss the surcharge among themselves and chapman continued to complain to the secretaries and to piester.moreover,the board found that piester knew that the other drivers continued to complain about the change amongst themselves.city disposal,at holding that a lone employee invocation of a right grounded in his agreement is a concerted activity in a very real sense because the employee is in effect reminding his employer of the power of the group that brought about the agreement and that could be reharnessed if the employer refuses to respect the employee objection.in fact,evidence in the record suggested that piester himself understood chapman april complaints to be an extension of the january concerted activity.a south carolina employment security commission form signed by piester listed the reason for chapman termination as meet part of jan that fuel surcharge would be taken out due to customer did want share.disorderly conduct in office.for all of these reasons,we believe that,even though chapman continued protests were presented individually,they were reasonably understood by the board to be a continuation of the drivers mutual decision to take their grievance up with management,at see hugh wilson,at.
we note that our conclusion is strongly supported by dayton typographic service,nlrb,cir,which reached a similar result on closely analogous facts.in that case,an employee and several of his coworkers complained to their supervisor at a meeting about several working conditions,including the fact that they were often required to work overtime on saturdays for no pay.see id.at.when the complaint went unaddressed,the employee reiterated his concerns regarding unpaid saturday work on two more occasions,one about a month after the original complaint,and one about a month after that.see id.subsequently,he and another employee argued heatedly when their supervisor told them that one of them would have to work the next saturday.see id.at.the employee continued to argue that employees should be paid for their saturday work.see id.at.the court found reasonable a board finding that the subsequent complaints constituted a continuation of the initial joint complaints.see id.at.the court found the fact that the employee had not been chosen by his fellow employees as a spokesman for their joint complaints and noted that although the company claimed the other employees had lost interest in the issue,the company did not present any evidence of that fact.see id.at.rather,the court concluded that it was sufficient to warrant protection that the employees had decided amongst themselves to bring their collective concern to management.see id.at.
the company emphasizes that chapman request to have the surcharge shown on his pay stub was a request that no other driver had made and that his protests were always framed in terms of how much money he personally was losing.however,we conclude that it was reasonable for the board to find these facts not dispositive.in the weeks after the january meeting,the group opposition to the surcharge change had spawned a number of requests that the surcharge be shown in worksheets explaining how the drivers wages were calculated.chapman request to have the surcharge shown on his pay stub was only a slight variation on those requests,and it was presented in the context of chapman underlying complaints about the fuel surcharge change.as for the fact that chapman stated his objections in terms of the effect that it was having on his paycheck,that would at most show only that it was his concern for his own finances rather than those of the group that motivated his support for the drivers collective position.see joanna cotton mills nlrb,cir explaining that individual personal motivation for attempting to further group action does not prevent the conduct from being protected.there was no testimony that chapman sought a personal exemption from the surcharge change that would not have applied to the other drivers as well.we therefore conclude that the board decision that chapman was engaged in protected,concerted activity on april was a reasonable one.
for the foregoing reasons,we deny the company petition for review of the board order and grant the board for enforcement.
petition for review denied for enforcement granted 
i concur with the majority opinion that alton piester comment to clean out your truck on january constituted a violation of the national labor relations act nlra based on the standard of review applicable in this case.see smithfield packing nlrb,cir w e must defer to the board where it has chosen between two fairly conflicting views,even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.quoting universal camera.however,i write separately because i do not agree with the majority conclusion as to the april events.in particular,i do not agree with the majority determination that even though darrell chapman continued protests were presented individually,they were reasonably understood by the board to be a continuation of the drivers mutual decision to take their grievance up with management.supra at internal quotations omitted.nor do i agree with the majority that whether chapman was reiterating the shared employee complaint is a close factual issue.supra at.the evidence in the record plainly shows,as the alj found,that chapman complaints on april were directed at his own inability to calculate the fuel surcharge,not the drivers collective dissatisfaction with imposition of the fuel surcharge in the first instance.as such,there is not substantial evidence from which to conclude that chapman was engaged in concerted activity at the time of his discharge.therefore,i respectfully dissent from that portion of the opinion holding that chapman discharge violated a of the nlra.
with respect to chapman discharge claim,the general counsel alleged that chapman engaged in concerted activities with other employees for their mutual aid or protection during his discussions with sherry marntin,renee derrick,and piester on april.specifically,the general counsel argued that chapman april conduct was a continuation of the employee protests at the january meeting,and therefore protected.the alj disagreed,finding that over time,employee discontent with the fuel surcharge abated but chapman continued to complain about it.in particular,the alj determined that 
t he credited testimony establishes that when chapman spoke with derrick on april,he was concerned that the fuel surcharge amount did not appear on his pay stub.derrick offered an explanation.chapman remained unsatisfied and ultimately spoke with piester.
chapman spoke only about his own pay and pay documents and not those of any other employee.additionally,the record fails to establish that chapman indicated in any way that he intended to speak on behalf of any other employees or that any other employees had asked him to act on their behalf.
the credited evidence does not establish that chapman said anything which would lead piester to conclude that he was continuing the earlier protest.considering the amount of time which had elapsed,it would not be that chapman complaints,focused solely on his own pay documentation,actually constituted activity on behalf of other employees.i conclude that piester had no reasonable basis to believe that chapman was acting on behalf of anyone but himself.
according to the alj,the two and months between the january meeting and chapman objections on april,combined with the lack of evidence that piester was hostile to the employees protest about the fuel surcharge,necessitated the conclusion that the general counsel did not carry its burden of showing a link between the protected activity at the january meeting and chapman discharge.
it is worth noting that in reaching his conclusions the alj also made significant determinations of witness credibility and expressly found that chapman testimony did not ring true,was not to be credited,and was not reliable.in contrast,the alj found that derrick testimony merit ed the greatest confidence,and that testimony by marntin and piester should be credited.we owe deference to such witness credibility assessments.nlrb mining specialists,cir citing concrete pipe,constr.laborers pension trust,sam club,a div.of stores,nlrb,cir an alj credibility determinations should be accepted by the reviewing court absent exceptional circumstances.the board did not reject the credibility findings by the alj.
despite the alj fact and credibility determinations,the board found that chapman complaints on april were a continuation of the earlier concerted employee complaints about the adverse change to the fuel surcharge.the board reached this conclusion notwithstanding its determination that chapman made an individualized request for a notation on his pay stub during the april meeting.according to the board,that request was made in the context of his underlying complaints about the fuel surcharge change.id.emphasis added.based on the record,i do not agree.
during the process of reviewing the entire record for substantial evidence,a reviewing court must not only consider the evidence used to support the board factual conclusion,but it also must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from the board factfinding.universal camera,at.when the board purports to be engaged in simple factfinding,it is not free to prescribe what inferences from the evidence it will accept and reject,but must draw all those inferences that the evidence fairly demands.allentown mack.at.courts performing substantial evidence review,therefore,must examine whether the board considered all of the reasonable inferences compelled by the evidence in reaching its decision.pirelli cable,f d at.
sam club,at emphasis added.
the board and the majority primarily rely on testimony by marntin and derrick as evidence that chapman reiterated protected group complaints made at the january meeting when he met with marntin,derrick,and piester in april.chapman own testimony,however,aptly illustrates the particular grievance he sought to address with marntin and derrick on april 
i asked her if she pull my record up showing me how things were being paid.and i said,you know i said to myself,i said sherry marntin,there no way that work.and she said what do you mean,and i said,i ca figure it out and so i walked over to derrick and derrick and i started talking.and i said,derrick,just tell me how you all are doing our payroll,how you doing the surcharge on our checks.

chapman then described his conversation in piester office this way 
she derrick walks in.she sits across from where i sitting.i in front of piester desk.and she asked her,he said,what do he want sic she said,well he want the money that we talking sic out of their check,he wanted it shown on his check stub.alton repeated,no,we ca do that.i said,why you ca do that you taking it out of our check.why you ca show it 
emphasis added.
according to the majority,it is clear that chapman repeatedly complained about the effect of the surcharge on his income,and that chapman had been in an ongoing debate with the company concerning the amount taken from his paycheck.supra at.it is patently clear from the context of the testimony,as it was to the alj who heard it firsthand,the gravamen of chapman complaint on april was that he did not understand how the surcharge was being calculated and thus how it was affecting his pay,not the fact that a surcharge was company policy.
marntin testified that chapman 
was complaining about the fuel surcharge.he had told derrick that he was wanting it to show on his check stub and she advised him she could put it on his check stub due to he be taxed by the irs and he could be taxed on money that did belong to him.that would benefit him at all.
then he had went back there and him and piester had started discussing it.
from this testimony the board excerpted marntin broad characterization of chapman complaint as being about the fuel surcharge,in total isolation from her specific description of chapman actual,specific complaint during his visit to the company office.moreover,marntin statement that chapman and piester were discussing it clearly refers to chapman desire to have the information included on his pay stub,as explained by marntin description of the meeting between chapman and piester 
piester called derrick back there and told derrick what chapman was wanting.he was wanting the fuel surcharge to show on his checks.derrick explained to piester,she said,that going to be the irs taxing that money and,she said,the money do belong to chapman anyway,we can not put it on his check stubs.
finally,the alj specifically asked marntin whether chapman said anything about just himself or other employees as well as himself when he came in and he talked about his payroll and his paycheck.marntin replied just himself.id.marntin then reiterated that chapman always spoke about his check.
the board likewise read derrick testimony out of context.she testified that chapman stood in between our desks and he was complaining about the fuel surcharge and wanted it showed sic on his check stub.emphasis added.the board cited this description as evidence that chapman was complaining about the fuel surcharge and thus making a group complaint when,in context,derrick undoubtedly conveyed that chapman purpose in speaking with derrick was to have the fuel surcharge shown on his pay stub.derrick description of chapman spontaneous meeting with piester mirrored that of marntin piester called me back there to help him explain what i had already explained to chapman.i explained to piester why it could be on his check stub and explained it again to chapman.
piester testimony is also consistent with that of marntin and derrick.the general counsel called piester as a witness and he testified as follows 
counsel and when chapman came in,he was talking to you about the fuel surcharge.is that correct 
piester,sir.
counsel is it true that your affidavit says that you were trying to explain how it worked to him,to chapman is that what it says 
piester yes sir 
counsel is it true that your affidavit,the bottom line,the last line there says that you were trying to explain how it worked.
piester yes.
counsel how the fuel surcharge worked.
piester yes.
counsel okay.did he ask that it be put on the pay stub so he could see it and figure it out 
piester i not sure about that now.i not sure whether it was on the worksheet or the pay stub.
emphasis added.this testimony by piester is utterly in accord with the testimony given by marntin and derrick.it shows,again,that the purpose of chapman requests on april was to obtain further explanation of how the surcharge was being calculated and to request that it be shown on his pay stub.
the majority concludes that substantial evidence supports the board finding that chapman was reiterating the shared employee complaint about the fuel surcharge expressed by the group at the january meeting.supra at.but when the testimony is read in context,the board did nothing more than improperly prescribe what inferences from the evidence it would accept and reject and the inferences it makes are not reasonable inferences compelled by the evidence.sam club.the board observation that chapman complained about the fuel surcharge is not a fair reading of the evidence and does not support the conclusion that his actions on april were a continuation of the drivers complaints.supra at.in my view,the evidence compels the conclusion reached by the alj that chapman was raising a personal pay computation issue on april.by accepting the board unreasonable reading of the testimony out of its context,the majority fails to take into account the parts of the record that fairly detracts from the board factfinding.sam club,at internal quotations omitted.

the alj found that while there was evidence that the fuel surcharge remained a subject of discussion among employees even at the time of chapman discharge in april,chapman was the only driver who still was voicing objections.as explained by the alj 
chapman protest,of course,would still be protected even if he were the lone holdout trying to rally other employees to support this cause.indeed,an individual employee complaints aimed at instigating group action is quintessential concerted activity.
however,the credible evidence does not establish that chapman was trying to enlist the support of other employees or that,on april,he intended to speak for anyone but himself.on that date,chapman sought,in effect,that piester treat the reduction in pay as a deduction from pay and list it on the paycheck stub.the record does not establish that any other employees wanted,or had asked for,such a change.therefore,i conclude that chapman was acting by himself,and not continuing the employees january,concerted activity.
credible evidence does not establish that,on april,piester regarded chapman as speaking or attempting to speak for anyone other than himself.accordingly,it is difficult to find a nexus between chapman discharge on that date and his protected activity several months earlier.
in reversing the alj decision,the board concluded that chapman repetition of the complaint about the fuel surcharge change on april was a continuation of earlier protected concerted activity.however,this faulty conclusion rests on the board erroneous determination that chapman request on april was made in the context of his underlying complaints about the fuel surcharge change.although the board decision is somewhat confusing on this point,it appears to have relied on two items of evidence when it overruled the alj decision regarding concerted activity that the employees continued to complain among themselves about the fuel surcharge change and that piester knew of this continuing dissatisfaction,and that other employees also had requested that the fuel surcharge information be included on their worksheets.the board reliance on this evidence as a basis that chapman acted with a concerted voice is unreasonable and is not supported by substantial evidence.
