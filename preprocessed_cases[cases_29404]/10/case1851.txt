background 
class action lawsuit and stipulation 
in august a processing tower at the unocal refinery in rodeo developed a leak,resulting in release into the atmosphere of the toxic chemical compound catacarb.thousands of residents from neighboring communities were affected.
respondent law firm lieff cabraser filed a class action complaint against unocal in february.other firms filed complaints against unocal on behalf of individuals and on behalf of putative classes.for example,appellants signed contingent fee contracts with michael meadows and the casper,meadows schwartz firm casper firm to represent them against unocal,and they were named as plaintiffs in an action filed by the casper firm on behalf of multiple individual plaintiffs.abercrombie et union oil company of california et.super.contra costa county no.
pursuant to a pretrial order,the trial court consolidated the related actions,designating them as complex litigation and assigning them for all purposes to a single department.the court vested primary responsibility for managing the litigation with a steering committee of plaintiffs counsel,with lieff cabraser appointed as class counsel and counsel and the casper firm appointed as direct action counsel and counsel.
lieff cabraser submitted the first amended complaint in february,identifying four potential classes personal injury,property damage,medical monitoring and punitive damages.four months later lieff cabraser,its class counsel and unocal entered into a stipulation and proposed order concerning class certification,subject to court approval.they agreed as follows plaintiffs would withdraw the allegations of the personal injury and property classes notice of withdrawal would be by publication in a manner approved by the court the parties would stipulate to certification of a mandatory,punitive damages class,defined as all persons entitled to compensatory damages as a result of the catacarb release the issue of certification of a medical monitoring class would be scheduled for briefing and decision by the court individuals with claims for personal injury or property damage would be given days to file claims and in the event unocal moved to substantially modify or decertify the punitive damages class,plaintiffs could move to certify the personal injury and property classes,on an expedited basis.
the court approved the stipulation after a hearing at which michael meadows,appellants individual counsel,participated.the stipulation and order was served on appellants counsel.
the court also approved the form of notice to all class members advising them of withdrawal of the class action allegations concerning personal injury and property damage claims,and found that n otice as specified in the stipulation shall be deemed adequate notice to all class members.the notice was published october,and november,in the san francisco chronicle.
meanwhile,lieff cabraser engaged in extensive discovery.from january through july,the firm conducted depositions on a nearly daily basis,reviewed hundreds of thousands of pages of documents and consulted extensively with experts in the fields of toxicology,chemistry,air dispersion modeling,property valuation,refinery operation and litigation risk assessment.plaintiff claims questionnaires were reviewed,individual claims were worked up and dozens of unocal employees were deposed.
settlement 
beginning in september lieff cabraser began negotiating in earnest with unocal,often with the assistance of judge daniel weinstein ret,the settlement master.judge weinstein reviewed written submissions,met with counsel,presided over presentations by expert witnesses and conducted a joint settlement conference during which time he monitored excerpts of video depositions.negotiations culminated in april with a tentative million global settlement of the consolidated class and individual actions.the proposed settlement called for dismissal of the punitive damage allegations.
in the beginning of may,the court approved a stipulated order of reference to judge weinstein,referring all issues concerning the good faith and scope of the settlement as well as the allocation of unocal settlement payment among plaintiffs.judge weinstein endorsed the settlement,observing at all times,the negotiations were conducted at arm length by highly qualified counsel who were thoroughly knowledgeable about the evidence and the law.these attorneys have been fully cooperative in sharing factual and legal information with me to allow me to become thoroughly knowledgeable in connection with the potential trial exposure of defendants.the settlement which was reached is,in my opinion,a fair,reasonable,and just settlement for all of the settling parties.this negotiated settlement could not have been achieved without class counsel agreement to dismiss with prejudice the punitive damage allegations of the punitive damage class i respectfully recommend that the court grant class counsel motion to dismiss the punitive damages class claims with prejudice.i have received and considered the handful of objections to the proposed dismissal,and find these objections to be unpersuasive.
the court set the motion to dismiss the punitive damages class claims for hearing on june,and ordered class counsel to send notice of the hearing by first class mail to all known members of the punitive damages class.as well,the court ordered publication of notice.
notice was published in the san francisco chronicle on june and,and the west county times on june and.on june,the notice was mailed to persons identified by class counsel as all persons who might be entitled to compensatory damages.that notice cautioned that a determination to dismiss the punitive damages class claims would be binding on all class members and such dismissal would bar any further suit by or on behalf of class members for punitive damages against unocal.the notice also specified that objections to the dismissal must be received and served by june.
on june,lieff cabraser moved to dismiss the punitive damages class claims and served the motion on appellants individual counsel.the motion included authorizations from attorneys for individual plaintiffs permitting lieff cabraser to dismiss their claims in exchange for participation in the million global settlement.attorney michael meadows attended plaintiffs counsel meeting where he and others signed a document authorizing such dismissal on behalf of appellants.
appellants admitted that they received notice of the hearing in early june,prior to the hearing date.indeed,they both filed timely,written objections.appellant ferguson attended the hearing and personally spoke against the settlement.their objections went solely to the purported insufficiency and unfairness of the settlement appellants proceeded in pro.per.because the casper firm refused to represent them in objecting to or opposing the dismissal and they were unable to find another lawyer to assist them.eight objections in total were received,out of a total class of over.
the court approved the settlement and dismissed the class action,remarking as follows i have had extensive communication with judge weinstein,and he has approached this settlement in the manner in which i would have expected him to.i think a lot of consideration,time and effort has gone into determining whether or not this is a fair settlement.judge weinstein feels it is a fair settlement for all parties concerned and that it is a very liberal settlement for the plaintiffs.further,addressing objecting class members the court stated i satisfied that those concerns that you have have been fully considered by the class counsel that are proposing this settlement.and i satisfied that this appears to be a fair and reasonable settlement for all parties involved my understanding is that the million settlement does encompass all punitive damages claims that have been filed,and i hearing from everyone that i have a great deal of confidence in that this is a settlement that should be approved and that the dismissal of the punitive damages claims would be appropriate.
in the written order dismissing the punitive damages class claims,the court indicated it had concluded that the public interest in punishing unocal for its conduct at its san francisco refinery,and in deterring unocal from future such conduct has been achieved.judgment of dismissal was entered no appeal followed.
thereafter,unocal applied with success for a finding under code of civil procedure section that the settlement was made in good faith.
attorney fees allocation 
as part of the settlement,judge weinstein awarded attorney fees and approved a final plan of allocation.class counsel received in attorney fees,with direct action counsel receiving million.
pursuant to the final allocation plan,eligible claimants could take a cash payment of up to for relatively minor injuries,without proof of medical or economic injury.those rejecting the payment could apply to the special master for an individual award.these potential middle level or less and serious injury more than cases would be evaluated by a panel including a,a doctor,and where appropriate,a toxicologist.the adjudicated awards could be appealed within days of the award.claimants who chose not to accept the predetermined cash payment or to proceed through the nonadversarial arbitration process for midlevel or serious claims could pursue compensatory damages through a jury trial.
appellants opted not to sue unocal for compensatory damages and instead participated in the settlement claims process,represented by the casper firm.ferguson and prieto received awards of and respectively.
present litigation 
two weeks after receiving their arbitration awards,appellants filed this action against lieff cabraser,michael meadows and the casper firm.the third amended complaint alleged causes of action,including negligence,legal malpractice,breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,and unjust enrichment.the gist of the complaint was that the settlement and notices related thereto were inadequate and lieff cabraser breached its duty to appellants by certifying the punitive damages class,negotiating and recommending the settlement and refusing to support their objections.each cause alleged that appellants suffered loss of a potential award of punitive damages against unocal and that they received a compensatory damages award far below what they could have received had defendants acted differently.appellants also sought punitive damages,damages for emotional distress and personal injuries,and disgorgement of attorney fees.
lieff cabraser demurred successfully to the causes of action.the court ruled that appellants had notice of all events through counsel and therefore there could be no misrepresentation or omission upon which they relied and the litigation privilege prevented further actions against defendants.
next,lieff cabraser moved for summary judgment on the remaining causes of action.granting summary judgment,the trial court ruled that the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred the remaining claims because the undisputed evidence demonstrated that appellants were parties in the underlying coordinated class and individual litigation which ended in a final judgment on the merits and the fairness and adequacy of the settlement and the adequacy of lieff cabraser representation of the class were actually and necessarily decided by the court in approving the settlement and dismissing the class action.moreover,the undisputed evidence showed that appellants were not deprived of due process in the underlying litigation.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
appellants insist that the trial court erred in sustaining lieff cabraser demurrer to their fraud causes of action.the lower court ruled that knowledge of all relevant events and notices by the casper firm was imputed to them.that being the case,appellants could not have relied on any alleged representation or omission by lieff cabraser.
this ruling was sound.as a matter of law,any knowledge in the hands of the attorney casper firm is imputed to the client appellants.stalberg western title ins.d.see.
appellants argue that the imputed knowledge doctrine does not apply because both lieff cabraser and the casper firm were defalcating agents.say appellants the casper firm,with whom appellants had an contract,associated with lieff cabraser in the action against unocal and both sets of attorneys conspired against appellants.the first problem with this statement is appellants assumption that lieff cabraser associated with the casper firm,thereby entering into a direct relationship with them.not so.
according to the complaint,appellants signed contingent fee contracts with michael meadows and the casper firm to represent them as their attorney in the unocal action.on the other hand,the court appointed lieff cabraser as class action counsel and counsel appellants contend that until the class was certified,lieff cabraser was not class counsel and instead owed responsibilities to them as individuals,citing mandujano basic vegetable products,cir,we disagree.at that point in time they were potential class members represented individually by their own attorney.putative or potential class members are not represented by lead counsel,and other attorneys may contact them.atari,superior court d.in re mckesson hboc.securities litigation d.further,w hile lead counsel owes a generalized duty to unnamed class members,the existence of such a fiduciary duty does not create an inviolate relationship with each and every member of the putative class.ibid.
after certification,lieff cabraser duties ran to the class as a whole and did not depend on individualized representation of individual class members.see owners for fair franchising southland th,d parker anderson,blanchard edgemark financial,one of the factors unique to class litigation is the existence of a class,rather than individual,client.stated another way,in a class suit,class counsel client is the group which comprises the class,rather than any individual class member.
simply put,lieff cabraser was not appellants agent for purposes of providing individual notice of class certification and settlement matters.its obligations with respect to notice to class members were accomplished through the notice process.lieff cabraser could not realistically be expected to communicate on a regular basis with over individual claimants.this was the job of retained counsel such as the casper firm.appellants admit that the casper firm had knowledge of all essential facts and phases of the proceedings.that knowledge was imputed to appellants and thus their causes of action for breach of duty to disclose and constructive fraud as against lieff cabraser must fail.
appellants also argue that the doctrine of imputed notice does not apply because lieff cabraser colluded with the casper firm to defraud them.appellants did allege conspiracy to commit fraud.but again,this cause of action assumes duties on the part of lieff cabraser that would stem from an independent relationship,not from their role as class counsel.for example,appellants alleged that lieff cabraser furthered the conspiracy by secretly stipulating to a out punitive damages class without notice to plaintiffs,failing to disclose the terms of the settlement to the plaintiffs in time to gain effective service of counsel and settling the lawsuit without plaintiffs consent.
to the extent appellants conspiracy claim is based on assertions of misrepresentation or inadequate disclosure in,or timing of,the notice of class certification or notice of proposed settlement and dismissal of punitive damages class claims,that claim is barred by the litigation privilege.civil code section provides a privileged publication or broadcast is one made b in any judicial proceeding.id.subd.b.this
