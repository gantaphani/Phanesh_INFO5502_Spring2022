the republic of the philippines appeals from two orders issued by the district court,even though the republic is not a party to this litigation.the first memorandum and order reinstates a settlement agreement between the estate of ferdinand marcos and a class of plaintiffs who had sued the estate for violations of their human rights.the second order directing compliance facilitates the first order by enjoining foreign banks from transferring certain assets that could be used to fund the settlement.the republic asks us to vacate both orders.but,because the republic is neither a party to the settlement agreement nor a person or banking institution bound by the order directing compliance,we dismiss its appeal for lack of standing.
background 
before turning to the present dispute,we pause to place it in its historical context.
a.the hilao litigation and the abandoned settlement agreement 
ferdinand marcos and his family fled to hawaii in.almost immediately,several lawsuits were filed on behalf of individuals who had been arrested,tortured,executed,or during marcos tenure as president of the philippines.hilao estate of marcos in re estate of ferdinand marcos,human rights litig.estate ii,cir.the judicial panel on litigation consolidated all those cases in the district of hawaii the consolidated case was later certified as a class action.id.ferdinand marcos died three years after the litigation commenced.in february,the district court entered a final judgment in the class action,approving jury awards of billion in exemplary damages and million in compensatory damages against the marcos estate.hilao estate of ferdinand marcos hilao ii,cir.we affirmed that judgment.id.at.
collecting that judgment proved exceedingly difficult for the hilao plaintiff class who are plaintiffs in this case because of two developments.first,to settle a separate suit by the republic against the marcos estate,the estate agreed to transfer to the republic the bulk of the portion of the estate assets that had been impounded by united states customs officials in hawaii.hilao estate of marcos in re estate of ferdinand marcos,human rights litig.estate iii,cir.although the district court tried to enjoin the republic from participating in that transfer,we vacated the injunction to the extent that it purported to enjoin the republic directly,on the ground of foreign sovereign immunity.id.at.
second,in august the republic asked switzerland federal government to transfer frozen estate assets,which were held in swiss banks,to a philippine national bank pnb escrow account.the request was somewhat unusual in that the republic sought an early transfer of assets before a final adjudication of the ownership of those assets.but the swiss federal supreme court confirmed orders approving the republic request in december.
those two developments brought the bulk of the estate assets under the republic control.yet plaintiffs were owed almost billion.as a result of this dilemma,plaintiffs and the estate entered into an agreement and compromise in december under which the estate would pay plaintiffs million to satisfy all claims.to fund the settlement,it was agreed that a ll parties shall make efforts to obtain all necessary consents to trigger release and transfer of the million from the pnb escrow of the settlement fund and shall execute all documents necessary to accomplish the release and transfer.
the republic did not sign,and was not a party to,the settlement agreement.nonetheless,the chairman of the philippine presidential commission on good government pcgg magdangal elma,signed a february undertaking under which the pcgg would seek to transfer million from the pnb escrow account to the settlement fund.the undertaking conditioned that transfer on the approval of the sandiganbayan and other competent court,and the president of the republic of the philippines.on april,the district court granted final approval of the settlement agreement between the estate and plaintiffs.
in a july,decision,the sandiganbayan rejected the pcgg request to transfer million to the settlement fund because,among other reasons,the sandiganbayan concluded that the settlement was not in plaintiffs best interests.that decision left no viable source of funding for the settlement agreement.in light of the parties failure to acquire settlement funds,the district court terminated the settlement agreement in january.
b.the district court past efforts to preserve estate assets in connection with the hilao litigation 
both before and after the parties attempt to settle the hilao litigation,the district court took a number of measures to secure funding for the sizable judgment against the estate.plaintiffs first moved for a preliminary injunction in november to prevent the estate from transferring or secreting any of its assets.we upheld that injunction against a challenge from the estate.estate ii,at.when the estate later settled its dispute with the republic by agreeing to transfer certain assets to the republic,the district court modified the injunction to bring the republic within its scope.we agreed with the republic that,under the foreign sovereign immunities act of it was immune from the district court jurisdiction.so,as noted above,we vacated the injunction insofar as it purported to enjoin the republic.estate iii,at.
the district court next ordered several swiss banks to deposit into the court registry as an interpleader proceeding all estate assets in the possession of the banks that are the subject matter of this proceeding.hilao estate of marcos hilao i,cir.we vacated that order,holding that neither california law nor federal rule of civil procedure a gave the district court the authority to order the banks to deposit the contested funds into the court registry.id.at.
undeterred,the district court next entered an identical order,sua sponte,against the swiss banks in connection with an action that plaintiffs lawyer had filed against those banks in rosales credit suisse swiss bank,no.cv.the swiss banks petitioned for a writ of mandamus.we granted the writ in credit suisse united states district court,cir.there,we concluded that the doctrine prohibited the district court order in view of the paradigmatically sovereign executive orders issued by the swiss federal council,freezing all estate assets held in switzerland.id.at.consequently,we directed the district court to refrain from taking any further action in the rosales action or any other case involving any or all of the real parties in interest and any assets of the estate of ferdinand marcos held or claimed to be held by the banks.id.at.but we retained jurisdiction and later clarified that the district court could continue to perform its rule settlement duties in the hilao action so long as such duties do not involve an attempt to reach marcos assets held or claimed to be held by the banks and as long as such duties do not involve taking any further action in the rosales action.credit suisse united states dist.court,cir unpublished order.
c.the memorandum and order and order directing compliance 
while plaintiffs were attempting to secure estate assets to fund the judgment that they had obtained,or at least the settlement,in the hilao litigation,the republic was pursuing forfeiture proceedings in philippine courts against the estate assets.in july,those proceedings ended in a lengthy philippine supreme court judgment,which concluded that the estate assets were wealth stolen from the republic.the philippine supreme court thus granted summary judgment in favor of the republic and ordered the assets in the pnb escrow account forfeited to the republic.
on september,upon learning of the philippine supreme court decision and the impending transfer of the estate assets,the district court entered sua sponte the memorandum and order and order directing compliance that are at the center of this case.the first order discusses perceived deficiencies in the philippine supreme court decision,as well as the republic involvement in the hilao litigation and settlement proceedings.its operative text,however,merely reinstates the settlement agreement between plaintiffs and the
