charles behlen,individually and on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals,appeals the district court denial of his motion to remand his case to state court and its order dismissing his lawsuit.the district court determined that it had removal and supplemental jurisdiction over the action and therefore denied the motion to remand.the court further determined that the action was barred by the securities litigation uniform standards act of slusa.thus,the court dismissed behlen claims with prejudice and his individual claims without prejudice.because we determine that the action was preempted by the slusa and subject to dismissal,we affirm.
background 
from november to march behlen purchased shares in a mutual fund known as the aggressive growth fund.behlen purchased the shares from merrill lynch and phoenix investment partners,the defendants.on march,behlen filed a civil action in state court seeking to recover money damages resulting from his purchase of those shares.in his original complaint,which was styled as a class action,behlen asserted various state law claims,including claims for breach of contract,breach of implied covenants and duties,breach of fiduciary duty,unjust enrichment,suppression,misrepresentation,and negligence wantonness.he alleged that the defendants sold him and the class members class b shares in the growth fund when they were unknowingly eligible to purchase class a shares.he further alleged that the defendants sold them the wrong shares,because the class b shares were subject to higher fees and commissions than the class a shares.
on april,the defendants removed the lawsuit from state court to the united states district court for the southern district of alabama,asserting that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the case pursuant to the slusa.three days later,the defendants filed a motion to dismiss behlen complaint.behlen subsequently filed an amended complaint,in which he asserted the same state law claims,deleted the claims for misrepresentation and suppression,and added claims for money had and received and for an accounting.behlen also removed all explicit references to any fraudulent activity by the defendants.he argued that the slusa was no longer applicable to his claims and filed a motion to remand the case to state court.
the district court ultimately denied behlen motion to remand and granted the defendants motion to dismiss the action,dismissing the claims with prejudice and behlen individual claims without prejudice.this appeal followed.

discussion 
removal jurisdiction 
we first address whether the district court had removal jurisdiction over this action.although behlen asserted only state law claims in his original complaint,the defendants removed the case to the district court based upon their belief that behlen actually alleged violations of federal securities laws,which fell within the scope of the slusa.
generally,whether an action raises a federal question is governed by the complaint rule,which provides that federal jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented on the face of the plaintiff properly pleaded complaint.caterpillar williams,d.thus,the plaintiff is the master of the claim and may avoid federal jurisdiction by exclusive reliance on state law.id.furthermore,a case may not be removed to federal court on the basis of a federal defense,including the defense of,even if the defense is anticipated in the plaintiff complaint,and even if both parties concede that the federal defense is the only question truly at issue.id.at.
the supreme court,however,has recognized an independent corollary to the complaint rule,known as the complete doctrine.id.citation omitted.the court explained,
on occasion,the court has concluded that the force of a statute is so extraordinary that it converts an ordinary state complaint into one stating a federal claim for purposes of the complaint rule.once an area of state law has been completely,any claim purportedly based on that state law is considered,from its inception,a federal claim,and therefore arises under federal law.
id.citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.
thus,whether a district court has removal jurisdiction over a state law case alleging securities fraud depends upon whether the claims fall within the scope of the slusa and are therefore preempted.in making this determination,it is helpful to consider the slusa and its historical context.
congress passed the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,which established uniform standards for class actions alleging securities fraud.the procedural reforms enacted by the pslra were intended to prevent plaintiffs from bringing strike suits in securities matters.conf,at discussing the pslra.congress found that the high costs of defending strike suits often forced defendants to settle meritless class actions.conf,at,reprinted in.the pslra addressed this problem by instituting heightened pleading requirements for class actions alleging fraud in the sale or purchase of national securities riley merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir,cert.denied.the pslra also required a mandatory stay of discovery until the district court could determine the legal sufficiency of the class action claims.see b b.
by,however,it became apparent to congress that the objectives of the pslra were being frustrated,because plaintiffs were evading its heightened pleading requirements by bringing suit in state court rather than federal court.securities litigation uniform standards act of,stat,lander hartford life annuity ins,cir noting that litigants were able to assert many of the same causes of action,but avoid the heightened procedural requirements instituted in federal court.congress thus resolved that 
in order to prevent certain state private securities class action lawsuits alleging fraud from being used to frustrate the objectives of the private securities litigation reform act of,it is appropriate to enact national standards for securities class action lawsuits involving nationally traded securities,while preserving the appropriate enforcement powers of state securities regulators and not changing the current treatment of individual lawsuits.
as a result,congress passed the slusa,which amended the securities act of and the securities exchange act of and made federal court,with limited exceptions,the sole venue for class actions alleging fraud in the purchase and sale of covered securities riley,at.congress further mandated that such class actions would be governed by federal law rather than state law.see conf,at.to that end,the slusa preempts certain state law claims,allows for removal of state actions to federal court,and requires immediate dismissal of covered lawsuits.riley,at.
a party seeking to remove an action to federal court pursuant to the slusa bears the burden of showing that the suit is a covered class action,the plaintiffs claims are based on state law,one or more covered securities has been purchased or sold,and the defendant misrepresented or omitted a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of such security.id.at emphasis omitted.the district court found that each of these requirements had been met and that the action was therefore removable.behlen,however,argues that the case was not removable,because the action was not a covered class action and the misconduct alleged in the complaint was not in connection with the sale or purchase of a security.
covered class action 
behlen argues that his case was not removable,because it was not a covered class action.behlen points to the statutory language of the slusa,which provides that n o covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any state or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any state or federal court by any private party.b,f emphasis added.behlen contends that at the time of removal the case was not maintained as a class action,becaus
