factual and procedural summary 
in,deborah kavruck purchased a blue cross individual health insurance policy which provided that premiums would be rated based on the subscriber initial enrollment age.we refer to this type of policy as an entry age policy.in,blue cross stopped marketing these entry age policies,but the existing entry age policies remained in effect.in,blue cross transferred subscribers with entry age policies contract,into new policies,in which premiums were calculated based on the subscriber actual age at the time of renewal.we refer to this type of policy as an attained age policy.
kavruck is one of the entry age subscribers whose policy was transferred.she brought this action on behalf of herself and other similarly situated subscribers,alleging breach of the insurance contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraud,negligent misrepresentation,and unfair competition.she also sought declaratory relief.her action was certified as a class action as to the breach of contract,breach of implied covenant,and declaratory relief causes of action.
in the operative pleading the second amended complaint,plaintiff alleged that under the terms of her contract with blue cross,plaintiff was to pay premiums based upon her age at the time she first purchased a blue cross policy in.blue cross allegedly breached this agreement when it notified her that it was no longer going to observe its obligation to base premiums on her age at the time she first purchased a blue cross policy in and would instead calculate her premiums based upon her age at the time of each premium increase or recalculation.effective january,blue cross dramatically raised plaintiffs sic premiums based upon her attained age.
in its initial motion for summary judgment,blue cross relied on a provision in plaintiff contract and in the three other contracts at issue,which stated any provision of this agreement which,on its effective date,is in conflict with any applicable statute,regulation or other law is hereby amended to conform with the minimum requirement of such law.blue cross asserted that since the entry age contracts were all closed blocks of business,it was required to transfer them to open blocks of business in order to comply with health and safety code section it claimed this action was taken in order to conform the contracts to law,and hence was not a breach of contract because it was authorized under the provision in the contracts we have just quoted.blue cross also asserted that the department of corporations doc had expressed concern over whether the transfers complied with the statute that the doc had investigated the transfers and that blue cross and the doc had engaged in lengthy negotiations leading,ultimately,to a settlement under which blue cross took remedial steps to restore benefits and rebate premiums to individuals affected by the transfers.the court denied summary judgment,finding that blue cross asserted compliance with health safety code does not excuse its contractual obligations,as this is a contract issue,not a regulatory issue.
in its second motion for summary judgment,blue cross asserted that another provision in the entry age contracts gave it the right to cancel or modify the contract including a change in the premiums upon thirty days written notice.in opposition,plaintiff acknowledged that blue cross reserved the right to change subscription charges,but argued that the contract said nothing about changing rating methods.plaintiff asserted that the contracts each contained an express limitation on blue cross power to modify,providing for a change in initial enrollment age rating only if the contract type changed.plaintiff also argued that under the contracts,any changes could be made only through an endorsement signed and authorized by a blue cross officer,and that requirement was not satisfied with respect to the change from entry age rating.
the court gave blue cross an opportunity to amend its summary judgment motion to address this new issue of compliance with the procedural requirements for modification.the court ultimately concluded that the contracts expressly permitted modification or termination on thirty days notice that plaintiff had failed to allege noncompliance with the contract requirements for modification or termination and that the evidence submitted in support of the amended motion established as undisputed that plaintiff had received timely and adequate notice of the change from entry age rating to attained age rating in accordance with the terms of her contract.on this basis,the court concluded there was no triable issue of material fact concerning the propriety of blue cross exercise of its express right under the agreement to modify the rating provision.
discussion 
the issue before us is whether blue cross has established as a matter of law that it did not breach the entry age contracts of plaintiff and other members of the certified class.we look to the law on interpretation of insurance contracts while insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.citation.the fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.if contractual language is clear and explicit,it governs.on the other hand,i f the terms of a promise are in any respect ambiguous or uncertain,it must be interpreted in the sense in which the promisor believed,at the time of making it,that the promisee understood it.bank of the west superior court cal th,d.
in order to ascertain whether there is an ambiguity in an insurance policy,the disputed policy language must be examined in context with regard to its intended function in the policy.citations.this requires a consideration of the policy as a whole,the circumstances of the case in which the claim arises and common sense.citation.paul fire marine ins.american dynasty surplus lines ins.th,d.an insurance policy is considered ambiguous when its terms are capable of two or more constructions,both of which are reasonable.prudential ins.of america,superior court th,d.
the contracts at issue in this case each contained a provision entitled term of your agreement part iv in plaintiff contract,which stated d.we have the right to cancel end your coverage or modify this agreement,including change subscription charges,if we give you days written notice.considered in isolation,this provision seems to authorize blue cross to change any term of the policy upon proper notice.but the scope of blue cross authority is not clear when the provision is read,as it must be,in the context of the entire policy.
the contracts required blue cross to calculate subscribers premiums on an entry age basis this requirement is found in part xv of plaintiff contract,which contains a chart showing subscription charges.the left hand column of the chart lists the initial enrollment age and the columns to the right show the subscription charges for the number of individuals to be insured single,two party,family,adult and child,or adult and children.the contract provides the initial enrollment age pertains to enrollment under this agreement only.for married subscribers enrolled under a or family coverage,the age rating category will be based upon either the age of the subscriber or the age of the enrolled spouse,whichever is younger.if contract type changes,subscription charges will be rated as an initial enrollment.
the next paragraph provides blue cross reserves the right to change the subscription charges on thirty days written notice to the subscriber prior to the close of any quarterly term.the change will become effective on the date shown in the notice,and payment of the new charges will indicate acceptance of the change.
this portion of the policy,which specifically addresses the entry age rating and the subscription charges,can reasonably be understood to promise a subscriber that unless the contract type changes,for example from single to two party,he or she will continue to be rated at the initial enrollment age.it also can reasonably be understood to reserve to blue cross the right to change the subscription charges,but not the entry age rating.these reasonable interpretations,which limit blue cross right to modify the agreement,are in conflict with the apparently broad grant of authority to cancel or modify the agreement set out in part iv,paragraph d of the contract.
in the interpretation of insurance contracts,a specific provision relating to a particular subject will govern in respect to that subject,as against a general provision,even though the latter,standing alone,would be broad enough to include the subject to which the more specific provision relates.general ins.truck ins.exch.d.furtado metropolitan life ins.d.see also,particular expressions qualify those which are general.application of this principle leads to the conclusion that blue cross general authority to modify the contracts did not include the authority to change the specific contract term promising that entry age rating would continue unless the subscriber changed contract type.
this conclusion is reinforced through the normative rules for resolving contract ambiguities.plaintiff reads the language of the contract as providing that her entry age rating would not be modified except upon a change in contract type blue cross reads it as authorizing it to modify any term of the contract upon thirty days notice.if the language of an insurance policy is ambiguous or uncertain,the policy must be interpreted to give effect to the insured objectively reasonable expectations.bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d,home savings of america continental ins.th,d.
plaintiff submitted parol evidence to establish the objectively reasonable expectations of the insureds.parol evidence may properly be considered as other evidence of the circumstances under which the agreement was made or to which it relates,or to explain an extrinsic ambiguity or otherwise interpret the terms of the agreement,code civ,subd.g garcia truck ins.exchange cal d.
blue cross argues plaintiff conceded in discovery that there was no ambiguity in the policy,and therefore she is precluded from submitting parol evidence to interpret the policy.in form interrogatory,plaintiff was asked is any agreement alleged in the pleadings ambiguous if so,identify each ambiguous agreement and state why it is ambiguous.plaintiff responded no.plaintiff asserts that the contracts are clear in giving insureds enrollment age protection and that said protection could only be changed in the event of a voluntary change by the insured.a fair reading of the response is that plaintiff believes the contract unambiguously protects the entry age rating from modification unless the insured changes coverage.plaintiff assertion that the policy unambiguously favors her position does not concede an argument that if there is some ambiguity,it should be resolved against her.we find no judicial waiver on this point.
as we have discussed,the contract does not unambiguously support the position of blue cross.assuming that it does not unambiguously favor plaintiff position either,the only inference is that it is ambiguous.we proceed on the assumption that it is,and that plaintiff was entitled to submit parol evidence to aid her position.
in support of her interpretation of the contract,plaintiff submitted the deposition testimony of james killian,director of sales at the woodland hills office of blue cross,beginning in he explained that in enrollment age products marketed at that time,a person age at the time of enrollment is what was used as long as you remained in that product and did have a major change in status or change deductible killian was shown blue cross advertising brochures for and labeled exhibits,and for identification which described the health care plans offered by blue cross at that time.in the section explaining the cost of the available plans,the brochures each define initial enrollment age as the age of the subscriber or enrolled spouse whichever is younger as of the date the application is signed.after setting out the subscription charges,the brochures state that subscription charges are subject to change.they explain your age rating category will not be unless your contract type changes.for example,if you change from a single party contract to a or family contract.you change your plans.for example,if you change from plan to a plan.killian testified that these explanations were consistent with other materials he had seen describing the enrollment age provision,and were consistent with the way he understood the enrollment age rating feature worked.
plaintiff also relied on the deposition of jacqueline anderson,designated by blue cross to testify about the nature and extent of any agreement made by blue cross in plan number and other entry plans to rate subscribers based upon their age at initial enrollment.according to anderson,under plaintiff blue cross policy and the other entry age policies at issue,the agreement was that blue cross would rate subscribers based on their age at the time of enrollment,and as their age changed,they still would be rated based upon the age they had at the time they enrolled,so long as there was no change in contract type.
this explanation of the age rating provision in blue cross entry age contracts is entirely consistent with the interpretation advanced by plaintiff the subscriber premiums would continue to be age rated based on the subscriber age at the time of initial enrollment,unless the subscriber changed contract type or plans.this entry age rating provision would be activated at the time of initial enrollment,but could only be enjoyed in the future,as the subscriber grew older and would,in the absence of this promise,pass through older age rating bands.it was objectively reasonable for the parties to understand that blue cross contractual right to modify the terms of the contract was limited with regard to this provision,and that it could only modify the entry age rating upon the occurrence of the two designated events,a change of contract or a change of plan.blue cross interpretation of the contract,that it could modify the age rating term on days notice,would make this promise meaningless.a contract may not be interpreted in a manner which would render one of its terms meaningless.principal mutual life ins.vars,pave,mccord freedman th,d.
for all these reasons,the entry age contracts are subject to the interpretation that blue cross authority to modify terms on days notice does not extend to the entry age rating provision.blue cross failed to establish as a matter of law that its transfer of the contracts was within the modification provision of the contracts,and hence failed to establish a complete defense to the cause of action for breach of contract.
in opposition to blue cross second summary judgment motion,plaintiff asserted blue cross had not complied with the statutory and contractual requirements for modification of the contracts.the court gave blue cross an opportunity to amend its motion to address this claim.blue cross relied on plaintiff discovery responses to argue that she had conceded that her action was not based on a lack of statutory or regulatory compliance.in granting summary judgment,the trial court concluded plaintiff had admitted the statutory noncompliance issue away.we disagree.
plaintiff did not allege in her complaint that blue cross failed to comply with the requirements of the act.in its answer,blue cross asserted plaintiff claims were barred by section a provision in that act which the doc construed as requiring blue cross to
