the class action fairness act of cafa,stat,confers federal jurisdiction over class action lawsuits where the amount in controversy exceeds and the adversaries are minimally diverse.when a class action satisfying these conditions is filed in state court,section of cafa provides that such action may be removed by any defendant without the consent of all defendants.b.in this appeal,we address whether cafa section,b,allows a party joined to an action as a defendant to a counterclaim an additional counterclaim defendant to remove the case to federal court.we hold that b does not permit additional counterclaim defendants to remove an action to federal court,and we affirm the district court decision to remand this case to state court.
background 
cafa and the removal statutes 
congress enacted cafa to curb perceived abuses of the class action device which,in the view of cafa proponents,had often been used to litigate or even national class actions in state courts.united steel shell oil,cir quoting tanoh dow chem,cir.cafa wrought several changes to the judicial code,including amending the federal diversity statute,d,and liberalizing the requirements governing removal from state court.
section a of cafa amended the federal diversity jurisdiction statute,to grant original federal jurisdiction over large interstate class actions,at least class members in which the matter in controversy exceeds and any member of the plaintiffs class is diverse in his domicile from any defendant.see d,d b.
section of cafa augmented chapter of the judicial code which governs the removal of actions to federal courts by the addition of.subsection b of provides that 
a class action may be removed to a district court of the united states in accordance with section except that the year limitation under section b shall not apply,without regard to whether any defendant is a citizen of the state in which the action is brought,except that such action may be removed by any defendant without the consent of all defendants.
b.section,which is in b,sets forth the procedures a removing defendant must follow and provides,inter alia,that a defendant or defendants desiring to remove any civil action shall file in the district court of the united states for the district and division within which such action is pending a notice of removal containing a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal as well as the operative pleadings.id.a.the notice of removal shall be filed within thirty days after the receipt by the defendant of the complaint or,in certain states,the summons.id.b.
the general removal statute,which was not amended by cafa,is also found in chapter of the judicial code,and provides 
a ny civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction,may be removed by the defendant or the defendants,to the district court of the united states for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending.
ii.the underlying proceedings 
this litigation commenced in san bernardino county superior court on may,when plaintiff westwood apex filed a breach of contract action against defendant jesus contreras to recover on an unpaid student loan.westwood apex is a subsidiary entity of the institution westwood college.contreras,a former westwood college student,answered the complaint and,on august,filed class action counterclaims alleging violations of california laws.
contreras counterclaims allege that defendant westwood apex and additional counterclaim westwood college and certain affiliated individuals and entities collectively,the additional counterclaim defendants,removing parties,or westwood college committed fraud and engaged in unfair and deceptive business practices in connection with their operation of the college.contreras putative class consists of all california residents who have attended,or are presently attending,westwood college programs.
on september,the additional counterclaim defendants,all westwood college entities except westwood apex filed a notice of removal in the central district of california.that notice asserted that federal jurisdiction was appropriate under u.d,and that removal was authorized by section of cafa,b.specifically,the notice of removal reads 
section b,added by cafa,expands removal authority,conferring on any defendant the right to remove a class action section b,in authorizing removal by any defendant,expands removal authority beyond a limits so that it includes any defendant,including naturally a defendant joined in the case by a counterclaim.
on september,the district court ordered westwood college to show cause why removal was appropriate under cafa.specifically,the district court highlighted the dearth of authority in this circuit regarding whether state court,joined by way of a,qualify as defendants under.the order to show cause further recognized persuasive authority from the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit which,in considering the issue presented here,held that cafa does not permit removal by additional counterclaim defendants.see palisades collections,llc shorts,cir.
following briefing by the parties,the district court remanded the action to state court on the ground that removal by an additional counterclaim defendant was not authorized by either the language or purpose of cafa the order of remand.see apex contreras,civ.gaf,wl.
on march,we granted the additional counterclaim defendants petition to appeal the order of remand.

discussion 
the removing parties contend that b permits removal by any defendant and that this phrase includes additional counterclaim defendants.this is a question of statutory interpretation,and thus our analysis begins with the plain language of the act.campbell allied van lines,cir.the plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson shell oil.where language is susceptible to varying interpretations,we will look to other sources to determine congressional intent,such as the canons of construction or a statute legislative history.jonah carmona,cir.
our circuit has addressed the meaning of b.see abrego abrego dow chemical,cir see also progressive ins.preciado,cir.in progressive west,where the question of removal by a defendant arose,we recognized that b was written to eliminate three significant barriers to removal for qualifying actions.at.first,b expressly exempts qualifying actions from the b prohibition of removal more than year after commencement of the action.id.at citation omitted.second,b allows a class action founded on diversity to be removed even where any defendant is a citizen of the state where the action was filed.this language eliminates the defendant restriction on removal found in b.palisades collections,at.finally,b provides that any defendant is allowed to remove an action without obtaining the consent of all defendants.this overrides the requirement that each defendant consent to removal.arego abrego,at.that unanimity requirement had been longstanding,dating back to the supreme court decision in chicago,rock island,pacific railway company martin.
the phrase any defendant is used twice in b,first as part of the language eliminating the complete diversity requirement and second in the clause overriding martin unanimity rule.despite the apparent usage of any defendant in two provisions aimed at eliminating longstanding barriers to removal,the removing parties nevertheless contend that b also authorizes removal by additional counterclaim defendants.their argument proceeds by taking b final clause such action may be removed by any defendant without the consent of all defendants and erasing the last six words so that what remains is,according to the removing parties,unambiguous authority that any defendant of whatever kind may remove a class action to federal court.we believe it inappropriate to construe a statute by reading related clauses in isolation or taking parts of a whole statute out of their context.an excerpted clause in a statute can not be interpreted without reference to the statute as whole,nor can it be understood free from the sentence in which it was included.see united states morton,we do not,however,construe statutory phrases in isolation we read statutes as a whole.see also harbison bell,roberts,concurring w e do not construe statutory phrases in isolation we read statutes as a whole.this certainly applies to reading sentences as a whole.citation omitted.appellants focus on the phrase any defendant takes the words out of the context in which they are written here the word any is being employed in connection with the word all later in the sentence by any without the consent of all.see also palisades collections,at t he use of the word any juxtaposed with the word all was intended to convey the idea of,not to alter the definition of the word defendant.given that any and all are used in relation to one another,they should be read that way and interpreted consistently with the sentence structure.
the argument that b allows for additional counterclaim defendants to remove depends on appellants faith in the redeeming power of one adjective any.but this argument not only ignores twain skepticism on the value of a,it also eschews the established meaning of defendant in chapter of the judicial code.since the supreme court decision in shamrock oil gas corporation sheets,defendant for purposes of designating which parties may remove a case under has been limited by a majority of the courts to mean only original or true defendants defendant in chapter,thereby,excludes plaintiffs and parties who become defendants through a counterclaim.
in shamrock oil,the supreme court interpreted the predecessor statute to,which permitted removal by the defendant or defendants therein,to preclude removal by a plaintiff who was in point of substance a defendant to the cause of action asserted in the counterclaim.id.at,citation omitted.the ability for certain parties to remove a action to a federal forum has existed since the first judiciary act.see paul mercury indem.red cab co,citing judiciary act of,stat.the shamrock oil court traced the amendments in removal law back to the first judiciary act and emphasized that,at different times,removal was either afforded to defendants or,alternatively,to either party.at.because congress was presumed to be aware of this statutory history,the choice of defendant was a deliberate exclusion of other classes of parties.id.at we think these alterations in the statute are of controlling significance.
since shamrock oil,the law has been settled that a counterclaim defendant who is also a plaintiff to the original state action may not remove the case to federal court.see,progressive west,at w e must conclude cafa does not alter the longstanding rule announced in shamrock that precludes from removing class actions to federal court.am.int l underwriters phil,cont l ins,cir t he supreme court found that congress had intended to eliminate the automatic right of a plaintiff to remove.likewise,the shamrock oil rule has been extended to preclude removal by defendants to an action.see palisades collections,at collecting cases first bank of pulaski curry,cir although shamrock oil is not dispositive of the precise issue before us,it does dictate that the phrase the defendant or the defendants,as used in a,be interpreted narrowly,to refer to defendants in the traditional sense of parties against whom the plaintiff asserts claims.see also wright miller,et,federal practice procedure the federal courts often speak of the right to remove as being limited to true defendants t defendants brought into the state action by the original defendant can not exercise the right to remove claims to the federal court,although there is some authority to the contrary in the fifth and eleventh circuits.while we left the question of removal without a definitive answer prior to the enactment of cafa,of,cir w e need not reach the interesting question whether defendants are defendants for purposes of the removal statute,some courts in our circuit recognized that the majority position prohibited removal.see,schmidt ass of apartment owners of marco polo.
this accepted understanding of defendant as excluding defendants and defendants survived the enactment of b.we recognized this,albeit in dicta,in progressive west,where we observed that b did not create an exception to shamrock longstanding rule that a can not remove an action to federal court.at.the seventh circuit,endorsing progressive west,held that b use of any is not enough to alter the meaning of the term defendant.see first bank djl,llc,cir.as chief judge easterbrook explained in first bank 
t he word defendant has an established meaning in legal practice,and it is vital to maintain consistent usage in order to ensure that members of congress and those who advise them know what proposed language will do,and people can understand the meaning of statutes by using a word with an established meaning,congress produces the established result.
the fourth circuit,the only other court of appeals to have addressed the precise issue presented here,also concluded that b did not overwrite the accepted meaning of defendant.see palisades collections,at.in palisades collections,judge williams recognized that f or more than fifty years,courts applying shamrock oil have consistently refused to grant removal power under a to defendants.id.at.palisades collections aptly highlighted that congress has shown the ability to clearly extend the reach of removal statutes to include,defendants,or defendants by using the term party in other sections of chapter.see id.at citing a a party may remove any claim or cause of action.the fourth circuit further explained that b was drafted to comport with both and,which each employ the word defendant.id.at.if the meaning in a and is dictated by shamrock oil,and excludes third parties,both defendants and counterclaim defendants,then b does as well.id.at.
the various judicial interpretations of cafa,including our own,recognize that cafa evidences a detailed appreciation of the background legal context.abrego abrego,at see also blockbuster,galeno,cir cafa detailed modifications of existing law show that congress appreciated the legal backdrop at the time it enacted this legislation.to the extent there is any ambiguity about the meaning of defendant as it is used in b,the legislative history reveals that congress purpose in drafting cafa section was not animated by concerns regarding shamrock oil or its progeny,nor was b drafted with the intention of changing the meaning of defendant.as explained above,b removed three longstanding obstacles to removal of interstate class actions,namely the rule that,in a diversity case,a defendant can not remove a case from its home forum,b the rule that a defendant can not remove a diversity case once it has been pending in state court for more than a year,b and the rule that all defendants must consent to removal.palisades collections,at.
the report of the senate judiciary committee confirms congress intent to remove these three longstanding barriers to removal.the report specifically identifies each barrier to removal,discusses its potential for abuse,and explicitly states that b eliminates it.see,at,reprinted in.despite the numerous abuses of the class action system chronicled in its lengthy legislative history,b omits any mention of shamrock oil or the majority rule limiting the right of removal to original defendants.indeed,there is no mention of shamrock oil or or counterclaim defendant in the entirety of the senate report.given the care con
