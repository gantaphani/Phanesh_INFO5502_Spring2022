in this pension case the city of san diego the city obtained by summary judgment against defendants san diego city employees retirement system sdcers,richard haas and benjamin vernon together sometimes defendants,a judicial declaration that defendants are ineligible to receive certain ancillary retirement benefits.the ancillary benefits at issue on this appeal are a retirement check,payable whenever there are excess earnings available in the retirement system at the end of the year the deferred retirement option program drop,an alternative method of benefit accrual the right to purchase up to five years of additional service credits service credits and retiree medical health benefits collectively,the four benefits.
before they began their employment with the city,defendants or their labor representatives entered into employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements with the city that provided that employees hired on or after july,were ineligible to receive the four benefits.however,it was not until january,that the city passed san diego ordinance the ordinance,which amended the san diego municipal code sdmc to reflect that employees hired on or after july,were not eligible for the four benefits.the ordinance stated that it was effective days thereafter,on february.
defendants benjamin vernon and richard haas represent a defense class consisting of all city employees hired on or after july,but before february.the defense class is divided into two subclasses.vernon represents defense subclass a,which consists of employees who were represented in labor negotiations by a recognized bargaining unit.employees who were not represented by a labor union are represented by haas in defense subclass 
defendants haas and vernon assert on that the court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the city because by its express terms the ordinance was to apply prospectively the city did not overcome the presumption that ordinances are to apply prospectively retroactive application of the ordinance is unconstitutional because it deprived defendants of vested retirement benefits and the ordinance was in violation of article ix,section of the san diego city charter city charter or charter which required that it be approved by members of the retirement system.
defendant george schaeffer has filed an appeal,individually,and in propria persona,asserting that the court erred in certifying the defense class.
we conclude that although the ordinance operates retroactively,it is not invalid because it only amends the sdmc to reflect the city existing agreements with defendants.further,no vote was required under city charter article ix,section for the ordinance to become effective because defendants never accrued rights to the four benefits.we also conclude that schaefer individual appeal lacks merit.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
a.the city exclusive power to grant benefits and negotiate labor agreements 
article iii,section of the city charter permits the san diego city council city council to enter into memoranda of understandings mous with any recognized city employee organization concerning wages,hours and other terms and conditions of employment.the charter also authorizes the city to maintain a pension system for its employees through sdcers.city charter,art.ix.sdcers is empowered to issue rules and regulations to administer the pension system and is a separate legal entity from the city.city charter,art.ix.the city council,however,possesses the exclusive authority in granting and modifying retirement benefits.city charter,art.ix.
elimination of the four benefits for new hires on or after july,
the city has recognized five employee bargaining units the san diego municipal employees association mea the san diego city firefighters local,iaaf,afl cio firefighters local,american federation of state,county and municipal employees,afl cio afscme the deputy city attorneys association of san diego dcaa and the san diego police officers association poa.
the city negotiated benefit modifications for prospective employees in its summer collective bargaining efforts with the five bargaining units under the meyers milias brown act mmba.effective july,the city entered into mous with the mea,firefighters,afscme,and the dcaa.the city also negotiated with the poa,but upon reaching an impasse,the city council imposed the terms of its last,best,final offer lbfo on the poa.
in exchange for receiving a fixed retirement allowance formula and other benefits,the mous and lbfo provided that city employees hired on or after july,new employees would not be eligible for the four benefits.neither the mous nor the lbfo changed any retirement benefits for city employees hired before july.
the afscme,firefighters and mea mous contained implementation provisions.article,section of the mea mou states the city shall,in a timely manner,complete necessary changes in ordinances,resolutions,rules,policies and procedures to conform to this agreement,using september,as a target date for such completion.article of the mea mou states that its term is from july,to june.article,section,states that the mou reflects the parties agreement regarding retirement contribution and benefit changes resulting from meet and confer in.mea members ratified the mou shortly after negotiations.
article of the afscme mou contains a similar implementation provision.article states that the term of the mou shall be from july,to june.article,section.a,further states that the mou reflects the parties agreement regarding retirement contribution and benefit changes resulting from meet and confer in.afcsme members ratified the mou shortly after negotiations.
article of the firefighters mou states,in pertinent part the city shall act as soon as possible to make the necessary changes in ordinances,resolutions,rules,policies and grievance procedures to conform to this agreement.all such changes shall be submitted to local prior to their submittal for implementation to insure sic that the proposed changes are consistent with the agreement.all disputes over language shall be governed by the grievance procedure.article of the firefighters mou states that its term is from july,to june.article,section,states that the mou reflects the parties agreement regarding retirement contribution and benefit changes resulting from meet and confer in.firefighters ratified the mou shortly after negotiations.
the dcaa mou does not contain an implementation provision.dcaa members ratified the mou.
on june,the city council passed and adopted resolution no.r,approving the lbfo and ratifying the mous entered into by and between the city and its representative bargaining units,to be effective as of july.resolution r legislative history states that the parties or their representatives ratified their respective agreements,with the express understanding that new employees would not be eligible for the four benefits.
haas accepted an employment offer with the city that did not include the four benefits 
the parties stipulated that at all relevant times,it was the city custom and practice to provide employees who were not members of the bargaining units unrepresented employees with the same benefits as members of the mea.haas was an unrepresented employee.haas was offered the position of deputy chief of public works with the city in a letter dated december.attached to his offer letter was a document entitled benefits schedule,deputy chief operations officer benefits schedule.the retirement benefit section of the benefits schedule does not include the four benefits and the offered benefits are identical to those included in mea mou.neither the offer letter nor the benefits schedule makes any reference to benefits being defined by any city ordinance.according to haas,he never received any document from the city explaining his benefits other than the benefits schedule.he accepted the position on december.
sdcers extends the four benefits to defendants 
after july,sdcers advised defendants that,notwithstanding any contrary mou,contractual obligations,or binding custom and practice,sdcers would continue to recognize their eligibility to receive the four benefits because the city attorney had not filed the paperwork necessary for modification.
e.the city council amends the municipal code to confirm elimination of the four benefits 
on january,the city council passed and adopted ordinance,which amended the sdmc consistent with the july,benefit changes.in this regard,section of the sdmc provides m embers hired or assuming office on or after july,are non health eligible.section of the sdmc provides the general provision for purchase of creditable service does not apply to members hired or assuming office after july.section of the sdmc provides m embers hired or assuming office on or after july,may not participate in drop.section of the sdmc provides m embers hired or assuming office on or after july,shall not be eligible for participation in the annual supplemental benefit program established by this article.
the ordinance states that it shall take effect and be in force on the day from and after its final passage.the ordinance legislative history includes the city attorney official report to the mayor and city council official report.the official report explains that the ordinance amends the sdmc to reflect these agreed to and imposed benefit modifications resulting from the labor negotiations.among other things,the official report states that the city and the bargaining units ratified their respective agreements or unilaterally implemented the lbfo with the express understanding that new employees would not be eligible for the four benefits.it further explains that,as a condition of the benefit modification,the city expressly promised the bargaining units that all new unrepresented employees would receive the same benefits as represented employees would under the mous.
city charter article ix,section a provides that n o ordinance that affects the benefits of any employee under the retirement system shall be adopted without the approval of a majority vote of city employees.the parties stipulated that no such vote was taken.
sdcer informs the city the effective date for the benefit changes was february 
in a letter dated august,sdcers general counsel informed the city that it would use an effective date of february,for the benefit changes,and continue to advise employees hired before that date that they were eligible for the four benefits.
then san diego city attorney michael aguirre responded by letter on august,in which he requested that sdcers discontinue advising employees that they are eligible for the four benefits.
sdcers did not respond to aguirre letter and did not stop approving benefit requests by defendants.
sdcers approves vernon and haas to purchase service credits 
in october defendant vernon accepted a job with the city of san diego as a firefighter.he began working for the city by attending the fire academy.on his first day on the job,a representative of sdcers informed him that,there was an agreement in that the four benefits were not available but that the city attorney had not filed the paperwork so that it was still available to us.on october,vernon submitted a request to purchase service credits.sdcers approved the request on february.
on or about june,defendant haas submitted a request to purchase service credits.in august sdcers approved haas request,and he completed his service credit purchase in september.
on october,the city advised haas that the purchase was ineffective and demanded haas rescind the purchase.haas refused.
procedural background 
the city files suit 
the city brought suit against sdcers,seeking a declaration that city employees first hired between july,and february,are ineligible to receive the four benefits.in response,sdcers brought a demurrer on the basis of misjoinder of parties,asserting that defendants were necessary and indispensable parties to the suit because their property interests in the four benefits may be adversely affected by the declaration sought by the city.the court sustained the demurrer,with leave to amend.
the city thereafter filed a second amended complaint sac,naming vernon and haas individually and as class representatives.the sac second cause of action was directed to defendants and prayed for the following relief a judicial determination on the second cause of action that the benefit changes described in the july,mous and san diego city ordinance,and san diego municipal code sections,and,apply to all new city employees hired on or after july.
the court certifies a defense class 
in march the court certified the city second cause of action as a defense class action,consisting of two subclasses.the ruling defined subclass a as all city employees first hired on or after july,and before february,employed in positions within any bargaining unit represented by mea,firefighters,afscme,poa,and dcaa.subclass b was defined as all city employees first hired on or after july,and before february,who are not members of at least one of the representative bargaining units described in a above.
the court found that the defense class alleged by the city was clearly defined and ascertainable.the court further found that common questions of fact and law predominated over individual ones because resolution of the following issues would determine the defendants entitlement to the four benefits whether the effective date of benefit changes is july,or february,whether the ordinance is applicable retroactively and whether the mou and lbfo terms are binding on all subclass members.the court found that differences in the mous language was immaterial,as they would not affect the central legal issue the effective date of modification.
the court also found there was adequate representation in that the class representatives defenses were typical of the class,class counsel were experienced and diligent,and any purported conflict of interest was illusory.the court found that many of the due process concerns that arise out of defense class actions,such as collusion and inadequate notice,were not present here because defendants would receive actual notice of the pending action,and pension litigation has been subjected to significant public scrutiny.finally,given the court conclusion that all class members were necessary parties,the court found that class treatment was clearly in the interests of the parties and the court,and thus certification was appropriate under the heightened standard for a defense class action.
the parties for summary judgment 
the city moved for summary adjudication on the second cause of action against defendants on the ground that no defense existed because the undisputed facts demonstrated that defendants had not acquired vested rights to the four benefits.defense subclass a members were bound by the mous or lbfo that modified their eligibility for the four benefits,and poa members were collaterally estopped from relitigating issues concerning the lbfo due to litigation between the city and the poa in the federal courts.the city asserted that defense subclass b members were either covered by the mea mou by virtue of custom and practice or they accepted employment offers from the city that did not include the four benefits as consideration.alternatively,assuming all defendants gained vested rights to the four benefits before employment,they consented to the benefit modifications through these contractual arrangements.
vernon moved for summary judgment on the city second cause of action,arguing that he was entitled to the four benefits because he was hired before enactment of the ordinance,which must be construed to operate prospectively because if construed to operate retroactively the ordinance would be invalid for failure to comply with section a of the city charter.he also argued the ordinance violated the contract clauses of the federal and state constitutions by impairing his vested rights to the four benefits.
in his summary judgment motion on the city second cause of action,haas argued that the ordinance is void for failure to comply with charter section a the ordinance must be construed to operate prospectively,not retrospectively and he could establish one of his affirmative defenses,namely,retroactive application of the ordinance violates defense subclass b due process rights.
schaefer did not file a summary judgment motion of his own because he elected not to intervene in the trial court.
the trial court granted the city summary judgment motion,finding that defendants did not have a vested,contractual right to the four benefits.further,the court found that at the time they were hired,defendants did not have a reasonable expectation of receiving such benefits because the ratified,binding mous,the lbfo,and the separate contracts did not provide for them.because defendants were not eligible to receive the four benefits,the ordinance retroactive operation had no legal significance,and,thus,article ix,section a of the city charter did not apply.
in its ruling,the court acknowledged that the modification of retirement benefits was required to be made by an ordinance,not by a resolution or the mous referencing employees hired after july.the court found that it must look only to the ordinance and the legislative history to determine when the modification of the four retirement benefits became effective.the court recognized that there is a presumption that a statute applies prospectively only,but then found that the city overcame that presumption because the ordinance and related documents,including the mous,demonstrated a clear intent that employees hired after july,would not receive the four benefits,notwithstanding the additional language that the ordinance would be effective days after enactment.
the court also noted that t he right to a pension vests upon acceptance of employment and that defendants had been hired with the understanding that the four benefits would not apply to them.the court found that employees hired after july,did not have vested contractual rights because,at the time they were hired,the four benefits were not provided for in the mous.
finally,the court held that a vote under city charter article ix,section a was not required with respect to the ordinance because,among other things,the employees hired after july,were not members to have their benefits affected.
this timely appeal follows.

ii.analysis 
city status as a charter city 
as we have noted,ante,san diego is a charter city.it can make and enforce all ordinances and regulations regarding municipal affairs subject only to the restrictions and limitations imposed by the city charter,as well as conflicting provisions in the united states and california constitutions and preemptive state law.grimm san diego d,grimm.employee compensation and benefits constitute municipal affairs covered by city charters.ibid.

defendants contention they acquired vested rights to the four benefits

ordinance is retroactive 
defendants assert that even if they did not accrue vested rights to the four benefits,the ordinance language and legislative history establish that the ordinance is prospective in nature.we reject this contention.

ordinance no.o unambiguously provides that city employees hired or assuming office on or after july,are not eligible for the four benefits.
defendants assert that because the ordinance states that it shall take effect and be in force on the thirtieth day from and after its final passage,this effective date provision means that the ordinance has only prospective application.however,the effective date of a statute is merely the date upon which the statute came into being as an existing law.preston state bd.of equalization cal th,preston.it does not mean that the effective date of the elimination of the four benefits is that date.the effective date language does not control over the city council clear intent and purpose,which was to make employees hired on or after july,ineligible to receive the four benefits.id.at where,as here,compelling indicators of the legislature intent to give a statute retrospective effect exist,the mere post ponement of the statute operative date is not enough to negate these indicators see also tevis san francisco cal d,a charter amendment has retrospective effect even though the amendment delayed its effective date.
not only is this construction demonstrated by the text of the mous,the resolution and the ordinance,it is consistent with the mmba,which makes valid and permissible mous providing retroactive salary adjustments to public employees.san joaquin county employees,county of san joaquin d,county of san joaquin acknowledging that under the mmba there was no impediment to making a salary adjustment retroactive goleta educators dall armi d,same,several contracts relating to the same matters,between the same parties,and made as parts of substantially one transaction are to be taken together.
vernon asserts that county of san joaquin is distinguishable because it concerns retroactive pay increases,not benefit decreases.this contention is unavailing.the mmba provides a collective bargaining mechanism for resolving labor disputes.glendale city employees,city of glendale,supra,cal d at.county of san joaquin examined whether retroactive,implementing legislation is permitted under the mmba,such that the local government was obligated to meet and confer on retroactive pay issues.county of san joaquin,supra,d at.because the mmba did not provide the authority for such increases,the determination that the retroactive increases was legal was accomplished under the appropriate constitutional and statutory provisions.id.at.that court,however,did not limit its holding to salary or benefit increases.it only considered the legality of the retroactive application of such increases.
indeed,the city charter budgetary process illustrates the need to have benefit changes applied retroactively.article vii,section of the city charter provides that that the city fiscal year begins every july and ends the following june.article iii,section provides that the salary ordinance,which fixes the salaries for all city employees for the coming year,must be adopted by no later than may.article vii,section provides that a ll increases and decreases of salary or wages of officers and employees shall be determined at the time of the preparation and adoption of the budget,and no such increase or decrease shall be effective prior to the fiscal year for which the budget is adopted.finally,article vii,section provides that the city budget must be adopted in the month of july,and only after two public hearings are held on the draft budget.
as such,the city is required to make any benefit changes effective july,even though it can not officially appropriate the funding for such changes until later that month.the target date found in the mea mou reflects this budgetary process.consistent with article vii,sections and of the city charter,the mou sets the effective date for benefit changes and the beginning of its term for july,the beginning of the fiscal year.the mou target date of september,comes more than two months after the appropriations are made by the city,presumably to permit the relevant city departments to generate and enact the needed legislation without impacting the budgetary process.given this structure,retroactive,implementing legislation is needed to effectuate the benefit changes agreed to by the city and its bargaining units.
f.the mou implementation provisions 
vernon concedes that the mea,afcsme,firefighters and dcaa mous all agreed to eliminate the four benefits for him and his fellow new employee members.nevertheless,he asserts that the mous implementation clauses required the enactment of a valid implementing ordinance before the terms of the mous became binding on defendants.we reject this contention.
vernon interpretation of the implementation clauses is incorrect in several respects.first,he considers the clauses in isolation and ignores the substantive benefit change provisions,the agreements stated purposes,and the recitals memorializing the parties underlying intent on benefit changes that the four benefits would be eliminated as to employees hired on or after july.such a reading of the implementation provisions impermissibly renders the bulk of the mous,including the benefit change provisions themselves,as surplusage.city of el cajon el cajon police officers,supra,th at see also.
second,vernon appears to interpret the implementation clauses as conditions precedent.see,a condition precedent is one which is to be performed before some right dependent thereon accrues,or some act dependent thereon is performed.yet,to be a construed in that manner,the implementation clauses would have to plainly and unambiguously state that new employees eligibility for the four benefits is to be determined by the enactment date of any implementing legislation.see rubin fuchs cal d,contract provisions are not construed as conditions precedent in the absence of language plainly requiring such construction.there is no such language in the implementing provisions of the mous.
g.the presumption that statutes are to operate prospectively 
as the city acknowledges,statutes are presumed to operate prospectively.preston,supra,cal th at.however,this presumption may be rebutted by legislative intent,inferred from a statute express provisions as well as from extrinsic sources,including legislative history.ibid.
the plain meaning of the ordinance text,coupled with its legislative history,demonstrates that the city council intended that the ordinance operate retroactively to effectuate the parties already existing agreements on benefit modifications.although it was not enacted until january,or effective until february,the ordinance plainly states that employees hired on or after july,are ineligible for the four benefits.thus,the city council intended that the ordinance be given retroactive effect to july,the effective date of the parties agreement.preston,supra,cal th at courts must apply statute retrospectively if legislative intent is clear.
the ordinance legislative history also reveals an intent that it be applied retroactively.in an october,memo,then city attorney aguirre explained to the mayor and city council that the ordinance sought to retroactively effectuate the benefit modifications resulting from the labor negotiations.memoranda from city attorneys to city councils concerning a draft ordinance are properly considered in determining legislative intent.aguiar superior court th,fn.
defendants contend that the ordinance must be construed to apply prospectively based upon its effective date of february.however,as discussed,ante,the ordinance effective date is merely the date upon which the statute came into being as an existing law.preston,supra,cal th at.it does not control over the city council clear intent and purpose that the benefit modifications be applied retroactively to.ibid.defendants interpretation ignores the ordinance plain language and purpose.
accordingly,the court correctly found the city has overcome the presumption that the ordinance operated prospectively.
retired employees decision 
as noted,ante,following briefing by the parties,the california supreme court issued its decision in retired employees,supra,cal th,and we allowed the parties to file supplemental briefs to address this case.retired employees supports the court grant of summary judgment in favor of the city.
in retired employees,our high court answered a question certified by the ninth circuit court of appeals w hether,as a matter of california law,a california county and its employees can form an implied contract that confers vested rights to health benefits on retired county employees.retired employees,supra,cal th at.the question arose because of orange county decision to end a longstanding practice of pooling retirees with active employees for purposes of calculating health insurance premiums.id.at because active employees tend to be younger and healthier than retirees,the pooling effectively lowered retirees health insurance costs below what they would have paid absent pooling.ibid.when the county ended the practice,the retirees sued in federal court under the state and federal constitutions contract clauses cal,art.i,art.i,cl,arguing that although the express provisions of various mous were silent as to the duration of the pooling,the longstanding and consistent practice of doing so had created an implied contractual right to its continuation.retired emples.ass of orange county county of orange,retired employees,supra,cal th at.
on appeal,the ninth circuit sought the california supreme court guidance on whether a county could enter into an implied contract for vested retiree health benefits,and the supreme court answered in the affirmative.the supreme court held that vested contractual rights may be implied from an ordinance or resolution,including a collective bargaining agreement ratified by resolution.retired employees,supra,cal th at.the key question,according to the court,was what the parties intended if the language or circumstances accompanying the passage of a resolution,ordinance,or other legislative act clearly evince a legislative intent to create private rights of a contractual nature enforceable against the employer then courts should find such a right.ibid.
however,our high court also held that where,as is the case here,the parties are authorized to bargain collectively under the mmba,the mous they have agreed to govern their relationship,and,once ratified,such agreements are binding and constitutionally protected.retired employees,supra,cal th at.such mous are binding and enforceable contracts that the city may enforce against its employees.id.at.
defendants assert that retired employees supports the proposition that because the four benefits were part of the sdmc at the time they were hired,those benefits may be implied in their employment contracts at the time they were hired.in fact retired employees negates this contention because the law does not recognize implied contract terms that are at variance with the terms of the contract as expressly agreed or as prescribed by statute.retired employees,supra,cal th at.thus,vested rights may not be implied from the sdmc where,as here,they are contrary to the express terms of the parties contract.id.at.because the mous expressly made employees hired on or after july,ineligible for the four benefits that existed at that time in the sdmc,they can not be implied from the sdmc into the mous.id.at.
defendants again rely upon sdcers representations that they were entitled to the four benefits,despite the ratified mous.however,we may only look to whether the city council,and not sdcers,intended to grant vested rights to the four benefits.retired employees,supra,cal th at.this is because,as we explained in another city pension case,only the city council has the power to grant employee benefits,and sdcers exceeds its authority when it attempts to expand pension benefits beyond those the city council has granted.city of san diego san diego city employees retirement system th.
according to amicus dcaa,retired employees confirms that defendants are correct that the bare mou,without an implementing ordinance,did not eliminate pension benefits.actually,retired employees held just the opposite,stating the alleged contractual right there did not necessarily depend on whether there is express language in a statute or ordinance retired employees,supra,cal th at.
accordingly,retired employees supports our conclusion that the court did not err in granting summary judgment on behalf of the city.
presumption that legislation is valid 
legislative enactments are presumed valid.county of del norte city of crescent city th.to overcome this presumption,d
