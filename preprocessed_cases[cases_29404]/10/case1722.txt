christina denkinger appeals from the order granting the motion made by the defendant,to strike class allegations from her complaint.she contends the trial court erred in granting the motion to strike based on evidence outside the pleadings at the least,she contends,the trial court should have given her leave to amend the complaint.alternatively,denkinger contends if the trial court properly relied on evidence outside the pleadings,it erred in striking the class allegations without affording her an opportunity to test the evidence through discovery.
we find the trial court correctly handled the motion under class certification guidelines,properly receiving evidence on the class certification issue and exercising its discretion in denying certification.accordingly,we affirm.
in december,john williams and james thornhill filed a class action complaint against,doing business as bcbg maxazria bcbg,on behalf of all managers and assistant managers in bcbg california stores during the preceding four years.the complaint alleged causes of action for failure to pay overtime compensation,and disgorgement of unpaid wages bus,et.in april,christina denkinger filed a class action complaint alleging the same causes of action.the three plaintiffs collectively referred to as plaintiffs then filed a coordinated complaint against bcbg in march.
the coordinated complaint alleges that bcbg designated all managers and assistant managers as exempt to avoid paying them overtime wages.they were expected and required to work more than forty hours per week and were regularly and customarily scheduled to and required to work more than eight hours per day or more than forty hours per week and,in some instances,were required to work over sixty hours per week without overtime pay bcbg policy of operating stores without incurring employee overtime required the managers and assistant managers to work over forty hours per week and spend over fifty percent of their working hours performing the duties delegated to employees.
in january,bcbg filed a motion to strike class allegations pursuant to california rules of court,rule a for judgment on the pleadings.in the points and authorities,bcbg explained the nature of its business bcbg is an haute couture design house for styled women clothing in california,bcbg has maintained approximately business locations with a variety of differing operating instance,some boutiques are small,shops,others are large destination locations some other s are small locations,while others are large even locations in malls still others are incorporated as part of outdoor shopping plazas.not all bcbg shops carry the same merchandise only a handful of bcbg boutiques have been considered collection stores that carry the seasonal collections designed by max azria design house and shown on fashion runways.
bcbg submitted declarations of current or former managers and assistant managers from various california stores supporting its contention that managers are not assigned uniform duties and spend more than percent of their time on work.different stores target different customers,each requiring a different business strategy.hours of operation and staffing differ according to each shop unique circumstance and market focus.and the boutiques are neither uniformly designed nor share a uniform layout.i ndependent judgment of the manager is necessary in analyzing where and how to display or store clothes,the sight lines of shoppers entering the shop,the number and location of windows and walls,and hidden areas that are at high risk for shoplifting,while factoring in the volume and variety of clothing sold in that particular location,the availability of storage space,and promoting the interests of clientele for that particular boutique.
the plaintiffs opposed the motion,contending it was an improper attempt to circumvent the class certification process.the tentative decision issued by the court was to grant the motion,and at oral argument,the plaintiffs asked that the motion be continued to allow them to depose some of the declarants.the plaintiffs also requested a administrator to provide notice to all of the individuals,who m they claim to have from,so that we can give them the opportunity to contact us.they also asked,at the very least,leave to amend the complaint as to thornhill to add claims for failure to calculate correctly the overtime paid for hourly employees.and we will be bringing a motion to amend,or requesting your honor,today,to permit us to do so,in light of the tentative decision to grant the motion to strike 
the trial court granted the motion to strike the class allegations,finding the motion was properly before it because class certification issues may be determined at any time during the litigation.it found that bcbg had met its burden to show that the action is not suitable for class certification by producing substantial evidence which establishes that plaintiffs can not prove the elements of typicality or commonality necessary for class certification.
discussion 
on appeal,denkinger contends the motion to strike was improperly granted for two alternative reasons evidence outside the pleadings can not be considered on a motion to strike unless it is the subject of judicial notice or the motion was an untimely challenge to class certification before the plaintiffs could make their motion to certify the class,and it was granted without giving them the opportunity to test the veracity of the evidence submitted by bcbg neither contention has merit.we find plaintiffs motion filed under rule was not an attack on the pleadings,like a traditional motion to strike rather,it was a request to initiate the class certification process.the motion was timely,and the trial court properly took evidence outside the pleadings and denied the belated discovery request.
