although respondents credit card agreement required their claims to be resolved by binding arbitration,they filed a lawsuit against petitioner compucredit corporation and a division of petitioner bank,alleging,inter alia,violations of the credit repair organizations act croa.the federal district court denied the defendants motion to compel arbitration,concluding that congress intended croa claims to be nonarbitrable.the ninth circuit affirmed.
held because the croa is silent on whether claims under the act can proceed in an arbitrable forum,the federal arbitration act faa requires the arbitration agreement to be enforced according to its terms.
a section of the faa establishes a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration.moses cone memorial hospital mercury constr.it requires that courts enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms.see dean witter reynolds byrd.that is the case even when federal statutory claims are at issue,unless the faa mandate has been overridden by a contrary congressional command.express mcmahon.
b the croa provides no such command.respondents contend that the croa disclosure provision which requires credit repair organizations to provide consumers with a statement that includes the sentence you have a right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the act,a gives consumers the right to bring an action in a court of law and that,because the croa prohibits the waiver of any right of the consumer under this subchapter,a,the arbitration agreement waiver of the right to bring a court action can not be enforced.respondents premise is flawed.the disclosure provision creates only a right for consumers to receive a specific statement describing the consumer protections that the law elsewhere provides,one of which is the right to enforce a credit repair organization liab ility for fail ure to comply with the act.a.that provision does not override the faa mandate.its mere contemplation of judicial enforcement does not demonstrate that the act provides consumers with a right to initial judicial enforcement.
c at the time of the croa enactment in,arbitration clauses such as the one at issue were no rarity in consumer contracts generally,or in financial services contracts in particular.had congress meant to prohibit these very common provisions in the croa,it would have done so in a manner less obtuse than what respondents suggest.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
we consider whether the credit repair organizations act croa,et,precludes enforcement of an arbitration agreement in a lawsuit alleging violations of that act.
respondents are individuals who applied for and received an aspire visa credit card marketed by petitioner compucredit corporation and issued by columbus bank and trust,now a division of petitioner synovus bank.in their applications they agreed to be bound by a provision which read any claim,dispute or controversy whether in contract,tort,or otherwise at any time arising from or relating to your account,any transferred balances or this agreement collectively,claims,upon the election of you or us,will be resolved by binding arbitration app.
in,respondents filed a complaint against compucredit and columbus in the united states district court for the northern district of california,alleging,as relevant here,violations of the croa.the claims largely involved the defendants allegedly misleading representation that the credit card could be used to rebuild poor credit and their assessment of multiple fees upon opening of the accounts,which greatly reduced the advertised credit limit.
the district court denied the defendants motion to compel arbitration of the claims,concluding that congress intended claims under the croa to be.supp.a panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed,judge tashima dissenting.we granted certiorari.
the background law governing the issue before us is the federal arbitration act faa,et,enacted in as a response to judicial hostility to arbitration.mobility llc concepcion,slip,at.as relevant here,the faa provides 
a written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.
this provision establishes a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.moses cone memorial hospital mercury constr.see also,concepcion,supra,at slip,at gilmer lane.it requires courts to enforce agreements to arbitrate according to their terms.see dean witter reynolds byrd.that is the case even when the claims at issue are federal statutory claims,unless the faa mandate has been overridden by a contrary congressional command.express mcmahon.see also mitsubishi motors soler.respondents contend that the croa contains such a command.
that statute regulates the practices of credit repair organizations,defined as certain entities that offer services for the purpose of i improving any consumer credit record,credit history,or credit rating or ii providing advice or assistance to any consumer with regard to any activity or service described in clause i.in its principal substantive provisions,the croa prohibits certain practices,establishes certain requirements for contracts with consumers,and gives consumers a right to cancel.enforcement is achieved through the act provision of a private cause of action for violation,as well as through federal and state administrative enforcement.
like the district court and the ninth circuit,respondents focus on the croa disclosure and nonwaiver provisions.the former,which is reproduced in full in the appendix,infra,sets forth a statement that the credit organization must provide to the consumer before any contract is executed.a.one sentence of that required statement reads,you have a right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the credit repair organization act.the act nonwaiver provision states,any waiver by any consumer of any protection provided by or any right of the consumer under this subchapter shall be treated as void and may not be enforced by any federal or state court or any other person.a.
the ninth circuit adopted the following line of reasoning,urged upon us by respondents here the disclosure provision gives consumers the right to sue,which clearly involves the right to bring an action in a court of law.at.because the nonwaiver provision prohibits the waiver of any right of the consumer under this subchapter,the arbitration agreement which waived the right to bring an action in a court of law can not be enforced,at.
the flaw in this argument is its premise that the disclosure provision provides consumers with a right to bring an action in a court of law.it does not.rather,it imposes an obligation on credit repair organizations to supply consumers with a specific statement set forth in quotation marks in the statute.the only consumer right it creates is the right to receive the statement,which is meant to describe the consumer protections that the law elsewhere provides.the statement informs consumers,for instance,that they can dispute the accuracy of information in their credit file and that t he credit bureau must then reinvestigate and modify or remove inaccurate or incomplete information.a.that description is derived from a,which sets out in great detail the procedures to be followed by a credit bureau in the event of challenges to the accuracy of its information.similarly,the required statement informs consumers that they may cancel your contract with any credit repair organization for any reason within business days from the date you signed it the right created and set forth in more detail in.and the right to sue language describes the consumer right to enforce the credit repair organization liab ility for fail ure to comply with any provision of this subchapter provided for in a thus,to the dissent assertion,our interpretation does not r educ e the required disclosure to insignificance,post,at.the disclosure provision informs consumers of their right to enforce liability for any failure to conform to the statute information they might otherwise not possess.it is the dissent interpretation that effectively reduces a portion of the croa to a nullity.interpreting the right to sue language in a to create a right to sue in court not only renders it strikingly out of place in a section that is otherwise devoted to giving the consumer notice of rights created elsewhere it also renders the creation of the right to sue elsewhere superfluous.
respondents suggest that the croa,set forth in full in the appendix,infra,demonstrates that the act provides consumers with a right to bring an action in court.they cite the provision repeated use of the terms action,class action,and court terms that they say call to mind a judicial proceeding.these references can not do the heavy lifting that respondents assign them.it is utterly commonplace for statutes that create civil causes of action to describe the details of those causes of action,including the relief available,in the context of a court suit.if the mere formulation of the cause of action in this standard fashion were sufficient to establish the contrary congressional com mand overriding the faa,mcmahon,supra,at,valid arbitration agreements covering federal causes of action would be rare indeed.but that is not the law.in gilmer we enforced an arbitration agreement with respect to a cause of action created by the age discrimination in employment act of adea which read,in part any person aggrieved may bring a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter.c.in mcmahon we enforced an arbitration agreement with respect to a cause of action created by a provision of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico which read,in part any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate united states district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit c.and in mitsubishi motors we enforced an arbitration agreement with respect to a cause of action created by a provision of the clayton act which read,in part a ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the united states and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained,and the cost of suit,including a reasonable attorney fee.a.thus,we have repeatedly recognized that contractually required arbitration of claims satisfies the statutory prescription of civil liability in court.see gilmer,at mcmahon,at mitsubishi motors,at.to be sure,none of the statutes described above contained a nonwaiver provision,as the statute before us does.but if a provision mentioning judicial enforcement does not create a right to initial judicial enforcement,the waiver of initial judicial enforcement is not the waiver of a right of the consumer,a.it takes a considerable stretch to regard the nonwaiver provision as a congressional command that the faa shall not apply 
moreover,if one believes that contemplation of court suit combined with a establishes a right to initial judicial enforcement,one must also believe that it establishes a nonwaivable right to initial judicial enforcement in any competent judicial tribunal,since it contains no limitation.we think it clear,however,that this mere contemplation of suit in any competent court does not guarantee suit in all competent courts,disabling the parties from adopting a reasonable clause.and just as the contemplated availability of all judicial forums may be reduced to a single forum by contractual specification,so also can the contemplated availability of judicial action be limited to judicial action compelling or reviewing initial arbitral adjudication.the parties remain free to specify such matters,so long as the guarantee of the guarantee of the legal power to impose liability is preserved.
respondents and the dissent maintain that if the croa does not create a right to a judicial forum,then the disclosure provision effectively requires that credit repair organizations mislead consumers.we think not.the disclosure provision is meant to describe the law to consumers in a manner that is concise and comprehensible to the layman which necessarily means that it will be imprecise.the required statement says,for example,that the croa prohibits deceptive practices by credit repair organiza tions,a.this is in some respects an overstatement,and in some respects an understatement,of the prohibited practices set forth in.it would include,for example,deception apart from the offer or sale of the services of the credit repair organization,a.yet we would not hold,in order to prevent the required statement from being misleading,that a consumer has a right to be protected from deceptive practices beyond those actually covered by.so also with respect to the statement description of a right to sue.this is a colloquial method of communicating to consumers that they have the legal right,enforceable in court,to recover damages from credit repair organizations that violate the croa.we think most consumers would understand it this way,without regard to whether the suit in court has to be preceded by an arbitration proceeding.leaving that possibility out may be imprecise,but it is not misleading and certainly not so misleading as to demand,in order to avoid that result,reading the statute to contain a guaranteed right it does not in fact contain.
at the time of the croa enactment in,arbitration clauses in contracts of the type at issue here were no rarity.quite the contrary,the early saw the increased use of arbitration clauses in consumer contracts generally,and in financial services contracts in particular.see ware,arbitration and unconscionability after doctor associates,casarotto,wake forest,and shimabukuro,congressional research service report for congress,the federal arbitration act background and recent developments.
had congress meant to prohibit these very common provisions in the croa,it would have done so in a manner less obtuse than what respondents suggest.when it has restricted the use of arbitration in other contexts,it has done so with a clarity that far exceeds the claimed indications in the croa.see,n,supp.iv no predispute arbitration agreement shall be valid or enforceable,if the agreement requires arbitration of a dispute arising under this section a ed.notwithstanding any other provision of law,whenever a motor vehicle franchise contract provides for the use of arbitration to resolve a controversy arising out of or relating to such contract,arbitration may be used to settle such controversy only if after such controversy arises all parties to such controversy consent in writing to use arbitration to settle such controversy b,supp.iv granting authority to the newly created consumer financial protection bureau to regulate predispute arbitration agreements in contracts for consumer financial products or services that congress would have sought to achieve the same result in the croa through combination of the nonwaiver provision with the right to sue phrase in the disclosure provision,and the references to action and court in the description of damages recoverable,is unlikely.
because the croa is silent on whether claims under the act can proceed in an arbitrable forum,the faa requires the arbitration agreement to be enforced according to its terms.the judgment of the ninth circuit is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

sotomayor,concurring in judgment 
compucredit corporation,et,petitioners wanda greenwood et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice sotomayor,with whom justice kagan joins,concurring in the judgment.
claims alleging the violation of a statute,such as the credit repair organizations act act,et,are generally subject to valid arbitration agreements unless congress evinces a contrary intent in the text,history,or purpose of the statute.see gilmer lane.i agree with the court that congress has not shown that intent here.but for the reasons stated by the dissent,i find this to be a much closer case than the majority opinion suggests.
the act creates a cause of action in its liability provision,see a,denominates the cause of action a right to sue in the mandatory disclosure statement,a,and then provides that right s may not be waived,a.those for whom congress wrote the act lay readers of limited economic means and inexperienced in credit matters,a reasonably may interpret the phrase right to sue as promising a right to sue in court.and it is plausible to think that congress,aware of the impact of its words,intended such a construction of the liability provision.
but while this interpretation of the act is plausible,it is in my view no more compelling than the contrary construction that petitioners urge.as the majority opinion notes,the disclosure provision does not itself confer a cause of action,and the liability provision that does is materially indistinguishable from other statutes that we have held not to preclude arbitration.in my mind this leaves the parties arguments in equipoise,and our precedents require that petitioners prevail in this circumstance.this is because respondents,as the opponents of arbitration,bear the burden of showing that congress disallowed arbitration of their claims,and because we resolve doubts in favor of arbitration.see,at.of course,if we have misread congress intent,then congress can correct our error by amending the statute.
i add one more point.the majority opinion contrasts the liability provision of the act with other,more recently enacted statutes that expressly disallow arbitration.i do not understand the majority opinion to hold that congress must speak so explicitly in order to convey its intent to preclude arbitration of statutory claims.we have never said as much,and on numerous occasions have held that proof of congress intent may also be discovered in the history or purpose of the statute in question.see ibid.if such an intention exists,it will be discoverable in the text of the statute,its legislative history,or an inherent conflict between arbitration and the statute underlying purposes express mcmahon,if congress did intend to limit or prohibit waiver of a judicial forum for a particular claim,such an intent will be deducible from the statute text or legislative history,or from an inherent conflict between arbitration and the statute underlying quoting mitsubishi motors soler,citation omitted.i agree with the dissent that the statutes the majority opinion cites shed little light on the thoughts of the congress that passed the act.but the act text is not dispositive,and respondents identify nothing in the legislative history or purpose of the act that would tip the balance of the scale in favor of their interpretation.

compucredit corporation,et,petitioners wanda greenwood et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice ginsburg,dissenting.
congress enacted the credit repair organizations act croa to protect consumers who have experienced credit problems particularly those of limited economic means against the unfair and deceptive practices of credit repair organizations.a.central to the legislation,congress sought to arm consumers with information needed to make intelligent decisions about purchasing a repair organization services.to that end,congress directed that,before execution of any contract between a consumer and a credit repair organization,the organization must make certain disclosures.one of the required disclosures reads 
you have a right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the croa.this law prohibits deceptive practices by such organizations.a.
the act provision describes suits consumers may bring in court individual and class actions for damages actual and punitive and attorneys fees.a further provision renders void any purported waiver of any protection or right the act grants to consumers.
the court today holds that credit repair organizations can escape suit by providing in their contracts that arbitration will serve as the parties sole mechanism.the right to sue,the court explains,merely connotes the vindication of legal rights,whether in court or before an arbitrator.that reading may be comprehensible to one trained to think like a lawyer.but congress enacted the croa with vulnerable consumers in mind consumers likely to read the words right to sue to mean the right to litigate in court,not the obligation to submit disputes to binding arbitration.
in accord with the ninth circuit,i would hold that congress,in an act meant to curb deceptive practices,did not authorize credit repair organizations to make a false or misleading disclosure telling consumers of a right they do not,in fact,possess.if the act affords consumers a nonwaivable right to sue in court,as i believe it does,a credit repair organization can not retract that right by making arbitration the consumer sole recourse.
compucredit marketed a credit card to consumers with weak credit ratings.it did so through massive and internet solicitations,urging recipients to acquire a card under the brand name aspire visa,and thereby rebuild poor credit and improve their credit rating.app,complaint internal quotation marks omitted.plaintiffs,individuals who applied for and received compucredit card,sought redress for multiple violations of the croa.
their complaint alleged that compucredit promotional materials told potential customers that no deposit would be required,and that cardholders would receive,upfront,a credit line of.in fact,plaintiffs asserted,they were charged an initial finance fee of,a monthly fee of,and an annual fee of,assessed immediately against the limit.in the aggregate,plaintiffs calculated,fees charged the first year amounted to.compucredit fee exactions did appear in the promotional materials in small print,buried amidst other information,and removed from the clearer representation that no deposit would be required,at,complaint.far from improving their credit rating,plaintiffs complained,compucredit knew that its card,saddled with these fees,would not provide any meaningful assistance whatsoever with regard to rebuilding credit and improving a credit rating.at,complaint b.furthermore,plaintiffs stated,compucredit did not provide them with the written disclosures of their rights required by the croa,at,complaint.
seeking damages for the alleged violations,along with attorneys fees,plaintiffs requested class certification.in the district court and court of appeals,they successfully resisted compucredit motion to compel arbitration pursuant to a form contract that barred class proceedings this court,however,interprets the croa to permit compucredit demand that plaintiffs proceed,if at all,before an arbitrator i read the governing statute differently.
three sections of the croa,considered together,indicate congress intention to preclude mandatory,arbitration of croa claims.see a,and.before entering into any consumer contract,credit repair organizations must give potential customers a written statement of rights they possess under that act and related laws.a.congress dictated every word of the required notification.credit repair organizations must tell consumers,in plain terms,how they may enforce their rights you have a right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the credit repair organization act.ibid.
the right to sue refers to the claim for relief congress afforded consumers in.any person who violates another rights under the croa shall be liable for actual damages and attorneys fees,and may be liable for punitive damages as well.a.the act sets out the factors the court shall consider in determining the amount of punitive damages the court may allow aggrieved consumers to recover,either individually or as a class.a and b.the liability created here,in,is precisely what the consumer,in light of,may sue to enforce.
the act renders void and unenforceable a ny waiver by any consumer of any protection provided by or any right of the consumer under this subchapter.emphasis added the rights listed in a rendered nonwaivable by are the right to sue and the right to cancel a contract for any reason within business days from the date the consumer signed it.
the question on which this case turns is what congress meant when it created a nonwaivable right to sue.recall that congress target audience in the croa is not composed of lawyers and judges accustomed to nuanced reading of statutory texts,but laypersons who receive a disclosure statement in the mail.recall,as well,congress findings that these individuals are often of limited economic means and inexperienced in credit matters.a.attributing little importance to this context,the court construes the right to sue as the legal right,enforceable in court,to recover damages without regard to whether the suit in court has to be preceded by an arbitration proceeding.ante,at.i read congress words without that sophisticated gloss the right to sue,i would hold,means the right to litigate in court.
the court is quite right in recognizing that consumers have the legal right,enforceable in court,to recover damages from credit repair organizations that violate the croa.ibid.but the court is quite wrong,as i see it,to characterize as merely imprecise,congress failure to include the caveat that access to court may be conditioned upon an anterior arbitration.the right to sue may well be a colloquial method of communicating to consumers.see ibid.but it surely is not colloquially understood by recipients of the required disclosures as the right,not to adjudicate in court,but only to seek,or defend against,court enforcement of an award rendered by the arbitrator chosen by the credit repair organization.few,if any,credit repair customers would equate the right to sue,a,with the extremely limited judicial review given to an arbitrator award,see,hall street associates,mattel.
the court discounts the references to action,class action,and court in,the provision that create s the consumers claim for relief.see ante,at.despite similar statutory language,the court observes,we have enforced arbitration agreements to settle disputes arising under other acts of congress.the croa,however,is distinguished by its disclosure requirements,prime among them,the obligation imposed on the credit repair organization to inform potential customers they have a right to sue an organization that violates the act.a.yet the court refuse
