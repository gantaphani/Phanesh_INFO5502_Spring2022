remigio and lina lebrilla,and karen and paul balfour collectively the lebrillas sought statewide class certification in their suit against farmers group,dba farmers underwriters association,and farmers insurance exchange collectively farmers,regarding farmers car repair practices.the trial court denied the lebrillas motion seeking class certification,ruling the lawsuit did not involve predominant common questions of law or fact.on appeal,the lebrillas argue the court ruling is based on a premature assessment of the lawsuit underlying merits.we conclude the matter must be reversed because the court applied the wrong legal criteria.
farmers provides automobile insurance to california consumers.under the terms of its standardized insurance policy,farmers limits their liability as follows our limits of liability for loss shall not exceed the amount which it would cost to repair or replace damaged or stolen property with other of like kind and quality or with new property less an adjustment for physical deterioration depreciation.
according to the lebrillas,farmers has a company wide policy to use parts not manufactured by the original equipment manufacturer oem,but or imitations of the oem parts made by manufacturers who do not have the material or dimensional and manufacturing specifications of the original equipment manufacturer.these are commonly called aftermarket parts,parts,or imitation parts.farmers specifies these imitation parts because they are cheaper than oem parts.
this case involves a narrow subset of parts,known as crash parts or parts such as hoods and fenders the lebrillas assert these crash parts are inferior to oem parts in terms of structural integrity,corrosion resistance,finish and appearance,fit,material composition,durability,and dent resistance and therefore are not of like kind and quality to oem parts as required by farmers insurance policy.
the lebrillas filed a lawsuit on behalf of themselves,and others similarly situated,challenging farmers practice of installing imitation crash parts on its insureds vehicles or paying its insureds money based on the cost of imitation crash parts.the lebrillas assert,as a result of farmers deceptive and fraudulent actions,plaintiffs and the class received substandard repair work which failed to restore their damaged vehicles to condition and received imitation crash parts on their vehicles or received payments that were insufficient because they were based on cheaper,inferior parts and omitted repairs.
they sought statewide class certification of three causes of action declaratory and injunctive relieve violation of the unfair competition law ucl bus,et and violation of the consumers legal remedies act clra,et the complaint framed several potential remedies available to the court,including an injunction directing farmers to comply with the like kind and quality standard and restitution measured by the amount farmers has saved since june the class period using inferior cheaper parts.
the trial court denied the motion seeking class certification stating,the number of unique factual issues relating to each class member strikes me as being dominant and as destroying any benefit that we could possibly get from class treatment.i can not in my mind conclude that this is an appropriate case for class treatment on a class that you have identified for this action.the reasons are,i think,well stated in some of the opposition i can not conceive,in my analysis of the situation,of grouping all of these claims for class treatment when my impression is they will almost,of necessity,require individualized analysis.each part,each claim,each car,and probably each discussion,each agreement between repair agent and customer and claims rep resentative,leaves,to me,too many issues that are unique and individual to permit class treatment.
general law regarding class certification 
courts long have acknowledged the importance of class actions as a means to prevent a failure of justice in our judicial system.citations.by establishing a technique whereby the claims of many individuals can be resolved at the same time,the class suit both eliminates the possibility of repetitious litigation and provides small claimants with a method of obtaining redress citation.generally,a class suit is appropriate when numerous parties suffer injury of insufficient size to warrant individual action and when denial of class relief would result in unjust advantage to the wrongdoer.citations.but because group action also has the potential to create injustice,trial courts are required to carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts.citations.linder thrifty oil cal th,d,linder.
code of civil procedure section authorizes class suits in california when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court.to obtain certification,a party must establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members.citation.the community of interest requirement involves three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.citation.other relevant considerations include the probability that each class member will come forward ultimately to prove his or her separate claim to a portion of the total recovery and whether the class approach would actually serve to deter and redress alleged wrongdoing.citation.linder,supra,cal th at,d.
we are mindful that b ecause trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action,they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification.the denial of certification to an entire class is an appealable order citations,but in the absence of other error,a trial court ruling supported by substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous legal assumptions were made citation.citation.under this standard,an order based upon improper criteria or incorrect assumptions calls for reversal even though there may be substantial evidence to support the court order.citations.accordingly,we must examine the trial court reasons for denying class certification.any valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.citation.linder,supra,cal th at,d.
class can establish predominant common questions of fact and law 
in this case,the trial court concluded the claims could not be grouped for class treatment because there were a number of unique factual issues relating to each class member.in other words,the court was convinced there were no predominant questions of fact and law,and the class members claims were not susceptible to common proof.
in their motion,the lebrillas claimed the following common questions of law and fact make their claims ideally suited for class treatment each of the california insurance policies is identical and,therefore,a declaration of the insureds rights under the policy presents a common classwide issue whether farmers common practice of specifying imitation crash parts meets the like kind and quality standard in the policy presents a common classwide issue each class member vehicle was repaired using imitation parts or each member was paid cash by farmers based in part on the cost of such parts and t he injunction farmers to retrospectively and prospectively comply with its coverage the very type of classwide injunction that is ideal for certification.
the lebrillas discussed the common evidence they have gathered to prove the class claims.for example,they asserted the fact farmers imitation parts are categorically inferior to oem parts could be proved on a classwide basis since they all suffer from the same design,manufacturing,and testing defects.
as explained by the lebrillas expert,paul griglio,crash parts are produced through a manufacturing process.they are not handmade individual items,rather they are uniformly produced through the use of particular tools,processes,specifications,and materials.analysis of each part is not necessary to determine the relative quality of a part modern automotive manufacturing,first introduced by henry ford,has obviated the need for individual assessment of the quality of any one individual part.he concluded,n o vehicle that has oem crash parts replaced with crash parts is restored to its condition and no individual evaluation or assessment of the vehicle would be necessary in order to make this determination.emphasis omitted.
the lebrillas expert cited three critical and consistent distinctions between oem and parts.griglio explained all oem parts are made to specifications both in terms of materials and in terms of dimensions.these specifications are proprietary and not available to manufacturers.he opined that without this information,manufacturers can not produce a part identical to an oem part.second,griglio noted all oem manufacturers engage in production of parts,which ensures uniform characteristics.he stated,the small production runs used by manufacturers of parts lack the safeguards inherent in production,such as specialized machinery and precise dies,molds,and stampings.finally,griglio focused on the fact all oem parts are crash and durability tested.he stated that because oem manufacturing standards result in the production of virtually identical parts consumers can be assured that the performance of replacement oem parts will be equal to the performance of original oem parts.he opined that no similar assurances can be made by manufacturers.for these reasons,the lebrillas contend common proof can show parts are universally inferior to oem parts.
farmers presented nine reasons why the proposed class claims do not present common questions of law and fact most of the arguments are premised on farmers different interpretation of like kind and quality.it maintained the phrase is tied to the preaccident condition age,use and condition of each class member car and,therefore,not subject to common proof.
as noted by both parties on appeal,interpretation of like kind and quality is by no means settled.class actions challenging the use of crash parts have been popping up all over the united states,and from this body of litigation two different interpretations have emerged.contrary to the lebrillas contention,interpretation of the policy language at this stage of the proceedings is not premature.as aptly stated by farmers,while the trial court may not determine whether or not the claim has merit,it must determine the applicable legal standard,in order to analyze whether appellants can demonstrate an ability to satisfy that legal standard by common proof.
the nationwide debate 
the question of whether a class can establish imitation crash parts are uniformly not of like kind and quality as oem parts has been examined by nearly one dozen courts,but is an issue of first impression in california.when the trial court considered the issue,farmers argued in its opposition,this is at least the eleventh court,in the seventh state,that has been asked to certify a class in a parts case.all but two of these in refused to grant certification.
much of the authority relied on by the parties is unpublished.in california an unpublished opinion may not be cited or relied upon.cal.rules of court,rule a people webster cal d,fn.however this rule applies only to opinions originating in california.opinions from other jurisdictions can be cited without regard to their publication status.decisions of the courts of other states are only regarded as persuasive depending on the point involved witkin,california procedure ed.appeal,and some states have different publication criteria than california.
at the time the motion was argued before the trial court,the illinois appellate court had published its decision.avery state farm mutual automobile ins.d,avery depublished.farmers argued the opinion was an aberration and urged the trial court to consider the unpublished opinions from six other,tennessee,alabama,washington,maryland,and texas.since then,four more states have weighed in on the debate,and florida has switched sides forming an alliance with illinois,pennsylvania,and mississippi.massachusetts and ohio joined the group denying class certification.
we start our discussion with the highly persuasive body of case authority authorizing class certification.although the illinois avery opinion was ultimately depublished,two other states missouri and florida have published comparable opinions on the matter.state ex rel.american family mutual ins.clark clark sweeney integon general insurance th dist so d sweeney united services automobile modregon d dist so d modregon.and,the pennsylvania court prepared an extremely detailed analysis of the issue in foultz erie ins.exchange,wl foultz.
in clark,the plaintiffs sued their car insurance company for breach of contract on behalf of themselves and similarly situated plaintiffs nationwide.clark,supra,at.the supreme court of missouri determined the laws of states applicable to the proposed class action were too varied to support a nationwide class action.it reasoned missouri had no interest in applying the kaleidoscope of rules and insurance laws found in the other states to missouri citizens and thus concluded the trial court abused its discretion in certification of the class with respect to insureds whose contracts were subject to laws of states other than missouri.id.at.
however,the clark court upheld the court certification of a class action for insureds whose policies are subject to missouri law.clark,supra,at.like farmers,the insurance company in clark argued individual inquiries were necessary to decide whether the damaged parts at issue for all class members were oem parts in good condition,and all the crash parts used for repair were inferior to oem crash parts.the court disagreed stating,under plaintiffs theory,the insurance company breached its contract with each prospective class members when it made payments on policyholders claims based upon estimates either specifying the use of crash parts or omitting particular repairs.this common issue is the predominant issue.if it is established at trial that the insurance company did not breach its contracts then the claims of all the prospective class members fail without further factual analysis.if it is determined that the insurance company actions constitute a breach of contract for some or all of the prospective class members,then the trial court can proceed in the most expeditious and efficient way possible relative to any individual circumstances or issues that may exist.the predominance of the common issue is not defeated simply because individual questions may remain after interpretation of the of damages or possible defenses to individual claims.citations.ibid.
the clark court acknowledged that other state courts faced with similar facts have reached contrary conclusions.it gave as an example an unpublished ohio case,augustus progressive ohio,wl,in which the court affirmed the lower court decision to deny class certification.the clark court reasoned,while the court in augustus found that it would be inconceivable to reason that an automobile is not returned to its condition because a part is utilized in making a repair,we leave the determination of that predominant issue in this case to the trier of fact.clark,supra,at,fn.it reiterated,t he trial court can resolve individual questions,particularly those relating to damages and defenses,after making a determination on the predominant issue.ibid.
two florida appellate courts have published opinions supporting class certification,and like the missouri court,found the predominant issue in the case subject to common proof.for example,in sweeney,the complaint was filed as a class action seeking damages for breach of contract based on the insurance company policy of authorizing crash parts to be used in vehicle repairs.sweeney,supra,so d at.the court reversed the trial court dismissal of the action,explaining,the trial court ruled the plaintiff could not possibly establish the truth of its allegation that parts uniformly are not of like kind and quality to oem parts.although superficially a reasonable assumption,the court is impermissibly assuming a lack of proof as to the merits of the claims.citation.in reviewing a motion to dismiss a complaint,however,the trial court is limited to considering questions of law.the court is not free to rely on its assumptions as to what may,or may not,ultimately be proved.id.at.
the modregon case involved a class action filed against a different car insurance company but raised similar allegations as the sweeney class action.modregon,supra,so d.in modregon,the court,from a different district,upheld the trial court denial of the insurer motion to dismiss and motion to compel an appraisal.ibid.in a very short opinion,the court reasoned,the trial court denied the motion to compel an appraisal,holding that the gravamen of the complaint challenges a policy decision by defendant to use parts,not the relative value of the damage to plaintiff vehicle and that w hether parts are parts of like kind and quality is not an appropriate issue for an appraiser to determine.we have reviewed the class action complaint and agree that it states more than a disagreement over the amount of loss for the modregons vehicle.id.at.implicit in this ruling is the acknowledgment the class will have to establish the crash parts are uniformly not of like kind and quality as oem parts.ibid.
the pennsylvania court opinion offers a detailed analysis of the issue.foultz,supra,wl.the facts of the foultz case are remarkably similar to ours.the foultz plaintiff obtained car insurance with erie insurance exchange erie,who imposed a similar limitation of liability to parts of like kind and quality.id.at the class action was limited to persons with cars repaired or valued by the replacement crash parts.the class action suit alleged breach of the policy,violations of pennsylvania unfair trade practices and consumer protection law utpcpl,and insurance bad faith.ibid.the case differs from ours only in that the foultz class dismissed its claim for declaratory relief or a permanent injunction.ibid.
as aptly noted by the foultz court,the question as to whether the quality of parts can be addressed on a level shapes up as a battle of decisions of courts.foultz,supra,wl at.after discussing the current status of the debate,the court sided with those courts authorizing class certification.it reasoned,while reserving judgment as to whether the plaintiff claims can be corroborated,the court is inclined to agree with the plaintiff that the question of oem parts and the contested crash parts uniformity does not preclude class certification.for the court to involve itself at this stage in determining which party experts are correct would be to improperly address the merits of the plaintiff claim,at least in part.citation.moreover,the plaintiff expert declaration presents a logical argument as to why parts may be addressed in a blanket fashion.as such,the plaintiff claim that she can establish the value of oem parts in relation to the value of the corresponding contested crash parts on a scale supports certification.id.at.
the foultz court next stated,as an aside,it is worth noting what the court believes the plaintiff would be unable to show at trial.it is implausible that the plaintiff could show the value of each oem part in class members vehicles or the difference in value between such parts and the contested crash parts on a basis.to establish either the value or the related difference in value would appear to require an examination of the individual parts in each class member vehicle and would be a substantial obstacle to showing common questions of law and fact.although this conclusion has no impact on whether the plaintiff can establish generalized values of contested crash parts and oem parts,which the court has concluded is plausible,it has potential implications for the plaintiff ability to show damages on a basis,as seen infra.foultz,supra,wl at.
the foultz court considered what values are necessary to establish damages on a classwide basis and particularly whether a classwide difference in kind and quality can be shown.it reasoned,as discussed supra,value generalizations involving the contested crash parts and oem parts are possible,while value generalizations involving used oem parts are not.thus,if like kind and quality includes distinctions based on the age,condition and use of the part being replaced,resolving the class claims will require the court to confront individual questions,and the commonality element will not be satisfied.on the other hand,if like kind and quality refers only to the design and material of the part replaced,valuation questions may be addressed on a scale,and the condition of each class member used oem part will be irrelevant.the court therefore must examine the definition of like kind and quality under the policy.foultz,supra,wl at.
in pennsylvania,as in california,interpretation of an insurance policy is a matter of law to be decided by the court.foultz,supra,wl at ray farmers ins.exchange d.ray.the foultz court explained some courts addressing the term like kind and quality discuss the term broadly and provide little guidance as to what the term underlying meaning is.frequently,courts have stated that a like kind and quality replacement provision requires the insurer to put the automobile in as good condition as it was before the collision without reaching a conclusion as to whether age and use should be factors in determining the condition or whether an examination is limited to the suitability and material of the parts in question.citations.foultz,supra,wl at.coincidentally,the foultz court gives as an example the very same california case farmers believes is dispositive.
in ray,supra,d at,the jury concluded farmers did not breach its insurance policy contract by failing to compensate the plaintiff,after repair of his wrecked car,for the car diminution in market value because of its status as a wrecked car.the appellate court affirmed the judgment finding farmers did not have a duty to repair the automobile both to its preaccident condition and market value.it explained the insurance policy has a provision giving farmers the right to elect to repair ray vehicle if the cost to repair to like kind and quality was less than the actual cash value of the vehicle at the time of the loss.id.at.
the ray court examined owens pyeatt d,the only other california case interpreting the phrase like kind and quality.it noted the owens court determined,the type and extent of repair contemplated by this provision were such as would place the automobile in substantially the same condition it was before the accident if the damage was such that the automobile could not be restored to this condition the insurer was required to pay the actual cash value thereof at the time of loss.ray,supra,d at.based on this definition,the ray court reasoned like kind and quality could not be the equivalent of actual cash value as suggested by the plaintiff.rather,it concluded the provision simply required farmers to repair the plaintiff car to its preaccident safe,mechanical,and cosmetic condition id.at.
we agree with the foultz court that ray provides little guidance as to the precise definition of preloss condition.the opinion does not specify whether age,use,or condition should be factors.we are unpersuaded by farmers contention the case is dispositive.rather,we are convinced,as was the foultz court,by the state authority holding that like kind and quality refers only to a part material and suitability,not its age or extent of use.foultz,supra,wl at.
the court in foultz went on to explain that in maryland motor car,ins.smith,for example,the plaintiff brought suit against her automobile insurer to recover the amount that it would have cost to repair her vehicle with like kind and quality parts.in affirming the trial verdict in favor of the plaintiff,the texas appellate court found that t he words of like kind and quality do not refer to parts of like age,use,and condition,or present cash value or the parts injured or destroyed by the fire.the words are used as relating to quality and suitableness or fitness for the purposes used.citation.similarly,north river insurance godley.revolved around a plaintiff attempt to recover for damages to his roof under an insurance policy that allowed recovery up to the cost to repair the property with material of like kind and quality.to define this term,the georgia court of appeals held that the expression material of like kind and quality refers to the kind and quality used in the original construction.there is no plea and no contention that the roof could have been repaired by using old shingles.citation.on a related note,the florida district court in siegle progressive consumers ins.so d looked at the relationship between like kind and quality and market value a repair with like kind and quality would thus require the property to be restored to good condition with parts,equipment and workmanship of the same essential character,nature and degree of excellence which existed on the vehicle prior to the accident.the damaged vehicle may or may not be returned to its market value,but a return to market value is not what the words repair with like kind and quality commonly connote and is not what an ordinary insured would reasonably understand the phrase to mean.the psychology of the market place,which assigns a lesser value to an adequately and competently repaired vehicle,has nothing to do with the quality of the repair itself.citation.foultz,supra,wl at.in short,many courts have similarly concluded the words kind and quality relate to suitableness of fitness for the purpose intended.ibid.
on a final note,the foultz court commented,another indication that age is irrelevant to a part kind and quality is the fact that many courts have held that depreciation,which accounts in part of the age of and on a specific item,can not be considered as a factor when calculating the costs of repairs based on parts of like kind and quality.foultz,supra,wl at.depreciation is usually considered only when an insurer elects to pay the actual cash value of the damaged property.by electing to repair or replace,the insurer elected a measure of loss that does not allow for depreciation.citation.ibid.indeed,under farmers policy in this case,an alternative to replacing the damaged part is to pay for new property less an adjustment for physical deterioration depreciation.
the insurance company in foultz admitted its appraisers do not record or describe the preaccident condition of the vehicle or its parts.according to the company,a car with a dented door that is further damaged in a collision will be replaced with an undamaged door even if another dented door could be located.thus,very telling was the insurance companies own application of the term.it was understood a rusty fender damaged in a collision would not be replaced with a different rusty fender.foultz,supra,wl at.
based on the above case law and respected authorities the foultz court concluded,t he age and use of an individual class member oem parts is not pertinent to determining whether the replacement parts are of like kind and quality.rather,like kind and quality centers on the original parts oem status alone,and an analysis may focus on the quality of oem parts and contested crash parts in general.as such,contingent on her ability to substantiate her generalizations as to the quality of oem parts and the contested crash parts,the plaintiff will be able to establish damages and the value of such damages on a basis.citation.foultz,supra,wl at.we agree and adopt this sound analysis and reasoning.
that being said,we obviously were not won over by the decisions of our sister states denying class certification.suffice it to say,the state courts rejecting class certification uniformly interpret like kind and quality as being tied to the preloss condition of each vehicle in nearly every instance,there is a noticeable sense of disbelief at the notion imitation parts can never be of like kind and quality to oem parts and,it should be noted,several of the decisions were handed down before avery,foultz,and their progeny.for the reasons stated above,we interpret like kind and quality differently and do not wish to speculate on whether plaintiffs will be able to prove their case.
indeed,it remains to be seen whether the trier of fact will be persuaded by the plaintiffs common proof and experts testimony as to the quality of oem parts and the imitation crash parts.however,we are certain that,at this time,it is not our role,nor the trial court job,to involve ourselves with the merits of the underlying action or which parties experts are most qualified.the lebrillas expert lengthy declaration pages presents several reasoned and plausible explanations as to why parts can be discussed with common evidence and in a blanket fashion.he is the designated expert in numerous other class actions involving crash parts,including avery and foultz.farmers contention the expert opinion is flawed is an argument best left for trial.as decided by our supreme court,w e view the question of certification as essentially a procedural one that does not ask whether an action is legally or factually meritorious.linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th at,d.
other arguments to class certification are without merit 
on appeal,farmers raises several arguments not mentioned by the trial court when making its ruling.we will briefly explain why we find these arguments meritless.
the california code of regulations 
title,section,subdivision j of the california code of regulations provides,no insurers shall require the use of equipment manufacture replacement crash parts in the repair of an automobile unless the parts are at least equal to the original equipment manufacturer parts in terms of kind,quality,safety,fit and performance 
farmers asserts the statute does not apply to it because it does not require the use of parts.alternatively,farmers points out the provision fails to expressly prohibit the use of parts,and therefore,the legislature impliedly determined at least some parts are of like kind and quality to oem parts farmers fails to appreciate the lebrillas are not objecting to the use of every part,only a narrow subset of crash parts which they claim are uniformly inferior.according to the lebrillas,interpretation of the phrase like kind and quality can be based entirely on the statute.the lebrillas assert they have common proof the imitation parts at issue are not equal to the oem parts in terms of kind,quality,safety,fit and performance,tit,subd.j.
the legislative requirement that insurers use replacement parts of like kind,quality,safety,fit and performance to oem parts suggests to us the legislature is well aware there have been problems with some parts.indeed,as noted by farmers,one year after the lebrillas filed their lawsuit,the legislature enacted senate bill,authorizing a study to consider the appropriate criteria or standards necessary for certifying crash parts and to identify an oversight agency for certifying parts.assembly committee on business and professions,staff comments on sb,as amended april,july.as noted by the committee authoring the bill,there recently has been a rash of class action litigation regarding the use of parts and a dramatic increase in the price of oem parts,resulting in a virtual monopoly for oem parts manufacturers.ibid.the committee commented insurance rates are on the rise at a more rapid rate than they might otherwise be if insurance companies felt more confident using parts.ibid.clearly,the legislature and insurance companies are aware that not all inferior parts have been eliminated.thus,we reject farmers suggestion it can be inferred the legislature in passing california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision j,impliedly determined crash parts are not inferior.
criticisms of proposed declaratory and injunctive relief 
farmers contends the lebrillas proposed declaratory relief failed to eliminate the inherently individualized issues that permeated all of their causes of action.specifically,it claims a declaration interpreting the insurance poli
