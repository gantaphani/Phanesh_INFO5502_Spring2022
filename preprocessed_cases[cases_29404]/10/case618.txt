appellants,objecting members of a proposed settlement class of plaintiffs damaged or injured by hurricanes katrina or rita,seek review of the district court certification of a limited fund mandatory class under federal rule of civil procedure b b and its approval of a final class settlement.we hold that the supreme court opinion in ortiz fibreboard,requires decertification of the mandatory class because the settlement fails to provide a procedure for distribution of the settlement fund that treats class claimants equitably amongst themselves.we further hold that the settlement is not fair,reasonable and adequate because its proponents fail to show that the class members will receive some benefit in exchange for the divestment of their due process rights in a mandatory class settlement.we therefore reverse.
background 
in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita,a plethora of lawsuits were filed against public and private entities by residents of the greater new orleans area who were harmed by the catastrophic flooding caused by levee and floodwall failures.these complaints were consolidated in the district court for the eastern district of louisiana as in re katrina canal breaches consolidated litigation,and divided for case management purposes into several categories.this appeal involves the levee and mrgo categories 
following the dismissals of various defendants,the levee and mrgo plaintiffs sought certification of a limited fund mandatory settlement class under rule b b and concomitant approval of a settlement with the defendant levee districts,their respective boards of commissioners,and their insurer,paul fire and marine insurance company the putative class consisted of 
all persons a who at the time of hurricane katrina hurricane rita i were located,present or residing in the hurricane affected geographic area jefferson,orleans,plaquemine,and bernard parishes,or ii owned,leased,possessed,used or otherwise had any interest in homes,places of business or other immovable or movable property on or in the hurricane affected geographic area,and b who incurred any losses,damages injuries arising from,in any manner related to,or connected in any way with hurricane katrina hurricane rita and any alleged levee failures waters that originated from,over,under or through the levees under the authority control of all or any of the levee defendants.
the class was further divided into three geographical subclasses corresponding to the particular levee defendant that allegedly caused its damages.a claimant could be a member of more than one subclass by virtue of some overlap among these three areas.
under the relevant terms of the settlement,the class would receive roughly the limits of the available insurance proceeds,plus exchange for releasing all claims against the settling defendants related to the hurricanes levee failures.the levee districts themselves would not contribute to the settlement.the settlement fund would be administered and distributed by a special master under the court supervision.finally,class counsel would waive their attorneys fees,while retaining the right to seek enhanced costs.
the district court issued a preliminary order of certification for settlement purposes,to which groups of dissenting class.first,appellants argued that the proposed class did not qualify as a rule b b class under the standards established by the supreme court in ortiz fibreboard.second,appellants averred that certifying a mandatory settlement class in a mass tort damages action violates due process.finally,appellants opposed the settlement on the grounds that the content of the notice was deficient and misleading,and that the settlement itself provided no benefit to the class while allowing counsel to seek an enhancement of costs.
following the subsequent class certification and settlement fairness hearing,the district court certified the class and approved the settlement.in certifying the class,the court first determined that the rule a prerequisites for all class actions had been met the court next analyzed whether the class complied with the stringent standards for b b classes set by the supreme court in ortiz.noting that the supreme court had explicitly refrained from deciding the constitutionality of a mandatory mass tort class certification,the district court held that certification under rule b b was proper because all three ortiz fund demonstrably insufficient to satisfy all claims,devotion of that fund to the payment of claims,and equity in distribution of the been met.finally,the district court approved the settlement based on its determination that notice was reasonable and that the settlement was fair,adequate,and reasonable under this circuit test in reed general motors,cir the court found no evidence of fraud or collusion behind the settlement litigation would be immensely complex the cases had been proceeding for nearly four years success on the merits would be difficult plaintiffs were settling for the maximum amount they could win through litigation and class counsel and class representatives all agreed to the settlement.
in this consolidated appeal,appellants renew their challenges to the district court class certification and approval of the settlement.
ii.discussion 
certification of the class under rule b b 
we review a district court decision to certify a class for abuse of discretion.langbecker data,cir citation omitted.a district court abuses its discretion,inter alia,when it rests its legal analysis on an erroneous understanding of governing law.id.citation omitted.
in addition to satisfying the prerequisites of rule a,a class must also meet the requirements of one of the subdivisions of rule b in order to be certified.at issue here is subdivision b b,which provides for certification of a mandatory class,whose members have no right to opt out,when 
prosecuting separate actions by or against individual class members would create a risk of adjudications with respect to individual class members that,as a practical matter,would be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the individual adjudications or would substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests 
b b.a limited fund action,which aggregates numerous claims against a fund insufficient to satisfy them all,is one type of class action traditionally encompassed by rule b b.ortiz,at alba conte herbert newberg,newberg on class actions at ed hereinafter newberg.
the nub of this case,as it was in ortiz,is the certification of the class under rule b b on a limited fund rationale.we do not decide the general constitutional question,left open in ortiz,whether a mandatory limited fund rationale some applied to a settlement class of tort claimants.at.such circumstances do not exist here because the settlement does not seek equity by providing for procedures to resolve the difficult issues of treating differently situated claimants with fairness as among themselves,id.at,and thereby fails to satisfy one of the essential premises of mandatory limited fund actions,id.at.
ortiz involved a large class of asbestos claimants suing a manufacturer,fibreboard,which had in turn sued its two insurance carriers for funds to pay the claimants.see id.at.eleventh hour negotiations between class counsel,fibreboard and the two insurance companies produced a settlement fund of billion,funded nearly entirely by the insurance companies and contingent on certification under rule b b as a mandatory limited fund class.see id.at.the district court certified the class under rule b b,reasoning that,without certification and settlement,the class ran the risk that the insurance companies would prevail against fibreboard in their pending coverage cases,leaving a much smaller fund available to the class.see id.at.we affirmed.flanagan ahearn in re asbestos litig,cir,vacated and remanded.on remand for further consideration in light of amchem products,windsor,we again affirmed.flanagan ahearn in re asbestos litig,cir,reversed by ortiz.
the supreme court reversed.the court expressed serious constitutional concerns that come with any attempt to aggregate individual tort claims on a limited fund rationale,ortiz,at 
first,the certification of a mandatory class followed by settlement of its action for money damages obviously implicates the seventh amendment jury trial rights of absent class members.
second,and no less important,mandatory class actions aggregating damages claims implicate the due process principle of general application in jurisprudence that one is not bound by a judgment in personam in a litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process,it being our historic tradition that everyone should have his own day in court.
id.at quoting hansberry lee,martin wilks,citations omitted.
in light of these concerns,the court counseled against adventurous application of rule b b,id.at,stressing that a limited construction of the rule,stay ing close to the historical model avoids serious constitutional concerns raised by the mandatory class resolution of individual legal claims id.at see also newberg at.the court described this historical model of a limited fund as a fund with a definitely ascertained limit,all of which would be distributed to satisfy all those with liquidated claims based on a common theory of liability,by an equitable,pro rata distribution.ortiz,at.from its discussion of the historical model,the court identified three presumptively necessary characteristics of a traditional limited fund.id.at.those characteristics are 
the totals of the aggregated liquidated claims and the fund available for satisfying them,set definitely at their maximums,demonstrate the inadequacy of the fund to pay all the claims,id.at 
the whole of the inadequate fund is to be devoted to the overwhelming claims,id.at and 
the claimants identified by a common theory of recovery are treated equitably among themselves,id.
the court phrasing and discussion of this third requirement differs noticeably from the other two requirements in that it departs from a strict interpretation of the traditional limited fund.to cleave to the traditional model of a true limited fund,the third element of equity should require that the class claims be capable of liquidation and pro rata distribution.see id.at describing classic limited fund actions as present ing straightforward models of equitable treatment,with the simple equity of a pro rata distribution providing the required fairness.however,the court contemplated that the unattainability of straightforward pro rata distribution would not necessarily disqualify a class action from adhering to the historical model,as long as the settlement otherwise provided for fair distribution amongst the claimants in the class 
fair treatment in the older cases was characteristically assured by straightforward pro rata distribution of the limited fund.while equity in such a simple sense is unattainable in a settlement covering present claims not specifically proven,at the least such a settlement must seek equity by providing for procedures to resolve the difficult issues of treating such differently situated claimants with fairness as among themselves.
id.at internal citation omitted.
the settlement proponents argue,and we agree,that this class does not suffer from the particular defects that led the ortiz court to find the procedures to resolve the difficult issues unsatisfactory in that settlement.the court identified two structural conflicts obstructing the fairness of distributions within that class.the first conflict was between present interest was in generous immediate future claimants,whose interest was to ensure an ample fund for the future.id.at.this type of temporal conflict between present and future classes is not applicable in this case,which involves an identified class that has suffered a presently identifiable harm.the other conflict in ortiz was between class members whose claims accrued before the lapse of the insurance policy providing the bulk of the insurance funds,giving them more valuable rights to the insurance proceeds,and those who were injured after this policy lapsed.id.at.the settlement before us avoids this second concern through the creation of providing that the funds from one insurance policy providing coverage to a particular levee district will not be available to any class member who does not have a claim against that levee district.nevertheless,freedom from the particular infirmities identified in ortiz is insufficient to issue a clean bill of health for equity here.
the class members in this case suffered a wide variety of injuries,ranging from property damage to personal injury and death,and no method is specified for how these different claimants will be treated each other.the district court acknowledged that fairness of distribution was a significant concern in this settlement.the issue was addressed during the fairness hearing,where the court received an amicus brief,and heard testimony,from dean edward class action suggested the use of grids or matrices to differentiate between the various class members,using factors such as the particular kind of damage,personal injury,property create,in essence,subclasses of claimants.sherman suggested that these categories could be further subdivided for example,by partitioning the category of property damage according to the extent of damage,as measured by the depth of water that caused the damage.while opining that such a method would be fairly inexpensive given the existence of certain data already available to the court,sherman also stated that,should the administrative costs associated with this differentiation threaten to consume the fund,the court might find that the class would benefit more from a cy pres distribution that was related in some way to the levees,such as levee protection or beautification.
none of these procedures made their way into the settlement agreement.instead,the settlement provides for the appointment of a special master to provide to the court a recommended disposition and protocol with regard to the remaining settlement fund,and treatment of claims of class members.this arrangement simply punts the difficult question of equitable distribution from the court to the special master,without providing any more clarity as to how fairness will be achieved.the lack of any procedures to resolve the difficult issues of treating such differently situated claimants with fairness as among themselves,id.at,leads us to reverse the district court order certifying this class.by failing to meet one of the three essential premises of mandatory limited fund actions identified by the supreme court in ortiz,id.at,this settlement class strays too far from the historical model to avoid the court constitutional concerns.
approval of the settlement under rule e 
the objecting class members separately challenge the district court approval of the class action settlement on the grounds that the settlement does not benefit the class,allows counsel to seek an enhancement of actual costs,and provided inadequate and misleading notice to the class members.we review the district court approval of the settlement for an abuse of discretion.newby enron,cir citation omitted.
benefit to the class 
rule e states that a court may approve a settlement proposal that would bind class members only after a hearing and on finding that it is fair,reasonable,and adequate.e.six factors guide our review of a decision to approve a class action settlement agreement 
evidence that the settlement was obtained by fraud or collusion the complexity,expense,and likely duration of the litigation the stage of the litigation and available discovery the probability of plaintiffs prevailing on the merits the range of possible recovery and certainty of damages and the opinions of class counsel,class representatives,and absent class members.
newby,at citing reed,at parker anderson,cir.based on its wealth of experience in hurricane katrina litigation and the evidence it received before and during the certification and settlement hearing,the district court found that all six factors weighed in favor of approving the settlement.
without quarreling with the district court findings,we nevertheless conclude that this settlement is not fair,reasonable,and adequate under rule e because there has been no demonstration on the record below that the settlement will benefit the class in any way,either through the disbursement of individual checks or through a cy pres distribution.the court must be assured that the settlement secures an adequate advantage for the class in return for the surrender of litigation rights against the defendants.newberg at see also id.at often,the settlement benefits are somewhat speculative in nature and capable of only approximate valuation.nevertheless,the settlement may be approved if it is clear that it secures some adequate advantage for the class.emphasis added in re compact disc minimum advertised price antitrust,holding that a settlement is not fair where all the cash goes to expenses and lawyers,and the class members receive only discounts of dubious value,even when the lawsuit itself has dubious value.
the settlement provides that the following administrative costs may be paid out of the million settlement fund 
notice costs,special master fees and costs,escrow agent costs and fees,cada court appointed disbursing agent fees and costs,the fees and costs of any person retained by the special master or cada,and other costs,fees and expenses incurred in the implementation of the class settlement agreement including but not limited to the costs and fees of all experts of the parties up to an amount to be agreed to by the settling defendants in their sole and absolute discretion.
no estimate was given as to what these costs might be.nevertheless,the court recognized that i t is a reasonable fear that the mere cost of adjudicating individual claims may swallow the entire settlement.in re katrina canal breaches consol.
the settlement further provides class counsel with the right to seek reimbursement of enhanced costs and expenses,and counsel of any class member with the right to seek attorneys fees 
class counsel and counsel of any class member shall have the right to seek an award from the settlement fund for fees,costs and expenses including any enhancement of costs and expenses as may be awarded by the court and shall have the right to make an application to the court for same class counsel agree to recommend to the court that no attorneys fees should be awarded from the settlement fund,and shall oppose any such request s.
there is no indication in the record as to what these attorneys costs and expenses will be.at the certification and fairness hearing,class counsel could not provide any estimate of the costs incurred thus far,other than to admit that litigation had been expensive.class counsel conceded,and the court accepted,that a lot of depositions were taken,a lot of costs were incurred,and we do know what the plaintiffs are going to seek.
we have previously affirmed a district court approval of a settlement in which costs and attorneys fees had not been determined as of the date of settlement.see newby,at.however,we were able to definitively state in that case,upon a record that was exceptionally,id.at,that the class would receive some monetary benefit from the settlement.see id.at it is untrue that there will be nothing left in the settlement fund for the class members.this was in part because there was a separate of million set apart for past and future litigation expenses.here,we are unable to definitively state,based on the record below,that the class will receive any benefit from the settlement.moreover,newby did not concern a mandatory class.because classes do not permit,certification for settlement imposes particularly stringent standards.federal judicial center,manual for complex litigation at ed.
we hold that the district court erred by approving the settlement without any assurance that attorneys costs and administrative costs will not cannibalize the entire million settlement.in doing so,we express no opinion as to whether such a result would occur but the burden is on the settlement proponents to persuade the court that the agreement is fair,reasonable,and adequate for the absent class members who are to be bound by the settlement.newberg at american law institute,principles of the law aggregate litigation c at hereinafter aggregate litigation.in our judgment,the settlement proponents have not met this burden because they have failed to provide any basis for their assertion that there will be money remaining after payment of these costs to effect even a cy pres distribution,let alone a monetary distribution.
nor do we consider whether a cy pres distribution of the settlement fund,without any monetary distribution,would be fair,reasonable,and adequate under rule e.that decision would be premature here,where the very possibility of such a distribution is in question.furthermore,without any specific proposal for a cy pres distribution before us,we are unable to determine whether such a distribution would be for the next best use which is for indirect class benefit,newberg at,and would be for uses consistent with the nature of the underlying action and with the judicial function,in re agent orange prod.liab,cir.
enhancement of costs 
we agree with appellants that any enhancement of costs is the functional equivalent of a fee.see fogleman aramco,cir to the extent that counsel charges a party more than actual cost for any service,be it reproduction of documents or telephone calls,counsel is recovering additional fees.we have repeatedly held that a district court abuses its discretion if it approves a class action settlement without determining that any attorneys fees claimed as part of the settlement are reasonable and that the settlement itself is reasonable in light of those fees.see,strong bellsouth telecomm,cir to fully discharge its duty to review and approve class action settlement agreements,a district court must assess the reasonableness of the attorneys fees.citation omitted piambino bailey,cir holding that the district court has a responsibility to assess the reasonableness of attorneys fees proposed under a settlement of a class action,and that,where it abdicates its responsibility to do so,its approval of the settlement must be reversed on this ground alone.
as noted above,we have also previously affirmed a district court approval of a settlement agreement in which attorneys fees were unknown at the time of approval.see newby,at.in that agreement,as here,attorneys retained the right to request fees and reimbursement of past and future litigation expenses,to be paid from the gross settlement fund upon approval of the district court.again,however,we were able to definitively state in that case that there would be money remaining in the settlement fund after payment of those costs and fees.see id.at.because there is no such assurance here,it was error for the district court to approve the settlement.
notice to the class 
rule e states that a court must direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the proposal before approving a settlement.e.appellants argue that the notice apprising the class of the proposed certification and settlement was inadequate and misleading because it i failed to provide class members with any way of estimating the amount of money that they could expect to receive in exchange for releasing their claims,nor warned them that it was unlikely that they would receive any recovery at all ii wrongly represented that class counsel would not be seeking attorneys fees from the settlement fund and iii incorrectly informed class members that they were barred by law from receiving compensation from the levee districts.
under rule e,a settlement notice need only satisfy the broad reasonableness standards imposed by due process.petrovic amoco oil,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted newberg at t he court formulation of an adequate notice procedure under rule e is limited only by constitutional due process considerations.the minimum of due process,as interpreted by the supreme court,is that deprivation of life,liberty or property by adjudication be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature
