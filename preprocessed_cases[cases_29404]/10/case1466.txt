rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure permits certification of class actions not exclusively or predominantly for money damages.this petition for interlocutory review presents the following question in a case involving requests for both monetary and equitable relief,may a district court certify a rule b class as to equitable relief only without first determining whether,looking at the complaint as a whole,plaintiffs monetary claims predominate over their equitable claims although this issue is both unsettled and fundamental factors that may justify interlocutory review pursuant to rule f we nevertheless deny the petition because the critical questions required to resolve it are entirely unbriefed and because we are satisfied that the issue will not escape appellate review.
the united states department of agriculture administers several farm credit and benefit programs under the direction of its farm service agency fsa.see consolidated farm and rural development act,et.farmers seeking fsa loans or subsidies apply to local county committees made up of farmers elected by other farmers.pigford glickman.if the county committee approves the application,the farmer receives the benefit.if the committee denies the application,the farmer may appeal to a state committee and then to a federal review board.pigford glickman.farmers believing that their applications have been denied on the basis of race can file complaints either directly with the fsa or with the department.id.
alleging that the department discriminated against them on the basis of race in its administration of these programs,seven farmers filed this action in the united states district court for the district of columbia on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated.the lawsuit followed the department release of a report that had been prompted by longstanding accusations of racial discrimination in the administration of agricultural programs.civil rights action team,usda,civil rights at the united states department of agriculture,available at http.noting that discrimination in program delivery continues to exist to a large degree unabated,id.at,the report found significant disparities between the department treatment of minority and nonminority farmers,such as lower participation and lower loan approval rates for minorities in most agency programs,and substantial inequalities in loan processing rates,including disparities between nonminority loan processing and american indian loan processing in certain states,id.at.since complaints were processed slowly,if at all,id.at,farmers found little relief in the department complaint process,which,if anything,often ma de matters worse,id.at.according to the report,department officials did little to improve the department record of civil rights enforcement indeed,during the early and usda leaders had effectively dismantled usda civil rights apparatus,and numerous reorganizations since that time had left civil rights at usda in a persistent state of chaos.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.minority farmers,the report concluded,have lost significant amounts of land and potential farm income as a result of discrimination by usda programs.id.at.
proceeding under the equal credit opportunity act,the administrative procedure act,a,and title vi of the civil rights act of,et,the farmers,seeking both equitable and monetary relief,allege discrimination in the department handling of applications and in its failure to investigate and process their discrimination complaints.four similar suits have been filed an action on behalf of and latino farmers was dismissed,williams glickman,filed june,another action brought by a class of farmers has been settled,see pigford veneman,and actions on behalf of latino farmers,garcia veneman,filed,and female and other farmers alleging discrimination on the basis of age,sex,marital status,race,color,national origin,or religion,love veneman,filed,remain pending in district court.
in a motion for judgment on the pleadings,or in the alternative for summary judgment,the department argued among other things that the farmers claims regarding its failure to process their complaints were actionable under neither the apa nor the ecoa.the district court denied the motion without prejudice,and the farmers moved to certify a class consisting of a ll farmers and ranchers who believe that usda discriminated against them on account of their race in their applications for,or usda administration of,usda farm programs and who complained of that discrimination to the usda.
under the federal rules of civil procedure,a class can be certified if it meets rule a four,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of if it falls into one of the three categories of class actions described in rule b.fed.civ.a,b amchem,windsor,d.rules b and b the two categories at issue in this case have different requirements depending primarily on the nature of the relief sought.rule b certification is appropriate where plaintiffs seek declaratory or injunctive relief for injury.such certification is particularly for civil rights actions where a party is charged with discriminating unlawfully against a class.fed.civ.b advisory committee notes.according to the advisory committee notes,however,b certification is not proper where the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or predominantly to money damages.id.
in contrast to rule b,class certification pursuant to rule b is appropriate even where plaintiffs seek only monetary damages so long as questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.fed.civ.b.certification pursuant to rule b,however,comes with certain procedural requirements because members of a class seeking substantial monetary damages may have divergent interests,due process requires that putative class members receive notice and an opportunity to opt out.see fed.civ.c robinson commuter,cir.by contrast,rule b imposes no similar requirements because a class seeking primarily equitable relief for a common injury is assumed to be a cohesive group with few conflicting interests,giving rise to a presumption that adequate representation alone provides sufficient procedural protection.see robinson,at noting the presumption that an adequate class representative in a b action will generally safeguard absent class members interests and thereby satisfy the strictures of due process.
seeking both equitable and monetary relief,the farmers asked the district court to certify a hybrid class a b class for their equitable claims and a b class for their monetary claims.in support of this request,the farmers relied on language in eubanks billington,which held that district courts may grant rights in b class actions either by certifying a b class as to claims for monetary relief or by exercising their discretion under rule d to allow from the b class.id.at.the district court,however,certified only a b class and central to this case instead of determining whether plaintiffs monetary claims predominate over their equitable claims,the district court limited the class to pursuing equitable relief,explaining that it lacked a sufficiently developed factual record to rule on the appropriate treatment of the monetary claims.keepseagle veneman,mem.op.at.also,the class the district court farmers and ranchers who filed discrimination complaints with the department between january,and november,narrower than the one the farmers had sought.keepseagle veneman,mem.op.at.
proceeding under.f,which allows courts of appeals,in their discretion,to entertain interlocutory appeals of class certification decisions,the department now mounts two challenges to the district court class certification decision.first,the department claims that the farmers allegations fail rule a commonality and typicality requirements.second,the department argues that the district court lacked authority to certify a b class without first determining whether the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or predominat
