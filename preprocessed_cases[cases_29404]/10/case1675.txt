this is an appeal from the denial of a writ petition,styled as a class action,filed by employees of albertson albertson seeking to reverse an administrative decision denying them unemployment insurance benefits during an lockout by albertson.on demurrer,the trial court ruled that the employees failed to allege sufficient facts supporting equitable tolling.the trial court also struck the class allegations as overly broad.the employees elected not to amend their petition in order to pursue the present appeal.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
facts and proceedings below 
allegations of the 
in august,contract negotiations between the united food and commercial workers ufcw labor union and albertson,ralphs grocery ralphs,and the vons company,vons commenced.during the negotiations,albertson,ralphs,and vons agreed that they would act as one bargaining unit and consider a strike against one grocer as a strike against all three grocers.the three grocers,along with a fourth grocer food less food that was not a party to the negotiations,also agreed that they would share all revenues and losses resulting from a strike by the union or a lockout by one or more of the grocers.
on october,vons employees went on strike.the next day,albertson and ralphs announced that they would lock out all of their union employees,those employees who held active memberships with ufcw except pharmacists,whose continued work was ostensibly required to protect public health and safety.during the lockout,both albertson and ralphs encouraged a number of employees to either resign their union membership or return to work under false names and social security numbers.on february,ufcw and the three grocers reached a contract,thus ending the strike against vons and the lockouts by albertson and ralphs.
a number of albertson and ralphs employees filed claims with the california employment development department edd for unemployment insurance benefits during the lockout period.edd denied their claims because,in edd view,the employees voluntarily left work over a trade dispute,thus falling within the ambit of unemployment insurance code section 
petitioners gayle tarkington and joel straub,two albertson employees whose claims had been denied by the edd,appealed the decision to the california unemployment insurance appeals board cuiab.cuiab set the hearings on the appeals in march,may,and july of.it sent notice of the hearings to thousands of claimants,and hundreds attended the hearings.at the hearings,tarkington and straub asserted that they were seeking unemployment benefits on a class or basis.hundreds of claimants who attended the hearings chose not to present their own statements on the record in reliance on the assertions that the tarkington and straub case would yield relief.
in november,the cuiab issued a written decision authored by administrative law judge alj knipe concluding that ufcw had instituted the first blow by initiating a strike against vons and thus its members,including the employees locked out by albertson,were ineligible for unemployment benefits because they fell within the ambit of section.in december,alj knipe issued a nearly identical decision denying benefits for employees locked out by ralphs.
tarkington and straub appealed alj knipe decision to the board panel members of the cuiab board,on behalf of themselves and all persons similarly situated.on june,the board issued a written decision affirming alj knipe ruling that the employees locked out by albertson had voluntarily stopped working over a trade dispute.on june,the board issued a virtually identical decision regarding ralphs employees.
procedural history 
on december,tarkington and straub,along with two ralphs employees john duran and deborah brown who had also sought review by the board and were denied relief,filed a petition for writ of administrative mandate in los angeles superior court,styled as a class action,against the cuiab and named as real parties albertson and ralphs the joint petition alleged that albertson and ralphs falsified their reasons for permitting pharmacists to work during the lockout,urged employees to resign their union membership,encouraged their locked out employees to work under false names and social security numbers,and entered into an illegal profit sharing agreement with food less,a grocer that was not a party to the negotiations.the joint petition sought a writ of mandamus ordering the cuiab to set aside its june and decisions and pay unemployment benefits to the joint petitioners and all other class members.
on may,albertson demurred to the petition,raising the following arguments the joint petition improperly joined claims made against albertson and ralphs the class allegations were vague and failed to describe an ascertainable class with a community of interest and the joint petition failed to allege that all putative class members had exhausted administrative remedies.
on december,at the hearing on the demurrer,the trial court invited suggestions from all parties about how the court should proceed if it concluded the joint petition had improperly joined albertson and ralphs as real parties in interest.counsel for albertson maintained that the joint petitioners would have to file two lawsuits,but noted t here no statute of limitations problem,i do believe.he went on to argue that the way to do it mechanically is unjoin them and have separate trials.on december,the trial court sustained the demurrer,ruling there is a misjoinder of parties defendant.the defendant real parties in interest have been misjoined since there is no joint,several or alternative liability under code of civil procedure section a.the court gave the joint petitioners days leave to amend with no further direction.
on december,the joint petitioners,through a motion for reconsideration,urged the trial court to maintain one action against both grocers and bifurcate those issues in which a single proceeding might prejudice one of the grocers.at the hearing,after the trial court announced its tentative decision to deny the motion,joint petitioners sought clarification about how they should proceed in light of the court anticipated ruling.the court replied as far as your comments on how to handle it,i not here to give advice on how to practice law or on how to plead,but i think you can keep alive one case under this number and go with another case which will probably get related to this.on january,the trial court denied the motion for reconsideration citing the absence of new or different facts,circumstances or law.
on february,tarkington and straub filed a petition for writ of mandate in los angeles superior court,styled as a class action,against the cuiab and named only albertson as the real party in interest the instant petition allegations mirrored those made in the joint petition but for the allegations against ralphs and sought the same relief.the ralphs petitioners remained in the original case,under the original case number,and filed an amended petition 
albertson demurred to the instant petition raising the following arguments the action was time barred the class allegations were overly broad and included individuals who had no beneficial interest in the outcome of the litigation the putative class members failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and review of the denial of unemployment benefits is not amenable to class treatment.
on may,the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend and ruled as follows 
the defined class is too broad.it should not include putative class members who are by the statute of limitations,those who did not pursue their administrative remedies,and those who dismissed their appeals to the appeals board.only those who exhausted their administrative remedies and are not should be part of the class.the petition against albertson appears to be on its face.petitioner needs to specifically plead equitable tolling to overcome dismissal,based upon the statute of limitations found in the unemployment insurance code.
on june,tarkington and straub amended the instant petition to include allegations supporting equitable tolling.the class allegations remained unchanged.albertson demurred,arguing that petitioners failed to allege specific facts in support of equitable tolling.albertson also filed a motion to strike the class allegations,arguing that because tarkington and straub failed to amend the class allegations when given the opportunity,all such allegations should be stricken.the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend,granted the motion to strike,and instructed tarkington and straub to amend their petition to allege additional facts in support of equitable tolling and to omit the class allegations altogether.
tarkington and straub elected not to amend the instant petition and instead sought a judgment of dismissal in order to pursue the matter on appeal.pursuant to an application by albertson,the trial court dismissed the instant petition with prejudice.petitioners timely appealed from the final judgment.

we review a trial court ruling on a demurrer independently.citation.liska v.the arns law firm th,d.our task in reviewing a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer is to determine whether the complaint states,or can be amended to state,a cause of action.for that purpose we accept as true the properly pleaded material factual allegations of the complaint,together with facts that may properly be judicially noticed.citations.crowley katleman cal th,d.where,as here,a plaintiff is given the opportunity to amend his complaint and elects not to do so,strict construction of the complaint is required and it must be presumed that the plaintiff has stated as strong a case as he can.reynolds bement cal th,d.
ii.statute of limitations 
the statute of limitations began to accrue on june,when the board issued its final decision denying unemployment benefits to tarkington and straub the instant petition bears a file stamp date of february,because the instant petition shows on its face that it is barred by the applicable statute of limitations,tarkington and straub must plead facts which show an excuse,tolling,or some other basis for avoiding the statutory bar.ponderosa homes,city of san ramon th,d.
the equitable tolling doctrine evolved in the to toll statutes of limitations when defendants would not be prejudiced and plaintiffs,who had several legal remedies,pursued one such remedy reasonably and in good faith.downs department of water power th,d downs.it is a doctrine which operates independently of the literal wording of the code of civil procedure to suspend or extend a statute of limitations as necessary to ensure fundamental practicality and fairness.lantzy centex homes cal th,d.the doctrine of equitable tolling works to prevent the unjust technical forfeiture of causes of action,where the defendant would suffer no prejudice.ibid.
three factors determine whether the statute of limitations is equitably tolled in a particular case timely notice to defendants in filing the first claim lack of prejudice to defendants in gathering evidence to defend against the second claim and good faith and reasonable conduct by plaintiffs in filing the second claim.downs,supra,th at,d.we turn to these factors,keeping in mind that in this case,the first claim is the joint petition filed against albertson and ralphs in december and the second claim is the petition filed against albertson in february.
timely notice the timely notice requirement essentially means that the first claim must have been filed within the statutory period.furthermore the filing of the first claim must alert the defendant in the second claim of the need to begin investigating the facts which form the basis for the second claim.generally this means that the defendant in the first claim is the same one being sued in the second.collier city of pasadena d.collier.
the first factor is satisfied.in paragraphs and of the operative pleading,tarkington and straub alleged that the board issued its final decision denying benefits for albertson employees on june,and that they along with duran and brown filed the joint petition on december,which was within the statutory period.further,albertson was named as a real party in interest in both the joint petition and the instant petition.
lack of prejudice the second prerequisite essentially translates to a requirement that the facts of the two claims be identical or at least so similar that the defendant investigation of the first claim will put him in a position to fairly defend the second.collier,supra,d at.so long as the two claims are based on essentially the same set of facts timely investigation of the first claim should put the defendant in position to appropriately defend the second.once he is in that position the defendant is adequately protected from stale claims and deteriorated evidence.ibid.
the second factor is satisfied.the allegations regarding albertson conduct in the joint petition mirror the allegations in the instant petition.we cite some examples 
on or about august,in anticipation of a pending contract renegotiation with the union,the employers entered into a mutual strike assistance agreement the msaa which committed them to share any costs and revenues disproportionately earned or lost as a result of the strike or lockout.of joint petition of instant petition.
the moa expressed the parties agreement that there be a bargaining unit for the purposes of the negotiations and stated the employers position that a strike against one of the employers would be treated as a strike against all of the employers.of joint petition of petition.
shortly before the lockout was implemented,albertson had begun informing bargaining unit members of their right to become financial core members and thus resign their union membership.albertson campaign to solicit union members resignations targeted sympathetic workers,pharmacists in particular,who were most likely to resign.of joint petition of instant petition.
shortly before and during the lockout,albertson store managers told bargaining unit employees that they could work during the lockout under false names and social security numbers indeed,albertson confirmed the fact that bargaining unit members performed bargaining unit work during the lockout under false names and social security numbers.of joint petition of instant petition.
based on these allegations and others,both petitions sought the same relief,a reversal of the board decision denying unemployment benefits to locked out employees.albertson cites no material fact,nor can we identify any,alleged in the instant petition that was not already alleged in the joint petition.in short,the claims made in the joint petition placed albertson in position to appropriately defend against the almost identical claims made in the instant petition,and albertson will suffer no prejudice if we allow the present petition to proceed forward.collier,supra,d at.
good faith and reasonable conduct the third requirement of good faith and reasonable conduct may turn on whether a plaintiff delayed filing the second claim until the statute on that claim had nearly run,or whether the plaintiff took affirmative action which misle d the defendant into believing the plaintiff was foregoing his second claim.collier,supra,d at.
in assessing whether tarkington and straub acted reasonably and in good faith when they filed the instant petition,we review the relevant time line 
june,board issues final decision denying benefits.
december,joint petitioners file joint petition.
may,albertson demurs to the joint petition.
december,trial court sustains demurrer with leave to amend.
december,joint petitioners seek reconsideration.
january,trial court denies motion for reconsideration.
february,file stamp date of instant petition.
while it is true,as albertson repeatedly points out,that tarkington and straub filed the instant petition more than two years after filing the joint petition,almost all of the elapsed time is attributable to the time used by the trial court to issue its rulings.when tarkington and straub finally learned of the court decision on the issue of joinder,on january,they filed the present petition less than two weeks later,on february.we do not view this short period of time as unreasonable or in bad faith,especially in light of the protracted nature of the underlying litigation.moreover,there is no allegation that tarkington and straub misled albertson into thinking that they would forgo their claims against it once they were separated from the ralphs petitioners.in fact it was albertson that pushed to have the joint petition split into two actions and its counsel who noted that there was no statute of limitations issue in his view.
nonetheless,albertson contends that tarkington and straub acted unreasonably and in bad faith because they waited until the last possible hour to file the joint petition,and they continued to litigate the issue of joinder even though they conceded that there was no joint,several,alternate liability between albertson and ralphs.we reject both contentions.
first,whether tarkington and straub waited until the last possible hour to file the joint petition,the first claim,is beside the point.collier,supra,at.requirement of good faith and reasonable conduct may turn on whether a plaintiff delayed filing the second claim until the statute on that claim had nearly run.what matters is whether the first claim was filed in a timely fashion and here there is no dispute that tarkington and straub had until december,to challenge the board decision and they filed the joint petition one day before that date.
second,it is simply inaccurate to say that petitioners conceded there was no joint,several,and or alternate liability between albertson and ralphs.albertson cites to the following allegation in the instant petition as this apparent concession a ny unemployment insurance benefits paid to petitioners will be charged against the reserve account of their respective employees.but this was far from a concession.as tarkington and straub counsel argued at the hearing on the demurrer,the issue about whether there joint and several liability is really a red herring that has no relevance in this case.this would be a different case if we were directly suing these individual companies for money damages.we not doing that in this case.we seeking government benefits in the form of unemployment benefits for the class that we seek to represent.thus,alleging that insurance benefits would be charged to each grocer account did not concede the issue of joinder.
we conclude that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies in this case and tolled the statute of limitations.perhaps anticipating this conclusion,albertson argues that even if equitable tolling applies,the instant petition is still untimely because tarkington and straub had already exhausted their statutory clock with the filing of the joint petition and thus had no remaining time left to file the instant petition.albertson cites a number of equitable tolling cases and notes that,in each case,the plaintiff had time remaining on the statutory clock after the conclusion of the first action and,once the clock was restarted,the plaintiffs in those cases acted before the remaining time had run,collier,supra,d.elkins derby cal d,fn,appalachian ins.mcdonnell douglas d.addison state of california cal d.albertson reasons that,because tarkington and straub had one day left on the statutory clock when they filed the joint petition and they filed their instant petition days after the court denied their motion for reconsideration,they were days late,regardless of whether equitable tolling applied.
friends of mammoth board of supervisors cal d,friends of mammoth is instructive.in that case,the plaintiffs had days to challenge a zoning decision that was issued on june.id.at.on july,the plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of administrative mandate in the court of appeal.on july,the court of appeal denied the petition without prejudice and directed the plaintiffs to file the action in superior court,which they did on july.ibid.on appeal,the defendants argued that the second petition was untimely.the court characterized the defendants argument as a myopic reading of the abbreviated statute of limitations and held that the second petition was timely because the appellate court denial of the first petition tolled the statute of limitations.id.at.the court cited with approval the policy of allowing a party who has seasonably filed a cause of action,to try it upon the merits,notwithstanding defects in the form or substance of pleadings,or error in the remedy sought id.at.notably,when the plaintiffs filed their first petition,they had two days left on the statutory clock,and they took four days to file the second writ petition in the superior court after the first petition was dismissed.id.at.under albertson view,which the supreme court implicitly rejected,the plaintiffs petition would have been untimely.
according to albertson,friends of mammoth ought not to control here because the plaintiffs there filed their writ petition in the wrong court and promptly refiled the petition in the right court after the dismissal in the court of appeal.in contrast,as albertson sees it,tarkington and straub filed their petition in the appropriate court,and then engaged in dilatory behavior by waiting another two weeks to file an identical petition.albertson distinctions are wholly unpersuasive.first,the fact that tarkington and straub filed their action in the appropriate court at the outset militates in favor of hearing their case on the merits.a plaintiff who files in the wrong court should not be in a better position than a plaintiff who files in the right court.second,as we discussed earlier,we do not view tarkington and straub conduct as dilatory.they filed the instant petition days after the court denied their motion to reconsider,which in our view is prompt given the protracted history of the underlying litigation.
ii.exhaustion of remedies 
we turn now to the trial court ruling that the putative class should include only those individuals who exhausted their administrative remedies.
the principal purposes of exhaustion requirements include avoidance of premature interruption of administrative processes allowing an agency to develop the necessary factual background of the case letting the agency apply its expertise and exercise its statutory discretion and administrative efficiency and judicial economy.california water impact network newhall county water dist.th,d.the exhaustion doctrine is grounded on concerns favoring administrative autonomy,courts should not interfere with an agency determination until the agency has reached a final decision and judicial efficiency,overworked courts should decline to intervene in an administrative dispute unless absolutely necessary.ibid.
in friends of mammoth,supra,cal d,the supreme court addressed a situation similar to the one presented in this case.in that case,two named plaintiffs brought a putative class action challenging their local commission decision to grant a use permit to a developer.the developer challenged the plaintiffs standing to pursue the suit because they had not personally exhausted their administrative remedies.the supreme court rejected this challenge,reasoning that although the named plaintiffs had not participated in the administrative review certain individuals who were members of the putative class had already exhausted their administrative remedies.those individuals,the court explained,would have expressed the position of the representative plaintiff in the class suit,and the board will have had its opportunity to act and to render litigation unnecessary,if it had chosen to do so.id.at.under those circumstances,the supreme court held that the purposes underlying the exhaustion doctrine were satisfied and the action could proceed forward.id.at.requiring the named plaintiffs to exhaust their remedies when others in their class had already done so,the court noted,would serve no additional useful purpose because n othing more could effectuate the policy of the exhaustion doctrine.id.at.
