plaintiffs stephen egerer,stephanie egerer,and kathy boyink brought this putative class action suit against defendants woodland realty,woodland title agency,llc,chicago title insurance company,and chicago title of michigan,alleging that defendants violated the real estate settlement and procedures act of,et.respa,by paying and receiving unlawful referral fees for title insurance business.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants and the plaintiffs now appeal.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
factual background 
plaintiffs stephen and stephanie egerer sold their home in michigan with the assistance of defendant woodland realty,woodland realty.the woodland realty agent who sold the egerers home,pat siler siler,was a relative of the egerers.defendant woodland title agency,llc woodland title,performed the settlement services to complete the sale,which took place on june.before woodland title completed the transaction,siler provided the egerers with an affiliated business arrangement disclosure statement disclosure at.the disclosure,acknowledged and signed by the egerers on april,stated that the egerers were welcome to shop around and not required to use woodland title for their real estate settlement services woodland realty had a business relationship with woodland title and because of that business relationship,woodland realty may receive a financial or other benefit for referring clients to woodland title.the specific nature of that benefit was not contained in the disclosure,but the actual benefit received by a woodland realty agent from woodland title was a credit in the form of woodland title marketing dollars,which could be used by the agent to offset marketing or promotional expenses marketing dollars program.in addition,the disclosure estimated the cost of title insurance to be for a title insurance owner policy.the actual cost of title insurance was.
plaintiff kathy boyink boyink purchased a home in michigan that was listed for sale by woodland realty.in purchasing her home,boyink utilized a buyer agent.boyink buyer agent was heidi parsons parsons,who was a friend and an agent with prins real estate boyink followed parsons recommendation and engaged defendants for the necessary settlement services,which were completed for the purchase of her home on october.parsons and prins real estate had no relationship with woodland realty,woodland title or chicago title,and are not defendants in this case.
ii.procedural background 
plaintiffs amended complaint contends that woodland title marketing dollars program constitutes an unlawful fee,kickback,or thing of value in violation of respa.as a consequence,plaintiffs allege that they paid more for settlement services than they would otherwise have paid.defendants dispute that the marketing dollars program violates respa or increased the cost of title insurance to the plaintiffs.
after plaintiffs filed their amended complaint,defendants moved to dismiss for summary judgment on plaintiffs respa claim and claim defendants argued that plaintiffs respa claim fails because the egerers claims were filed outside of the statute of limitations boyink was not referred to defendants for settlement services by any of the defendants and therefore can not maintain a claim against them for violating a and plaintiffs have not adequately alleged an actual injury in fact as a result of the marketing dollars program 
plaintiffs opposed defendants motion on the merits and filed their own motion for judgment on the pleadings.plaintiffs argued they were entitled to judgment on the pleadings because the marketing dollars program is an unlawful referral fee concealed from plaintiffs in violation of respa.because of those fees,plaintiffs contend that they paid more for settlement services.alternatively,plaintiffs argued that if the district court was not persuaded that judgment should be entered in their favor,the district court should allow plaintiffs additional time to conduct discovery before deciding defendants motion.
because the parties motions presented information and documents outside of the pleadings,the district court analyzed the motions pursuant to.based on this analysis,the district court granted defendants motion as to plaintiffs federal respa claim,denied plaintiffs motion for judgment on the pleadings,and remanded plaintiffs claim.plaintiffs moved for reconsideration,which was denied by the district court,and plaintiffs filed a timely appeal.

egerers respa claims 
plaintiffs are not entitled to equitable tolling of respa statute of limitations 
the plaintiffs,stephen and stephanie egerer,concede that their respa claims are outside of the statute of limitations however,they argue that respa statute of limitations is subject to the doctrines of equitable tolling and estoppel,and that they have both alleged and provided evidence sufficient to support the application of these doctrines and are entitled to more discovery to develop additional supporting evidence.plaintiffs claim that they are entitled to equitable tolling because defendants concealed and misled them regarding the defendants business relationship,the marketing dollars program,and true cost of title insurance,all of which could not have been reasonably discovered.
the district court recognized that this court has not yet ruled on the question of whether the respa statute of limitations is subject to equitable tolling.however,based on an analysis of young united states,d jones transohio sav.ass n,cir and other courts that have held that respa statute of limitations is subject to equitable tolling judge enslen concluded that equitable tolling is available to respa plaintiffs.
the district court then considered whether equitable tolling was appropriately applied in this case to toll the respa statute of limitations.after considering the five factors identified by truitt county of and the doctrine of fraudulent concealment as described in pinney dock transp.penn cent.judge enslen determined that it was not appropriate to equitably toll the egerers respa claims in this case.accordingly,the district court dismissed the egerers respa claims as time barred by without reaching the merits.
in order to establish equitable tolling by the doctrine of fraudulent concealment,the plaintiffs must allege and establish that defendants concealed the conduct that constitutes the cause of action defendants concealment prevented plaintiffs from discovering the cause of action within the limitations period and until discovery,plaintiffs exercised due diligence in trying to find out about the cause of action.pinney dock,at citing dayco goodyear tire rubber,cir see also jarrett kassel,cir mills equicredit,d.
defendants did not take affirmative steps to conceal plaintiffs cause of action 
the record does not support a finding that defendants affirmatively concealed conduct that allegedly violates respa.in fact,the disclosure,which was presented to and signed by the egerer plaintiffs,clearly stated that a business relationship existed between woodland realty and woodland title,and that woodland realty may receive a financial or other benefit as a result of referring plaintiffs to woodland title for settlement services.in addition,the disclosure identified the title insurance fee as estimated.defendants did not affirmatively conceal the business relationship,marketing dollars program,or actual cost of title insurance from the egerers.these basic facts,which now support plaintiffs respa cause of action,were defendants.
additionally,plaintiffs argue that defendants affirmatively concealed plaintiffs cause of action because defendants did not bring potential legal claims to their attention,and cited veltri building service pension to the district court in support of this proposition.however,plaintiffs reliance on veltri is misplaced.
veltri involved an untimely appeal regarding pension benefits,which plaintiff alleged was due to the erisa plan administrator failure to properly notify him of his right to appeal.in that case,the applicable code of regulations required that veltri be notified of his right to file both an administrative appeal and a civil action in court challenging an adverse benefits determination.veltri,at.the veltri court found that defendants did nothing that even approached compliance with the requirement that they inform veltri of his right to file an action in court,and held that the statute of limitations for filing an action in court to challenge the denial of his benefits claim was equitably tolled because the pension fund failed to notify him of his right to do so.
however,the veltri court was clear in holding that the pension fund failure to inform veltri of his right to file an action in court resulted in equitable tolling of the statute only because of the regulatory notice requirement and congress express policy favoring placement of the burden of disclosure on pension plans and protecting the interest of pension plan participants in this case,there is no requirement that defendants inform plaintiffs that they may have a legal claim because of defendants business relationship,the marketing dollars program,or because the actual cost of title insurance may vary from the estimated cost,and defendants failure to do so is not the type of concealing activity that normally justifies equitable tolling.
construing the facts in a light most favorable to plaintiffs,we find that defendants did not affirmatively conceal plaintiffs respa cause of action and were not required to inform plaintiffs that they may have a cause of action.therefore,we conclude that plaintiffs have not established the first prong of fraudulent concealment.
plaintiffs did not exercise due diligence to discover a cause of action 
the disclosure acknowledged and signed by the egerers clearly stated that a business relationship existed between woodland realty and woodland title woodland realty may receive a financial or other benefit for referring business to woodland title and the cost of title insurance was estimated.however,the egerers did not inquire of their real estate agent or anyone else as to the particulars of the business relationship,the financial benefit,or the actual cost of title insurance.
in an effort to establish that due diligence on their part would have been futile,plaintiffs assert that bouman bouman,an owner and officer of woodland realty and woodland title,testified that the marketing credit would not have been disclosed to customers even if they had asked.however,bouman testimony does not actually support that assertion 
similarly,plaintiffs assert that bouman testified it was misleading for woodland realty to print an estimate of for title insurance on the disclosure if the actual filed rate submitted by chicago title to the state of michigan was higher.once again,bouman testimony does not support that assertion perhaps more importantly,the rates charged by all title insurers must be filed with the state of michigan and are publicly available.at.
construing the facts in a light most favorable to plaintiffs,we find that the plaintiffs did not exercise due diligence and would not have been prevented by defendants from discovering their respa cause of action had they exercised due diligence.therefore,we conclude that plaintiffs have not established the second prong of fraudulent concealment.
as the district court noted,we have not yet ruled on the question of whether the respa statute of limitations is subject to equitable tolling.however,if the statute of limitations in respa were subject to equitable tolling,the propriety of equitable tolling is determined on a basis and is to be narrowly applied.see truitt county of wayne,at hill united states department of labor,cir.we conclude,like the district court,that equitable tolling should not be applied to toll the statute of limitations on these facts,and affirm the district court in granting summary judgment to defendants 
plaintiffs are not entitled to equitable estoppel 
plaintiffs also assert that the district court erred by not considering the doctrine of equitable estoppel with respect to the respa statute of limitations.plaintiffs contend that had the district court construed the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,those facts would have supported both the doctrines of equitable estoppel and equitable tolling.
unlike equitable tolling,which requires concealment of plaintiffs cause of action,equitable estoppel applies when plaintiffs are aware of their claims but defendants conduct prevents plaintiffs from timely filing suit.when this occurs,defendants are estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a bar to plaintiffs lawsuit.
the elements of an equitable estoppel claim are set forth in sprague general motors as follows 
there must be conduct or language amounting to a representation of a material fact the party to be estopped must be aware of the true facts the party to be estopped must intend that the representation be acted on,or the party asserting the estoppel must reasonably believe that the party to be estopped so intends the party asserting the estoppel must be unaware of the true facts and the party asserting the estoppel must reasonably or justifiably rely on the representation to his detriment.
like equitable tolling,equitable estoppel requires affirmative steps or action on the part of a defendant.plaintiffs must have reasonably relied on defendants affirmative conduct in failing to file suit within the statute of limitations.also,like equitable tolling,plaintiffs invoking equitable estoppel must establish due diligence.
equitable estoppel,sometimes referred to as fraudulent concealment,is invoked in cases where the defendant takes active steps to prevent the plaintiff from suing in time,such as by hiding evidence or promising not to plead the statute of limitations.application of equitable estoppel should be premised on a defendant improper conduct as well as a plaintiff actual and reasonable reliance thereon internal quotation marks and citations omitted to invoke equitable estoppel,a plaintiff must demonstrate that his ignoran
