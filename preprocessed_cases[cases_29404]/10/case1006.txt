background 
plaintiffs are small businesses and small business owners who leased point of sale credit and debit card processing equipment,such as swipe terminals and pinpads.plaintiffs allege that leasing defendants,a group of entities who financed their acquisition of the equipment,defrauded them in a scheme involving equipment leases and credit card processing services.
plaintiffs describe the alleged fraud that swindled them as follows credit and debit card transactions are processed through financial networks called interchanges that are run by entities such as visa and mastercard.financial institutions may become members of the interchange and can then sell card processing services directly to merchants or indirectly through entities known as independent sales organizations and merchant service providers.must be licensed and registered with the financial institutions and both visa and mastercard.merchants must acquire specific equipment necessary to process credit and debit card transactions and must also pay a fee for each transaction.
plaintiffs allege that leasing defendants conspired with the defendants the merchant service defendants to market fraudulent,equipment leases and credit card processing services to merchants.merchant service defendants sought merchants and induced them to enroll in such leases through a series of deceitful misrepresentations and forged documents,whereby merchants paid fees in excess of standard industry rates.the high lease costs did not pay for the equipment,but instead,primarily went toward merchant service defendants commissions for securing the leases and toward leasing defendants profits.
the tax collection scheme 
more specifically,plaintiffs allege that in,leasing defendants conspired among themselves to defraud former lessee merchants by collecting or attempting to collect taxes that were not actually due or paid to any taxing authority.leasing defendants calculated property taxes using inaccurate tax information,such as the wrong property tax base and incorrect years that lessees were enrolled in the leases,and compiled the results in a spreadsheet called schedule.schedule listed more than merchants owing over million in back property taxes and administrative fees.leasing defendants next instructed a third party to send a form letter to the former lessees telling them that defendant sks associates llc had acquired collection rights,and deductions would occur based on the purported back taxes merchants owed.leasing defendants collected the taxes and fees from merchants with expired leases by making misrepresentations to third party processors and causing processors to authorize automated clearing house ach withdrawals from the merchants bank accounts.many accounts were actually debited,but leasing defendants could only attempt to debit closed bank accounts associated with expired leases.leasing defendants also created a network of shell companies to ensure that their unlawful acts remain hidden and that victims and the courts are unable to identify the responsible party.
plaintiff erin campbell does business as the silicon valley pet clinic.campbell seeks to represent a class of lessees targeted under this expiration tax collection scheme.she entered into a lease for a credit card terminal with cit corporation and provided her bank account information to make monthly payments of about.gcn holdings,llc later acquired campbell lease,and defendant northern leasing systems serviced the lease on behalf of gcn.campbell began taking steps to terminate her lease in january and completed termination in june.yet,in march,campbell received a letter the notice of debt from defendant sks associates,which plaintiffs allege was written by defendant northern leasing systems.the letter stated that sks associates had acquired the rights and title to her old lease,that she owed for taxes and filing costs associated with her equipment,and that the amount would be deducted on march.campbell called sks associates about the charge,and the customer service representative stated that leasing defendants had paid taxes on campbell behalf and that she now owed them for that payment.the representative warned campbell that if she did not pay,leasing defendants would report the amount owed to credit bureaus and pursue other methods of collection.campbell alleges she spent several hours of her normal work time investigating the claims in the letter and paid an employee to investigate the claims and compute what campbell paid during the lease.
the property tax scheme 
plaintiffs also allege that leasing defendants collected property taxes using an inaccurate methodology rather than collecting property taxes based on the actual cost of equipment the equipment cost,leasing defendants calculated taxes using a higher base the stream of income a lease generated the acquisition cost.plaintiffs contend that the difference between the two costs is large.for example,plaintiff just film acquisition cost was,and plaintiff dietz towing acquisition cost was.by contrast,the equipment cost was only.
leasing defendants collected property taxes using the higher acquisition cost as the tax base for several years but later switched to calculating property tax using the equipment cost as the tax base.plaintiffs allege that after the switch,defendant northern leasing systems never told merchants that it had wrongly overcharged them for property taxes and did not take any steps to refund merchants for its mistakes.
procedural history 
plaintiffs filed a putative class action in state court,which defendants removed to federal court.in their third amended class action complaint,plaintiffs allege violations of sections and of the california business and professions code violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,violations of the fair credit reporting act fcra,breach of contract deceit misrepresentation negligent misrepresentation and conversion.
in april,plaintiffs filed an application for a temporary restraining order,asking the district court to enjoin leasing defendants collection of expiration taxes and administrative fees.the district court granted the application,and in june,issued a preliminary injunction.we affirmed the preliminary injunction order in just film,merchant,app x cir.
in december,the district court granted a motion for final approval of the class action settlement with respect to the merchant service defendants.
in may,plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification,seeking to certify an overarching class and five separate subclasses under rule b.two of the subclasses were certified and are relevant to this appeal the sks expiration class,and the property tax equipment cost basis class.the sks expiration class is defined as a ll persons and businesses whose lease numbers appeared on schedule with a national class pursuing rico and rico conspiracy claims and a california subclass pursuing an unfair competition law ucl claim under section of the california business and professions code.the property tax equipment cost basis class is defined as a ll persons and businesses who from march,to the present paid any leasing defendants property taxes based on a cost greater than the equipment cost with a national class seeking to bring rico,rico conspiracy,fraud,and breach of contract claims,and a california subclass seeking to bring negligent misrepresentation,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,and ucl claims.
the district court granted plaintiffs class certification motion in part on december.the court certified the california subclass of the proposed sks expiration class to pursue a ucl claim the property tax equipment cost basis class to pursue a breach of contract claim and the california subclass of the property tax equipment cost basis class to pursue a claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and a ucl claim.
thereafter,campbell filed a motion requesting leave to file a motion for reconsideration of that order.the district court granted campbell motion for reconsideration,and on march,the court certified the nationwide sks expiration class to pursue rico and rico conspiracy claims.
leasing defendants filed,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f,a petition for permission to appeal the orders,which we granted.in this consolidated appeal,leasing defendants challenge the district court class certification orders,arguing that plaintiffs did not establish typicality,commonality,and predominance for the sks expiration class and plaintiffs did not establish commonality,predominance,and superiority for the property tax equipment cost basis class.

a.the sks expiration class 
campbell represents the sks expiration class in pursuing rico,rico conspiracy,and ucl claims.she alleges that leasing defendants debited or attempted to debit bank accounts of former lessees in a spurious tax collection scheme.leasing defendants argue that campbell rico claim is not typical of the class,and that plaintiffs did not establish commonality and predominance.to establish a civil rico claim,a plaintiff must establish conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity known as predicate acts causing injury to plaintiff business or property.living designs,dupont de nemours,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.
we address the challenges to class certification raised on this appeal.
typicality 
typicality focuses on the class representative claim but not the specific facts from which the claim arose and ensures that the interest of the class representative aligns with the interests of the class.hanon dataproducts,cir.the requirement is permissive,such that representative claims are typical if they are reasonably coextensive with those of absent class members they need not be substantially identical.parsons ryan,cir.quoting hanlon chrysler,cir.measures of typicality include whether other members have the same or similar injury,whether the action is based on conduct which is not unique to the named plaintiffs,and whether other class members have been injured by the same course of conduct.torres mercer canyons,cir.quoting hanon,at.a court should not certify a class if there is a danger that absent class members will suffer if their representative is preoccupied with defenses unique to it.hanon,at internal quotation marks omitted.
leasing defendants argue campbell claim is not typical of the class because campbell legal theory is different from that of the class,her injuries are based on a different predicate act than the injuries of the class,her damages are different from those of the class,and she faces unique defenses.we reject each argument and conclude that the district court did not err in finding campbell claim typical of the class.
first,leasing defendants mischaracterize plaintiffs legal theory.leasing defendants describe it as follows they made misrepresentations to two ach processors,and the ach processors relied on the misrepresentations and debited class members bank accounts without authorization.therefore,leasing defendants assert the class injuries are attributable to reliance on leasing defendants alleged misrepresentations,and leasing defendants assert that campbell own legal theory necessarily differs from that of the class because her bank account was not actually debited.
plaintiffs actually allege a broader fraudulent scheme in which leasing defendants conspired to defraud former lessees through a course of conduct which injured campbell as well as other class members.plaintiffs allege that leasing defendants planned to collect from former lessees past taxes that were not due,and that as part of the fraudulent scheme,leasing defendants ran a faulty simulation to calculate the taxes and fees of more than merchants with expired leases,with the results compiled on schedule sent letters to merchants that inaccurately stated that an audit had revealed that the merchants owed property taxes and administrative fees created another entity to ensure that ach regulators would not learn that leasing defendants were collecting payments applied to new banks to access the ach system to debit the bank accounts associated with the expired leases sent collections letters to third party bank processors and sent electronic notices to merchants banks.
campbell is one of the merchants from whom leasing defendants made or attempted to make unauthorized ach deductions.plaintiffs presented evidence showing that campbell was the personal guarantor of an expired lease that she received a letter from sks advising her that an audit was conducted and that she owed for certain taxes and related fees that she called defendants and they informed her that she owed money and that defendants subsequently admitted that the amount they sought to collect from campbell was inaccurate.campbell claim is reasonably coextensive with that of the class because she alleges leasing defendants committed the same overall course of misconduct against other members of the class seeking to collect alleged past taxes and fees through subterfuge and misrepresentation and the class alleged injuries also resulted from that course of misconduct.see parsons,at concluding that the named plaintiffs met the typicality requirement because their injury is a result of a course of conduct that is not unique to any of them and they allege that the injury follows from the course of conduct at the center of the class claims citing hanon,at.her claim is typical of the class because it shares some common question of law and fact with class members claims.newberg on class actions ed.
leasing defendants next make the closely related argument that campbell claims are not typical because they do not focus on the same injurious conduct as that of the class.they contend that campbell was harmed by the notice of debt sent directly to her,whereas the class alleges injury based on the misrepresentations made to the ach processors.plaintiffs stress that all class members need not have suffered an identical injury instead,they need to prove that leasing defendants engaged in a pattern of racketeering,and that at least one of the acts within the pattern caused the class injury.according to plaintiffs,all class members,including campbell,have been injured by leasing defendants course of conduct.
again,leasing defendants construe plaintiffs claim too narrowly.the proposed sks expiration class rico and rico conspiracy claims are based on a broader scheme that leasing defendants crafted to collect purported back taxes and administrative fees.the pattern of racketeering includes leasing defendants alleged misrepresentations to ach processors,but also include the letters leasing defendants sent to class members claiming an audit revealed additional property taxes and fees were owed and concealing their identity to banks and merchants while pursuing collection.
campbell injuries stem from the same scheme,although the specific predicate act that caused her injury may differ from the acts that caused injury to other class members.substantively,campbell allegation of harm based on some of the activities comprising the rico violation is sufficient.see deppe tripp,cir.n o requirement exists that the plaintiff must suffer an injury from two or more predicate acts,or from all of the predicate acts.thus,a rico verdict can be sustained when a pattern of racketeering acts existed,but when only one act caused injury.internal citation omitted town of kearny hudson meadows urban renewal,cir holding that the rico statute required only injury from any predicate act,not from an entire pattern of racketeering.given the nature of rico liability,the typicality requirement necessarily focuses on whether campbell was injured by the same pattern of racketeering as the other class members.
defendants next contend that campbell injury is different from the rest of the class because ach processors did not actually debit her account.it is true that campbell account was not actually debited because it was closed,while members of the class did have funds debited from their bank accounts without authorization.instead,campbell alleges damages in the form of time taken off from work and payment to an assistant to research her financial records upon receiving the notice of debt.plaintiffs describe the class injuries as the amounts defendants debited from their bank accounts and costs class members incurred as a result of defendants bogus collection efforts.plaintiffs maintain that campbell and the class were injured by the same course of conduct,and argue that the differences in the nature of the injuries are relevant only to the extent,and calculation,of damages.
the district court cited to this court decision in lozano wireless,cir,to support its conclusion that differing injuries do not defeat typicality in this action.the district court was correct in its analysis.the relevant portion of lozano holds,it is not necessary that all class members suffer the same injury as the class representative to satisfy rule a.id.at the requirement of typicality is not primarily concerned with whether each person in a proposed class suffers the same type of damages rather,it is sufficient for typicality if the plaintiff endured a course of conduct directed against the class.although campbell was able to fend off the attempted fraud before it reached into and diminished her bank account,there is no reason why she can not prove the nature of the fraudulent scheme for benefit of all class members,whether or not their precise injuries are identical.
the district court did not misapply lozano,as leasing defendants contend.the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that campbell rico claims are the same as those of the class and the claim is based on defendants conduct not unique to campbell.even if campbell damages differ from the damages of some class members,typicality is not defeated.the class includes merchants whose accounts were actually debited,as well as merchants who spent resources to investigate the notice of debt or other representations of the debt owed and so frustrated the fraudulent scheme before it directly impacted their bank accounts.
leasing defendants next argue that campbell is subject to a unique defense lack of standing to pursue the rico claim such that certification of the sks expiration class was wrong.to establish standing,a civil rico plaintiff must show that his alleged harm qualifies as injury to his business or property and that his harm was by reason of the rico violation,which requires the plaintiff to establish proximate causation.canyon cty.syngenta seeds,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.leasing defendants contend that the district court did not address the second element.they again stress that the wrongful conduct alleged by the sks expiration class is predicated on defendants misrepresentations toward two ach processors.these two processors then relied on the misrepresentations and went on to improperly debit class members bank accounts without permission.by contrast,leasing defendants argue that campbell injury is not a direct or indirect result of this conduct.because campbell account was not debited,the argument goes,the misrepresentations were not the proximate cause of campbell injuries.
we once more reject leasing defendants repeated attempt to narrow the scope of activities that comprise the alleged rico violation.campbell alleges she suffered an injury to her business or property because of leasing defendants misconduct.the district court properly concluded that campbell had standing to pursue the rico claim because,although defendants did not deduct money from her bank account,she spent time away from her usual work and paid an assistant to help her research and compile records responding to a fraudulent allegation.this amounted to a loss to business or property sufficient to confer standing.see diaz gates,cir.
finally,leasing defendants argue that campbell would be a poor advocate for the sks expiration lease class members.they cite to in re payment card interchange fee and merch.disc.antitrust,cir.payment card interchange,to support their argument that campbell could not zealously advocate for class members with accounts actually debited.in payment card interchange,the second circuit vacated the final approval of a class action settlement between merchants and visa,mastercard,and other banks.see id.at.the court concluded that class counsel unitary representation of the plaintiffs was inadequate,as class counsel represented both merchants in a rule b class,pursuing solely monetary relief,and merchants in a rule b class,pursuing solely injunctive relief.id.at.the court reasoned
