plaintiff gary thiessen,an employee of defendants general electric capital corporation ge and montgomery ward credit services,filed this putative class action under the age discrimination in employment act adea alleging that he and other similarly situated employees had been adversely affected by a pattern or practice of age discrimination on the part of defendants.although the district court initially certified a class of plaintiffs,it ultimately decertified the class,dismissed the plaintiffs,and granted summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to thiessen individual claims.thiessen now appeals claiming the district court erred in decertifying the class and dismissing the plaintiffs,granting summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to his individual claims of age discrimination,refusing to allow eight proposed plaintiffs to join the class,and refusing to allow him to depose defendants corporate counsel.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to,and reverse and remand for further proceedings.
ge is the parent company of general electric capital services gecs,which in turn owns general electric capital credit gecc.within gecc is the retail financial services unit rfs.in,gecc purchased monogram retail credit services,mrcsi,which had been the credit division of retailer montgomery ward.mrcsi became a subsidiary of the rfs unit after the acquisition,and in,it was renamed montgomery ward credit services,
thiessen,who was born on march,began working as a credit manager trainee for mrcsi in.from to,he held various management positions within mrcsi and progressed to band on the company scale.between may and august,thiessen was placed on special assignments and assisted in the construction of mrcsi facilities in kansas,illinois,and georgia.at the completion of those projects,thiessen transferred to mrcsi las vegas facility and assumed his current position as band collection manager.according to statements in the record,thiessen position at the las vegas facility was to be eliminated as of may,and thiessen allegedly was not allowed to post for any other positions within ge.at.
on february,thiessen filed a charge of discrimination with the kansas human rights commission and the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.he alleged that defendants had an express but covert white blockers or blockers policy of discriminating against older white employees by forcing them into early retirement or by eliminating their position s through restructuring.id.at tab c.he further alleged that defendants exercised this pattern and practice of employment decisions motivated by age race and related factors against him.id.specifically,thiessen alleged he was repeatedly denied promotions because of his age and race.he subsequently filed this action alleging,in pertinent part,that defendants committed willful violations of the adea by denying him various promotions and placing him on special assignments.appee.ii at.thiessen further alleged in his complaint that defendants undertook a pattern or practice of systematically discriminating against older employees.
the centerpiece of both thiessen individual claims of age discrimination and his claims of discrimination was a blocker policy allegedly adopted and implemented by defendants in the early.according to thiessen,in,gecc management began referring to the older executive employees as blockers,because in their view these employees were blocking the advancement of younger,newly recruited employees,in particular those younger employees who were participants in defendants management development program mdp.id.at.on march,dave ekedahl,a at rfs,and david ferreira,of human resources for gecc,sent a memorandum to steve joyce,the then president and ceo of mrcsi,and jeff faucette,of human resources for mrcsi,asking,what are plans to upgrade executive talent remove blockers.appee.i at.in response to this memo,faucette directed his subordinates to prepare severance worksheets and retirement packages for various mrcsi employees over the age of forty,including thiessen and several of the plaintiffs lawson,gwen colwell,bob demartine,melva heid,and bob marsonette none of whom had requested such packages.on march,ferreira circulated a memo to faucette and others again discussing the subject of blockers.joyce and faucette allegedly gave a presentation discussing band blockers at a leadership review meeting attended by ferreira.at a may meeting of mrcsi human resource managers,the concept of blockers was again discussed and outlined by faucette.at a june,meeting at mrcsi merriam,kansas facility,faucette distributed a list of possible blockers to the human resource managers.the managers were effectively instructed to discuss the blocker policy with their respective operational managers,and assist the operational managers in identifying blockers and carrying out the policy.ultimately,thiessen alleges,the operational managers implemented the blocker policy by taking various negative employment actions,negative performance evaluations,demotions,terminations,reductions in force,placement on special projects,toward older employees identified as blockers.
thiessen alleged defendants blocker policy impacted all of the plaintiffs,each of whom allegedly suffered some type of adverse employment action.on an individual level,thiessen alleged he was identified by defendants as a blocker,and he was denied a business center manager position in las vegas in,phased out of his position as national manager in and placed on special assignment,downgraded on his and performance reviews,and denied two remittance processing manager positions in.
defendants denied having any pattern or practice of discrimination.although they acknowledged there had been some discussion among certain employees of blockers,they denied that any type of blocker policy was implemented anywhere in the organization.further,defendants alleged that in the fall of,gail lanik,the ceo of mrcsi and successor to steve joyce expressly repudiated the notion that employment decisions were based on any blocker policy.in response to defendants denials,thiessen alleged that,notwithstanding lanik purported repudiation,the blocker policy continued to be used on a covert basis.in support of his allegation,thiessen pointed to alleged acts of employment discrimination against him and the other proposed plaintiffs after the fall of.thiessen also pointed to statistical evidence that allegedly demonstrated older workers were treated less favorably than younger employees.
during the course of discovery,the district court conditionally certified a class of plaintiffs thiessen and plaintiffs.thiessen general capital,thiessen i.in doing so,the district court noted 
thiessen has not simply averred the existence of a discriminatory policy or merely argued that circumstantially one should infer its existence by virtue of numerous people in the protected category having incurred adverse employment actions.instead,he has come forward with direct evidence of an overall policy of purported age discrimination.moreover,the names of some of the plaintiffs appear on blocker lists.the court believes this evidence can not be so easily discounted just because the alleged discrimination was meted out over a wide geographic range in a number of ways and that it merits a threshold determination that the plaintiffs are similarly situated to thiessen for purposes of something akin to conditional certification.however,the court remains troubled by a puzzling lack of any significant showing by thiessen that there is a link between this alleged policy and the adverse job actions.even if there was a discriminatory policy,the plaintiffs are only similarly situated if they can make a submissible case that they,too,were victims of it.it is because of that deficiency,at least in part,that the court is unwilling to grant final certification on the record before it.
id.the court cautioned thiessen that,i n order to survive a motion to decertify,he would need to set forth what he deem ed to be the specific link between the blocker policy and what occurred with each plaintiff.id.further,the court noted that if,in a subsequent motion to decertify,defendants could truly convince the court that individual defense issues would predominate at trial,the contention that the plaintiffs we re similarly situated would likely be largely eviscerated.id.at.finally,the court noted it would make a final determination regarding whether the trial of all the plaintiffs claims could be coherently managed and presented in a manner that w ould not confuse the jury or unduly prejudice any party.id.
at the conclusion of discovery,defendants moved to decertify the class.defendants also moved for summary judgment with respect to each of the plaintiffs.the district court decertified the class,dismissed the plaintiffs claims without prejudice,and granted summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to thiessen individual claims of discrimination.thiessen general capital,d thiessen ii.
decertification of plaintiff class and dismissal of plaintiffs 
thiessen contends the district court erred in decertifying the plaintiff class and dismissing the plaintiffs claims without prejudice.we review for abuse of discretion a district court decision to certify or decertify a class under the adea.see mooney aramco servs,cir lockhart westinghouse credit,cir.under an abuse of discretion standard,we will not disturb the underlying decision unless we have a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a clear error of judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances.see richardson missouri pacific,cir.
class actions under the adea are authorized by b,which expressly borrows the class action mechanism of the fair labor standards act of,b.section b provides for a class action where the complaining employees are similarly situated.unlike class actions under rule,n o employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.id.
the overriding question here is whether thiessen and the plaintiffs are similarly situated for purposes of b.unfortunately,b does not define the term similarly situated,and there is little circuit law on the subject.federal district courts have adopted or discussed at least three approaches to determining whether plaintiffs are similarly situated for purposes of b.see,mooney,at discussing two different approaches adopted by district courts bayles american med.response of.under the first approach,a court determines,on an ad hoc basis,whether plaintiffs are similarly situated.mooney,at.in utilizing this approach,a court typically makes an initial notice stage determination of whether plaintiffs are similarly situated.vaszlavik storage tech.in doing so,a court require s nothing more than substantial allegations that the putative class members were together the victims of a single decision,policy,or plan.id.quoting bayles.at.at the conclusion of discovery often prompted by a motion to decertify,the court then makes a second determination,utilizing a stricter standard of similarly situated.id.at.during this second stage analysis,a court reviews several factors,including disparate factual and employment settings of the individual plaintiffs the various defenses available to defendant which appear to be individual to each plaintiff fairness and procedural considerations and whether plaintiffs made the filings required by the adea before instituting suit.id 
under the second approach,district courts have incorporated into b the requirements of current federal rule of civil procedure.see bayles.at discussing cases adopting this approach.for example,in shushan university of,the district court concluded that rule a four prerequisites numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation and b requirement that common questions of fact predominate should be used to determine whether plaintiffs are similarly situated.bayles.at describing shushan holding.
in a third approach,district courts have suggested incorporating into b the requirements of the pre version of rule,which allowed for spurious class actions.see bayles.at holding that,because advisory committee notes to the amendments make clear that the amendments were not intended to affect b actions,if rule standards apply at all,it must be through rule as it existed prior to.under the pre version of rule,the character of the right sought to be enforced for the class of plaintiffs must be several,there must be a common question of law or fact affecting the several rights,and a common relief must be sought.id.further,under the old rule,district courts had inherent authority to refuse to proceed collectively where it would waste judicial resources or unfairly prejudice the party opposing the proposed class.id.at.
in the present case,the district court adopted the ad hoc approach to determining whether the plaintiffs were similarly situated for purposes of b.it first conditionally certified the class during the course of discovery,applying a fairly lenient standard for what constituted similarly situated.during its analysis prompted by the defendants motion to decertify,the court applied a stricter standard,focusing on three factors whether a sufficient link existed between the alleged blocker policy and the challenged employment decisions whether individual issues would predominate at trial and whether a trial of the action could be coherently managed and evidence presented in a manner that would not confuse the jury or unduly prejudice any party.thiessen ii,d at.ultimately,the district court concluded that all three factors warranted decertifying the class.
with respect to the first factor,the district court concluded the mere fact that plaintiffs suffered adverse employment actions after having been designated as blockers,standing alone,wa s insufficient to support an inference that a causal connection exist ed between the blocker policy and the adverse actions,particularly in light of the significant time lag and critical intervening events.id.at.the significant time lag was the time period between the plaintiffs alleged designations as blockers in and the filing of thiessen eeoc charge in february,which the district court concluded allowed thiessen and the other plaintiffs to reach back days from the charge,or until approximately april.the critical intervening events included the express repudiation of the blocker policy by mrcsi ceo gail lanik in the fall of because there was insufficient evidence of a causal link between the blocker policy or plaintiffs purported blocker status and the challenged employment actions,the district court stated it could not conclude that the plaintiffs we re similarly situated for purposes of proceeding as a collective action.id.at.
in conducting its analysis of the first factor,the district court also rejected the suggestion forwarded by thiessen that it should apply a summary standard in determining whether,for purposes of the similarly situated analysis,there was a sufficient link between the blocker policy and the adverse employment actions taken against plaintiffs.instead,the court concluded that whether plaintiffs were similarly situated was a factual determination it was entitled to make based on the evidence presented by the parties.
with respect to the second factor,the district court noted that defendants had come forward with highly individualized defenses with regard to each of the various adverse employment actions alleged by plaintiffs.id.at.allowing defendants to assert these defenses during a collective trial,the court concluded,would effectively result in individual jury trials to determine defendants liability to each plaintiff.id.at.although the court acknowledged the common thread of the blocker policy,it nevertheless concluded that the judicial inefficiencies associated with resolving what appear ed to be distinct cases clearly outweighed any potential benefits in proceeding as a collective action.id.
with respect to the third factor,the district court noted that plaintiffs had proposed separating the trial into two phases.plaintiffs proposed that during the first phase of the trial the court would submit the pattern and practice allegations as well as the individual claims and damages of nine plaintiffs seven of whom appeared on various lists of proposed blockers,and two of whom were told they were blockers.id.according to plaintiffs,this initial phase would involve a determination of common class issues relating to the existence,implementation,and discriminatory nature of the blocker policy as well as class issues regarding wilfulness under the adea.id.if the jury determined that the blocker policy existed and that defendants had engaged in a pattern and practice of age discrimination,according to plaintiffs proposed plan,then the same jury would hear phase two of the trial,which would involve the remaining plaintiffs.id.at.
the district court concluded that plaintiffs proposed trial plan had numerous,serious deficiencies.id.at.in particular,the court concluded that plaintiffs plan render ed individualized consideration of the claims impossible and impose d extraordinary burdens on the jury,both in terms of the quantity of evidence and the length of trial.id.thus,the court stated that the absence of any workable trial management plan reinforce d its decision to decertify the class.id.
the initial question,which we address de novo,is whether it was proper for the district court to adopt the ad hoc approach in determining whether plaintiffs were similarly situated for purposes of b.see mooney,at applying a de novo standard of review in determining whether district court applied the proper legal standard in decertifying a class.arguably,the ad hoc approach is the best of the three approaches outlined because it is not tied to the rule standards.congress clearly chose not to have the rule standards apply to class actions under the adea,and instead adopted the similarly situated standard.to now interpret this similarly situated standard by simply incorporating the requirements of rule either the current version or the pre version would effectively ignore congress directive that said,however,there is little difference in the various approaches.all approaches allow for consideration of the same or similar factors,and generally provide a district court with discretion to deny certification for trial management reasons.we find no error on the part of the district court in adopting the ad hoc approach.
turning to the merits of thiessen arguments,the question is whether the district court abused its discretion in applying the ad hoc approach and decertifying the class.if plaintiffs were simply attempting to collectively assert their individual claims of discrimination,the decision to decertify would appear to be entirely proper.the problem,however,is that plaintiffs were asserting a claim modeled on international brotherhood of teamsters united states,d.in particular,plaintiffs alleged that defendants,by way of the mdp and the blocker policy,had a policy of age discrimination.stated differently,plaintiffs alleged that it was defendants standard operating procedure,implemented through the mdp and the blocker policy,to discriminate against employees particularly executive employees on the basis of age.although the district court acknowledged that all of the plaintiffs relied on the existence of the blocker policy to support their claims,it failed to recognize the nature of the class claim.for the reasons discussed below,we conclude the district court failure in this regard adversely impacted its similarly situated analysis and resulted in an abuse of discretion.
cases differ significantly from the far more common cases involving one or more claims of individualized discrimination.in a case involving individual claims of discrimination,the focus is on the reason s for the particular employment decisions at issue.cooper fed.reserve bank of richmond,d.in contrast,the initial focus in a case is not on individual employment decisions,but on a pattern of discriminatory decisionmaking.id.thus,the order and allocation of proof,as well as the overall nature of the trial proceedings,in a case differ dramatically from a case involving only individual claims of discrimination.teamsters,at.
cases are typically tried in two or more stages.during the first stage of trial,the plaintiffs burden is to demonstrate that unlawful discrimination has been a regular procedure or policy followed by an employer or group of employers.id.at.thus,a t the initial,liability stage of a suit the plaintiffs are not required to offer evidence that each person for whom they will ultimately seek relief was a victim of the employer discriminatory policy.id.instead,plaintiffs burden is to establish that such a policy existed.id.the burden then shifts to the employer to defeat the prima facie showing of a pattern or practice by demonstrating that the plaintiffs proof is either inaccurate or insignificant.id.if an employer fails to rebut the inference that arises from the plaintiffs prima facie case,the finder of fact can conclude that a violation has occurred and the trial court can award prospective equitable relief.id.at.if the plaintiffs also seek individual relief for the victims of the discriminatory practice,the case moves into the second or subsequent stages.id.in these additional proceedings it must be determined whether each individual plaintiff was a victim of the discriminatory practice.importantly,by having prevailed in the first stage of trial,the individual plaintiffs reap a significant advantage for purposes of the second stage they are entitled to a presumption that the employer had discriminated against them.see cooper,at.
returning to the district court decision to decertify,we conclude the district court erred in its determination of whether a sufficient link existed between the alleged blocker policy and the challenged employment decisions,thiessen ii,d at.given the nature of plaintiffs claim,this factor necessarily encompasses factual issues relevant to both the first and second stages of trial,whether the blocker policy continued after lanik alleged repudiation and,if it did,whether a link existed between that policy and the individual employment decisions affecting the named plaintiffs.the problem is that the district court effectively made findings regarding these issues in the guise of determining whether plaintiffs were similarly situated.see adamson bowen,cir holding that district court,in making class certification decision,should avoid focusing on merits of underlying class action anderson city of albuquerque,cir reversing and remanding denial of class certification where district court indicated its belief that plaintiff could not prevail on individual claims.by doing so,the district court essentially deprived plaintiffs of their right to have the issues decided by a jury,or to at least have the court determine,under summary judgment standards,whether there was sufficient evidence to send the issue to the jury.further,the district court failed to take into account the fact that,if plaintiffs were able to establish a pattern or practice of discrimination,they would be entitled to a presumption that the individual employment actions taken against them were the result of such discrimination.indeed,the district court effectively deprived plaintiffs of this procedural advantage as well.
the district court consideration of the second factor whether individual issues would predominate at trial,was likewise adversely affected by its failure to recognize that plaintiffs were proceeding under a theory.although it is true that defendants asserted highly individualized defenses to each of the instances of individual discrimination asserted by plaintiffs,those defenses would not become the focal point until the second stage of trial and could be dealt with in a series of individual trials,if necessary.with respect to the first stage of trial and the initial issues of whether they had in place a pattern or practice of discrimination and whether it continued after the fall of,defendants had only a few common defenses.specifically,defendants alleged that the blocker policy,though perhaps mentioned by faucette at various times,was never implemented anywhere in the organization and was expressly repudiated by lanik.further,with respect to the discriminatory nature of the mdp program,defendants claimed it was open to all employees,including those over age forty.thus,the presence of the highly individualized defenses clearly did not,as the district court concluded,outweigh any potential benefits in proceeding as a collective action.as previously noted,there was a significant procedural advantage for plaintiffs to proceed in a collective action if they prevailed in the first stage of trial,they would be entitled to a presumption of discrimination in subsequent proceedings to decide the merits of their individual claims.by bowing to the individualized defenses relevant only to the second stage of trial,the district court deprived plaintiffs of this opportunity.
the district court consideration of the third factor trial management concerns was also adversely affected by its failure to recognize the nature of plaintiffs claim.most notably,the district court failed to acknowledge that plaintiffs proposed trial plan,though perhaps deficient in some respects,was consistent with the framework outlined in teamsters for claims.the court also failed to make any effort to modify the plaintiffs proposed trial plan.finally,the district court was wrong in concluding that trying the case in two phases,as suggested by plaintiffs,render ed individualized consideration of the claims impossible.thiessen ii,d at.
we conclude the district court abused its discretion in decertifying the class.taking into consideration the pattern or practice nature of plaintiffs lawsuit,as discussed above,plaintiffs were,in fact,similarly situated for purposes of b.in particular,many of the plaintiffs were specifically listed or classified by defendants as blockers and suffered adverse employment consequences during the relevant time period.the remainder of the plaintiffs,though never specifically classified by defendants as blockers,fell within the alleged definition of blockers and were likewise subjected to adverse employment consequences during the relevant time period.
a district court considering a motion to certify or decertify is entitled to look past the pleadings and examine the evidence produced during discovery,but when an adea plaintiff relies upon a pattern or practice theory and comes forward with legitimate evidence to support that theory,the district court must take into account the framework for cases outlined by the supreme court in international brotherhood of teamsters united states,d.that did not occur in this case,and hence our application of those factors using the correct legal framework.we do not hold that whenever there is evidence of a,a class must be certified.whether certification or decertification is appropriate depends upon application of the factors we have identified in the ad hoc approach.
grant of summary judgment 
in connection with their motion to decertify,defendants moved for summary judgment with respect to all of thiessen claims for relief.after granting defendants motion to decertify,the district court granted defendants summary judgment motion in its entirety.in doing so,the court treated thiessen claims as,individual claims of discrimination.the court concluded that three of thiessen claims,his claim his claim and his downgraded performance claim were time barred because they occurred more than days prior to the filing of thiessen eeoc charge.thiessen ii,d at.as for the remaining two claims the denial of the two rpc manager positions,the district court concluded,after analyzing them under the mcdonnell douglas framework,that thiessen had failed to produce evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that defendants proffered explanations for their actions were unworthy of credence.id.at.
on appeal,thiessen contends the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.kidd taos ski valley,cir.summary judgment is proper only when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences derived therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.kidd,at.
as with defendants motion to decertify,proper consideration of defendants motion for summary judgment must take into account the fact that thiessen and the plaintiffs were asserting a claim.although there is little case authority discussing summary judgment motions in cases,we see no reason why summary judgment motions can not be aimed at both the first and second stage issues.presumably,however,such motions must be analyzed in light of the orders of proof peculiar to cases,and must be filed and considered at an appropriate stage of the proceedings.during the first stage of a case,for example,a summary judgment motion whether filed by plaintiffs or defendants must focus solely on whether there is sufficient evidence demonstrating that defendants had in place a pattern or practice of discrimination during the relevant limitations period see teamsters,at.until the first stage is resolved,we question whether it is proper for a court to consider summary judgment motions regarding second stage issues,whether individual plaintiffs are entitled to relief.even assuming,arguendo,such motions can properly be considered prior to resolution of the first stage,it is clear they would not be analyzed under the typical framework.see id.rejecting use of framework in cases see also davoll webb,cir discussing teamster rejection of the test in cases.instead,they would operate under the presumption that defendants had in place a pattern or practice of discrimination,and all employment decisions regarding the class plaintiffs were made pursuant to that pattern or practice.see teamsters,at.
we conclude the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to thiessen claims for relief.consistent with our discussion of the class decertification decision,it is apparent that the first stage issues in this case have yet to be resolved.thus,thiessen claims can not at this point be treated as claims of individual discrimination or analyzed under the mcdonnell douglas framework.
refusal to allow certain plaintiffs to join class 
when it initially certified the plaintiff class during discovery,the district court addressed several issues,including whether the proposed plaintiffs,none of whom filed eeoc charges,could piggyback on the eeoc charge filed by thiessen the district court first concluded that thiessen eeoc charge asserted allegations of discrimination and satisfied the notice requirements of d.the district court then concluded that only those individuals who could have filed timely eeoc charges at the time thiessen actually filed his charge could join as plaintiffs.more specifically,the court concluded that only those individuals who suffered adverse employment actions in the period prior to the filing of thiessen eeoc charge could opt in.accordingly,the district court excluded from the class eight proposed plaintiffs,seven of whom resigned or were terminated from employment long before the start of the day filing period,and one of whom failed to allege any discriminatory treatment in the filing window.thiessen i.at.
on appeal,thiessen contends the district court erred in excluding these eight individuals from the class.according to thiessen,the district court failed to consider evidence that defendants actively concealed the existence of the blocker policy.this evidence,thie
