in this case,we must determine whether a proposed class meets the requirements for class certification under texas rule of civil procedure.the trial court certified a class consisting of gas royalty owners in crockett county who claim that lessees breached an implied duty to obtain the best current price reasonably obtainable.the court of appeals affirmed.as certified,the class includes some royalty owners whose leases calculate royalty payments on an or proceeds basis and other royalty owners whose leases calculate royalty payments based on current market value.because a covenant to obtain the best price reasonably attainable is implied under texas law only to proceeds leases,not to leases,we conclude that the royalty owners have not established that there are questions of law or fact common to the class sufficient to support certification.civ.we therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.
union pacific resources group uprg leases land in crockett county,produces gas from that land,and pays the lessors a royalty on its gas production.this suit was filed by several royalty interest owners who alleged that uprg had underpaid royalties.specifically,they alleged that uprg sold the gas to affiliated companies at preferential index prices and calculated royalty payments on the basis of the indexes used for the sales,and that the uprg affiliates then sold the gas to third parties at higher prices.the plaintiffs brought this suit on behalf of a purported class of uprg royalty owners collectively,the royalty owners against uprg and several of its affiliates collectively,union pacific for breach of an implied covenant to reasonably market the gas and to obtain the best current price reasonably obtainable for it.the royalty owners also alleged that uprg paid unreasonable and excessive rates to its marketing affiliates to market,gather,compress,treat,and transport the gas,which increased the affiliates profit and decreas ed the amount of royalty received by plaintiffs and class members.
union pacific objected to class certification,arguing that not all the leases in the purported class contained an implied covenant to reasonably market the gas.union pacific conceded that it might have an implied duty to obtain the highest price reasonably available on those leases that calculate royalty payments based on the proceeds actually received by the lessee.however,it argued that it had no such duty on those leases that base royalty payments on the current market price of the gas.for those leases,royalty payments are based upon fair market value regardless of what price the lessees actually obtain for the gas.
union pacific does not dispute that an appropriate sale price under a lease may often be roughly equivalent to an appropriate sale price under a proceeds lease,but contends that even though the two prices may be similar,they are independent of each other and are subject to different methods of evaluation.market value is generally determined by comparing the sale price to other sales comparable in time,quality,quantity,and availability of marketing outlets.heritage,nationsbank.the implied covenant to reasonably market,by contrast,focuses on the behavior of the lessee rather than on evidence of other sales,and asks whether the lessee acted as a reasonably prudent operator under the same or similar facts and circumstances.see amoco prod.alexander.consequently,we recently noted in yzaguirre kcs,that m arket value may be wholly unrelated to the price the lessee receives as the proceeds of a sales contract.
because the purported class included both and proceeds leases,union pacific argued that the royalty owners claims were too dissimilar to meet the initial certification prerequisites.see civ.notwithstanding union pacific objections,the trial court certified a class encompassing royalty owners of leases in crockett county in which the gas was purchased by an affiliate of union pacific resources group,with the exclusion of any royalty owners whose leases specifically allow for the type of affiliate transactions or index pricing used by the defendants in this case.the propriety of the marketing fee charged to union pacific by its affiliates was included in the issues to be addressed on a basis,but no other charges were included.
union pacific appealed the certification order.while the appeal was pending,this court decided southwestern refining bernal,which held that c ourts must perform a rigorous analysis before ruling on class certification to determine whether all prerequisites to certification have been met,because actual,not presumed conformance with the requirements of rule remains indispensable.id.at quoting.of the southwest falcon,d.bernal consequently concluded that it is improper to certify a class without knowing how the claims can and will likely be tried and that a trial court certification order must indicate how the claims will likely be tried so that conformance with rule may be meaningfully evaluated.id.at.pursuant to bernal,the court of appeals abated the case so that the trial court could develop a trial plan.union pac.res.group,hankins,paso,no pet.
after the trial court developed its trial plan and the case returned to the court of appeals,this court decided yzaguirre,which distinguished between leases and proceeds leases.yzaguirre,at.we noted that while leases contain an explicit requirement to pay royalties based on the prevailing market price at the time of the sale or use,proceeds leases merely base the royalty payment on the price actually received for the gas.id.at.yzaguirre further held that while a lessee under a proceeds lease has an obligation to obtain the best current price reasonably available,that obligation does not extend to leases.because a lease provides an objective basis for calculating royalties that is independent of the price the lessee actually obtains,the lessor does not need the protection of an implied covenant to obtain the highest price reasonably available.id.at.yzaguirre therefore confirmed union pacific argument that those royalty owners with leases had no cause of action for breach of an implied covenant to reasonably market oil and gas.at most,their claim was for breach of an express agreement to pay royalty based on market value.
the court of appeals acknowledged that both parties urge that the recent texas supreme court case of yzaguirre kcs resources,supports the merits of their positions on implied covenants or lack thereof,but held that it was unnecessary to address these contentions because an appellate court review of a class certification order should not include examining the merits of claims or defenses asserted by the parties.at.nor did the court consider yzaguirre impact on the class ability to meet the certification prerequisites of rule.instead,it simply concluded that w hatever impact yzaguirre may have upon this case remains for resolution at another stage of litigation.id.union pacific then appealed the certification order to this court.
because this is an interlocutory appeal from an order certifying a class action and there was no dissent in the court of appeals,this court has jurisdiction only when the court of appeals holds differently from a prior decision of another court of appeals or of the supreme court.gov t code b,c a.union pacific asserts that the court of appeals failure to analyze yzaguirre impact on the rule requirements conflicts with bernal requirement that courts require certification orders to demonstrate actual,not presumed conformance with the requirements of rule.bernal,at.we agree.in bernal,we held that in order to make a proper analysis of the rule factors,a court must go beyond the pleadings and must understand the claims,defenses,relevant facts,and applicable substantive law in order to make a meaningful determination of the certification issues.id.quoting castano am.tobacco,cir.by choosing to delay analysis of yzaguirre until another stage of litigation,the court of appeals ignored applicable substantive law crucial to understanding the claims and defenses in this case.
