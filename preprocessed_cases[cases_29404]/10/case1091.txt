this is a class action brought under the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa or the act,et.plaintiff david tourgeman contends that the defendants collins financial services,paragon way,nelson kennard and collins financial services usa,made false representations to him in connection with their efforts to collect a purported debt specifically,tourgeman argues that the defendants violated the act by misidentifying his original creditor in a series of collection letters sent to him,as well as in a complaint filed against him in state court.he also maintains that one defendant,nelson kennard,misleadingly represented that its collection letter was from an attorney when,on tourgeman account of the facts,no attorney had been meaningfully involved in evaluating his case.the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants.we have jurisdiction under.we now reverse and hold that judgment should be entered for tourgeman.
background 
david tourgeman bought a dell computer.at the time of the purchase,tourgeman resided in mexico,and he ordered the computer to be shipped to his parents home in california.he financed the purchase through dell financial services,which arranged for a loan to be originated by cit online bank.dell financial then serviced the loan.according to tourgeman,he completed repayment within two years of buying the computer.but dell financial records reflected otherwise.tourgeman allegedly outstanding debt therefore was charged off and then sold,along with more than other dell financial debts,to collins financial services 
collins transferred tourgeman file along with the other dell financial accounts to collins affiliated collection agency,paragon way,which mailed three letters to tourgeman encouraging him to pay off the purported debt.collins then referred the file to the law firm of nelson kennard,which sent its own dunning letter to tourgeman.all of these letters were mailed to addresses in california at which paragon and nelson kennard believed tourgeman might reside.in fact,the addresses belonged to tourgeman parents,and tourgeman himself remained resident in mexico.after receiving no response to the letters,nelson kennard filed a complaint on behalf of collins in san diego county superior court.tourgeman retained counsel,and nelson kennard eventually elected to dismiss the action.it was during this state court litigation that tourgeman learned of the several letters that had been mailed to him at his parents addresses.see tourgeman collins fin,cv,wl,at.july.
tourgeman then went on the offensive.he filed this lawsuit in federal district court,alleging that collins,paragon way,and nelson kennard had violated the fdcpa,as well as california law,in their efforts to collect the purported debt from him tourgeman complaint survived motions to dismiss filed by the several defendants,see,and the district court later certified a class of consumer plaintiffs,see tourgeman collins fin,cv,wl,at.but upon the defendants motions for summary judgment and tourgeman,the court granted judgment to the defendants.see tourgeman collins fin,cv,wl.
on appeal,tourgeman makes two claims under the fdcpa.his main claim arises from the fact that the defendants both in their letters and in the state court complaint falsely identified his original creditor as american investment bank,when,in actuality,cit online bank originated the loan.tourgeman contends that this misidentification violated the act prohibition on the use of any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.tourgeman second claim relates to the letter sent to him by the law firm of nelson kennard.he argues that the attorney who signed the letter had not been meaningfully involved in evaluating his case,and that the letter therefore runs afoul of,which proscribes t he false representation or implication that any individual is an attorney or that any communication is from an attorney.tourgeman seeks only statutory damages,conceding that he suffered no pecuniary loss as a result of the defendants conduct.
ii.standing 
nelson kennard first argues that tourgeman lacks both statutory and article iii standing to assert any claims based on the collection letters,which tourgeman admittedly never received when they were sent.the law firm contends that the fdcpa does not provide a cause of action to a consumer in tourgeman position,notwithstanding the statute broad language providing that any debt collector who fails to comply with any provision of this subchapter with respect to any person is liable to such person.a.nelson kennard further maintains that even if the fdcpa does purport to endow such consumers with a cause of action,article iii would forbid it,because consumers who never receive the offending communication have suffered no injury in fact.tourgeman position is that a violation of the fdcpa in and of itself confers article iii standing.
article iii standing 
article iii of the constitution limits jurisdiction to cases and controversies.massachusetts.the requirement of standing flows from this limitation.lujan defenders of wildlife.standing doctrine assures that the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues,warth seldin,by demanding that he or she possess a direct stake in the outcome of the case,hollingsworth perry,quoting arizonans for official english arizona.

at the same time,the requirement of injury in fact is a hard floor of article iii jurisdiction that can not be removed by statute.summers earth island.thus,there are limits on congress ability to elevate to the status of legally cognizable injuries particular types of harm that were previously not recognized in law.lujan,at.as this court has observed,there are two constitutional limitations on congressional power to confer standing.robins,at.first,a plaintiff must be among the injured,in the sense that she alleges the defendants violated her statutory rights.id.quoting beaudry telecheck,cir internal quotation marks omitted.second,the statutory right at issue must protect against individual,rather than collective,harm.id.quoting beaudry,at.
the second limitation poses no problem in this case.the personal interest in not being the object of a misrepresentation made unlawful by statute,havens realty coleman,assuredly is an individual,rather than collective,harm,beaudry,at internal quotation marks omitted.the gravamen of nelson kennard argument,rather,is that tourgeman is not truly among the injured.that is,it contends that tourgeman has not suffered the actual injury required by article iii because he never received any letter that contained the allegedly misleading representations.according to nelson kennard,a consumer who never receives a dunning letter can suffer neither pecuniary nor emotional harm,nor can such a consumer be hindered in deciding how to respond to the effort to collect the debt.
the supreme court decision in havens realty coleman,however,makes clear that such pecuniary or emotional harms are not necessary to a finding of injury in fact.in havens,the court held that an african american tester who,by posing as an apartment hunter,aimed to ferret out violations of the fair housing act fha possessed standing to bring suit based on the defendants falsely telling her that no apartments in a particular housing complex were available,even though the tester had no intention of actually renting an apartment from the defendant and,indeed,may well have fully expect ed that he would receive false information.at.the court concluded that the alleged injury to the plaintiffs statutorily created right to truthful housing information was a cognizable injury in and of itself regardless of whether the plaintiff actually hoped to reside in the defendant housing complex and therefore the art.iii requirement of injury in fact was satisfied.id.at citing warth,at.the tester plaintiff possessed standing not because she had been deprived of the benefits that result from living in an integrated community,id.at,but simply because her statutorily created right to truthful housing information had been infringed,id.at.
similarly,we have held that where a home buyer is referred by her settlement agent to a particular title insurer as a result of a kickback deal between the agent and the insurer,the consumer suffers article iii injury even though she paid no more for the insurance than she otherwise would have.edwards first am.corp,cir,cert.granted in part,cert.dismissed as improvidently granted.per curiam accord alston countrywide fin,cir recognizing that because article iii injury can be predicated on the violation of statutory rights,a plaintiff need not demonstrate that he or she suffered actual monetary damages carter welles bowen realty,cir just as a violation of the rights of testers to receive truthful information supports standing,so does a violation of the right to receive referrals untainted by conflicts of interest.quoting havens,at.more recently,we concluded that an individual had standing to sue a website operator that allegedly had published inaccurate information about him,regardless of whether the plaintiff had suffered any financial or emotional harm as a consequence.see robins,at accord beaudry,at see also in re zynga privacy,wl,at cir.may,affirming article iii standing based on facebook user interest in maintaining the privacy of her online identification and url information.in cases involving a variety of other federal statutes,courts regularly have held that the absence of pecuniary loss is no bar to article iii standing,if the plaintiff has alleged a violation of the rights conferred by statute.see,hammer,wl,at action under fair and accurate credit transactions act donoghue,at action under section b of securities exchange act robey,at action under fdcpa demando morris,cir action under truth in lending act.
although tourgeman could not have suffered any pecuniary loss or mental distress as the result of a letter that he did not encounter until months after it was sent when related litigation was already underway the injury he claims to have suffered was the violation of his right not to be the target of misleading debt collection communications.the alleged violation of this statutory right like those rights at issue in havens,robins,and the other cases that we have noted constitutes a cognizable injury under article iii.and w hen the injury in fact is the violation of a statutory right that we inferred from the existence of a private cause of action,causation and redressability the two other elements of standing will usually be satisfied.robins,at.such is the case here.the alleged violation of tourgeman statutory rights stems solely from the defendants having mailed to him their collection letters,and that injury would be redressed by an award of statutory damages,which the fdcpa makes available to prevailing consumers.see a providing for additional damages.we conclude,therefore,that tourgeman has constitutional standing.
statutory standing 
satisfied that article iii of the constitution would not bar congress from creating a private cause of action for a consumer in tourgeman position,we now turn to ask whether congress actually has done so in the fdcpa.we start with the text of the statute see lexmark int l,static control components,united states johnson,cir.the fdcpa provides that any debt collector who fails to comply with any provision of this subchapter with respect to any person is liable to such person.a.and the substantive provision that tourgeman alleges was violated states that a debt collector may not use any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.id.the question,then,is whether the use of any false,deceptive,or misleading representation with respect to any person entails a corollary requirement that the person to whom the representation was addressed actually have received it.
the statute text imposes no such requirement.still,it is not unreasonable for nelson kennard to contend that the very concept of a representation contemplates the presence of two parties the party making the representation and the party to whom it is made.see,webster third new int l dictionary defining represent as meaning,inter alia,to set forth or place before someone as by statement,account,or discourse,and to exhibit a fact to another mind in language emphases added black law dictionary ed defining representation as meaning,inter alia,a presentation of fact either by words or by conduct made to induce someone to act especially the manifestation to another that a fact,including a state of mind,exists emphases added.but these definitions do not speak to the nature of the intended recipient role in the transaction,and the statutory text itself is aimed squarely at the debt collector conduct,rather than at its effect on the consumer.see k a proscribing the use of any false,deceptive,or misleading representation with respect to any person emphasis added.a debt collector who addresses a misleading dunning letter to a consumer as a means of collecting that consumer debt use s an unlawful practice with respect to the consumer,regardless of whether some interceding condition such as of the letter,or the consumer failure to read it,or the fact that the consumer is savvy enough not to be misled by it renders the practice ineffective.
the manner in which the majority of courts have applied the fdcpa aligns with this construction of the statute.to begin with,a consumer possesses a right of action even where the defendant conduct has not caused him or her to suffer any pecuniary or emotional harm,phillips asset acceptance,llc,cir robey,at miller wolpoff abramson,cir baker servs,cir.an fdcpa plaintiff need not even have actually been misled or deceived by the debt collector representation instead,liability depends on whether the hypothetical least sophisticated debtor likely would be misled,gonzales arrow fin,llc,cir terran kaplan,cir.this inquiry is objective and is undertaken as a matter of law.gonzales,at.in addition,by making available to prevailing consumers both statutory damages and attorneys fees,congress clearly intended that private enforcement actions would be the primacy enforcement tool of the act.baker,at citing elements of the fdcpa legislative history see also evon law offices of sidney mickell,cir the fdcpa is a consumer protection statute and was intended to permit,even encourage,attorneys like plaintiffs class counsel to act as private attorney generals to pursue fdcpa claims.gonzales,at noting that congress encouraged private enforcement of the fdcpa by permitting aggrieved individuals to bring suit as private attorneys general citing camacho bridgeport,cir.
these interlocking statutory features demonstrate that congress intended to achieve its goal of regulating debt collectors conduct by motivating consumers to bring enforcement actions if they are the targets of unlawful collection efforts.and the act broad regulatory purpose is effectuated by measuring the lawfulness of a debt collector conduct not by its impact on the particular consumer who happens to bring a lawsuit,but rather on its likely effect on the most vulnerable consumers the hypothetical least sophisticated debtor in the marketplace.see,gonzales,at.in addition,b ecause the fdcpa is a remedial statute,it should be construed liberally in favor of the consumer.clark capital credit collection servs,cir quoting johnson riddle,cir omission in original.this rule of construction fortifies our conclusion that a consumer such as tourgeman,who did not actually receive a dunning letter directed toward him at the time it was sent,nonetheless may bring an action challenging the lawfulness of that letter under the act.
for these reasons,tourgeman has both article iii standing and a statutory cause of action under the fdcpa 
iii.claims under the fdcpa 
we turn now to the merits of tourgeman claims,which require that we determine whether the defendants communications were misleading under section of the fdcpa.although tourgeman levels the same basic charge against all defendants that his original creditor,cit online bank,was falsely identified to be american investment bank there are a few distinctions between the various challenged documents and these differences warrant dividing our separate discussion of them.we first address the paragon way letters,then the complaint drafted by nelson kennard and filed against tourgeman in california state court,and conclude with the letter sent by nelson kennard.we exercise de novo review over a grant or denial of summary judgment.evon,at.this court also reviews a district court interpretation of the fdcpa de novo.id.at.
the fdcpa comprehensively regulates the conduct of debt collectors,and is a strict liability statute.gonzales,at see also clark,at concluding that the fdcpa holds debt collectors strictly liable.section therefore broadly prohibits the use of any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.gonzales,at quoting.the section also provides a list of sixteen practices that violate this general prohibition tourgeman relies on three of the subsections a,proscribing the false representation of the character,amount,or legal status of any debt,prohibiting the false representation or implication that any individual is an attorney or that any communication is from an attorney and,forbidding the use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt.
in this circuit,a debt collector liability under of the fdcpa is an issue of law.gonzales,at.the analysis is objective and takes into account whether the least sophisticated debtor would likely be misled by a communication.id.quoting donohue quick collect,cir.the least sophisticated debtor standard is lower than simply examining whether particular language would deceive or mislead a reasonable debtor.id.quoting terran,at.most courts agree that although the least sophisticated debtor may be uninformed,naive,and gullible,nonetheless her interpretation of a collection notice can not be bizarre or unreasonable.evon,at.
in addition,i n assessing fdcpa liability,we are not concerned with mere technical falsehoods that mislead no one,but instead with genuinely misleading statements that may frustrate a consumer ability to intelligently choose his or her response.donohue,at.in other words,a debt collector false or misleading representation must be material in order for it to be actionable under the fdcpa.id.at.the purpose of the fdcpa,to provide information that helps consumers to choose intelligently,would not be furthered by creating liability as to immaterial information because by definition immaterial information neither contributes to that objective if the statement is correct nor undermines it if the statement is incorrect.id.quoting hahn triumph llc,cir.thus,false but representations are not likely to mislead the least sophisticated consumer and therefore are not actionable under section.id.
paragon way letters 
paragon way mailed three letters to tourgeman that falsely identified his original creditor as american investment bank,when in fact cit online bank originated his loan.the letters also displayed an original account that did not match tourgeman original cit loan number.the first two of these letters,however,did include a description line item that stated,dell computer corporation.the question presented is whether this combination of features in particular,the letters misidentification of tourgeman original creditor rendered these letters materially misleading under section 
tourgeman contends that these false statements could lead a consumer to reach any number of incorrect understandings about the nature of the predicament he or she faces.for example,the consumer might be concerned that the erroneous information is indicative of an attempted fraud.or the consumer might assume that because the letter seeks to collect a debt that evidently does not belong to him,the letter can safely be disregarded.alternatively,the consumer might be concerned that if he responds to the letter by paying the amount demanded,he will later receive another letter from a different debt collector attempting to collect the same debt.tourgeman contends that because each of these beliefs about the nature of the situation is just as reasonable as the one true understanding,he has been misled or deceived within the meaning of the act 
nelson kennard maintains that despite the erroneous identification of tourgeman original creditor,the references to dell in the first two paragon way letters were sufficient to tip off even the least sophisticated debtor about the subject matter of the collection effort.and a consumer genuinely puzzled by the mention of american investment bank,need only have picked up the phone to call for more information or to dispute the debt.thus,says nelson kennard,because the consumer ability to intelligently respond to the letters would not have been adversely affected by the incorrect information,the false statements were not material,and consequently paragon way did not violate the act.
in donohue,we held that a defendant mislabeling of a portion of a debt as interest of when in fact the sum included charges and interest did not violate section because the statement falsity did not undermine donohue ability to intelligently choose her action concerning her debt.id.at.we relied on the seventh circuit decision in hahn,which involved comparable facts.see at t he difference between principal and interest is no more important to the fair debt collection practices act than the color of the paper that the creditor used.see also wahl midland credit,cir plaintiff ca win simply by showing that the debt collector use of the term principal balance is false in a technical sense she has to show that it would mislead the unsophisticated consumer.
by contrast,in lox cda,cir,the court concluded that the statement that a tribunal could award attorneys fees payable by the consumer when,in fact,such an outcome was a legal impossibility was a material misrepresentation because,for the consumer who believed that were the case,such a fact would have undoubtedly been a factor in his process,and very well could have led to a decision to pay a debt that he would have preferred to contest.id.at.and the sixth circuit has held that a consumer allegations that she endured confusion and delay in trying to contact the proper party concerning payment on her loan and resolution of her problem,which allegedly was caused by the defendant false statement that a particular bank held her mortgage note,sufficiently stated a claim under the court fdcpa materiality standard.wallace.mut.bank,cir.
we are persuaded that,in the context of debt collection,the identity of a consumer original creditor is a critical piece of information,and therefore its false identification in a dunning letter would be likely to mislead some consumers in a material way.unlike mislabeling portions of a total debt as principal rather than interest literally false,but meaningful only to the hypertechnical reader,see wahl,at the factual errors in paragon way letters to tourgeman could easily cause the least sophisticated debtor to suffer a disadvantage in charting a course of action in response to the collection effort.see donohue,at a false statement violates the fdcpa if it may frustrate a consumer ability to intelligently choose his or her response 
the debtor who takes paragon way letters at face value either because he does not remember the details concerning his financing of a computer bought several years beforehand,or perhaps because he never knew the identity of his original creditor to begin with might engage in a fruitless attempt to investigate the facts of this debt,in a responsible effort to determine how to most effectively respond to the collection notice.this debtor might,quite reasonably,contact american investment bank to obtain background information so that he can remember what had earlier transpired,or to obtain any records that the bank holds pertaining to his debt so that he can prove he already had paid it off,if he believes such is the case.but,of course,american investment bank would have no record of a loan agreement and the unknown account number certainly is of no help in getting to the bottom of things.even if the consumer eventually finds his way to learning that the letter referred to the dell debt he had incurred with cit online bank,the delay already would have cost him some portion of the thirty days that the fdcpa grants to consumers before having to respond to a collection notice,lest the debt collector be entitled to assume the validity of the debt.see.and such confusion and delay in trying to contact the proper party concerning payment on the loan is precisely the kind of infringement of the consumer best interests that the fdcpa seeks to combat.wallace,at 
by ensuring that consumers are fully and truthfully apprised of the facts and of their rights,the fdcpa enables them to understand,make informed decisions about,and participate fully and meaningfully in the debt collection process.clark,at see also donohue,at the purpose of the fdcpa is to provide information that helps consumers to choose intelligently.quoting hahn,at paragon way false representations would likely mislead consumers in a manner that deprives them of their right to enjoy these benefits.we therefore hold that these letters contained materially misleading statements that trigger liability under section of the act.accordingly,the appellant is entitled to judgment on his claims against paragon way under subsections and e.
nelson kennard repeatedly suggests that a perplexed consumer could simply place a phone call to the debt collector to clear up any confusion.but for many consumers particularly those who do not even recognize that they have encountered false information making such a call likely would not be their first reaction to the letter,nor does the fdcpa require that it be so.as we have previously explained,consumers are under no obligation to seek explanation of confusing or misleading language in debt collection letters.gonzales,at citing fields wilber law firm,cir.indeed,nelson kennard argument,taken to its furthest reach,would transform many of the fdcpa substantive provisions into surplusage,converting any dunning letter bearing a return address and phone number into a communication not misleading by virtue of those features.see fields,at noting that the seventh circuit has rejected the proposition that a debt collector could provide incomplete information in a dunning letter so long as it provided a telephone number for the debtor to call.interpreting materiality in such a fashion would gut the fdcpa prohibition of misleading representations,and w e must avoid a construction which renders any language of the enactment superfluous.security pac.bank resolution trust,cir.
state court complaint 
we next address the complaint prepared by nelson kennard and filed against tourgeman in california state court,which nelson kennard delivered directly to tourgeman father,who then transmitted it to his son in mexico.tourgeman,wl,at,because the one material aspect of this complaint is the same as that which renders paragon way letters misleading namely,the inclusion of erroneous references to american investment bank the preceding discussion applies with equal force to this document.the complaint presented the information in a somewhat different format,however the body of the complaint twice referred to a loan agreement between american investment bank and tourgeman.attached to the complaint was a blank exemplar of such an agreement between the bank and a dell computer customer,which featured the logos of both american investment bank and dell.although the complaint lacked any reference to the erroneous account number,based on the reasoning of the preceding section of this opinion,we necessarily conclude that nelson kennard violated the act by transmitting this complaint to tourgeman.
furthermore,a consumer could be harmed by a complaint as opposed to a dunning letter in ways distinct yet equally problematic as those we have already discussed.for example,the consumer who engages legal counsel might be unable to accurately apprise the lawyer of the relevant circumstances,potentially leading to lost opportunities to settle the debt.and the stakes are undoubtedly higher when the consumer faces the possibility of a default judgment rather than the mere continuation of collection attempts.
nelson kennard letter 
finally,we come to the letter mailed to tourgeman by nelson kennard.that letter informed him that the firm client,collins financial services,ha d forwarded his account to this office with instructions that we take appropriate action to effect collection of the balances due.the nelson kennard letter did not mention dell.it did reference american investment bank,but,unlike the paragon way letters,it did not label the bank as tourgeman original creditor.rather,both the bank name and the same incorrect account number that appeared in paragon letters were placed in a re line item atop the body of the letter.there was no explanation as to the meaning or significance of these pieces of information.
nelson kennard argues that the absence of a label informing tourgeman that american investment bank was the original creditor somehow makes the letter less misleading than those sent by paragon way,because the original creditor was not misidentified.on the contrary,nelson kennard letter gives the least sophisticated debtor even less of a clue as to how to investigate the claim being made against him,making it more likely that the consumer will waste valuable time and suffer confusion in his efforts to formulate a response.nelson kennard also emphasizes that its letter does correctly identify tourgeman current creditor collins financial services but,in fact,the letter simply states that collins is the firm client.by contrast,paragon way letters clearly describe collins as tourgeman current creditor.because the nelson kennard letter does not describe who american investment bank purports to be,and as one can not assume that the least sophisticated debtor understands that the firm client collins financial services is the entity to whom he currently owes money,the consumer might very well think that the letter concerns a debt currently owned by american investment bank.such a misunderstanding could further impede the consumer ability to exercise his rights under the fdcpa.
nelson kennard also arg
