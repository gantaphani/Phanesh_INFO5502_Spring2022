background 
plaintiff michael ambers plaintiff filed an unverified class action complaint against defendant beverages more,bevmo seeking civil penalties for violation of section,which prohibits merchants from requesting or requiring and recording a consumer personal identifying information pii,such as an address and telephone number,during the course of a credit card purchase transaction.in his initial complaint,plaintiff alleged that he purchased alcohol online through bevmo website and elected to pick up his order at a bevmo store.plaintiff further alleged that providing his pii was a condition to completing the online purchase,that he provided bevmo with the required information,and that he completed the transaction,paying for the merchandise with his credit card.sometime thereafter,plaintiff went to a bevmo store,showed his identification and the credit card used to make the online purchase to a bevmo employee,and received his merchandise.
bevmo demurred to the complaint,arguing that under apple superior court cal th apple,section did not apply to an online purchase transaction in which pii is the only means to prevent fraud during the purchase.bevmo argued that plaintiff had alleged that his purchase was completed online,and that bevmo had no other means to prevent fraud in the transaction except by requesting pii.bevmo further argued that its pii request came within the exception set forth in subdivision c of section.
the trial court sustained the demurrer,concluding that section applied to the online purchase,and not the pickup of merchandise.the court granted plaintiff leave to amend,but advised plaintiff that the amended pleading would have to explain the allegation in the initial complaint that plaintiff had completed the transaction online.
plaintiff filed a first amended complaint,the operative pleading in this appeal,in which he alleged that bevmo online request for his pii violated section because that information was unnecessary to the completion of his store pick up transaction or to prevent fraud because he was required to show the store employee his photo identification and credit card before receiving his merchandise.plaintiff further alleged the transaction was not completed until he went to the bevmo store,showed the clerk both his photo identification and credit card,and physically received his merchandise.plaintiff argued that the purchase could not have been completed until he took physical possession of the merchandise because the merchandise was personal property to which a customer could not take title before physical possession a customer who failed to pick up merchandise after placing an online order would have his or her credit card with the purchase price and section prohibits the retailer from claiming that title to goods has passed when it in fact has not.
bevmo again demurred,arguing that plaintiff was bound by his prior admission that his purchase transaction was completed online because he failed to explain why the previous allegation was erroneous.bevmo further argued that under the terms and conditions of its website,the parties had agreed that title to merchandise purchased online transfers to the buyer at the time of purchase,and not when the buyer takes physical possession.bevmo asked the trial court to take judicial notice of bevmo web site terms and conditions of use.finally,bevmo argued that the transaction was exempt under section,subdivision c.
the trial court sustained the demurrer,after finding that plaintiff had failed,despite the court instruction to do so,to explain why he was not bound by his previous allegation that the transaction was completed during the online purchase.the court took judicial notice of the terms and conditions of use posted on bevmo website,which provide in relevant part when your order is approved by your credit card company,you own the goods.the trial court concluded that b ased on the facts alleged in the complaint,the applicable law and the facts judicially noted,under commercial code section,then,plaintiff owned the merchandise after he made his online payment.the court ruled that plaintiff failed to state a claim because,under apple,bevmo could collect pii without violating section.the trial court concluded that the terms and conditions of bevmo website clearly implicates the exception set forth in subdivision c of section to the statutory prohibition against collecting pii,and that plaintiff failed to explain why that exception did not apply.finally,the trial court found that plaintiff had failed to allege any facts showing that the amended complaint could be further amended to state a cause of action and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
this appeal followed.
