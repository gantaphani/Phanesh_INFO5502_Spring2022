former employees of chase investment securities now morgan securities,llc filed a putative class and collective action against morgan chase and chase investment services collectively,chase for violations of state and federal overtime laws.chase moved to compel arbitration pursuant to an arbitration clause in the plaintiffs employment contracts.the united states district court for the southern district of new york swain,denied the motion.the court interpreted the clause to cover only claims or controversies required to be arbitrated by the finra rules,ruled that it thus incorporated the arbitrability restrictions of the finra code of arbitration procedure for industry disputes finra rules,and applied the current version of finra rule,which prohibits arbitration of claims brought as putative class or collective actions.
on appeal,chase contends that the arbitration clause incorporates finra rules that govern arbitration procedure,but not rules like rule that govern the scope of arbitrable issues.chase argues that the district court erred by construing the arbitration clause to incorporate rule,and applying the amended version of rule in effect at the time of chase motion,rather than the earlier version that was in effect when plaintiffs entered into their contracts.we affirm.
background 
the following facts are drawn from plaintiffs first amended class action complaint,which we presume to be true at this juncture.see,dejesus hf mgmt,llc,cir.
chase employs financial advisors to sell financial products at its numerous branch locations chase classifies these employees as and does not pay them for hours worked in excess of forty per week.plaintiffs lawrence kaufmann,susan hyman,alan krichman,and jeffrey lammert,who were employed as financial advisors in new york and new jersey,contend that chase practices violate the overtime provisions of the new york labor law nyll,the new jersey state wage and hour law njswhl,and the fair labor standards act flsa.they plead nyll claims on behalf of a putative rule class of current and former financial advisors employed in new york njswhl claims on behalf of a putative rule class of current and former financial advisors employed in new jersey and flsa claims as part of a b collective action of current and former financial advisors employed nationwide 
chase is registered with finra,a organization that adopts and enforces rules for its member firms.see securities and exchange commission release.as licensed securities representatives employed by chase,plaintiffs registered with finra and executed the uniform application for securities industry registration or transfer form,under which they agreed to arbitrate any disputes with chase that are required to be arbitrated by the finra rules.
in addition to the form,plaintiffs executed an employment agreement the chase agreement that contains the following arbitration clause 
any claim or controversy concerning you arising out of or in connection with the business activities of chase,your activities your appointment as a registered representative or your employment the termination thereof required to be arbitrated by the finra rules shall be resolved by individual not class or collective arbitration in accordance with the code of arbitration procedure of the finra,and in accordance with applicable law further,no claims shall be arbitrated on a class or collective action or collective or basis.
emphases added.
the arbitration clause thus incorporates the finra rules,but with disputed effects.the issues are whether the clause incorporates finra rule at all,and whether the parties agreed to apply a the version of rule in effect at the time they entered into the chase agreement or b the current,amended version that took effect before chase filed its motion to compel.the earlier version refused finra arbitration of class action claims,while the current version refuses finra arbitration of collective action claims as well.the difference between the two versions is thus potentially decisive as to plaintiffs flsa claims,which are brought as a collective action.
at the time plaintiffs signed the chase agreement finra rule provided 
a class action claims may not be arbitrated under the code.
b any claim that is based upon the same facts and law,and involves the same defendants as in a class action or a putative class action,shall not be arbitrated under the code,unless the party bringing the claim files with finra a notice of or withdrawal from the class.
d a member or associated person may not enforce any arbitration agreement against a member of a certified or putative class action with respect to any claim that is the subject of the certified or putative class action until 
the class certification is denied 
the class is decertified 
the member of the certified or putative class is excluded from the class by the court or 
the member of the certified or putative class elects not to participate in the class or withdraws from the class according to conditions set by the court,if any.
this paragraph does not otherwise affect the enforceability of any rights under the code or any other agreement.
finra rule effective,to july,old rule.in,finra relabeled the existing sections and added a new one 
b collective actions 
collective action claims under the fair labor standards act may not be arbitrated under the code.
any claim that involves plaintiffs who are against the same defendants as in a collective action or a putative collective action,or that is ordered by a court for collective action at a forum not sponsored by a organization,shall not be arbitrated under the code,if the party bringing the claim has to the collective action.
a member or associated person may not enforce an agreement to arbitrate in this forum against a member of a certified or putative collective action with respect to any claim that is the subject of the certified or putative collective action until the collective action certification is denied or the collective action is decertified.
finra rule effective july,new rule.thus,following the amendment,neither class nor collective action claims can be arbitrated under the finra rules.
plaintiffs commenced suit on december.on january,chase moved to compel arbitration based on the chase agreement arbitration clause.the district court denied the motion,reasoning that the arbitration clause requires arbitration of only those claims required to be arbitrated under the finra rules and that,under new rule,plaintiffs claims can not be arbitrated.we affirm

a district court denial of a motion to compel arbitration is reviewed de novo.specht netscape commc ns,f d,cir.
under the federal arbitration act faa,a written provision in a contract to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable.in interpreting a validly formed arbitration agreement,we apply a presumption of arbitrability if the arbitration agreement is ambiguous about whether it covers the dispute at hand.granite rock int l of teamsters,see also goldman,sachs golden empire school fin,cir.
however,this policy favoring arbitration is merely an acknowledgment of the faa commitment to overrule the judiciary longstanding refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate and to place such agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.granite rock,at internal quotation marks omitted.construction of an arbitration agreement is a matter of contract interpretation,and as with any other contract,the parties intentions control.stolt nielsen animalfeeds int l,internal quotation marks omitted.
so if an arbitration clause is best construed to express the parties intent not to arbitrate certain disputes,that intent controls and can not be overridden by the presumption of arbitrability.granite rock,at see also allstate ins.mun,cir.the presumption is a soft one,and has effect only where it reflects,and derives its legitimacy from,a judicial conclusion that arbitration of a particular dispute is what the parties intended because their express agreement to arbitrate is best construed to encompass the dispute.granite rock,at emphasis added.the presumption may tip the scale if an agreement is truly ambiguous,see allstate,at,but it does not alter the controlling question is the arbitration agreement best construed to encompass the dispute 
citing cases from the supreme court and this circuit,chase urges that,under the presumption,an arbitration agreement must be interpreted to cover a dispute if the agreement is susceptible of such an interpretation,even if the contrary one may be considerably more plausible.chase further argues that the presumption of arbitrability can be rebutted only by positive assurances that a dispute is.
most of the cases on which chase relies were decided in the peculiar and exceptional context of collective bargaining agreements.see wright universal.serv,cautioning against extending positive assurances language in at t,commc ns workers of,to other contexts.moreover,every case cited by chase predates granite rock,which made clear that the presumption of arbitrability is a tool for resolving genuine ambiguity,not a bias in favor of arbitration.at.
we thus review the district court interpretation under granite rock does the chase agreement reflect the parties intent to arbitrate plaintiffs claims 
the disputed phrase in the arbitration clause is required to be arbitrated by the finra rules,and the principal interpretive issue is what words that phrase is intended to modify in the following sentence 
any claim or controversy concerning you arising out of or in connection with the business activities of chase,your activities your appointment as a registered representative or your employment the termination thereof required to be arbitrated by the finra rules shall be resolved by individual not class or collective arbitration in accordance with the code of arbitration procedure of the finra,and in accordance with applicable law.
emphasis added.
since class and collective action claims can not be arbitrated under new rule,the question becomes whether the phrase required to be arbitrated by the finra rules applies to the whole category of claims and controversies in which case plaintiffs claims can not be arbitrated,or only to claims arising out of plaintiffs employment in which case plaintiffs claims may be arbitrated as claims arising out of chase business activities or plaintiffs activities as registered representatives.
the district court held that the arbitration clause requires individual arbitration only to the extent such arbitration is required by the finra rules.since,as discussed,plaintiffs class and collective action claims are precluded from arbitration by finra rule,they fall outside the scope of the arbitration clause.we agree 
the arbitration clause begins with two nouns claim or controversy followed by three modifiers 
concerning you 
arising out of or in connection with the business activities of chase,your activities your appointment as a registered representative or your employment the termination thereof and 
required to be arbitrated by the finra rules.
the natural reading of this sentence is that each modifier modifies claim or controversy,so that only a claim or controversy that satisfies each of the three criteria shall be resolved by arbitration.
that reading is grammatically sound and makes substantive sense.the arbitration clause requires the whole category of claims arbitrable under the chase agreement to be arbitrated in accordance with the finra rules.it is therefore logical that the clause also incorporates the limitations of the finra rules as to the scope of arbitrable claims.if the universe of arbitrable claims consists solely of claims required to be arbitrated by the finra rules,then such claims may always be arbitrated in accordance with the finra rules.
chase competing interpretation is both ungrammatical and substantively flawed.chase argues that the absence of a comma before the phrase required to be arbitrated by the finra rules compels the conclusion that it modifies only the immediately preceding words,your employment the termination thereof.this result is required,chase argues,by the rule of the last antecedent,which provides that a limiting clause or phrase should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows,barnhart thomas.see also am.int l grp.bank of am,cir.
fastidious use of punctuation is a virtue in a drafter and often commands respect,but here,the absence of the comma does not support chase position.first,while the last antecedent rule can be useful,it is not an absolute and can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning.barnhart,at.second and more importantly,courts have applied the rule only when the last antecedent can grammatically be modified by the limiting phrase.hence,in barnhart,the supreme court read the phrase which exists in the national economy to modify the immediately preceding noun work.id.likewise,in united states kerley,we read the restrictive phrase pursuant to the law of a state or of an indian tribe as applicable only to the immediately preceding noun,administrative process,cir interpreting any amount determined under a court order or an order of an administrative process pursuant to the law of a state or of an indian tribe emphasis added.
in this case,the restrictive phrase required to be arbitrated by the finra rules follows two other restrictive phrases that unquestionably modify the only available antecedent claim or controversy.the phrase your employment the termination thereof is integral to the phrase arising out of your employment the termination thereof,which in turn modifies claim or controversy.the last antecedent rule does not apply because there is only one antecedent to which all of the modifiers must refer claim or controversy.
chase interpretation is also substantively flawed.as discussed,the arbitration clause unquestionably requires arbitrable claims to be resolved before finra and in accordance with the finra rules.but it is impossible to arbitrate plaintiffs class and collective action claims before finra,since new rule prevents finra arbitrators from entertaining class and collective action claims.see finra rule a the director of finra dispute resolution may decline to permit the use of the finra arbitration forum if the director determines that,given the purposes of finra and the intent of the code,the subject matter of the dispute is inappropriate.again,the district court reading obviates this interpretive problem if the only claims that are arbitrable under the chase agreement are those that are required to be arbitrated by the finra rules,then every arbitrable claim may be resolved by finra arbitrators.
that the arbitration clause calls for individual not class or collective arbitration does not assist chase.that language simply echoes new rule,which prohibits individual arbitration of claims that are the subject of putative class or collective actions,unless the party asserting those claims declines to proceed on a class or collective basis or the court decertifies or declines to certify the class or collective action new rule a,b.
finally,we are unpersuaded by chase argument that interpreting the arbitration clause to incorporate the finra rules would violate the interpretive canon against surplusage.it is true that plaintiffs separately signed form agreeing to arbitrate claims required to be arbitrated by the finra rules,but there is nothing unusual about an employer conforming its documents to requirements that already exist in standard finra forms.in any event,the surplusage canon does not apply because the chase agreement and form are not provisions of a single contract.int l multifoods commercial union ins,cir we disfavor contract interpretations that render provisions of a contract superfluous.
accordingly,we hold that the district court correctly interpreted the arbitration clause to require arbitration of only those claims required to be arbitrated by the finra rules.
we next consider whether the arbitration clause incorporates old rule which was effective when plaintiffs entered into the chase agreement or new rule which became effective prior to chase motion to compel and remains the current rule.the former b
