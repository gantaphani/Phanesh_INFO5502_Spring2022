lead plaintiff carl schwartz filed a putative federal securities class action against defendants arena pharmaceuticals,jack lief,dominic behan,william shanahan,and christen anderson in connection with public statements made about arena drug,lorcaserin.at various times,defendants all made positive public statements about lorcaserin safety and the likelihood of fda approval.on certain occasions,defendants claimed that lorcaserin was not carcinogenic and referred to supporting animal studies.when arena filed its application with the fda,the fda advisory panel published a briefing document that disclosed,for the first time,that arena had been in a highly unusual with the fda regarding the results of cancer studies on rats the rat study.for years,arena knew that the rats receiving lorcaserin were getting cancer.and the fda wanted evidence that it was not a threat to humans.the market was surprised by the undisclosed rat study,and arena stock dropped significantly.schwartz filed suit after news of the rat study broke.after further study,the fda ultimately signed off on lorcaserin,and the product is now on the market.
the district court dismissed the first,second,and proposed third amended complaints,holding that arena and the fda were engaged in a scientific dispute regarding the cause of the rat cancer and that,therefore,scienter was not adequately pleaded.schwartz filed this timely appeal.we conclude that schwartz has properly pleaded scienter,and we reverse.
background 
arena pharmaceuticals and lorcaserin 
arena is a company that developed and eventually marketed a drug called lorcaserin.lorcaserin is a serotonin agonist,and functions in some ways similar to the notorious drug,fen phen.given the disastrous health consequences of fen phen,the fda gives close scrutiny to serotonin agonists when it comes to potential cardiovascular problems,and lorcaserin safety was of obvious importance to investors for the same reason.prior to approving a drug,the fda requires extensive clinical studies testing on humans and nonclinical studies testing on animals and in labs.clinical testing is done in three phases.each phase of clinical testing attempts to gather more information on drug safety and efficacy in human subjects,and each phase requires a larger and larger population size.
between september and july,arena conducted two phase iii clinical tests with lorcaserin known as the bloom behavioral modification and lorcaserin for overweight and obesity management and blossom behavioral modification and lorcaserin second study for obesity management tests.they involved thousands of patients who used lorcaserin for up to two years.at the same time,arena was conducting the rat study a nonclinical study in which lorcaserin was given to lab rats to test lorcaserin carcinogenicity.the animal tests are run so that the fda can see whether there is a risk of humans developing cancer from the drug.if the rats develop cancer,the burden is then on the drug developer to show the fda that the carcinogenic mechanism is not relevant to humans.this is generally done in one of two ways a demonstrating that the biological mechanism causing the cancer is unique to rats or at least not present in humans,or b showing that there is a sufficiently large safety threshold to make risk to humans irrelevant,the dosage levels for rats is significantly higher than human dosages.
by february,the rat study initial results indicated that lorcaserin was causing mammary tumors,brain cancer,skin cancer,and nerve sheath cancer in the rats.in may,arena reported these results to the fda.arena believed that the cause of the carcinogenic mechanism was the hormone prolactin,a theory it deemed the prolactin hypothesis.prolactin is a hormone that has been linked to cancer in rats.the fda did not halt the clinical studies,but requested testing and updates on whether the rats taking lorcaserin experienced increased prolactin levels arena complied and submitted initial readings of the ongoing rat study.
in april,defendants shanahan,behan,and anderson sat down with the fda to discuss these and other matters.once again,the fda did not put the bloom and blossom studies on hold,instead insisting that arena submit a draft of the final rat study report as soon as possible.the fda permitted the human testing to continue because 
the updated informed consent forms included the nonclinical rat study findings it learned that drug exposure in rats was nearly twice as high as predicted,which increased the safety margin to clinical exposure preliminary data showed a modest increase in serum prolactin levels after a single dose in male rats it acknowledged that the interim tumor incidence data would change,might be less worrisome only with continued clinical study was it possible to assess whether dosing with lorcaserin increased serum prolactin levels in humans only with continuation of clinical dosing would it obtain an accurate assessment of lorcaserin efficacy and safety in diabetics and given that lorcaserin is,it believed that cancer risk was low under the conditions of use in the ongoing clinical trials 
in february,arena put together the final report,concluding that studies substantiated the connection between prolactin and the cancer.
on march,less than one month after arena put together the final rat study report for the fda,ceo jack lief told investors that arena was confident about lorcaserin approval.that confidence was based on the phase ii data,the phase i data,the preclinical studies that was sic done,and all the animal studies that have been completed.emphasis added.a may sec filing,signed by lief,similarly represented that the safety and efficacy of lorcaserin had been demonstrated,in part,through preclinical toxicity and carcinogenicity studies.these preclinical,animal studies are required to help us and regulatory authorities assess the potential risk that drug candidates may be toxic or cause cancer in humans.emphasis added.in a shareholder call on september,christen anderson,vice president of clinical development,represented that arena ha d favorable results on everything that we compiled so far.emphasis added.during a shareholder call on november,lief stated that at that time they ha d all of the data in hand that would be included in the application.emphasis added.arena chief scientific officer,dominic behan,told investors that a s you can see from the data,we believe that lorcaserin is a game changer.and when discussing the upcoming advisory committee meeting,arena chief medical officer,william shanahan,said,we not expecting any surprises associated with the panel.
in december,arena submitted its final application which included all study data and the rat study conclusions to the fda.the fda scheduled an advisory committee meeting to consider whether lorcaserin should be recommended for fda approval.in preparation for this meeting,arena hired gary williams,a toxicologist specializing in carcinogenicity to answer questions for the committee 
on september,the fda published arena and the fda briefing documents on the fda website.in its briefing documents,the fda disclosed the existence of the rat study and concerns about lorcaserin possible carcinogenicity for the first time.investors and analysts were caught off guard,surprised,and completely blindsided by the unforseen,un disclosed,significant concern about cancers in rats.arena stock took a plunge,declining in value by in a single day.
at a later meeting with the advisory committee,arena interpreted the data to support the safety of lorcaserin.arena explained that the rat study showed that a the dosage rates for rats getting cancer were times higher than human exposure,thus creating an acceptable safety margin,and b the timing of prolactin increases substantiated the prolactin hypothesis and that the amount of prolactin increase should not be the focus of the inquiry.
the fda advisory committee disagreed,initially.it believed that in order to prove the prolactin hypothesis,the studies needed to show robust and sustained increases in prolactin levels in the rats,which the data did not show.advisory committee members recognized that there was a difference of opinion among its members regarding how to translate the data to apply to humans,but ultimately voted to against recommending lorcaserin for approval.a month later,the fda denied the application and requested that arena provide further independent pathological review of the rat study.
an independent panel of pathologists later uniformly concluded that arena had overreported the incidents of tumors to the fda.moreover,after arena submitted a new application,the fda advisory committee found that there was a safety margin for the drug and that the prolactin hypothesis was a plausible explanation for the rat cancer.the fda approved lorcaserin in june,and it is currently on the market.
b.the suit 
after the fda posted the briefing documents online and arena stock plummeted,schwartz filed suit alleging violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of and sec rule.the district court dismissed the first amended complaint fac without prejudice for failure to plead scienter.the court first held that the fac failed to plead sufficient details permitting the court to infer that the defendants had knowledge about the rat study or the fda concerns.second,the court held that reading the fac holistically,it was more plausible that,assuming they did know about the results,the defendants reasonably believed the results to be positive and thus they did not act with deliberate recklessness regarding the omissions.
schwartz filed a second amended complaint sac in may,adding details regarding the defendants and their personal knowledge of the rat study and allegations from numerous confidential informants regarding arena financial health.the district court dismissed the sac,holding that the case boiled down to a scientific dispute between arena and the fda regarding the safety of lorcaserin.the court then invited a proposed third amended complaint tac to give schwartz the opportunity to plead facts to show this case to be about more than a difference of scientific opinion.
schwartz proffered a tac,but the district court denied leave to amend saying that amendment would be futile.in the district court view,the strongest inference from the alleged facts was that arena experienced an unexpected scientific disagreement with the fda,and that because there was a reasonable basis to believe that the data supported the prolactin hypothesis,the defendants did not make their omissions with scienter.schwartz filed a timely appeal 
ii.analysis 
schwartz theory is simple.at the same time defendants touted the safety and likely approval of lorcaserin,they referred to the animal studies supporting the fda application.but once they raised the animal studies,defendants were obligated to disclose the rat study existence to the market.failure to do so,in schwartz view,demonstrates scienter.recognizing that this is a close case,we agree.first,we set out the background legal principles governing private securities fraud claims.second,we apply these standards to conclude that schwartz has adequately alleged scienter.
background legal principles 
under section b of the securities exchange act of b and sec rule b schwartz must allege a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant scienter a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission economic loss and loss causation.lloyd cvb financial,cir.quoting erica john fund,halliburton,d.only scienter is at issue in this appeal.

rule b imposes a heightened pleading requirement,which requires that a party state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.elevator indus.pension fund verifone holdings,in re verifone holdings.sec.lit,cir.quoting fed.civ.b.under the rule,however,the heightened pleading standard only applies to the circumstances of the fraud and not to the defendant state of mind.esg capital partners,lp stratos,cir.the pslra,however,ups the ante by requiring that the complaint specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,and the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,verifone,at quoting b b alteration in original,and by requiring that the allegations give rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b a emphasis added.these heightened pleading requirements for securities fraud cases present no small hurdle for the securities fraud plaintiff.verifone,at.
schwartz burden,therefore,is to allege sufficiently particular facts to demonstrate a strong inference of scienter a mental state that not only covers intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud,matrixx initiatives,siracusano,d quoting tellabs,makor issues rights,d,but also deliberate recklessness,zucco,at quotation marks omitted we have defined deliberate recklessness as more than mere recklessness or a motive to commit fraud.id.emphasis added.instead,deliberate recklessness is an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it.id.emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted accord ottmann hanger orthopedic,cir.a complaint will survive,the supreme court has instructed,only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.tellabs,at.all in all,though not impossible,this is not an easy standard to comply with it was not intended to be and plaintiffs must be held to it.eminence capital,llc aspeon,cir.per curiam.
of particular importance to schwartz theory is the idea that the securities laws do not create an affirmative duty to disclose any and all material information.matrixx,at.instead,companies can control what they have to disclose under these provisions by controlling what they say to the market.id.at.but once defendants cho o se to tout positive information to the market,they are bound to do so in a manner that would mislead investors,including disclosing adverse information that cuts against the positive information.berson applied signal,cir.three cases are particularly relevant here matrixx,berson,and in re astrazeneca sec,d.
