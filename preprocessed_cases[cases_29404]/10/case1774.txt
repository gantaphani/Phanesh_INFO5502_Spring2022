plaintiff maurice dunbar,a grocery manager for defendant albertson,seeks overtime compensation and other relief on the theory that defendant erroneously classified him as an executive employee exempt from the overtime wage laws.he appeals from the order denying his motion for certification of a class of defendant grocery managers to pursue these same claims.he contends that the order must be reversed because the court failed to apply proper criteria,and neglected to perform necessary analysis,in deciding whether common questions were predominant in the case.we find no error in the court determination of the matter and affirm the order.
background 
defendant owns and operates approximately grocery stores in california.each store generally has a grocery manager,and a store director to whom the grocery manager reports the grocery manger is the second person in charge in the store.the putative class consists of approximately individuals who have worked as grocery managers for defendant since march.
in support of the motion for class certification,plaintiff filed among other things his declaration and virtually identical declarations of other grocery managers stating that the great majority of their work time was spent in the allegedly tasks of walking the floor to verify that inventory was properly stocked,stocking shelves,organizing the stock room,unloading new merchandise,responding to customer questions,cashiering,putting price tags on items,checking inventory,and doing routine paperwork.
in opposition,defendant lodged,inter alia,declarations of grocery managers,including a number of managers who had executed declarations for plaintiff,describing in varied terms their allegedly executive work at different stores,and excerpts from the depositions of some of plaintiff declarants.this evidence was accompanied by a chart outlining how the deposition testimony and differed from the declarations plaintiff submitted.defendant also presented statistics on the varying amounts of time plaintiff declarants spent working cash registers each week during the period from july through april.
in reply,plaintiff filed,inter alia,more grocery manager declarations,some identical to those originally filed but from different grocery managers,and others from plaintiff original declarants,explaining their declarations or deposition testimony submitted by defendant.
this evidence was synthesized in the points and authorities,where plaintiff took the position that common issues of the grocery managers different tasks were exempt or predominate,and defendant argued that individualized issues of liability and which tasks each manager performed and for how predominate,given the variation in the work of different managers.
hearing on the motion 
at the outset of the hearing on the motion,the court commented on the large volume of evidence submitted,and remarked that the case present ed a good illustration of the weighing process that the court necessarily must undertake in determining the commonality principles that apply in class certification.
plaintiff proposed handling the case in three phases,with class certification as phase one,categorization of tasks as exempt or as phase two,and individualized determinations of liability and damages as phase three.with respect to phase two,plaintiff presented a list of tasks allegedly constituting all of the work grocery managers performed.with respect to phase three,plaintiff suggested that individual issues could be effectively managed with the use of exemplar plaintiffs,survey results,subclassing,or special masters.
defendant noted that the analysis of whether common issues predominate over individualized issues is a comparative one,observed that the court would have to weigh the evidence,assess credibility,and determine based on the record which issues predominated,and argued that its evidence could be credited over that of plaintiff in evaluating the extent to which the claims of the putative class were susceptible of common proof.defendant submitted that,compared to the individual liability and damage issues,the common classification issues could be resolved relatively easily,and partially through stipulation.defendant argued that the individual issues could not be resolved with exemplar plaintiffs or survey results,and that plaintiff had not met his burden of showing how such issues could be effectively managed.
order on the motion 
the court filed a order denying the motion.in it,the court concluded that many of the conditions for class certification were met,but that common issues did not predominate,and that a class action was not the superior means of resolving the litigation.on the latter point,the court reasoned that class members were reasonably likely to prosecute their individual claims,that a class action was not necessary to deter and redress the alleged wrongdoing,and that there were alternative procedures for handling the controversy,including administrative adjudication.the court thought that the different factual circumstances of the absent class members in this case will require their active participation in the resolution of their claims.
with respect to commonality,the court wrote 
class certification is determined with reference to each claim asserted and commonality is determined in the context of the claims asserted.hicks kaufman broad home th,fn,d.the allegedly common inquiry in this case is whether the class members fall within the executive exemption under wage order.title regs.a e states,the work actually performed by the employee during the course of the workweek must,first and foremost,be examined and the amount of time the employee spends on such work,together with the employer realistic expectations and the realistic requirements of the job,shall be considered in determining whether the employee satisfies this requirement.under california law,the court must determine whether any given class member or all the class members spend more than of their time on managerial tasks in any given workweek.ramirez yosemite water cal th,d.because the regulation references the work actually performed by the employee during the course of the workweek,the court is inclined to hold that employees exempt or status can vary on a week by week basis.counts gas cir reference in regulations to workweek suggests that classification is examined on a week to week basis.
plaintiff asserts that common issues of fact predominate because each class member had the same job title,the same job description,performed the same duties,and was required to follow the same policies and procedures.plaintiff argues that the classification of grocery managers as executive positions reflects a single policy decision that affects hundreds of employees,and employees should be able to contest it in a single action.drug stores,superior court cal th,d,evidence of a standardized or uniform policy or practice may justify class certification.plaintiff has also submitted declaration and deposition testimony from individuals indicating that the putative class members performed common tasks.
defendant contends that the job titles and descriptions are essentially irrelevant to the court inquiry because the court is required to make an individualized factual inquiry into how each class member actually spent his or her time.defendant asserts that the grocery manager training is not uniform and that store operations vary depending on the size,hours,and location of the stores.defendant represents that the proportion of time spent on the grocery managers various tasks depends upon factors such as store size,the number and type of peripheral departments florist,photo processing lab,bakery,starbucks,butcher shop,the demographic makeup of the local community,the incidence of criminal activity in the surrounding neighborhood,and the store director personal management style the store director is the grocery manager immediate superior and the person primarily responsible for a given store location.defendant also argues that the gm is second in command after the store manager and that the responsibilities of each gm will vary depending on his or her relationship with the store manager.
plaintiff has not demonstrated that common issues predominate.
first,although defendant has made a single policy decision to classify hundreds of gms as exempt,that single policy decision may be improper as to some putative class members but proper as to others.morisky public serv.gas.therefore,although the evidence of a standardized or uniform policy or practice can support class certification it does not compel class certification.
the court has considered other situations where a single allegedly wrongful action has different effects on different persons so that some have claims and some do not.in such cases,the courts will generally certify a class if the defendant action can be found to be wrong in the abstract even if no individual person has been damaged.massachusetts mutual life ins.superior court th,d misrepresentations,reyes board of supervisors d.erroneous interpretation of legislation,custom kitchen,d.antitrust violations.these situations are distinguishable from situations where the court can not determine the wrongfulness of an action without reference to individuals.mccullah southern cal.gas th,d class treatment not appropriate for challenging whether employment policy was discriminatory to disabled individuals kennedy baxter healthcare th,d class treatment not proper for claims that latex gloves caused injuries to certain persons.
in this case,the court can not determine whether defendant policy of designating gms as exempt is unlawful in the abstract.if the court found that the policies were appropriate as applied to of the gms and inappropriate with respect to the remaining,that finding would not permit the conclusion that the policies are unlawful.the hypothetical finding would indicate the policies are applied to too many employees and lead the court to visit the issue of ascertaining which employees are in the that should be in the class and which are in the that should not be in the class.therefore,plaintiff can not meet the commonality requirement by simply making reference to the common policy.
second,as a general proposition,in determining whether an employee is exempt or,the court should engage in a fact specific inquiry rather than simply review the job description.ramirez yosemite water,supra,cal th,d.see also nordquist broadcasting th,d television station sports director held to be a employee entitled to overtime pay even though in a different action a federal court had held that the plaintiff successor in the exact same job was an exempt employee.therefore,the court focuses on the evidence concerning the actual experiences of the class members rather than on the formal job descriptions and policies.
third,the court has considered the only contemporaneous time records that bear on the commonality records concerning when gms were operating cash registers 
the information shows that in a week period a class member worked the cash register significantly more or less in different weeks he worked more than hours per week for of the weeks and less than hours per week for of the weeks.this suggests that the work of that gm varied significantly on a week to week basis.the court is inclined to presume that the work of other gms varied in a similar manner.
fourth,the court has reviewed the declarations and depositions at some length.this is a fact intensive review.plaintiff presented approximately declarations of gms,each of which states that the declarant routinely spent over of his or her time on functions.defendant presented declarations from a similar number of gms including from some of the same gms,most of which state that the declarant work varied by work location and time of year,and that the declarant spent most of his or her time on exempt functions.this record requires the court to weigh the evidence.
in weighing the evidence,the court is not evaluating whether the claims asserted are legally or factually meritorious.linder thrifty oil cal th,d.the court is evaluating only whether common issues predominate.the court gives the greatest weight to deposition testimony because it reflects a witness actual testimony on cross examination and unlike declarations and interrogatory responses can not be scripted by counsel.plaintiff declarations are general in nature and may be tainted by hostility to defendant.evidence code section.the court has considered the role plaintiff counsel played in drafting the declarations.the court has not drawn any adverse inferences because plaintiff may have prior and arguably more detailed declarations from the witnesses that plaintiff elected not to use in this motion.counsel can determine the contents of the direct testimony that they present to the court.defendant proffered declarations are more factually detailed and individualized,but may be tainted by bias because many declarants are current employees.the court has also considered the role that defendant counsel played in drafting those declarations and presenting them to the witnesses.the court has not based its decision in the volume of declarations submitted.evidence code section.
the court finds that the deposition testimony of many witnesses suggests that the work of many gms varied significantly.the declarations submitted by defendant demonstrate similar variety in the work performed by different gms.these depositions and declarations are credible and suggest that the work performed by the gms varied significantly from store to store and week to week.
fifth,the court has considered the argument of plaintiff that all the gms performed the same tasks and that the determination of whether a task is managerial will be a common issue.it is true that there is a common issue whether stocking shelves and running cash registers are managerial tasks,but that is not the central focus of the commonality inquiry.if that were the inquiry,then the class could include employees at albertson,safeway,andronico and every other grocery chain and perhaps every retailer.the court is focusing on whether the work performed by any one gm is so similar to the work performed by any other gm that the court can reasonably extrapolate findings from the named plaintiff to the absent class members.
the court has considered that a class can be certified where each class member must establish the amount of his or her damages.this is not such a situation,because here each class member would need to establish entitlement to damages as well as the amount of damages.
based on its review and weighing of the evidence,the court finds that plaintiff ha s not demonstrated the commonality required for class certification.in particular,the court has relied on the deposition and declaration testimony indicating that the work performed by the gms varied significantly from store to store and week to week.
ii.discussion 
code of civil procedure section authorizes class actions when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court the party seeking certification has the burden to establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among class members.citations.the community of interest requirement embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.citation.
a trial court ruling on a certification motion determines whether the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.citations.
we review the trial court ruling for abuse of discretion.because trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action,they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification accordingly,a trial court ruling supported by substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous le
