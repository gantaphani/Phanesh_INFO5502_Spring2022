this is the latest appeal growing out of the nearly old,racial discrimination in employment lawsuit involving the alabama department of transportation aldot and the state personnel department spd.those two state agencies were sued in by what became two plaintiff classes of black employees and prospective employees.a partial settlement was reached and a consent decree was entered in,but instead of ending the case the decree became a platform for additional litigation.
a more detailed history of the case can be found in our six other published opinions involving it.see reynolds mcinnes,wl cir.july,reynolds v reynolds butts,cir reynolds iv davis butts,cir reynolds roberts,cir reynolds iii,cert.denied,d reynolds roberts,cir reynolds ii,cert.denied,d reynolds roberts,cir reynolds i.we wo repeat any more of that history than is necessary for an understanding of the issue before us in this appeal.
the issue is whether the district court abused its discretion when it modified one part of one article of the consent decree at the defendants request and over the objection of the plaintiffs.insisting that it did,the plaintiffs have appealed.concluding that it did not,we affirm.
the consent decree,aimed at ending racial discrimination in aldot employment practices,has articles.this appeal is about article two,which governs the development and use of minimum qualifications mqs,which are part of the selection procedure for hiring and promoting employees in aldot jobs.a job seeker wanting to sit for an employment examination must meet the mqs first.mqs are designed to screen for skills needed at entry into a new position,and can screen for,among other things,knowledge,skills and abilities ksas relevant to a position.the job examinations themselves measure ksas.
the provision of article two that was modified by the district court is,which is called the provision.this is what the paragraph says 
minimum qualifications will not be utilized on examination announcements or to preclude an applicant from examination unless the minimum qualification bears a manifest relationship to skills,knowledges,or abilities necessary to the performance of the job at entry without a brief orientation period and such skills,knowledges or abilities are not addressed in the examination process.
the key point for our purposes is that the skills,knowledges,or abilities to which the mqs must bear a manifest relationship can not be ones addressed in the examination process.before getting into the reasons that the provision is problematic,we need to explain some more about the job selection procedures process that is required by the decree.
other portions of article two incorporate the federal uniform guidelines on employee selection procedures,uniform guidelines,and require spd to meet the uniform guidelines in developing mqs.article two,allows for the use of mqs that have been determined to be valid within the meaning of the uniform guidelines.to establish that a job selection procedure is valid an employer must demonstrate that the selection procedure is appropriately.under the uniform guidelines,a job selection procedure may be validated through the use of one of three different types of studies content validity,validity,and construct validity.id.a.
of those three types of validation methods,the parties chose content validation for mqs.they wrote that choice into article two,which specifies use of a content validation procedure to determine the appropriate minimum qualifications for aldot jobs.a content validity study measures whether and to what extent the selection procedure is representative of important aspects of performance on the job for which the candidates are to be evaluated.id.b.it measures knowledge,skills,or abilities that are necessary prerequisite s for the performance of critical or important work behavior s for the job.id.c.the guidelines provide that a selection procedure may be used if it represents a critical work behavior,a behavior which is necessary for performance of the job or work behaviors which constitute most of the important parts of the job.c.under a criticality approach to content validation,an approach the plaintiffs advance as one that would be valid under the uniform guidelines and comply with the decree,mqs could be based on a small number of critical ksas instead of most of the ksas.
in order to construct content valid mqs and a valid examination under the uniform guidelines,a detailed job analysis must be performed for each job classification and must focus on the work behaviors necessary for successful performance of the job and also on the tasks associated with those behaviors.id.c.each job analysis conducted by spd for aldot included interviews with incumbents in the jobs or their supervisors,upon whom were bestowed the laudatory label subject matter experts.article two,also provides that the mqs and the validation procedure will be subject to challenge by plaintiffs and no new minimum qualifications will be implemented without approval by the plaintiffs or the court.
having finished our description of the job selection procedures in general,we focus again on the article two,the provision.it is important to say at the outset what all the experts for both sides agreed upon at the hearing in this case the provision is novel in the field of employment testing.there has been a whole lot of employment testing in this country over the years,but there is nothing in the record indicating that the provision,variously described as novel and unusual,has ever been used anywhere before.nonetheless,for several years after the consent decree was adopted,a joint panel of selected by the plaintiffs and two selected by the to develop mqs and job examinations for aldot jobs that would comply with the provision.
the plaintiffs and defendants experts initially agreed to develop mqs,which would evaluate a job candidate experience in performing the discrete tasks required at entry into a new position.they reasoned that measuring experience with certain tasks,instead of typical ksas,would provide the most valid mqs while avoiding overlap between the ksas used in the mqs and those measured by the examinations.however,problems resulted from use of the mqs,including a higher rejection rate of applicants than expected and a high rate of adverse impact,meaning that the pass rate of black applicants was significantly lower than that of white applicants.
spd then tried a different approach,using another mqs screen as an alternative to the existing one that had not worked.the new mqs screen was a more traditional one which included an educational requirement and an experience requirement.that approach did not work either.none of the parties was satisfied with the resulting mqs that were in place in.
by the summer of,spd and its experts decided to strike out on their own to develop new mqs for some of the job classifications,beginning with the job of civil engineer manager.the experts used by spd looked at job analysis reports that had already been developed for the jobs,selected subject matter experts,conducted mqs development sessions where a group of subject matter experts were brought together to help determine the types of mqs to use,and they looked for some consensus about potential mqs.then,the experts linked the mqs to the ksas in order to ensure that they were actually related to each other as required under article two,of the consent decree.despite all their efforts,the experts were unable to design any method for developing valid mqs that would comply with the provision.
on december,the defendants moved to modify the consent decree by removing the provision of article two,on the ground that the provision is contrary to accepted professional practice in the development of selection procedures,and it can not reasonably be satisfied.by that point,the defendants had developed mqs for two engineer manager and senior right of way the job examination for civil engineer manager had been administered to applicants who had gotten past the mqs screen.with the parties consent,the district court appointed a special master to consider the issue and make recommendations to the court.
after conducting a hearing,the special master made detailed findings.the gist of them is that the defendants had made reasonable,good faith efforts to comply with the provision,but those efforts had been unsuccessful because the provision is unworkable across all job classification s.the special master recommended to the district court that it find the defendants had satisfied the requirements for modification of a consent decree as set out by the supreme court in rufo inmates of suffolk county jail,d.
the district court adopted the special master recommendation and granted the defendants motion in part.the court ruled that the defendants may develop and use minimum qualifications mqs for those classifications for which examinations have already been developed.the effect of the ruling is to modify the consent decree by making the provision of article two,inapplicable to the fifteen job classifications for which the defendants had developed examinations at the time of the ruling.the district court explained that the defendants had made a good faith effort to comply with the provision without success,and it is simply time to proceed with the development of the mqs without the provision.
with respect to the other job classifications,the ones for which the defendants had not developed examinations at the time of the ruling,the district court referred the matter back to the special master.it directed him to determine whether for those remaining classifications it is still possible to comply with the provision without unreasonable delay in the development and administering of the examinations.as recently as the oral argument of this case in june of this year,those proceedings were still ongoing before the special master.
for modification purposes,a consent decree is not treated as a contract,but as a judicial act akin to an injunction.rufo,at.at united states swift.jacksonville branch,naacp duval county sch,cir.partly because of that,we review a district court decision granting a party request for modification of a consent decree only for an abuse of discretion.sierra club meiburg,cir jacksonville branch,at.findings of fact relating to the modification are reviewed only for clear error.jacksonville branch,at.
rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure allows a district court to modify a consent decree when it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.fed.civ.pro.b rufo,at.at.the standard for modification of a consent decree in an institutional reform case is a flexible one,because flexibility is often essential to achieving the goals of institutional reform litigation.rufo,at.at.flexibility in modifying decrees like this one is in the public interest,because such decrees reach beyond the parties involved directly in the suit and impact on the public right to the sound and efficient operation of its institutions.id.at.at internal marks and citation omitted.the need for modification of a consent decree and the importance of flexibility in regard to it can be especially apparent in an institutional reform case like this one where efforts to implement the decree have been bogged down for years,see generally reynolds mcinnes,wl cir.july,reynolds v.
a court faced with a motion to modify a consent decree in institutional reform litigation must begin by determining the basic purpose of the decree.united states city of miami,cir.if the provision that a party seeks to modify is central to the decree,or the most important element of the decree,then the modification is likely to violate the basic purpose of the decree and,therefore,will be forbidden.id.at.however,if the provision for which modification is sought merely sets out one of several means of accomplishing the purpose of the decree or one of several means of measuring compliance with the decree objective,then the requested modification is not necessarily prohibited.id.at.
if modification is permissible under those criteria,the court must decide whether to exercise its discretion to modify the decree.the supreme court has articulated a test for determining when a consent decree should be modified.first,a party seeking modification of a consent decree bears the burden of establishing that a significant change in circumstances warrants revision of the decree.rufo,at.at.a party may meet its initial burden by showing a significant change either in factual conditions or in law.id.at.at.second,the proposed modifications must be suitably tailored to address the new factual or legal environment.id.the plaintiffs do not contest that the second rufo requirement has been met,only the first one.
rufo first requirement,that there be changed factual or legal circumstances,is interpreted flexibly,and different sorts of factual changes may qualify as changed circumstances permitting modification.ensley branch,naacp seibels,cir.the rufo court observed that modification based on factual change may be appropriate in any of at least three situations when changed factual conditions have made compliance with the decree substantially more onerous when a decree proves to be unworkable because of unforeseen obstacles and when enforcement of the decree without modification would be detrimental to the public interest.at.at citations omitted.
we have explained that modification also may be appropriate when significant time has passed and the objectives of the original agreement have not been met despite the defendants efforts,or when a continuation of the decree would be inequitable.jacksonville branch,at citing rufo,at.at newman graddick,cir.see also heath decourcy,cir institutional reform consent decrees are subject to a lesser standard of modification,requiring the lower court to identify a defect or deficiency in its original decree which impedes achieving its goal,either because experience has proven it less effective,disadvantageous,or because circumstances and conditions have changed which warrant the decree.internal quotations and citation omitted.we have also said that a district court has broad discretion to modify an existing injunctive order when factual circumstances have changed or new ones have arisen since the order was issued,as long as notice and an opportunity to be heard are provided before the modification is made.riccard prudential ins,cir.
with those principles in mind,we turn now to the plaintiffs contentions in this case.the first one is that modification of the provision was impermissible because that provision is one of the consent decree basic purpose s.city of miami,at.the short answer is that it is not.
the consent decree itself provides that its intent and purpose is to undo the effects of the past practices which have been the subject of this case and d ecree and to prevent further practices which may perpetuate such efforts or otherwise discriminate against the plaintiffs or the class they represent.the decree accomplishes this purpose through articles that require changes in the way the defendants hire,promote,classify,and pay aldot employees.reynolds ii,at.the provision is only one part of one of those articles,and it is by no means central to the decree.
the provision is not the only provision that addresses the development of mqs.it is part of article two,which also provides for mqs in two other ways by requiring also in the mqs to bear a manifest relationship to the ksas necessary to perform a particular job at entry,and by requiring in and the procedure for determining mqs be valid within the meaning of the uniform guidelines.not only that,but beyond article two there are other provisions in the decree that seek to prevent discriminatory procedures at the hiring stage.for example,article three,a requires that spd use only selection criteria and procedures that have been validated in accordance with the uniform guidelines.and article eight,requires aldot to develop and use interview questions.
the plaintiffs contend that because the provision is the only provision aimed at eliminating the overlap of ksas between mqs and examinations,it is the only provision that will save from early elimination some members of the plaintiff class.but so
