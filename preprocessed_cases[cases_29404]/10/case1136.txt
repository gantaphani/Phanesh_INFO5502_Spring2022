in this appeal,we consider whether the district court erred in dismissing the plaintiffs state law claims for unpaid wages because those claims would be certified using different class certification procedures than their federal wage and hour claims.we also consider whether the plaintiffs have alleged plausible claims for unpaid wages under federal and nevada law for undergoing a security screening meant to prevent employee theft and for unpaid lunch periods shortened by walks to the cafeteria.we affirm the district court in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
plaintiffs jesse busk and laurie castro are former employees of integrity staffing solutions,which provides warehouse space and staffing to clients such as busk and castro worked as hourly employees at warehouses in las vegas and fernley,nevada,respectively,filling orders placed by customers.in,busk and castro sued integrity on behalf of a putative class of workers in both warehouses,claiming violations of the fair labor standards act flsa and nevada labor laws.
busk and castro alleged integrity violated federal and state labor laws by requiring them to pass through a security clearance at the end of each shift,for which they were not compensated.employees waited up to minutes to be searched removed their wallets,keys,and belts and passed through metal detectors.the plaintiffs alleged the clearances were necessary to the employer task of minimizing shrinkage or loss of product from warehouse theft.
the plaintiffs also sought compensation under flsa and nevada law for their entire minute unpaid lunch periods because they spent up to minutes of the meal period walking to and from the cafeteria undergoing security clearances.they said it took them about five minutes after punching out to walk to the facility cafeteria pass through security clearances and approximately five minutes to walk from the cafeteria to the time keeping system to clock back in.additionally,managers would frequently remind workers to finish their meal period quickly so that they would clock back in on time.
the district court granted integrity motion to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b.the court held that the time spent clearing security was not compensable under flsa,relying on cases finding the time employees spent passing through security screenings noncompensable.the court also held that the plaintiffs allegations about shortened meal periods did not state a claim under flsa because the plaintiffs did not allege that they performed any duty related to their job as warehouse workers during their lunch breaks.
the district court also held that the state law claims must be dismissed due to conflicting class certification mechanisms,namely that while plaintiffs must opt into a collective action under flsa,plaintiffs must opt out of a class action under federal rule of civil procedure.alternatively,the court dismissed the state claims on the merits.it held that since the claims were based entirely on the security clearance and lunch allegations,the plaintiffs have failed to allege fact scenarios that would support a valid claim under nevada law.
we review de novo the district court conclusion that a flsa collective action and state law class action are inherently incompatible as a matter of law.see miranda anchondo,cir questions of statutory construction and interpretation reviewed de novo.we agree with all other circuits to consider the issue that such actions can peacefully coexist.therefore,the district court erred in dismissing the state law claims based on a perceived conflict.
under flsa,a potential plaintiff does not benefit from and is not bound by a judgment unless he or she affirmatively opts in to the lawsuit.kinney shoe vorhes,cir,overruled on other grounds by hoffman la roche sperling,d see also b no employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.this rule is in contrast to a typical rule class action,where a potential plaintiff must opt out to be excluded from the class.see.c b v the court will exclude from the class any member who requests exclusion.although some district courts have held that a flsa collective action can not be brought in the same lawsuit as a class action based on the same underlying allegations all circuit courts to consider the issue have held that the different opting mechanisms do not require dismissal of the state claims.knepper rite aid,cir ervin os rest,cir shahriar smith wollensky rest,cir lindsay gov t emps.ins.
our sister circuits have correctly reasoned that flsa plain text does not suggest that a district court must dismiss a state law claim that would be certified using an procedure.its requirement extends only to any such action that is,a flsa claim.see b knepper,at noting section b explicitly limits its scope to the provisions of the flsa,and does not address relief ervin,at nothing about flsa text suggests that the flsa is not amenable to claims for related relief in the same federal proceeding.flsa also expressly permits more protective state labor laws.see a no provision of this chapter shall excuse noncompliance with any federal or state law or municipal ordinance establishing a minimum wage higher than the minimum wage established under this chapter or a maximum work week lower than the maximum workweek established under this chapter.this savings clause provides further evidence that a federal lawsuit combining state and federal wage and hour claims is consistent with flsa.see ervin,at shahriar,at.
nor does the legislative history of section b support the view of some district courts that allowing both actions to proceed simultaneously would essentially nullify congress intent in crafting section b and eviscerate the purpose of section b requirement.otto pocono health,d,overruled by knepper,at.we agree with the third circuit that the full legislative record casts doubt on the contention that section b was intended to eliminate class actions.knepper,at see also ervin,at shahriar,at.when congress created section b requirement as part of the portal to portal act of,it was responding to concerns about third parties filing representative flsa actions on behalf of disinterested employees.see hoffman la roche,at.accordingly,it amended flsa for the purpose of limiting private flsa plaintiffs to employees who asserted claims in their own right and freeing employers of the burden of representative actions.see id.
this purpose does not evince an intent to eliminate class actions for state wage and hour claims brought in federal court.even if it did,congress has expressed a contrary intent in the class action fairness act of,which confers federal jurisdiction over class actions where certain diversity and requirements are met.see class action fairness act of,stat.because the class action fairness act provides that federal courts should exercise jurisdiction over certain class actions including those alleging violations of state wage and hour laws,and these class actions are certified pursuant to rule procedure,we can not conclude that congress intended such claims be dismissed simply because they were brought in conjunction with flsa claims 
integrity argues that allowing both classes to proceed simultaneously would cause unnecessary confusion for potential class members who would receive notices stating both that they must opt in to have their compensation issues adjudicated and that they must opt out to avoid having their compensation issues adjudicated.while we do not minimize this practical concern,we agree with the seventh circuit that district courts should be able to work out an adequate notice in this type of case.ervin,at.furthermore,if these actions were to proceed separately the flsa in federal court and the class action in state court an entirely different and potentially worse problem of confusion would arise,with uncoordinated notices from separate courts peppering the employees.id.
in sum,we agree with the other circuits to consider
