cynthia parris and willie lopez filed a lawsuit on their own behalf and on behalf of all similarly situated against lowe,alleging violations of california wage and hour laws regarding overtime compensation.parris and lopez thereafter moved a for leave to communicate with potential class members prior to class certification and for approval of the content of their proposed communication and b to compel discovery of the names and addresses of potential class members.the trial court denied both motions.parris and lopez petitioned this court for a writ of mandate directing the trial court to reverse its orders,and we issued an order to show cause.
precertification communication with potential class members,like communication,is constitutionally protected speech.a blanket requirement of judicial approval for such communications would constitute an impermissible prior restraint on speech.accordingly,parris and lopez motion for judicial approval of their proposed communications was unnecessary and the trial court should have dismissed the motion on that ground,rather than denying it.the trial court also erred in denying parris and lopez discovery motion without expressly weighing the actual or potential abuse of the class action procedure that might be caused by permitting the discovery,on the one hand,against the rights of the parties,on the other hand.we therefore remand for a new hearing on that motion.
factual and procedural background 
in their complaint,filed on october,parris and lopez allege causes of action for failure to pay overtime compensation and compensation at time of termination in violation of the labor code,declaratory relief,an accounting,injunctive relief and unfair competition.the two named plaintiffs purport to represent the class of all persons who are,or have been,employed by defendant lowe,inc in the capacity as department managers,customer service pros,customer service specialists and customer service representatives in any of lowe home improvement centers located in the state of california.the complaint alleges it has been the business practice of lowe to require all members of the plaintiff class to complete more assignments than can be accomplished in the time allocated in their shifts.employees failing to complete their assignment,clock out but continue to work off the clock until they have completed their assignments.the putative class has not yet been certified.
parris and lopez moved in the trial court for an order permitting precertification notice to potential class members and for approval of the proposed notice and method of dissemination.the proposed notice,which was attached to the moving papers,contains the following information a class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of current and former lowe employees alleging lowe has failed to pay overtime compensation to certain of its hourly employees a three paragraph description of plaintiffs contentions and a one paragraph summary of lowe defense are also included individuals who worked for lowe at any time since october,in an hourly position may be members of the proposed class the attorneys for the plaintiffs in the lawsuit who are identified in the proposed notice wish to gather information from the recipients of the notice regarding the nature of their work at lowe,including any overtime they may have worked recipients of the notice are under no obligation to contact plaintiffs counsel the attorneys for lowe who are also identified in the proposed notice or other representatives of lowe may also wish to discuss the case recipients of the notice are under no obligation to provide information or to discuss the matter with attorneys for lowe or with any supervisor or manager at lowe y our employer may not retaliate against you in any manner for refusing to provide information and further information regarding the lawsuit is available at,a website set up by plaintiffs counsel.
in support of their motion,parris and lopez relied on atari,superior court d.atari,which held precertification communication with potential class members is appropriate,with prior court approval,in the absence of a showing of actual or threatened abuse of the class action process.parris and lopez also moved to compel responses to interrogatories they had previously served,seeking the names and addresses of current and former lowe employees,potential class members who were to be the recipients of the proposed notice.
lowe opposed the motions,arguing parris and lopez had not established a legitimate precertification need to communicate with potential class members or to discover their identities and personal information.lowe also opposed the motion to compel on procedural grounds.
after extensive briefing and a combined hearing on the two motions the trial court issued a minute order denying both motions without explanation or comment.parris and lopez filed a petition for writ of mandate on january.we issued an order to show cause on january.briefing was completed on april.at our request the parties have submitted supplemental letter briefs addressing whether precertification communications with potential class members constitutes speech protected by the first amendment for which no prior court approval is necessary,consistent with federal and state constitutional restrictions on prior restraints of speech.
discussion 
precertification communication with potential class members is speech protected by the first amendment and the california constitution and requires no prior court approval general free speech principles i.the first amendment 
a s a general matter,the first amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its meaning,its ideas,its subject matter,or its content.bolger youngs drug products,d bolger.for noncommercial speech entitled to full first amendment protection,a regulation is valid under the first amendment only if it can withstand strict scrutiny,which requires that the regulation be narrowly tailored that is,the least restrictive means to promote a compelling government interest.citations.kasky nike,cal th,d.
the preferred place of freedom of speech in the pantheon of constitutional values can not be overstated the right to freedom of speech is one of the cornerstones of our society.hurvitz hoefflin th,d.uninhibited speech is more than it is the essence of.garrison louisiana,d.
under the first amendment,however,commercial speech enjoys a more limited degree of protection.t he federal constitution accords less protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally safeguarded forms of expression.bolger,supra,at.lawyer advertising falls in the category of constitutionally protected commercial speech.bates state bar of arizona,d.
commercial speech doctrine,in the context of advertising for professional services,may be summarized generally as follows truthful advertising related to lawful activities is entitled to the protections of the first amendment.but when the particular content or method of the advertising suggests that it is inherently misleading or when experience has proved that in fact such advertising is subject to abuse,the states may impose appropriate restrictions.misleading advertising may be prohibited entirely.in re,d.the first amendment principles governing state regulation of lawyer solicitations for pecuniary gain are by now familiar commercial speech that is not false or deceptive and does not concern unlawful activities may be restricted only in the service of a substantial governmental interest,and only through means that directly advance that interest.citations.since state regulation of commercial speech may extend only as far as the interest it serves,citation state rules that are designed to prevent the potential for deception and confusion may be no broader than reasonably necessary to prevent the perceived evil.citation.shapero kentucky bar,d.
ii.the california constitution 
in terms more expansive than the first amendment,article i,section,subdivision a of the california constitution guarantees,every person may freely speak,write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects,being responsible for the abuse of this right.a law may not restrain or abridge liberty of speech or press.the protection afforded speech by this provision is broader than that provided by the first amendment.wilson superior court cal d,state constitutional guarantee is more definitive and inclusive than the first amendment gerawan farming,lyons cal th,d,gerawan.specifically,article i right to freedom of speech,unlike the first amendment,is unlimited in scope.citations.whereas the first amendment does not embrace all subjects,article i does indeed do so gerawan,at,d.
the wording of this section is terse and vigorous,and its meaning so plain that construction is not needed.the right of the citizen to freely speak,write,and publish his sentiments is unlimited,but he is responsible at the hands of the law for an abuse of that right.he shall have no censor over him to whom he must apply for permission to speak,write,or publish,but he shall be held accountable to the law for what he speaks,what he writes,and what he publishes.it is patent that this right to speak,write,and publish,can not be abused until it is exercised,and before it is exercised there can be no responsibility.dailey superior court cal.
the state and federal constitutions do not impose different boundaries between the categories of commercial and noncommercial speech nike,supra,cal th at,d,and the state constitution does not prohibit imposition of sanctions for misleading commercial advertising.ibid.but the supreme court in gerawan held that within its unlimited scope,expressly embracing all subjects,california constitution,article i right to freedom of speech protects commercial speech,at least in the form of truthful and nonmisleading messages about lawful products and services,as fully as it does political and ideological speech.gerawan,supra,cal th at,d.
in gerawan the california supreme court observed that the right to free speech is put at risk both by prohibiting a speaker from funding speech that he otherwise would fund and also by compelling him to fund speech that he otherwise would not fund.gerawan,supra,cal th at,d.nonetheless,under the united states supreme court commercial speech doctrine as applied in glickman wileman brothers elliott,d,the supreme court held that the california plum marketing program,which compels all plum producers to fund generic advertising about their product,does not violate the first amendment rights of dissenting growers.gerawan,at,d.
after surveying the development of the united states supreme court commercial speech doctrine,as well as california independent constitutional protection for the right to free speech,however,the gerawan court concluded there is no difference under the state constitution between the protection provided political and ideological speech and commercial speech,at least with respect to truthful and nonmisleading messages about lawful products and services.gerawan,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,without more,although valid under the first amendment,under california constitution,article i,it is not permissible to compel one who engages in commercial speech to fund speech in the form of advertising that he would otherwise not.id.at,d.the court found the dissenting grower complaint pleaded factual allegations that were sufficient to at least implicate its article i right to freedom of speech against the california plum marketing program and remanded the case,which was before it following a judgment on the pleadings in favor of the secretary of the california department of food and agriculture,to the court of appeal to determine in the first instance whether a violation of the grower article i right to freedom of speech had been established.id.at,d.
writing for the court in gerawan,justice mosk recognized that its conclusions concerning the full protection for commercial speech afforded by the california constitution have not been anticipated completely and in their entirety in prior california judicial decisions.that is because article i s free speech clause and commercial speech were not considered on their own terms in any of these prior decisions,but only,for example,through the distorting lens of the united states supreme court commercial speech dichotomy in first amendment jurisprudence.gerawan,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
atari and howard gunty 
in the only published decisions addressing the propriety of precertification notice to potential class members,two courts of appeal have upheld the role of the trial court in screening the content of the proposed notice and authorizing the communication only if the court determines there is no specific impropriety.atari,supra,d at.howard gunty profit sharing plan superior court th,d howard gunty.in howard gunty division four of this court held leave of court was required before a notice could be sent to potential class members in order to identify a new class representative after the original class representative had been found inadequate.id.at,d.the court concluded the necessity to regulate class action proceedings trumped free speech concerns,holding plaintiffs contend that since their communication with potential class members is protected commercial speech under the first amendment,the only limitation is that it not be false,misleading,or deceptive.see shapero kentucky bar,supra,at.at.we disagree.in the context of a class action,it is the court authority and duty to exercise control over the class action to protect the rights of all parties,and to prevent abuses which might undermine the proper administration of justice.see gulf oil bernard.at,d.id.at,d.accordingly,it held that precertification communications are properly subject to prior court approval precertification communication carries the potential for abuse.thus,any order limiting communications between parties and potential class members should be based on a clear record and specific findings that reflect a weighing of the need for a limitation and the potential interference with the rights of the parties.citation.the trial court should identify the potential abuses and weigh them against the rights of the parties under the circumstances.citation.howard gunty,supra,th at,d.
requiring judicial approval for precertification communications constitutes an impermissible prior restraint of protected speech 
we respectfully disagree with the free speech analysis of our colleagues in division four the requirement of court approval for precertification communications is a classic example of a prior restraint on speech.southeastern promotions,conrad,d prior restraint on speech exists if in order to engage in protected speech,advance approval of the government is required,the approval depends on affirmative action by a government official and such action requires the exercise of judgment,and the government official may render that judgment based on the content of the speech.
although p rior restraints are not unconstitutional per se southeastern promotions,conrad,supra,at,prior restraints have long been held presumptively unconstitutional.see bantam books,sullivan,d.p rior restraints on speech and publication are the most serious and least tolerable infringement of first amendment rights.nebraska press stuart,d.prior restraints on speech are permissible only in certain narrow circumstances constituting exceptional cases.near minnesota.the party seeking to enjoin speech thus carries a heavy burden of showing justification for the imposition of such a restraint.organization for a better austin keefe,d.
in a footnote in.pharmacy board.consumer council,d,footnote the supreme court suggested the hardy qualities of commercial speech may also make inapplicable the prohibition against prior restraints.see also central hudson gas public serv.comm,d,fn.we have observed that commercial speech is such a sturdy brand of expression that traditional prior restraint doctrine may not apply to it but see new york magazine metropolitan transp.auth.cir applying traditional prior restraint principles to invalidate decision by transit authority to remove from sides of busses advertisements poking fun at new york city mayor rudolph giuliani.
