this case sits squarely at the intersection of the class action fairness act cafa and a sovereign right to bring an enforcement action to protect its citizens from unscrupulous,fraudulent,or harmful business practices.the district court approved a cafa settlement between a nationwide certified class of disappointed purchasers of the intelligender prediction test and defendant intelligender,which sold and advertised the test as an accurate predictor of a fetus gender using the mother urine sample.subsequently,the people of the state of california filed an enforcement action against intelligender under the state unfair competition and false advertising laws,largely based on the same claims asserted in the cafa class action.the state seeks civil penalties,injunctive relief,and restitution for some individuals who were bound by the cafa class action settlement.intelligender initially moved for an injunction against the state entire action,which the district court denied.intelligender next moved for an injunction against only the state restitution claims,positing that the state action undermines the finality of the cafa settlement,which the court also denied.because the state action is designed to vindicate broader governmental interests than the class action,the settlement agreement in the cafa class action does not create privity sufficient to warrant enjoining the entire action.while we recognize the state strong interest in protecting its citizens through enforcement actions,we note that cafa expressly provides that the defendant in a class action must provide notice to the appropriate state official of any proposed settlement,presumably so that the state may comment upon or object to the settlement approval,if the state believes the terms inadequately protect state citizens.here,the appropriate state officials were notified,but they chose not to participate in the settlement approval process.the state can not now obtain a duplicate recovery in the form of restitution on behalf of those individual citizens who are bound by the bargained for restitution in the cafa class settlement.accordingly we affirm the district court denial of the motion to enjoin the entire state action,but reverse its denial of the motion to enjoin only restitution claims.
earlier this year,the supreme court explained 
congress enacted cafa in order to amend the procedures that apply to consideration of interstate class actions.in doing so,congress recognized that class action lawsuits are an important and valuable part of the legal system.it was concerned,however,that certain requirements of federal diversity jurisdiction,had functioned to keep cases of national importance in state courts rather than federal courts.
ex rel.hood au optronics,citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted.the senate stated its concerns more bluntly m ost class actions are currently adjudicated in state courts,where the governing rules are applied inconsistently frequently in a manner that contravenes basic fairness and due process considerations and where there is often inadequate supervision over litigation procedures and proposed settlements,at,wl,at.in an effort to curb these perceived abuses,congress loosened the requirements for diversity jurisdiction by adding d,which replaced the ordinary requirement of complete diversity of citizenship among all plaintiffs and defendants,with a requirement of minimal diversity.au optronics.at citation omitted.under cafa,therefore,a federal court may exercise jurisdiction so long as any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a state different from any defendant and the amount in controversy exceeds million.d.
complementing the expansion of federal jurisdiction to ensure uniformity and fairness is cafa class action settlement notice requirement,which was intended to provide a check against inequitable settlements,at,wl,at see in re uponor,plumbing fittings prods.liab,cir.section requires notice of a proposed settlement to be served on the appropriate federal and state officials typically the attorney general of the united states and the person in the state who has the primary regulatory or supervisory responsibility with respect to the defendant.a.in addition,prohibits a court from ordering final approval of a proposed settlement until days after the appropriate government officials were notified.id.d.the statute is equally clear that it shall not be construed to expand the authority of,or impose any obligations,duties,or responsibilities upon,federal or state officials.id.f.these requirements are intended to give states a role in ensuring that citizens are equitably compensated in class action settlements,but states are free not to participate,leaving that task to the courts,which ultimately retain discretion to approve or disapprove any settlement,regardless of a state intervention.
aside from securing compensation for citizens,state enforcement actions serve other interests such as protecting citizens from future harm,and these interests might not be served by intervention in ongoing settlement proceedings.thus,although the role of potential objector to a proposed settlement under cafa serves important interests,a sovereign ability to bring enforcement actions against private parties that violate the law serves equally if not more important public interests.nothing in cafa notification requirements could be read to interfere with the power of states or the federal government to bring enforcement actions.

on november,the people of the state of california,by and through the san diego city attorney,filed an action in california state court against intelligender,llc and its owners for violations of california ucl and fal.the state sought to enjoin intelligender from engaging in unfair competition and untrue or misleading advertising and sought to obtain civil penalties,restitution,and other remedies for the defendants violations of law.
intelligender removed the action to the federal district court for the southern district of california.the district court subsequently granted intelligender motion to change venue to the central district of california pursuant to a over the objection of the state.the case was assigned to judge audrey collins,who had presided over the related gram intelligender cafa class action.
on august,intelligender moved in the gram action for a permanent or preliminary injunction to enforce the court final order and judgment by enjoining the state from prosecuting the enforcement action.it argued that an injunction was necessary in aid of preserving the court jurisdiction pursuant to the all writs act,because allowing the state suit to go forward would undermine the ability of the district court to enforce its final order and judgment in the gram class action.on september,the district court remanded the state enforcement action to the superior court for the county of san diego reasoning,in part,that it was brought in the state sovereign capacity to protect its citizenry from unscrupulous business practices.the following day,the district court denied intelligender request for injunctive relief against the state enforcement action.
intelligender next moved in the gram action for an injunction against the state restitution claims only.intelligender argued that insofar as the state sought restitution on behalf of members of the settlement class,such relief should be enjoined because allowing the claims to go forward would amount to a double recovery and run afoul of the doctrine of res judicata.in short,allowing the restitution claims to proceed would undermine the finality of the class action settlement.on october,the district court also denied this motion.
whether an injunction may issue under the anti injunction act is a question of law reviewed de novo.california randtron,cir.if an injunction falls within the purview of the anti injunction act,then we review for abuse of discretion the district court decision whether to grant the injunction.id.
the anti injunction act,limits the all writs act by prohibiting federal courts from enjoining state court actions except in three narrow circumstances.one of these,the relitigation exception,allows a court to issue an injunction where necessary to protect or effectuate the federal court judgments.randtron,at.that exception empowers a district court to issue injunctions to enforce judgments and to reinforce the effects of the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.leon idx,cir internal quotation marks omitted.res judicata applies when the earlier suit reached a final judgment on the merits involved the same cause of action or claim and involved identical parties or privies.id.at 
there is no doubt that the first two elements are met with respect to both of intelligender motions.first,the district court entered a final judgment in the gram class action.second,the gram class action included the same causes of action or claims now brought by the state of california.specifically,the state alleges causes of action for violation of california business and professions code for untrue or misleading statements to the public about services based on the company statements about its product,including that it has p roven over accurate in laboratory tests,and violation of business and professions code for unfair competition based on their violation of and commission of theft by false pretenses in violation of penal code and.the gram class action also included claims against intelligender based upon california ucl and fal.
the third element,whether sufficient privity exists between the state and the class members to warrant the application of res judicata,is the crux of this case.see united states bhatia,cir noting that the doctrine of res judicata require s privity between parties.privity is a legal conclusion designating a person so identified in interest with a party to former litigation that he represents precisely the same right in respect to the subject matter involved.id.internal quotation marks omitted.and,as the supreme court recently cautioned,issuing an injunction under the relitigation exception is resorting to heavy artillery.for that reason,every benefit of the doubt goes toward the state court an injunction can issue only if preclusion is clear beyond peradventure.smith bayer,footnote omitted citation omitted.
the district court correctly denied intelligender motion to enjoin the state enforcement action in its entirety the court reasoned that intelligender had not met its burden of showing that the cafa class action settlement could bind the state in its sovereign capacity,where it asserted both public and private interests.intelligender failed to carry that burden because it is an impossible one to bear.
in herman south carolina national bank,cir,the eleventh circuit held that the federal government enforcement action seeking to vindicate both private and public concerns was not barred by the prior settlement of a private class action on those same claims.relying on several supreme court cases,the eleventh circuit explained that t hese erisa cases are consistent with the general principle that the government is not bound by private litigation when the government action seeks to enforce a federal statute that implicates both public and private interests.id.at see hathorn lovorn,holding that giving a state court authority to adjudicate voting rights act issues arising in disputes between private parties does not frustrate the attorney general enforcement of the act because t he attorney general is not bound by the resolution of issues in cases to which he was not a party,and,more broadly,c ommon notions of collateral estoppel suggest that the state proceedings similarly would not bind other interested persons who did not participate in them.the eleventh circuit reasoned that congress granted the secretary of labor an independent right to sue and seek redress for erisa violations because such plans affect the national public interest.herman,at.as such,the secretary action was not barred by the actions of private plaintiffs who sought to redress individual grievances,even when the secretary action also sought to recoup plan losses.see wilmington shipping new eng.life,cir agreeing with a number of our sister circuits that have held that,in light of the overarching national interest in ensuring the financial stability of pension plans and the inability of private plaintiffs to adequately represent this interest,the secretary of labor is not bound by the results reached by private litigants in erisa suits.we agree that a cafa class action settlement,though approved by the district court,does not act as res judicata against the state in its sovereign capacity,even though many of the same claims are included in both actions.because the state action is brought on behalf of the people,it implicates the public interest as well as private interests,and therefore the remedial provisions sweep much more broadly.
for example,california business and professions code a specifically provides that individuals who engage in unfair competition shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars for each violation in this action,the state requested penalties of for each and every untrue or misleading statement made or caused to be made by intelligender to each potential or actual consumer,as proven at trial,in an amount not less than five million dollars pursuant to as well as civil penalties in the amount of for every violation of pursuant to.section also allows public prosecutors to seek injunctive relief,and permits public prosecutors to seek restitution for all individuals who purchased the product,not only those who used it and received an incorrect result.
the cases relied upon by intelligender for its contrary arguments actually undercut its position.in leon idx systems,for example,we found privity and enjoined the department of labor dol action against a company because w hen the secretary of labor is suing for rights of precisely the sort plaintiff has already pursued then the requisite closeness of the interests for privity is present.leon,at alterations omitted citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.leon had sued his employer after being placed on unpaid leave,alleging violations of the provision of the false claims act,title vii,the americans with disabilities act,and state laws.id.at.he also filed a complaint with the dol.id.after the district court dismissed all of leon claims with prejudice because he had despoiled evidence,his employer moved the district court to enjoin,on res judicata grounds,the dol action as well.id.the district court denied the motion to enjoin,and we reversed,reasoning that the district court had erred in not finding privity between leon and the dol.id.at.because the dol action arose under the provision of the sarbanes oxley act,the only remedies available were individual compensatory remedies.id.at.on that basis,we concluded that the private nature of the remedy sought by the dol demonstrates that the agency is in privity with leon.id.at.similarly,in chao a one medical services,cir,we affirmed the grant of injunctive relief because the secretary of labor was not trying to vindicate broader governmental interests by,for example,seeking an injunction,but was instead trying to recoup plaintiff personal economic loss.
finally,intelligender argument that the state enforcement action should be enjoined because of its failure to object to the proposed settlement after receiving cafa required notice is simply incorrect.the three district court cases cited by intelligender in support of its position stand for little more than the proposition that the failure to object can be considered in assessing the fairness of a proposed class action settlement precisely what the cafa notification requirements were designed to accomplish.the notification requirement,by its own terms,does not impose any obligations,duties,or responsibilities upon,federal or state officials.f.intelligender arguments to the contrary are unavailing,contradict the plain text of the statute,and would undermine cafa purpose.
whether the district court erred in denying intelligender motion to enjoin the state claims for restitution is an entirely separate question.the same considerations of cafa purpose and the importance of state enforcement actions once again govern our analysis,but this time lead to a different result the state action,insofar as it seeks restitution for individual members of the gram settlement class,may be enjoined under its continuing jurisdiction to enforce and administer the gram class action settlement.i t goes without saying that the courts can and should preclude double recovery by an individual.eeoc waffle house,internal quotation marks omitted.to the extent that the state seeks restitution for individual members of the gram certified class,it may be enjoined from doing so.
when a government entity sues for the same relief that plaintiff has already pursued then the requisite closeness of interests for privity is present.leon,at emphasis added citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted see also chao,at enjoining an action by the secretary of labor because it sought simply to recoup plaintiff personal economic loss rather than vindicate broader governmental interests by,for example,seeking an injunction.sufficient privity exists between gram class members and the state with respect to claims for restitution.the district court suggestion that privity did not relied upon two mistaken premises that the individuals on whose behalf restitution was sought are different from the certified class and that the amounts sought are different.the former is factually incorrect,and the latter has no bearing on the question of privity.
in its order denying the motion to enjoin claims for restitution only,the court relied upon the fact that the class certified in this case is limited only to those who purchased defendant product and received an inaccurate result,whereas the people are seeking restitution on behalf of all california purchasers of the product regardless of the results they received from the product.this is incorrect.in its approval of the class settlement in gram,the district court certifie d this action for settlement purposes as a nationwide class action on the behalf of the following all individuals who personally purchased a test between november,and january,in the united states and personally used the test.while only those individuals who obtained an incorrect test result are eligible for compensation under the terms of the settlement,this does not negate the fact that the certified class covered anyone who purchased and used the test substantially the same individuals for whom the state now seeks restitution.that compensation was limited to those who obtained an incorrect result is a reflection of the bargaining and compromise inherent in settling disputes.individual gram class members who bought a test and used it but did not obtain an incorrect result remain bound by the settlement,even though they will not receive any compensation.if the state wished to secure compensation for those class members,it had an opportunity to do so by intervening after receiving notice of the proposed settlement pursuant to a.this is the method cafa established for states to seek equitable compensation for class members.the state chose not to use its authority,and the settlement was approved.compensation is res judicata.
the district court reliance upon the different amount of restitution in denying the motion is also misplaced.it is irrelevant for questions of privity and merely confirms that the state is essentially seeking a double or at least better recovery.indeed,even the district court agree d with the state conclusion that some individuals who received restitution in this case would be ineligible for recovery in the gram action.moreover,as our decision in leon confirms,the appr
