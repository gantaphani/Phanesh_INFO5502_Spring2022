this interlocutory appeal requires us to explore,for the first time,the crossroads at which rules intersect with the rescission provisions of the federal truth in lending act tila,and its massachusetts counterpart,the massachusetts consumer credit cost disclosure act mcccda.laws ch.after careful consideration of this nuanced terrain,we conclude that the district court lacked the authority to certify a class of residential borrowers who might potentially be eligible for rescissionary relief.consequently,we reverse the decision appealed from,vacate the class certification order,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
in march,the plaintiffs,ralph mckenna,glenroy and ilene deane,and christopher and laurie lillie,all massachusetts homeowners,filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts alleging that the defendant,first horizon home loan corporation first horizon,had violated both the tila and the mcccda in the course of various massachusetts transactions.specifically,the plaintiffs contended that first horizon had inaccurately disclosed information pertaining to consumers statutory rescission rights and,subsequently,had failed to respond appropriately to requests for the rescission of residential refinancings.in the plaintiffs view,these violations of the tila and the mcccda entitled them to rescission of their loans and statutory damages.
to that point,the action seems unremarkable.what makes it unusual is that,in addition to their claims for individualized relief,the plaintiffs asserted that first horizon practices had victimized countless others.based on this premise,they purposed to sue on behalf of a class of massachusetts consumers who had received similar loans and similar allegedly defective notices of rescissionary rights from first horizon during a particular time frame.with respect to the putative class,the plaintiffs sought a declaration that any class member who elected to do so could rescind his or her credit transaction with first horizon at any time during the extended statutory default period notwithstanding the expiration of the shorter period described in the rescission notices.first horizon denied the material allegations of the complaint and resisted any suggestion that class certification might be appropriate.
in due season,certain of the plaintiffs mckenna and laurie lillie moved for class certification.see.first horizon opposed the motion.the district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge.after some skirmishing over the definition of the class,the magistrate judge recommended,in a clarifying report,that a class be certified as follows 
all natural persons who obtained money loans from first horizon on or after april,and who received a notice of right to cancel in a described form where the loans were secured by the borrower massachusetts residence the loan was for purposes other than the initial construction or acquisition of the residence and all or part of the loan proceeds were used to refinance a loan made by someone other than first horizon.
mckenna first horizon home loan,d,the class definition contained certain exclusions,not material here it also provided that no person shall be excluded from the class simply because that person has refinanced or paid off the subject loan.id.finally,the magistrate judge recommended order stipulated that,if the action succeeded,class relief would take the form of a declaration that any class member who so desires may seek to rescind their transaction.id.quoting plaintiffs amended complaint.should such a declaration issue,members of the class who then elected to rescind could proceed to seek reimbursement of amounts previously paid,statutory damages,and attorneys fees.see id.at.
first horizon objected on divers grounds,but the district court nonetheless adopted the magistrate judge clarified recommendation in full.see id.at.undaunted,first horizon sought interlocutory review of the class certification order pursuant to.f.because of the important and unsettled legal issues involved and the substantial financial impact that the order portended,we granted the rule f petition in the exercise of our discretion.see waste mgmt.holdings,mowbray,cir.we then issued an expedited briefing schedule and heard oral argument on december.
ii.the statutory scheme 
we begin our odyssey through the wilderness by summarizing the statutory provisions that undergird the plaintiffs claims.congress enacted the tila in to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit practices.a.to accomplish this goal,the tila requires creditors to disclose,clearly and accurately,all the material terms of consumer credit transactions.see beach ocwen fed.bank,d.when creditors transgress this baseline rule,they are subject both to criminal penalties for willful and knowing violations,see,and to debtors claims for damages,see id.a.
the tila provides further protection to consumers by guaranteeing them a period within which they may,for any reason or for no reason,rescind certain types of credit transactions including residential refinancings.see id.rescission essentially restores the status quo ante the creditor terminates its security interest and returns any monies paid by the debtor in exchange for the latter return of all disbursed funds or property interests.see id.b.if the right to rescind is not adequately disclosed,however,the period within which the debtor may elect to rescind is extended for up to three years after consummation of the transaction.see palmer champion,cir see also a.the plaintiffs claim that this elongated rescission period applies in this case.
the rescission process is intended to be private,with the creditor and debtor working out the logistics of a given rescission.see belini.mut.bank,cir.not all debtors who suspect or know that they have been subjected to a tila violation will choose to rescind,in large part because rescission entails the return of loan proceeds to the creditor.see ralph rohner fred miller,truth in lending,at.if,however,a debtor elects to rescind,the mechanics of rescission are uncomplicated the debtor notifies the creditor in writing of his or her desire to rescind,and the creditor must respond to that election within twenty days.see b.during this response period,the creditor may comply with the request,resist rescission entirely,or agree to rescission while seeking equitable modifications.see rohner miller,supra,at.should disagreements ensue or problems arise,either party may repair to a federal court.see large conseco fin.servicing,cir.
in addition to individual claims for rescission and statutory damages,the tila expressly acknowledges the potential for damages class actions by capping statutory damages for a single violation,repeated in multiple cases,at the lesser of or one percent of the creditor net worth.see a b.there is no comparable provision in the section of the tila that deals with rescission.
except for a modest variance in regard to the limitation variance that is of no consequence mcccda mirrors its federal counterpart.this is not an accident the massachusetts legislature closely modeled the state law after the tila.see lynch signal fin.it is,therefore,common ground that the mcccda should be construed in accordance with the tila.see in re desrosiers,mayo key fin.thus,even though the parties agree that the rescission claims in this case invoke the mcccda,they also agree that,given the congruence between the two statutes,the tila supplies the applicable rules of decision.
iii.analysis 
we turn now to the operation of these statutes in the context.on appeal,first horizon advances a asseverational array.its flagship claim is that the district court erred in certifying the class because,as a matter of law,class actions for rescission are unavailable under the tila and,therefore,under the mcccda.the amici,whose assistance we appreciate,have filed an erudite brief in support of this claim.we start there.
we review orders granting or denying class certification for abuse of discretion.see tilley tjx,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when a relevant factor deserving of significant weight is overlooked,or when an improper factor is accorded significant weight,or when the court considers the appropriate mix of factors,but commits a palpable error of judgment in calibrating the decisional scales.dopp pritzker,cir quoting united states roberts,cir.within this rubric,a district court necessarily abuses its discretion when its decision or judgment depends upon an incorrect view of the law,cir.and,finally,a district court answer to an abstract legal question,even though made in the course of reaching a generally discretionary judgment,engenders de novo review.see tardiff knox county,cir.
the putative class in this case is aimed at clearing the way for rescission claims.thus,the principal issue before us is whether tila claims focused on rescission are maintainable in a format.this issue is one of first impression here.the fifth circuit has addressed it,however,holding squarely that rescission class actions are not maintainable under the tila.see james home constr.of mobile,cir.
the james court based its holding primarily on a conclusion that congress intended rescission to be a purely personal remedy a status inconsistent with the mechanism.id.a number of district courts have echoed this refrain.these courts have emphasized that rescission claims,unlike damages claims,are not subject to any aggregate statutory cap and,therefore,rescission class actions,if permitted,could easily render a creditor insolvent.see,gibbons interbank funding group.they also have noted the absence of any necessity for deployment of the vehicle in this context due to the availability of substantial monetary recoveries and attorneys fees in individual rescission cases.see,jefferson sec.pac.fin.
this case law notwithstanding,the question is not free from doubt.some district courts,like the court below,have certified tila rescission classes on the theory that nothing in the language of the tila expressly prohibits the maintenance of rescission class actions.see,rodrigues members mortg,mcintosh irwin union bank trust,williams empire funding.
we follow james and hold today that,as a matter of law,class certification is not available for rescission claims,direct or declaratory,under the tila and,thus,under the mcccda.we ground this holding primarily on our conclusion that congress did not intend rescission suits to receive treatment.
in determining congressional intent,we employ the traditional tools of statutory construction,including a consideration of the language,structure,purpose,and history of the statute.estey comm r,me.dep t of human,cir.thus,we begin the present inquiry with the tila text.
class actions are specifically addressed in the section of the tila relating to damages.see a b.there is,however,no comparable mention of the mechanism in the section that deals with rescission.see id.we long have recognized that,under ordinary circumstances,the inclusion of a specific provision in one part of a statute and the exclusion of the same sort of provision in another part of the same statute should be treated as deliberate.see united states green,cir.consequently,the variation in the treatment of class actions in the two relevant sections of the tila strongly suggests that congress did not intend to include a mechanism within the compass of section.see see also duncan walker,d applying this principle of statutory construction in an analogous context.
of course,the provision in the tila damages section is in the nature of a cap.thus,the exclusion of any mention of class actions from the rescission provision could conceivably lead to one of two conflicting conclusions congress either may have intended rescission to be totally unavailable as a class remedy in the tila milieu or it may have intended rescission class actions to be available unrestrainedly in tila cases,not subject to any special limiting conditions.we find the first alternative much more likely.
it is plain that unrestricted class action availability for rescission claims would open the door for vast recoveries.first horizon estimates that its exposure in this case,should the district court class certification order remain intact,would be approximately this is considerably in excess of the cap the lesser of or one percent of net worth that congress painstakingly established for damages class actions.see a b.the notion that congress would limit liability to with respect to one remedy while allowing the sky to be the limit with respect to another remedy for the same violation strains credulity.
here,moreover,we have the benefit of confirmatory evidence of congress intent.in rodash aib mortg,cir,the eleventh circuit held that a creditor tila violation justified rescission of a mortgage loan.see id.at.responding to that decision,congress enacted a moratorium on class actions for what it characterized as relatively minor violations including the selection of an incorrect form for disclosure of rescission precise type of violation at issue here.see truth in lending class action relief act of,stat.congress proceeded to amend the tila to provide higher tolerance levels for what it viewed as honest mistakes in carrying out disclosure obligations.see truth in lending act amendments of,stat.
in taking this step,congress made manifest that although it had designed the tila to protect consumers,it had not intended that lenders would be made to face overwhelming liability for relatively minor violations.a key proponent of the legislation expressed an awareness,acknowledged by others during the floor debate,that the threat of wholesale rescissions present s a real danger to our modern system of home financing.cong.rec,statement of.the amendments,senator stated,were specifically intended to curtail the devastating liability that threaten s our housing finance system.id.the senator attributed that prospect devastating liability to the onslaught of suits demanding the most draconian remedy available under truth in.id.viewed against this backdrop,it becomes readily evident that providing higher tolerance levels for minor violations was critical to avert ing what could have be en a financial disaster in the mortgage industry.id.at statement of mack.
the personal nature of the rescission remedy gives this legislative history a compelling quality.the highly individualized character of this process and the range of variations that may occur render rescission largely incompatible with a sensible deployment of the mechanism.
the plaintiffs attempt to blunt the force of this reasoning both directly and indirectly.in a frontal assault on what we have gleaned from the legislative history,they point out that congress,in the amendments,acted to limit the contours of the tila compilation of substantive violations rather than to restrict available remedies.from this,they reason that congress actions are not evidence of an intent to circumscribe rescission liability.
this is wishful thinking.while congress did not spell out that class actions were forbidden in the rescission context,it is risky business to attribute much significance to congressional inaction.see estey,at.what we know,to a virtual certainty,is that congress was responding to a troubling decision rodash.see cong.rec,statement of sarbanes the rodash problem arose from a court decision last year in which small violations of the disclosure requirements of the truth in lending act triggered the right of rescission provided by the act.that decision was a merits decision,not a class certification decision.amendment of the tila substantive provisions was a predictable reaction to that promised to ameliorate the threat of wholesale rescissions.id.every indication is that congress,while making no provision for class actions in the rescission context,intended to keep at bay the ominous prospect of liability that would be inherent in rescission class actions.
the plaintiffs indirect attempt to avoid an adverse construction of the tila begins with the supreme court statement that i n the absence of a direct expression by congress of its intent to depart from the usual course of trying all suits of a civil nature und
