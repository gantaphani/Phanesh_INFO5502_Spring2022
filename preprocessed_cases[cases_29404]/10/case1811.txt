petitioners bayer corporation,barr laboratories,the rugby group,watson pharmaceutics,and hoechst marion roussel,seek a writ of mandate directing the superior court to vacate its order granting class certification in a coordinated proceeding against them for alleged violations of the cartwright act bus,et,the unfair competition law bus,et,and the common law.we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in certifying the class.we nevertheless grant relief because the class as defined by the trial court is overbroad to the extent it includes purchasers of cipro who paid a flat copayment when they would have paid for a generic substitute under their health insurance.
factual and procedural backgrounda.allegations of class action complaint 
this matter arises out of a series of cases filed in various counties in california,which have been coordinated in the superior court of san diego county pursuant to code of civil procedure section et.the following facts are taken from the consolidated second amended complaint filed in the coordinated proceeding.
cipro is the brand name for ciprofloxacin hydrochloride ciprofloxacin,an antibiotic prescribed for the treatment of various infections.cipro is manufactured and marketed by bayer ag and its subsidiary bayer corporation collectively referred to as bayer.in,bayer obtained a patent on ciprofloxacin known as the patent.cipro is the best selling antibiotic in the world.cipro was the first bayer product to post over billion in annual sales in the united states.
in,barr laboratories,barr applied for approval from the federal food and drug administration fda to market a generic version of cipro.as authorized by the federal act,barr challenged the validity of bayer patent.in january,bayer brought a patent infringement suit against barr in federal court,which triggered a waiting period for fda approval of barr application under the act.in its answer to bayer complaint,barr asserted that the patent was invalid and unenforceable.
according to the complaint,bayer internal studies estimated that a generic version of cipro could capture percent of the market within the first six months of marketing and percent within the first full year of generic competition.based on barr predictions,bayer stood to lose at least million in annual revenues within a few years after the introduction of generic competition.
bayer settled the patent litigation in january and entered into several interrelated agreements the cipro agreements with barr and two other entities affiliated with marion roussel,hmr and the rugby group,rugby.under the terms of these agreements,barr acknowledged the validity of the patent.barr,hmr,and rugby agreed to refrain from selling or marketing a generic version of cipro.in exchange,bayer paid barr and hmr a lump sum of million and agreed that it would either license and supply cipro to barr and hmr for resale,or make additional quarterly payments to barr and hmr.as of the filing of the complaint,bayer had opted to pay a total of million in quarterly payments to barr and hmr.
the complaint alleges that,in the absence of the cipro agreements,barr would have begun manufacturing,marketing,and selling generic ciprofloxacin in the united states market no later than january.according to the complaint,the purpose of the cipro agreements was to allocate the entire united states market for ciprofloxacin to bayer for at least six years,to restrain competition in the market,and to grant bayer an unlawful monopoly with the concomitant ability to charge supracompetitive prices for cipro.
the complaint alleges causes of action for per se violation of the cartwright act bus,et,unfair competition in violation of the unfair competition law bus,et,and the common law tort of monopolization.
the named plaintiffs are individual residents and entities in california,each of whom allegedly purchased cipro indirectly from bayer.the complaint alleges that the named plaintiffs are suing on behalf of themselves and a class of california individuals and entities who indirectly purchased,paid reimbursed for cipro intended for consumption by themselves,their families,or their members,participants,employees or insureds the class during the period from january,through such time in the future as the effects of defendants illegal conduct,as alleged herein,have ceased the class period.according to the complaint,the named plaintiffs and the class members paid substantially more for cipro than they would have had to pay in a competitive market.
class certification motion 
in december,plaintiffs filed a motion for certification of the class described in the complaint.the motion was supported by a declaration of economist raymond hartman,as well as declarations of the named plaintiffs.according to hartman,he had analyzed whether the indirect purchasers of cipro in california were impacted as a class and damaged economically as a result of the alleged antitrust violations and other unlawful conduct among defendants.based on his economic analysis,hartman concluded that the purchasers of cipro had been damaged economically,for two reasons first,all scientific evidence indicates that over time consumers switch in large numbers from a branded drug to its bioequivalent generic once that generic becomes available.second,existing evidence suggests that branded prices would have been lower once the generic entered.
hartman also analyzed whether analysis is feasible and is the most efficient and effective way of analyzing impact and measuring damages.he concluded that it was.according to hartman,there exists a standard formulaic methodology to calculate both the amount of overcharges to the class as a whole and the monetary remedies available under business and professions code section.hartman described the formula in detail in his declaration and explained that the formula was widely used and accepted in scientific analysis of the penetration of generic drugs into the market.
defendants opposed the motion for class certification and submitted evidence in opposition to the hartman declaration,including expert declarations from economists gregory bell and james hughes.the defense experts asserted that there was no method for determining the impact on the class or for measuring damages to its individual members through common proof.in the opinions of the defense experts,the individual circumstances of the putative class members were too varied to permit an assessment of their claims on a basis.
hartman submitted a rebuttal declaration in opposition to the defense experts.in his rebuttal declaration,hartman reaffirmed the opinions set forth in his initial declaration,and explained why he believed bell and hughes objections to class certification were invalid.
c.the trial court ruling 
after issuing a tentative ruling and hearing oral argument,the trial court entered a written order granting the motion for class certification.the court found that the proposed class was an easily ascertainable group of hundreds of thousands of individuals and entities who had purchased cipro.the court further concluded that there was a community of interest among the class members because there was a predominance of common issues,the claims of the class representatives were typical of the class as a whole,and the class representatives could adequately represent the class.finally,the court found that a class action was the most efficient and fair means for adjudication of the claims.
writ proceedings 
on january,bayer,rugby,hmr,and watson filed a petition for writ of mandate or other appropriate relief seeking review of the class certification order.we issued an order to show cause.
discussiona.appellate review of class certification orders 
an order certifying a class is not appealable except on appeal from the final judgment.see shelley city of los angeles th,d code civ.however,such an interlocutory order is reviewable by way of a petition for writ of mandate.blue chip stamps superior court cal d,fn.
a trial court order granting or denying class certification is subject to review for abuse of discretion.neecke city of mill valley th,d.because trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action,they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification.linder thrifty oil cal th,d,linder.however,the trial court ruling must be reversed if its findings are not supported by substantial evidence,if improper criteria were used,or if erroneous legal assumptions were made.id.at,d,citing richmond dart industries,cal d,see also lockheed martin superior court cal th,d,lockheed.
b.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in certifying a class 
code of civil procedure section authorizes class actions when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court to obtain certification,a party must establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members.linder,supra,cal th at,d.to establish a community of interest,three factors must be shown predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.richmond dart industries,supra,cal d at.
petitioners do not contest the trial court findings as to the existence of an ascertainable class,the typicality of the class representatives claims,or the adequacy of representation by the class representatives.rather,they focus exclusively on the trial court finding that there are predominant common questions of law or fact.specifically,petitioners contend that there are numerous individual issues pertaining to liability and to damages that preclude class certification,and that the trial court erred in ruling that injury to all class members may be assumed where a horizontal restraint of trade is alleged.we reject these contentions.
there are substantial questions of law and fact common to all class members 
the predominance factor requires a showing that questions of law or fact common to the class predominate over the questions affecting the individual members.washington mutual bank superior court cal th,d.the ultimate question in every case of this type is whether the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.collins rocha cal d.the trial court must carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts.city of san jose superior court cal d.
the trial court here properly concluded that there are substantial issues of law and fact common to all of the proposed class members.determining whether the cipro agreements violate the cartwright act bus,et,the unfair competition law bus,et,or the common law requires the resolution of potentially complex issues that do not vary among the individual class members.the nature and circumstances of the cipro their legality under california identical factual and legal issues as to every member of the class.for every single class member to litigate these common issues separately would impose a substantial burden on the courts and the litigants.
state and federal courts alike have recognized that common issues usually predominate in cases where the defendants are alleged to have engaged in collusive,anticompetitive conduct resulting in artificially high prices for a product.in such cases,the existence of the conspiracy and its legality generally present common questions of law and fact that predominate over any questions affecting only individual class members.see,custom kitchen,d,citing cases rosack volvo of america d.rosack in re terazosin hydrochloride antitrust litigation,terazosin in re lorazepam clorazepate antitrust litigation,lorazepam see also wright,miller kane,fed.practice and procedure ed.
in terazosin,supra,the district court recently concluded that common issues predominated in a case factually similar to ours.terazosin was an antitrust class action brought against a drug manufacturer and its generic competitors,arising out of an allegedly anticompetitive settlement of patent litigation,which the plaintiffs claimed had the effect of delaying entry of a generic product and causing artificially inflated prices for the drug.the district court concluded that there were common questions of law and fact applicable to all class members,and that these common questions predominated over individual issues.terazosin,supra,at.
there is also substantial evidence in the record to support the trial court finding that the impact of the cipro agreements on the class as a whole is subject to common proof at trial.the damages suffered by the class depends primarily on the effect of bayer alleged monopoly on the overall market for ciprofloxacin.this is a matter that is subject to proof by way of expert testimony,without regard to the particular circumstances of each individual class member.as the trial court noted in its ruling,economist raymond hartman offered his expert opinion that the total amount of overcharges to the class as a whole could be calculated based on a standard economic formula described in his declarations.
the use of such a formula is an accepted method of proving aggregate damages to the class.conte newberg,newberg on class actions ed.in many cases such an aggregate calculation will be far more accurate than summing all individual claims.bruno superior court d,fn.the law requires only that some reasonable basis of computation be used,and the result reached can be a reasonable approximation.acree general motors acceptance th,d.
expert opinion constitutes substantial evidence to support a class certification order if it is based on relevant,probative facts,as opposed to mere guesswork,surmise,or conjecture.see lockheed,supra,cal th at,d.hartman expert opinion was based on existing data sources,published scientific analyses,the history of other comparable generic drugs,bayer internal strategic planning documents,bayer invoice and accounting data,the economics literature in the field,and a formulaic methodology widely used and accepted in scientific analysis of the market penetration of generic drugs.
we conclude that hartman expert testimony was based on relevant,probative facts and constituted substantial evidence to support the trial court finding that proof of aggregate impact on the class as a whole can be shown by common proof.terazosin,supra,at approving hartman methodology for computing damages and finding that it was based on widely accepted economic methods that were common to the class in re relafen antitrust litigation,relafen predominance requirement satisfied in part by expert declaration stating that proof could be used to demonstrate the existence of common injuries resulting from overcharges caused by allegedly unlawful conduct delaying entry of competing generic drug in re cardizem cd antitrust litigation,cardizem expert testimony in support of class certification satisfied plaintiffs burden of showing that there was an accepted methodology for calculating aggregate damages resulting from allegedly unlawful agreement between manufacturers of drug and generic version.
the fact that petitioners experts disagreed with hartman analysis and conclusions regarding proof of common impact is neither surprising nor relevant at this stage of the litigation.cardizem,supra,at.whether or not hartman is correct in his assessment of common impact or injury will ultimately be decided at trial.the class certification stage is not the proper forum in which to resolve such a dispute between experts.at this stage of the proceedings,it is not our role,nor the trial court job,to involve ourselves with the merits of the underlying action or which parties experts are most qualified.lebrilla farmers group,th,d.at the class certification stage,the court must merely consider merely whether the evidence the plaintiffs will offer to establish aggregate damages will be sufficiently generalized in nature.card
