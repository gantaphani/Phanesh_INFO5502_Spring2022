this appeal presents the novel question whether the worker adjustment and retraining notification act warn act,et,which prohibits an employer from ordering a mass layoff without giving days notice,applies to a mass layoff of employees who worked for a private employer as airport security screeners until the united states government federalized airport security services and took over operations at their airport.
virgil deveraturda,bernard sapitalo,shirley sampayan,and maria lillibeth edano collectively,deveraturda were employed by globe airport security services,to provide screening services at san jose international airport sjc.however,they and others were let go as a result of the aviation and transportation security act atsa of,stat.believing that globe should have given days notice under the warn act,which it did not do,deveraturda brought a class action for relief under the act 
the district court granted globe motion for judgment on the pleadings,holding that it was the federal government that took over control of airport security without any ability on globe part to dictate the nature,scope,or timing of the takeover.as it was the government that ordered the layoff and ousted globe from providing security personnel at sjc,the court concluded that the warn act does not apply.we agree that the act does not apply,and affirm.
taking the allegations in the complaint to be true,as we must deveraturda was a employee of globe at its headquarters facility located in san jose,california.on november,congress enacted the atsa and,on february,airport security in the united states was federalized.on august,globe issued a facsimile memo to its employees informing them how to apply for a position with the transportation security administration tsa,and,sometime that month,held an informational meeting.globe informed employees that if they were citizens,they would be rehired by tsa after undergoing an assessment test administered by tsa.tsa began administering those tests in september.on september,globe issued a memorandum to airport terminal c employees announcing that the federal government will tentatively take over responsibilities for aviation screening services at sjc airport on october.as of that date aviation screening services employees at sjc terminal c checkpoints will be relieved of those duties.on september,globe announced the first of a series of four layoffs that occurred between october and january.deveraturda did not receive days notice as provided by the warn act,and globe gave no reason for shortened notice.the mass layoffs were the direct and proximate result of defendant long known withdrawal from airport security at san jose international airport.the terminations were a product of the atsa,enacted in,by the federal government to replace private airport security with federal employees,not because of any new or sudden reversal of defendant prospects or failure to obtain capital or business.
globe answer admits that deveraturda was employed at its san jose facility that he was laid off on november,sampayan was laid off on september and that t he layoffs were the result of defendant being notified by the federal government the transportation security administration on september,that defendant operations at the san jose international airport in san jose,california were going to be transitioned to the government,pursuant to federal law,effective october.
globe filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on deveraturda warn act claim on march,which the district court granted,after hearing argument,on may.the court acknowledged the dearth of precedent but reasoned from the case it found most analogous,buck fdic,cir,where employees of a bank taken over by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic sued the fdic for warn act violations,that the warn act does not apply in the context of closures over which the employer has no control.in these circumstances,the court concluded,the layoffs are not effectively ordered by the employer,but by the government 
on may,deveraturda sought leave to file an amended complaint to allege that globe had more than days notice from the federal government of its intention to replace globe private airport security with federal employees,and that globe provided warn act notice to employees at other airports in california,but not at sjc.the district court found the additional allegations insufficient to fix the infirmity in the original complaint,and denied the motion.deveraturda timely appeals both rulings.

this appeal turns entirely on what the warn act covers.
deveraturda focuses on its provide protection to workers,their families and communities by requiring employers to provide notification calendar days in advance of mass layoffs.advance notice provides workers and their families some transition time to adjust to the prospective loss of employment,to seek and obtain alternative jobs and,if necessary,to enter skill training or retraining that will allow these workers to successfully compete in the job market.childress darby lumber,cir citing.he argues that it is enough that globe was his employer,and laid him off without the required notice.he also maintains that there is no blanket government takeover exemption,but rather application of the warn act depends upon the amount of government control and whether the employer had notice of the takeover.see hotel employees and restaurant employees int l union local elsinore shore,cir.further,deveraturda contends that this case is more analogous to cases such as halkias general dynamics,cir and loehrer mcdonnell douglas,cir,where courts have held the employer responsible for violating the warn act,than to cases such as buck.
like the district court,globe draws on closures of failed savings and loan institutions where courts have found the warn act inapplicable.globe maintains that cases such as buck indicate that takeovers,outside of the control of the employer,are not covered.in its view,this case fits that mold because it is undisputed that the federal government federalized private airport screening therefore,globe submits,as a private employer it did not order a mass layoff of screening personnel and so is not subject to the warn act.
we start with the statutory language 
an employer shall not order a plant closing or mass layoff until the end of a period after the employer serves written notice of such an order 
to each representative of the affected employees as of the time of the notice or,if there is no such representative at that time,to each affected employee and 
to the state or entity designated by the state to carry out rapid response activities under section a a of this title,and the chief elected official of the unit of local government within which such closing or layoff is to occur.
a.where the statute language is plain,the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.cleveland city of los angeles,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we believe the language of the warn act is it unambiguously provides that the act applies when an employer orders a mass layoff.there is no question here that the layoffs were the result of the federal government replacing private screeners with federal employees.the atsa,
