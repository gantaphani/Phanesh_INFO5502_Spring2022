this case returns to the court for the second time since.after the september bankruptcy of lehman brothers holdings,lehman,plaintiffs appellants plaintiffs brought suit on behalf of a putative class of former participants in an employee stock ownership plan esop invested exclusively in lehman common stock.plaintiffs alleged that defendants appellees plan committee defendants or benefit committee defendants,who were fiduciaries of this esop,breached their duty of prudence under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,by continuing to permit investment in lehman stock in the face of circumstances arguably foreshadowing its eventual demise.plaintiffs also alleged that lehman former directors,including lehman former chairman and chief executive officer,defendant appellee richard fuld defendant fuld,violated erisa by failing to keep the plan committee defendants apprised of material,nonpublic information that could have affected their evaluation of the prudence of investing in lehman stock 
applying the presumption of prudence articulated in moench robertson,cir,and adopted by this court in in re citigroup erisa litigation,cir,the united states district court for the southern district of new york kaplan,judge dismissed plaintiffs consolidated amended complaint cac and second consolidated amended complaint scac for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b.on july,we affirmed the district court dismissal of both the cac and scac while also applying the moench presumption,concluding that plaintiffs had failed to plausibly allege that the benefit committee defendants knew or should have known that lehman was an imprudent investment given the mixed signals with which the fiduciaries grappled.rinehart akers,cir.
nearly a year later,on june,the supreme court of the united states held in fifth third bancorp dudenhoeffer that esop fiduciaries are not entitled to any special presumption of prudence.on july,the supreme court granted plaintiffs petition for a writ of certiorari,vacated the judgment in rinehart,and remanded the case to our court for further consideration in light of fifth third.rinehart akers.we,in turn,remanded the case to the district court,and the district court allowed plaintiffs to replace the scac with a third consolidated amended complaint tcac that narrowed their claims and shortened the class period.
on july,the district court dismissed the tcac,again holding that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim under rule b.in re lehman.sec.erisa,d.though recognizing that fifth third abrogated the moench presumption of prudence formerly governing erisa claims in this circuit,the district court nonetheless concluded that plaintiffs failed to allege sufficiently that the plan committee defendants violated their erisa fiduciary duties as measured by the twombly and iqbal pleading standards.id.at.
the central purpose of erisa is to protect beneficiaries of employee benefit plans.slupinski first unum life ins,cir.to further this purpose,erisa imposes on fiduciaries a duty to act in a prudent manner under the circumstances then prevailing.pension benefit guar.ex rel.vincent catholic med.ctrs.ret.plan morgan stanley inv,cir quoting a b.we have long measured this duty according to the objective prudent person standard developed in the common law of trusts,katsaros cody,cir internal quotation marks omitted,and have emphasized that erisa fiduciary duty of care requires prudence,not prescience,pension benefit guar,at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.
in fifth third,the supreme court rejected the presumption that we previously applied when analyzing the prudence of an esop fiduciary decision to buy or hold an employer stock.at.prior to fifth third,we held that an esop fiduciary who invests the esop assets in employer stock is entitled to a presumption that it acted consistently with erisa in doing so.moench robertson,cir see also in re citigroup erisa,cir adopting the moench presumption in the second circuit because it provides the best accommodation between the competing erisa values of protecting retirement assets and encouraging investment in employer stock.fifth third,however,held unequivocally that the law does not create a special presumption favoring esop fiduciaries.fifth third.at.instead,the same standard of prudence applies to all erisa fiduciaries,including esop fiduciaries,except that an esop fiduciary is under no duty to diversify the esop holdings.id.
despite rejecting any special presumption of prudence for esop fiduciaries,fifth third made clear that where a stock is publicly traded,allegations that a fiduciary should have recognized from publicly available information alone that the market was over or undervaluing the stock are implausible as a general rule,at least in the absence of special circumstances.id.at.the court emphasized that erisa fiduciaries,who could reasonably see little hope of outperforming the market based solely on their analysis of publicly available information may,as a general matter,prudently rely on the market price.id.first alteration in original quoting halliburton erica john fund.the court specifically declined to consider whether a plaintiff could nonetheless plausibly allege imprudence on the basis of publicly available information by pointing to a special circumstance affecting the reliability of the market price as an unbiased assessment of the security value in light of all public information that would make reliance on the market valuation imprudent.id.at quoting halliburton.at.
for claims alleging breach of the duty of prudence on the basis of nonpublic information,fifth third held that a plaintiff must plausibly allege an alternative action that the defendant could have taken that would have been consistent with the securities laws and that a prudent fiduciary in the same circumstances would not have viewed as more likely to harm the fund than to help it.id.the court identified three considerations pertinent to this analysis 
c ourts must bear in mind that the duty of prudence,under erisa as under the common law of trusts,does not require a fiduciary to break the law 
c ourts should consider the extent to which an obligation either to refrain on the basis of inside information from making a planned trade or to disclose inside information to the public could conflict with the complex insider trading and corporate disclosure requirements imposed by the federal securities laws or with the objectives of those laws 
c ourts should also consider whether the complaint has plausibly alleged that a prudent fiduciary in the defendant position could not have concluded that stopping purchases which the market might take as a sign that insider fiduciaries viewed the employer stock as a bad investment or publicly disclosing negative information would do more harm than good to the fund by causing a drop in the stock price and a concomitant drop in the value of the stock already held by the fund.
it did not take long for a third case to reach the high court.harris amgen,was a class action brought by participants in an employee benefit plan alleging breaches of fiduciary duties under erisa when the trustees of the plan allowed continued investment in the employer stock despite allegedly knowing that its price was artificially inflated as a result of improper drug marketing and sales.cir,rev.per curiam.on remand from the supreme court,the ninth circuit reasoned that the plaintiffs complaint adequately alleged claims under fifth third because,in light of the fact that the federal securities laws require disclosure of material information,it is quite plausible that defendants could remove the amgen common stock fund from the list of investment options without causing undue harm to plan participants.id.at.
the supreme court accepted the possibility that removing the amgen common stock fund from the list of investment options might be an alternative action that could plausibly have satisfied fifth third standards.amgen.at.nevertheless,the court reversed the ninth circuit because plaintiffs failed to plead facts and allegations supporting that proposition.id.
