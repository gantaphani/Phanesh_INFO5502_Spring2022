in this case,we consider whether the district court properly dismissed a consumer class action pursuant to an arbitration agreement between and its customers.we hold that the agreement class action waiver is substantively unconscionable and therefore unenforceable under oregon law.we also note that under the agreement the waiver is not severable.we reverse the district court order dismissing the case pending arbitration.
procedural and factual background 
paul stewart and ellen chalk bought a lan pc card card,a device manufactured by sony ericsson mobile communications usa,sony that enables computers to connect wirelessly to the internet,from usa.plaintiffs also signed a service agreement with.the service agreement provided 
by signing this form or activating or using service i acknowledge and agree that 
this is my contract with usa.for wireless services.my contract is called a service agreement and it includes this document,the separate terms and conditions,and my rate plan information.the terms and conditions are in my welcome guide or were otherwise provided to me at the time of sale.
by signing,i acknowledge that i have received and read this document,the terms and conditions,and my rate plan information 
i understand that the service agreement affects my and legal rights.among other things,it 
requires mandatory arbitration of disputes 
requires mandatory waiver of the right to jury trial and waiver of any ability to participate in a class action 
the box containing the card and welcome guide was sealed with a label that stated 
read the enclosed terms conditions.by using service,you agree to be bound by the terms conditions,including the mandatory arbitration and early termination fee provisions.
the first paragraph of the terms and conditions instructs purchasers to read the terms carefully and advises those who do not agree to refrain from using the service or the unit.section three of the terms and conditions contains a mandatory arbitration clause,which provides that the parties will arbitrate all claims,and,in doing so,will follow the american arbitration association published wireless industry arbitration rules.the clause states that each party agrees to pay its own other fees,costs and expenses including those for counsel,experts,and witnesses.
that section also contains a class action waiver and a severability clause 
neither you nor we may be representative of other potential claimants or a class of potential claimants in any dispute you and we acknowledge and agree that this waives any right to a jury trial or participation as a plaintiff in a class action.if a court or arbitrator determines that your waiver of your ability to pursue class or representative claims is unenforceable,the arbitration agreement will not apply and our dispute will be resolved by a court of appropriate jurisdiction should any other provision of this arbitration agreement be deemed unenforceable,that provision shall be removed,and the agreement shall otherwise remain binding.
for approximately three weeks after the purchase of the card,plaintiffs were able to insert it into their ibm thinkpad laptop computer thinkpad and connect to the internet without any difficulty.they then did not attempt to use the card again for a few months,at which time they were unable to insert the card into their thinkpad.they contacted technical support several times and received refurbished cards on three separate occasions.they could not,however,insert any of the refurbished cards into the.after they were unable to insert the third card,staff from technical support informed plaintiffs that they would have to pursue the issue at the store where they purchased the original card.at the store,a sony representative attempted to insert the card and he failed to succeed in this task as well.he then promised to contact plaintiffs about how to solve the problem.plaintiffs never heard back from him,despite multiple email inquiries.
ultimately,plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit in federal district court against and sony.plaintiffs alleged violations of various federal and state laws,including oregon unlawful trade practices act utpa,or.stat,the federal warranty act,and the federal lanham act,a.plaintiffs also raised a number of common law theories of liability,including negligence,unjust enrichment,fraud by concealment,negligent misrepresentation,breach of implied warranties,breach of express warranty,breach of implied warranty of merchantability,and breach of implied warranty of fitness.the complaint alleged that defendants knew or should have known that the card was not compatible did not fit into the ibm thinkpad laptop computers,and that defendants allowed customers to purchase cards and enter into service contracts from which consumers would receive no benefit without a compatible card.
three months after plaintiffs filed their lawsuit,defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case or stay proceedings and compel arbitration under the federal arbitration act,et faa.plaintiffs opposed the motion,contending that the arbitration clause was unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.the district court granted defendants motion and dismissed the case.the court agreed with plaintiffs that the provision requiring each party to bear its own attorney fees was unconscionable because oregon utpa provides for prevailing party attorney fees,and severed that provision from the agreement the court rejected plaintiffs remaining arguments,however,including the argument that the prohibition against class actions was unconscionable,and concluded that plaintiffs were required to arbitrate their claims under the agreement plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal 
ii.standard of review and applicable law 
we review the district court ruling on the validity and scope of an arbitration clause de novo.shroyer new cingular wireless,cir.
the federal arbitration act provides that arbitration agreements shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.plaintiffs allege that arbitration agreement is unconscionable.as we have repeatedly recognized,unconscionability is a generally applicable contract defense that may render an agreement to arbitrate unenforceable.shroyer,at see also nagrampa mailcoups,cir en banc.
both parties recognize that unconscionability is governed by state this case,by oregon law.we must approximate state law as closely as possible and are bound by the pronouncements of the state highest court.ticknor choice hotels int l,cir quoting gee tenneco,cir.where the state supreme court has not yet decided an issue but there is relevant precedent from the state intermediate appellate court,the federal court must follow the state intermediate appellate court decision unless the federal court finds convincing evidence that the state supreme court likely would not follow it.ryman sears,roebuck and,cir emphasis omitted.
iii.analysis 
burden of production 
we begin by addressing defendants assertion that plaintiffs have not met their burden of producing evidence to support their claims of unconscionability.defendants claim that g overning law required plaintiffs to prove both that jurisdiction existed and that the arbitration agreement was burden plaintiffs failed to meet by failing to submit any competent evidence regarding any of the facts and circumstances in existence at the time the binding arbitration agreement was made.brief at.
under the oregon law of unconscionability,defendants argument is meritless.first,although t he party asserting unconscionability bears the burden of demonstrating that the arbitration clause in question is,in fact,unconscionable,motsinger lithia,oregon courts consider the contract itself to be evidence of unconscionability where the terms of the contract are unconscionable on their face.in motsinger,for example,the oregon court of appeals considered whether a contract provision requiring the plaintiff to submit all potential claims to arbitration without similarly binding the plaintiff employer was unconscionable.id.at.the court based its decision entirely on the terms of the provision.id.under defendants approach,however,this analysis would have been improper because it was not supported by evidence other than the contract terms at issue.likewise,in beneficial oregon,the oregon court of appeals considered the unconscionability of two different contract provisions by looking exclusively to the contract terms,without considering any other evidence.see id.at class action waiver id.at confidentiality provision.because the terms of arbitration agreement are properly before this court and provide evidence of unconscionability,plaintiffs have met their burden of production.
defendants reliance on motsinger is misplaced.motsinger involved an arbitration agreement that was silent as to how costs would be apportioned between the parties and no evidence was introduced as to what those costs were likely to be.motsinger,at.while the likely effect of a class action waiver,a confidentiality provision,or a agreement to arbitrate can be evaluated by reference to the terms of the contract alone,see motsinger,at,at,a contract silence regarding a particular issue provides little evidence as to the likely effect of that omission upon the plaintiff the contract simply presents a risk of unconscionability.in motsinger,the oregon court of appeals found that the mere possibility that the failure to apportion costs would result in hardship for the plaintiff was,in the absence of evidence suggesting that the plaintiff would in fact face a serious adverse consequence,insufficient to render the contract unconscionable.at.
here,plaintiffs allegations of unconscionability do not depend upon mere possibilities in the operation of the agreement it is undisputed that the arbitration agreement,among other provisions,waives the customer ability to participate in class actions,prohibits an award of attorney fees to a prevailing customer,and requires that all arbitrations be conducted according to the american arbitration association wireless industry arbitration rules.the likely effect of those provisions can be evaluated by looking to their terms alone.see id.at,at.accordingly,motsinger requirement of additional evidence is irrelevant here,and plaintiffs have met their burden of production.
unconscionability 
in assessing a claim of unconscionability,oregon courts consider both procedural and substantive unconscionability.see,at.although both forms of unconscionability are relevant,only substantive unconscionability is absolutely necessary.id.
procedural unconscionability 
procedural unconscionability focuses on two factors in contract formation oppression and surprise.motsinger,at.
oppression arises when there is inequality in bargaining power between the parties to a contract,resulting in no real opportunity to negotiate the terms of the contract and the absence of meaningful choice.surprise involves the extent to which the supposedly agreed terms were hidden from the party seeking to avoid enforcement of the agreement.
id.internal citations omitted.
in motsinger,the oregon court of appeals explained that a contract of agreement presented on a unequal bargaining power,but the adhesive nature of a contract standing alone is insufficient to render an agreement procedurally unconscionable.id.at.the court declined to find procedural unconscionability where an arbitration clause was not hidden or disguised and where the plaintiff was given time to read the documents before assenting to their terms.id.at a party is presumed to be familiar with the contents of any document that bears the person signature.internal quotations and citation omitted.
under the circumstances of the present case,the district court properly concluded that arbitration agreement is not procedurally unconscionable.the nature of agreement is insufficient to render it unenforceable.stewart signature appears on the service agreement below the arbitration clause and class action of which are featured in boldface and uppercase text.although plaintiffs are correct that the welcome guide contained additional terms,the box containing the device and welcome guide was sealed with a label that brought the terms and conditions to the buyer attention.to access the equipment,plaintiffs were required to break the seal of the label.under these circumstances,there is insufficient evidence of oppression or surprise to render the agreement procedurally unconscionable under oregon law.
substantive unconscionability 
the arbitration agreement,while not procedurally unconscionable,was adhesive and therefore reflected an underlying inequality in the parties ability to bargain.see,best bank of oregon,or,see also,at.because oregon law does not require that a contract exhibit procedural unconscionability in order to be invalid,see,at o nly substantive unconscionability is absolutely necessary,we must still determine whether the terms of arbitration agreement are unfairly onesided.to determine whether the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs claims pending arbitration,we must consider whether the arbitration clause is rendered unconscionable when the disparity in bargaining power reflected in the clause adhesive nature is combined with terms that are unreasonably favorable to the party with the greater power.motsinger,at internal quotations and citation omitted see also carey lincoln loan,although there is no evidence of trickery or deceit,as there often is in unconscionability cases,the gross inequality in knowledge and bargaining power is sufficient to require us to consider the substance of the challenged provisions.thus,if the terms of the agreement are unreasonably favorable to,the agreement may be unenforceable despite its lack of procedural unconscionability.
plaintiffs allege that numerous provisions of the arbitration agreement are substantively unconscionable,but we need address only one to resolve the present dispute.in an opinion issued after the district court order in this case,the oregon court of appeals held that a class action waiver in an arbitration provision may be substantively unconscionable,at.applying,we conclude that the class action waiver in the present case is substantively unconscionable and unenforceable under oregon law.
the court explained that a class action waiver in a consumer contract is unreasonably favorable to a company like for two distinct reasons.first,such a waiver is inherently when contained in a consumer contract.id.even if the waiver on its face applies equally to both parties,it is entirely unilateral in effect.wryly noting the literary passage that the majestic equality of the laws forbid s rich and poor alike to sleep under the bridges,to beg in the streets,and to steal their bread,the oregon court of appeals observed,although the arbitration rider with majestic equality forbids lenders as well as borrowers from bringing class actions,the likelihood of the lender seeking to do so against its own customers is as likely as the rich seeking to sleep under bridges.id.quoting anatole france,the red lily winifred stephens,frederic chapman.
second,a consumer class action waiver frequently prevents individuals from vindicating their rights.a ban on class action denies plaintiffs a crucial opportunity without which many meritorious claims would simply not be filed because the cost of pursuing each claim individually outweighs the potential relief.id.at.the policy at the very core of the class action mechanism is to overcome the problem that small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to bring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights.id.quoting amchem products windsor,d.as explained,by preventing consumers from pursuing small but meritorious claims a class action waiver gives defendant s a virtual license to commit,with impunity,millions of dollars worth of fraud.id.at.
like the supreme courts of california and washington,see discover bank superior court,cal th,d,scott cingular wireless,the court declared that a class action waiver in a contract where individual damages are likely to be small is substantively unconscionable as a matter of state contract law.because defendants have presented no convincing evidence that oregon supr
