after the failure of a settlement in a case brought by a group of employees of gristede supermarkets,the plaintiff employees moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether john catsimatidis,the chairman and ceo of gristede foods,could be held personally liable for damages.the case turns on whether catsimatidis is an employer under the fair labor standards act flsa,d,and the new york labor law nyll,lab.law.the united states district court for the southern district of new york crotty,granted partial summary judgment for the plaintiffs on the issue,establishing that catsimatidis would be held jointly and severally liable for damages along with the corporate defendants.see torres gristede operating,civ.pac,wl,torres iii.catsimatidis appeals.we affirm the district court decision so far as it established that catsimatidis was an employer under the flsa we vacate and remand the grant of partial summary judgment on plaintiffs nyll claims.
background 
catsimatidis is the chairman,president,and ceo of gristede foods,which operates between and stores in the new york city metro area and has approximately employees.although a series of mergers and acquisitions has complicated the question of which companies are responsible for the gristede business and supermarkets,the parties have not made corporate structure the focus of this case.they essentially agree that catsimatidis is the owner and corporate head of all implicated companies,but they dispute the manner and degree of his control over the stores and employees.
in,a group of and former employees of gristede supermarkets sued several companies involved in operating the stores.the employees also sued three individual defendants catsimatidis,gristede district manager james monos,and gristede vice president gallo balseca.the district court certified a class composed of a ll persons employed by defendants as department managers or co managers who were not paid proper overtime premium compensation for all hours that they worked in excess of forty in a workweek any time between april,and the date of final judgment in this matter the class period.torres gristede operating,civ.pac,wl,at,torres i quotation marks omitted.in this decision,the court noted that the parties disputed the duties of and department managers,though the scope of plaintiffs duties are not at issue in this appeal.
after years of litigation,the district court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs on their flsa and nyll claims,which concerned reduction of hours,withholding of overtime,misclassification as exempt employees,and retaliation.see torres gristede operating,d,torres ii.the court held that plaintiffs were entitled to liquidated damages,the amount of which would be determined in future proceedings.id.at.plaintiffs reserved the right to move separately for a determination that the individual defendants were individually liable as joint employers.id.at.
following the summary judgment order,the parties reached a settlement agreement,which the district court approved.the corporate defendants later defaulted on their payment obligations under the agreement.defendants sought to modify the settlement,but the district court denied their request.plaintiffs then moved for partial summary judgment on catsimatidis personal liability as an employer.
the district court granted the motion for reasons both stated on the record at the conclusion of oral argument on the motion,see special app x at,and memorialized in a written decision,see torres iii.the reasons included the fact that catsimatidis hired managerial employees,signed all paychecks to the class members,had the power to close or sell gristede stores,and routinely review ed financial reports,work ed at his office in gristede corporate office and generally preside d over the day to day operations of the company.torres iii,wl,at.according to the district court,f or the purposes of applying the total circumstances test,it does not matter that catsimatidis has delegated powers to others w hat is critical is that catsimatidis has those powers to delegate.id.citation omitted.the court concluded that t here is no area of gristede which is not subject to catsimatidis control,whether or not he chooses to exercise it,and that,therefore,catsimatidis had operational control and,as such,may be held to be an employer.id.at 
definition of employer under the flsa 
the supreme court has recognized that broad coverage under the flsa is essential to accomplish the statute goal of outlawing from interstate commerce goods produced under conditions that fall below minimum standards of decency.tony susan alamo found.sec y of labor.accordingly,the court has consistently construed the act liberally to apply to the furthest reaches consistent with congressional direction.id.quotation marks omitted.the common law agency test was found too restrictive to encompass the broader definition of the employment relationship contained in the flsa.frankel bally,cir.instead,the statute defines the verb employ expansively to mean suffer or permit to work.nationwide mut.ins.darden,quoting g.unfortunately,however,the statute definition of employer relies on the very word it seeks to define employer includes any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee.d.the statute nowhere defines employer in the first instance.
the supreme court noted early on that the flsa contains no definition that solves problems as to the limits of the relationship under the act.rutherford food mccomb.the court has also observed that the striking breadth of the flsa definition of employ stretches the meaning of employee to cover some parties who might not qualify as such under a strict application of traditional agency law principles in order to effectuate the remedial purposes of the act.barfield,at quoting darden,at internal citation omitted.
accordingly,the court has instructed that the determination of whether an relationship exists for purposes of the flsa should be grounded in economic reality rather than technical concepts.id.quoting goldberg whitaker house.the economic reality test applies equally to whether workers are employees and to whether managers or owners are employers.see herman rsr sec.servs,cir.
t he determination of the employment relationship does not depend on such isolated factors as where work is done or how compensation is divided but rather upon the circumstances of the whole activity.rutherford,at.some early cases concerned managerial efforts to distance themselves from workers in an apparent effort to escape the flsa coverage.for example,in goldberg,the supreme court considered whether a manufacturing cooperative was an employer of homeworker members who created knitted and embroidered goods in their homes and were paid by the month on a basis.at.the court concluded that this constituted an relationship because management authority made the device of the cooperative too transparent to survive the statutory definition of employ and the regulations governing homework.id.at.in short,if the economic reality rather than technical concepts is to be the test of employment,these homeworkers are employees.id.internal citations omitted.similarly,the court noted in rutherford that w here the work done,in its essence,follows the usual path of an employee,putting on an independent contractor label does not take the worker from the protection of the act.at.
the second circuit has treated employment for flsa purposes as a flexible concept to be determined on a basis by review of the totality of the circumstances we have identified different sets of relevant factors based on the factual challenges posed by particular cases.barfield,at.
in carter dutchess community college,cir,we identified factors that are likely to be relevant to the question of whether a defendant is an employer.in that case,prison inmates teaching classes in a program that was managed by a college claimed the college was their employer.the district court rejected this assertion because the college had only qualified control over the inmate instructors the department of correctional services always maintained ultimate control.barfield,at describing carter quotation marks omitted.this court,however,concluded that the ultimate control rule would not comport with the remedial purpose of the flsa,which congress intended to have the widest possible impact in the national economy.id.quoting carter,at.instead,we established four factors to determine the economic reality of an employment relationship whether the alleged employer had the power to hire and fire the employees,supervised and controlled employee work schedules or conditions of employment,determined the rate and method of payment,and maintained employment records.id.quoting carter,at 
barfield also discusses the factors this court has used to distinguish between independent contractors and employees,at citing brock superior care,cir,and to assess whether an entity that lacked formal control nevertheless exercised functional control over a worker,id.citing zheng liberty apparel,cir none of the factors used in any of these cases,however,comprise a rigid rule for the identification of an flsa employer.id.to the contrary,they provide a nonexclusive and overlapping set of factors to ensure that the economic realities test mandated by the supreme court is sufficiently comprehensive and flexible to give proper effect to the broad language of the flsa.id.quoting zheng,at.
individual liability 
none of the cases above dealt specifically with the question we confront here whether an individual within a company that undisputedly employs a worker is personally liable for damages as that worker employer.the only case from our circuit to confront the question squarely is rsr.rsr provided guards,screening,and other security services.it was sued for flsa violations with regard to its security guards.its chairman of the board,portnoy,was found by the district court after a bench trial to be an employer under the statute.we affirmed,in a decision that both applied the test from carter and noted other factors bearing upon the overarching concern of whether the alleged employer possessed the power to control the workers in question.id.at.
as background,we noted that a lthough portnoy exercised broad authority over rsr operations,he was not directly involved in the daily supervision of the security guards.id.at.nonetheless,because he was the only principal who had bank credit,he exercised financial control over the company.id.thus,he had authority over the operations manager,who directly supervised the guards.id.portnoy kept himself apprised of rsr operations by receiving periodic reports including work orders,memos,investigation reports,and invoices concerning the business operations,as well as weekly timesheets of a manager duties.id.at.he also referred a few individuals to rsr as potential security guard employees,assigned guards to cover specific clients,sometimes set the rates clients were charged for those services,gave a manager instructions about guard operations,and forwarded complaints about guards to a manager.id.
portnoy also signed payroll checks on at least three occasions and established a payment system by which clients who wanted undercover operatives would pay portnoy separate firm.id.additionally,portnoy represented himself to outside parties as being the boss of rsr by allowing his name to be used in sales literature,by representing to potential clients that he was a principal with control over company operations and by giving a manager instructions with respect to clients security needs.id.
we determined that at least three of the four carter factors applied.first,portnoy had hired employees,and although this involved mainly managerial staff,the fact that he hired individuals who were in charge of the guards was a strong indication of control.id.at.second,portnoy had,on occasion,supervised and controlled employee work schedules and the conditions of employment.id.third,he had participate d in the method of pay ing the guards,even though he was not involved in determining their salaries,because he had previously ordered a stop to the illegal pay practice of including security guards on forms as independent contractors,and he had the authority to sign paychecks throughout the relevant period.id.although there was no evidence that portnoy had been involved in maintaining employment records,we confirmed that the fact that this fourth factor is not met is not dispositive.id.the economic reality test encompasses the totality of circumstances,no one of which is exclusive.id.at.in sum,we determined that portnoy was not only a percent stockowner he had direct involvement with the security guard operations from time to time and was generally involved with all of rsr operations.id.at.
rsr also highlighted two legal questions relevant here.the first concerns the scope of an individual authority or operational control over a company at what level of a corporate hierarchy,and in what relationship with plaintiff employees,must an individual possess power in order to be covered by the flsa the second inquiry,related but distinct,concerns hypothetical versus actual power to what extent and with what frequency must an individual actually use the power he or she possesses over employees to be considered an employer 
operational control 
in addition to applying the carter test,rsr noted the district court recognition that portnoy exercised direct authority over the two persons most responsible for managing the security guards,as well as the fact that b ecause portnoy controlled the company financially,it was no idle threat when he testified that he could have dissolved the company if one of the managers had not followed his directions.id.at emphasis added.accordingly,we emphasized that we rejected portnoy argument that evidence showing his authority over management,supervision,and oversight of rsr affairs in general is irrelevant,and that only evidence indicating his direct control over the guards should be considered.id.we concluded that this formulation ignores the relevance of the totality of the circumstances in determining portnoy operational control of rsr employment of the guards.id.we also noted that operational control had been cited as relevant by other circuits considering the question of individual liability under the flsa.see id.
operational control is at the heart of this case.catsimatidis core argument is that he was a employee who made symbolic or,at most,general corporate decisions that only affected the lives of the plaintiffs through an attenuated chain of causation.although catsimatidis undisputedly possessed broad control over gristede corporate strategy,including the power to decide to take the company public,to open stores,and to carry certain types of merchandise,he contends that a flsa employer must exercise in a capacity.appellant br.at.by this,he appears to mean decisions about individual operations,close to,if not actually including,the particular working conditions and compensation practices of the employees themselves.plaintiffs counter that many cases have found individuals with operational control on a more general level to be employers.appellees br.at.
most circuits to confront this issue have acknowledged and plaintiffs do not dispute that a company owner,president,or stockholder must have at least some degree of involvement in the way the company interacts with employees to be a flsa employer.many cases rely on wirtz pure ice,cir,for this proposition.in wirtz,the court concluded that the individual defendant was not an employer even though he was the controlling stockholder and dominating figure because although he could have taken over and supervised the relationship between the corporation and its employees had he decided to do so,he did not.id.quotation marks omitted.the defendant visited the facility at issue a few times per year but had nothing to do with the hiring of the employees or fixing their wages or hours,and he left the matter of compliance with the fair labor standards act up to the various managers of the businesses in which he had an interest.id.at.the court noted,however,that if it were to consider a combination of stock ownership,management,direction and the right to hire and fire employees,then a contrary conclusion would be well supported.id.at.
in rsr,we cited three cases with holdings in accordance with wirtz in resolving the operational control issue.first,in donovan sabine irrigation,cir,the fifth circuit determined that an individual without an interest in the employer corporation could be held liable if he effectively dominates its administration or otherwise acts,or has the power to act,on behalf of the corporation its employees or if he lacked that power but independently exercised control over the work situation.the sabine court found the individual defendant liable because he indirectly controlled many matters traditionally handled by an employer in relation to an employee such as payroll,insurance,and income tax matters,noting also that the defendant financial gymnastics directly affected sabine employees by making it possible for sabine to meet its payroll and keep its employees supplied with the equipment and materials necessary to perform their jobs.id.at.quotation marks omitted.
second,in dole elliott travel tours,cir,the sixth circuit was unmoved by the protestations of an individual defendant who testified that he made major corporate decisions but did not have control of specific operations.the court found that the defendant responsibilities,which included determining employee salaries,constituted operational control of significant aspects of the corporation day to day functions.id.quotation marks omitted emphasis in original.
finally,in donovan agnew,cir,the first circuit imposed liability on individual defendants who together were president,treasurer,secretary and sole members of the board of the defendant company.one of the defendants had been personally involved in decisions about layoffs and employee overtime hours,and the defendants together had operational control of significant aspects of the corporation day to day functions,including compensation of employees,and personally made decisions to continue operations despite financial adversity during the period of nonpayment,id.at.
plaintiffs in our case place particular emphasis on the statement by the agnew court that t he overwhelming weight of authority is that a corporate officer with operational control of a corporation covered enterprise is an employer along with the corporation,jointly and severally liable under the flsa for unpaid wages.id.at.although this appears to suggest that any amount of corporate control is sufficient to establish flsa liability,the first circuit warned against taking the flsa coverage too far,noting that the act broadly inclusive definition of employer could,if t aken literally and applied in this context,make any supervisory employee,even those without any control over the corporation payroll,personally liable for the unpaid or deficient wages of other employees.id.at.
drawing on this language,the first circuit later concluded that individuals who had exercised some degree of supervisory control over the workers and been responsible for overseeing various administrative aspects of the business but had not demonstrated other important characteristics in particular,the personal responsibility for making decisions about the conduct of the business that contributed to the violations of the act were not personally liable under the flsa.baystate alternative staffing,herman,cir.the court rejected an expansive application of the definition of an employer that would find that the significant factor in the personal liability determination is simply the exercise of control by a corporate officer or corporate employee over the work situation.id.at.no other decision has gone as far as baystate most courts have endeavored to strike a balance between upholding the broad remedial goals of the statute and ensuring that a liable individual has some relationship with plaintiff employees work situation.
for example,in gray powers,cir,the court found that the of a company that owned a nightclub was not a bartender employer despite being a signatory on the corporate account and occasionally sign ing several pages of preprinted checks.the individual defendant had little control over the bar and its employees except to direct a bartender to serve certain customers on several occasions when he was at the bar.id.at.similarly,in patel wargo,cir,the eleventh circuit held that an individual who was both president and vice president of a corporation,as well as a director and principal stockholder,was not an employer because he did not have operational control of significant aspects of the company functions,including compensation of employees or other matters in relation to an employee.
by contrast,in reich circle investments,cir,the court found that a of a company that had invested in a nightclub had exercised sufficient control over the work situation as the driving force behind the company.the court cited evidence that the individual hired employees,gave them instructions including specific songs for dancers routines,and signed their payroll checks.id.he had also removed money from corporate safes,ordered one employee to refrain from keeping records of the,and spoke n for the company during the secretary investigation of possible flsa violations.id.
these cases reaffirm the logic behind our holding in rsr,which focused on defendant portnoy operational control of rsr employment of the guards,see rsr,at emphasis added,rather than simply operational control of the company.evidence that an individual is an owner or officer of a company,or otherwise makes corporate decisions that have nothing to do with an employee function,is insufficient to demonstrate employer status.instead,to be an employer,an individual defendant must possess control over a company actual operations in a manner that relates to a plaintiff employment.it is appropriate,as we implicitly recognized in rsr,to require some degree of individual involvement in a company in a manner that affects factors such as workplace conditions and operations,personnel,or compensation even if this appears to establish a higher threshold for individual liability than for corporate employer status.
the fundamental concern in the initial cases construing the flsa was preventing a business entity from causing workers to engage in work without the protections of the statute.it was an economic reality that the homework cooperative in goldberg functioned as the workers employer because it paid them to create clothing,even if the compensation structure technically circumvented concepts of formal employment.see goldberg,at stating that the court would be remiss if we construed the act loosely so as to permit this homework to be done in ways not permissible under the regulations see also united states rosenwasser,a worker is as much an employee when paid by the piece as he is when paid by the hour.this concern is not as pressing when considering the liability for damages of an individual within a company that itself is undisputedly the plaintiffs employer.
even in the context,however,the remedial nature of the flsa warrants an expansive interpretation of its provisions so that they will have the widest possible impact in the national economy.rsr,at quoting carter,at.nothing in rsr,or in the flsa itself,requires an individual to have been personally complicit in flsa violations the broad remedial purposes behind the statute counsel against such a requirement.the statute provides an empty guarantee absent a financial incentive for individuals with control,even in the form of delegated authority,to comply with the law,and courts have continually emphasized the extraordinarily generous interpretation the statute is to be given.nor is only evidence indicating an individual direct control over the plaintiff employees to be considered.rsr,at.instead,evidence showing an individual authority over management,supervision,and oversight of a company affairs in general is relevant to the totality of the circumstances in determining the individual operational control of the company employment of the plaintiff employees.id.
a person exercises operational control over employees if his or her role within the company,and the decisions it entails,directly affect the nature or conditions of the employees employment.although this does not mean that the individual employer must be responsible for managing plaintiff employees or,indeed,that he or she must have directly come into contact with the plaintiffs,their workplaces,or their schedules the relationship between the individual operational function and the plaintiffs employment must be closer in degree than simple but for causation.although the answer in any particular case will depend,of course,on the totality of the circumstances,the analyses in the cases discussed above,as well as the responsibilities enumerated in the carter factors,provide guidance for courts determining when an individual actions rise to this level.
ii.potential power 
in rsr,we noted that operational control need not be exercised constantly for an individual to be liable under the flsa 
employer status does not require continuous monitoring of employees,looking over their shoulders at all times,or any sort of absolute control of one employees.control may be restricted,or exercised only occasionally,without removing the employment relationship from the protections of the flsa,since such limitations on control do not diminish the significance of its existence.
at quotation marks and alteration omitted.the district court in this case appears to have relied on this language in stating that w hat is critical is that catsimatidis has certain powers to delegate and that t here is no area of gristede which is not subject to his control,whether or not he chooses to exercise it.torres iii,wl at.the parties also dispute the importance of evidence indicating that catsimatidis only rarely exercised much of the power he possessed.
employer power that is restricted or exercised only occasionally does not mean never exercised.in donovan janitorial services,cir,the fifth circuit noted that the company owner considerable investment in the company gives him ultimate,if latent,authority over its affairs,and the fact that he had exercised that authority only occasionally,through firing one employee,reprimanding others,and engaging in some direct supervision of johnson disposal drivers,does not diminish the significance of its existence.in superior care,this court noted that although representatives of the defendant business,a company,visited job sites only infrequently,the company had unequivocally expressed the right to supervise the nurses work,and the nurses were well aware that they were subject to such checks as well as to regular review of their nursing notes.at.an employer does not need to look over his workers shoulders every day in order to exercise control.id.similarly,in carter,we rejected the proposition that the community college was not employing prison inmates solely because the prison had ultimate control over the prisoners,reasoning that the community college also made decisions that affected the prisoners work.at.
the eleventh circuit has squarely held that even when a defendant could have played a greater role in the operations of the facility if he had desired.unexercised authority is insufficient to establish liability as an employer.alvarez perez sanford orlando kennel club,cir.the alvarez court found that an officer in a company that owned a kennel club was not an employer,in part because even though he might have had the authority to do so,he had not taken part in the operations of the facility,had not been involved in the supervision or hiring and firing of employees,and had not determined their compensation.id.
unlike alvarez,rsr does not state unambiguously that unexercised authority is insufficient to establish flsa liability,and we see no need to do so here in light of the evidence of the authority that catsimatidis did exercise.nonetheless,all of the cases discussed indicate that the manifestation of,or,at the least,a clear delineation of an individual power over employees is an important and telling factor in the economic reality test.ownership,or a stake in a company,is insufficient to establish that an individual is an employer without some involvement in the company employment of the employees.
ii.catsimatidis as employer 
using this economic reality test,we must decide whether catsimatidis is an employer under the flsa.see rsr,at.is there evidence showing his authority over management,supervision,and oversight of gristede affairs in general,see,as well as evidence under the carter framework or any other factors that reflect catsimatidis exercise of direct control over the plaintiff employees 
catsimatidis overall authority 
catsimatidis is the chairman,president,and ceo of gristede foods.joint app x he does not report to anyone else at gristede.id.at.catsimatidis personally owns the building in which gristede headquarters is located.id.at.his office is in that building,shared with charles criscuolo,gristede coo.id.at.catisimatidis was usually there for part of the day,at least four days a week.id.at.the human resources and payroll department is located in the same building.id.at.regarding his duties,catsimatidis testified i do the banking.i do the real estate.i do the financial i come up with concepts for merchandising i there every day if there is a problem,including problems with buildings,problems with the department of consumer affairs,governmental relations,and p roblems with vendors,relationships with vendors,it takes up most of the time.id.at.
a series of subordinate managers reported to catsimatidis but did not appear to have an extensive amount of interaction with him.catsimatidis spoke to criscuolo every day because they shared an office.id.at.catsimatidis testified that vice president gallo balseca runs operations and was in the stores every day,and that the district managers reported to balseca.id.at.balseca reported to criscuolo,but catsimatidis rarely spoke directly to balseca.id.at.catsimatidis testified that the company director of security reports to the chief operating officer on a basis,but if there is something he thinks i should know about,he would call and tell me.id.at.catsimatidis occasionally sat in on merchandising and operations meetings.id.at.
catsimatidis stayed apprised of how gristede was doing,reviewing the overall profit and loss statements as well as the sales to purchases statements of particular stores.he received weekly gross margin reports from all the perishable departments and a comprehensive p rofit and l oss report on a quarterly basis that he studied in depth and sometimes used to make general recommendations.id.at.as executive director of human resources and asset protection renee flores stated,if there is a store that buys more than they sell,and it a consistent thing,he may say,you know what,you might want to take a look at that,because they buying more than they selling.id.at.
catsimatidis testified that he made big picture merchandising decisions,like do we,for the next six months,push coca cola or push pepsi cola and the decisions on having pharmacies in the stores.id.at.he testified that after making this sort of decision,he would tell criscuolo or yell it out when they have the merchandising meeting in their shared office.id.at.he might also yell out to go out and do more sales.id.at.
in general,employees agreed,as executive vice president robert zorn testified,that catsimatidis has whatever privileges an owner of a company has to make ultimate decisions as to how the company is run,and that there was no reason to believe that if he chose to make a decision anybody there has the power to override him.id.at.they also agreed that catsimatidis has the power to shut down a store or sell a store if he felt that was the appropriate thing to do.id.at 
involvement with stores 
although catsimatidis did not exercise managerial control in stores on the level of a manager,the evidence demonstrates that he exercised influence in specific stores on multiple occasions.for example,he made suggestions regarding how products are displayed in stores.in general,he testified that he focused on driv ing sales,driv ing product,get ting more sales out of the stores through techniques such as buying a coca cola at the right price,and put ting it on a front end display at the right price.id.at.
catsimatidis testified specifically that when he used to go around the stores,he used to make comments to the store managers about displays,telling them,for example,if you put up this product,you might sell a week.id.at.he would make visits to five or ten stores on saturday mornings,staying about ten minutes in each one.id.he referred to these as just goodwill visit s,merchandising,sales,what are we doing right,what are we doing wrong,what can we do better.id.at.his deposition also contained the following exchange 
q why did you want to visit every store 
a to check the merchandising.
q ca the store managers take care of that themselves 
a if the store managers did it perfectly,then i would have to visit the stores.
q but you have a level of trust in the store managers,right 
a you hope so,yes.
q why do you think it was necessary for the president of the company to go around to all these stores 
a for the same reason sam walton went and visited his stores.
q what reason is that 
a you just get a better feeling for merchandising.sam walton was a great merchandiser.
q on the saturday morning visits to the stores,what did you do 
a i walked in,introduced myself to the manager,most of them i knew,and just we would talk about merchandising.i would say is this selling,is this not selling,are you missing any products that you think you should have and i would i felt i would get input from store managers on merchandising problems.
catsimatidis would also address problems that occurred in individual stores.for example,he testified that if a vendor called him and said there was a problem,m aybe that he was supposed to have a display and not have a display,he would not get involved personally but would refer the issue to criscuolo.id.at.catsimatidis testified that if a store did look clean,or if it was very cluttered,he would make the comment about it to the store manager,and then follow up and say it to criscuolo.id.at.on one occasion,he went to a store and was annoyed that a type of fish he tried to buy was not in stock,so he sent an to the meat director,copy to his boss,sent one to the store manager,and sent one to the district manager.id.at.catsimatidis commented that the emails were his attempt to bring it to their attention that the department looked bad and that he would hope the supervisor or the merchandisers would fix it.id.at.
additionally,catsimatidis testified that the company system automatically forwards him copies of any consumer complaints,which he then forwards by email to the responsible parties with a comment of what the hell is happening id.at.for example,he might forward a complaint about a store being dirty,and he sent a complaint about lids not fitting coffee cups to the deli director.id.he testified,i figured if they think i know about the problem,they work harder towards fixing it.id.at.when asked why this was,he said,i guess they want to keep the boss happy,and i want to keep the consumers happy,and that one of my jobs is how to get the consumers in our stores,and how to keep them in our stores.id.at.he has directed similar complaints to store managers.id.at.
mitchell moore,a former store manager,testified that catsimatidis asked him to get involved with a reset at a particular store,meaning an effort to change the store around,move items around the store,allocation,bring in new items.id.at.moore also testified that catsimatidis,while walking through a store,might want me to change a display around or to make it fuller or to put a different variety in there,or to put signs on certain items,give them a good deal on it if he wanted moore to push a particular item.id.at.zorn said that he had seen catsimatidis go to stores for grand openings or reopenings,walk up and down the aisles ask questions about you know,he sees a product that is new and asks,you know you know,who we buy that from and,you know,comments on the store decor,although zorn noted that catsimatidis was there more in a pr capacity than a management type capacity.id.at.
c.the carter factors 
the first element of the carter test considers whether the individual defendant had the power to hire and fire employees.barfield,at quotation marks omitted.the evidence demonstrates that catsimatidis possesses,but rarely exercises,the power to hire or fire anyone he chooses.he testified,i guess i can fire the people that directly report to me,which he said would include only maybe four or five employees such as the coo and cfo.joint app x.he testified in that he could not remember having fired anyone in five or six years.id.at.in rsr,we emphasized that the hiring and firing of individuals who were in charge of the plaintiff employees is a strong indication of control.rsr,at.
zorn testified that catsimatidis had hired him and obviously would have the authority to hire and fire others,but he does get involved in that.joint app x.for example,when zorn was involved in letting go employees for various reasons,he let catsimatidis know as a courtesy and fired the employees even if catsimatidis was happy about it.id.at.on one occasion when both zorn and catsimatidis interviewed a potential manager,catsimatidis was in favor of it but he left the decision to zorn.id.at.catsimatidis promoted deborah clusan from director of payroll to director of payroll and human resources.id.at.he promoted moore to store manager from night manager.moore testified that catsimatidis came to speak with me,asked me what my background was,and then the next day the vice president called me,and told me that i would be starting in the store the next day.id.at.moore,like other employees,indicated that he view ed catsimatidis as his boss and that catsimatidis would have the power to fire a store employee.id.at.
the second carter factor asks whether the individual defendant supervised and controlled employee work schedules or conditions of employment.barfield,at quotation marks omitted.plaintiffs overstate the importance of the two pieces of evidence on which they rely for this factor.although they state in their brief that catsimatidis said he has handled complaints from gristede workers union representatives every week for as long as i could remember,appellees br.at,this mischaracterizes catsimatidis testimony he stated that he had not been personally involved in union negotiations or discussions of problems,see joint app x.plaintiffs also assert that catsimatidis authorized an application for wage subsidies and tax credits on behalf of gristede employees.appellees br.at.the evidence reflects only that catsimatidis signed the application for tax credits to which gristede was entitled for employing people coming off of social services,off of welfare.joint app x at.moreover,plaintiffs do not indicate how this affected their work schedules or conditions of employment.although catsimatidis involvement in the company and the stores as discussed above demonstrates some exercise of operational control,it does not appear to relate closely to this factor of the carter test.
the third factor asks whether the individual defendant determined the rate and method of payment.barfield,at quotation marks omitted.the district court and plaintiffs emphasize the fact that catsimatidis electronic signature appears on paychecks.this like all factors is not dispositive.see gray,at.nonetheless,we held in rsr that t he key question is whether the defendant had the authority to sign paychecks throughout the relevant period,and he did.rsr,at.
