opinion of the court 
this putative class action was initiated by sandra babcock,a corrections officer at the butler county prison in butler,pennsylvania.babcock claims that butler county failed to properly compensate her and those similarly situated for overtime in violation of the fair labor standards act flsa,et.the flsa requires an employee who works a workweek longer than forty hours to be paid at least one and times the employee regular rate for the work performed over forty hours.a.
this appeal raises the issue of whether a portion of time for the butler county prison corrections officers meal periods is compensable under the flsa there is no provision of the flsa that directly addresses this issue.two tests have been suggested by other courts of appeal one looks to whether the employee has been relieved from all duties during the mealtime the other,more generally adopted,looks to the party to which the predominant benefit of the mealtime belongs.the district court noted that this circuit has not yet established a test to determine whether a meal period is compensable under the flsa.for the reasons set forth below,this court will adopt the predominant benefit test and affirm the district court.
many of the relevant facts are not disputed.a collective bargaining agreement cba between butler county and the employees who work at the butler county prison provides that corrections officers work eight and hour shifts that include a one hour meal period,of which minutes are paid and fifteen minutes are unpaid it is the lack of compensation for that fifteen minutes that is the subject of this action.during the meal period,the corrections officers may not leave the prison without permission from the warden or deputy warden,and they must remain in uniform,in close proximity to emergency response equipment,and on call to respond to emergencies.plaintiffs claim that as a result of this meal period policy,the officers can not run personal errands,sleep,breathe fresh air,or smoke cigarettes during mealtime,and if an emergency or unexpected situation arises,the officers must respond immediately in person,in uniform,and with appropriate response equipment.plaintiffs allege that because of these restrictions,they should be compensated for the full hour.
butler county filed a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing that the corrections officers meal periods were not compensable work because the officers received the predominant benefit of the meal period the district court agreed and dismissed the complaint.plaintiffs do not dispute the appropriateness of applying the predominant benefit test.rather,they argue that their pleadings establish a plausible claim for relief under either the predominant benefit test or the relieved from all duties test.
the predominant benefit tests asks whether the officer is primarily engaged in duties during meal periods.the majority of the courts of appeals have adopted this test.see,reich new england telecomm,cir roy cty.of lexington,cir bernard ibp,of,cir hill united states,cir alexander city of chicago,cir henson pulaski cty.sheriff dep t,cir armitage city of emporia,cir avery city of talladega,cir.plaintiffs cite only two cases that purportedly apply the relieved from all duties test kohlheim glynn and busk integrity staffing solutions,the court in neither case,however,actually applied that test.instead,the eleventh circuit in kohlheim applied its version of the predominant benefit test.at the firefighters are subject to real limitations on their freedom during mealtime which inure to the benefit of the county accordingly,the three mealtime periods are compensable under flsa regulations for overtime purposes.in busk,the ninth circuit identified the two tests but explained that t he distinction between the completely relieved from duty and predominant benefit standards d id not matter for th at case,which turn ed on whether the activities at issue we re compensable work.at.the supreme court reversed the ninth circuit decision in busk and focused the analysis on work as defined by the portal to portal act,d.in any event,the predominant benefit test is uncontroversial in the case before us neither party disputes that it is the appropriate standard.accordingly,we join our sister circuits in adopting the predominant benefit test.
courts have generally eschewed a literal reading of a department of labor regulation that provides that during a bona fide meal period 
t he employee must be completely relieved from duty for the purposes of eating regular meals the employee is not relieved if he is required to perform any duties,whether active or inactive,while eating.for example,an office employee who is required to eat at his desk or a factory worker who is required to be at his machine is working while eating.
a instead,courts have assessed the totality of the circumstances to determine,on a basis,to whom the benefit of the meal period inures.most courts derive this approach from supreme court precedent holding that w hether time is spent predominantly for the employer benefit or for the employee is a question dependent upon all the circumstances of the case.armour wantock,superseded on other grounds,portal to portal act of,stat,codified at.
thus,the predominant benefit test is necessarily a inquiry.for some courts,whether the employee is free to leave the premises is of particular importance.others emphasize the number of interruptions to which the employees are subject.as the eleventh circuit has stated,the essential consideration in determining whether a meal period is a bona fide meal period or a compensable rest period is whether the employees are in fact relieved from work for the purpose of eating a regularly scheduled meal.kohlheim,at.
here,although plaintiffs face a number of restrictions during their meal period,the district court correctly found that,on balance,these restrictions did not predominantly benefit the employer.in comparison to the cadre of case law addressing mealtime compensability in the law enforcement context,the allegations in plaintiffs complaint do not suffice.for example,the corrections officers here could request authorization to leave the prison for their meal period and could eat lunch away from their desks.in alexander city of chicago,in contrast,police officers were required to receive permission to take a meal period and were not permitted to read nondepartmental publications.
another factor to consider is the existence of the cba.we find helpful the decision of the seventh circuit in leahy city of chicago,a case initiated by chicago police officers seeking overtime pay the seventh circuit,like in the case before us,had before it a cba between the employees and the employer.in that case,the city of chicago faced an action brought by chicago police officers seeking overtime pay.in affirming the district court,the seventh circuit held that the cba sufficiently protected the officers right to overtime compensation.in this case,although the cba is silent on the compensability of the period,it provides corrections officers with the benefit of a mealtime and mandatory overtime pay if the mealtime is interrupted by work.as the seventh circuit stated,t he flsa requires no more.the cba,then,assumes that generally an officer is not working during a meal period,but provides for appropriate compensation when an officer actually does work during the meal.
the dissent argues that we have disregard ed supreme court precedent,inappropriately focused on a red herring the cba,and relied upon a factually inapposite and legally outdated case in our misguided approach to this case.dissenting op.at.in reality,our approach is consistent with the weight of precedent,considers the cba as one relevant though not dispositive factor,and merely comes to a different conclusion regarding the predominant benefit of the corrections officers uninterrupted mealtime period under the totality of the circumstances.although we find the seventh circuit analysis in leahy useful for comparison,the dissent is correct that the instant case is distinguishable,which is why,unlike the leahy court,we do no
