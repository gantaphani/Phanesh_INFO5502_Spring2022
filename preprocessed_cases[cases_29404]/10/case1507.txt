when an employee is terminated or resigns from his or her employment,final wages are generally due and payable immediately.section provides that,if an employer willfully fails to timely pay final wages,the wages of the employee shall continue as a penalty from the due date thereof at the same rate until paid or until an action therefor is commenced but the wages shall not continue for more than days,subd.a hereafter section a,italics added.a statute of limitations typically governs actions to recover penalties code civ,subd.a,but section further provides that an employee may sue for these penalties at any time before the expiration of the statute of limitations on an action for the wages from which the penalties arise,subd.b hereafter section b murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th,murphy t he legislature expressly provided that a suit seeking to enforce the section penalty would be subject to the same statute of limitations as an action to recover wages.
this case asks us to resolve two issues first,does a different statute of limitations apply when an employee seeks to recover only section penalties because,as in this case,final wages were paid albeit belatedly prior to the filing of the action,as opposed to when an employee seeks both final wages and penalties second,are section penalties recoverable as restitution under california unfair competition law ucl bus,et our answer to both questions is no.section b sets forth a single limitations period governing all actions to recover section penalties regardless of whether an employee seeks both unpaid wages and penalties or penalties alone.further,section penalties are not recoverable as restitution under the ucl because employees have no ownership interest in the funds.we accordingly reverse the court of appeal contrary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
facts and background 
plaintiff jorge pineda was employed by defendant bank of america he gave two weeks notice of his resignation,which occurred on may.defendant did not pay plaintiff his final wages on his last day,as required under section,but instead paid him on may,four days late.
plaintiff filed this action on october,seeking to represent a class of former bank of america employees whose final wages were untimely paid.the complaint asserts two causes of action.the first alleges defendant failed to timely pay plaintiff and class members final wages as required by section applying to employees who are terminated or section applying to employees who quit and seeks penalties pursuant to section.plaintiff second cause of action alleges defendant failure to timely pay final wages violates the ucl,and seeks restitution of unpaid section penalties.
the trial court granted defendant motion for judgment on the pleadings.it concluded that a statute of limitations code civ,subd.a applies when,as in this case,an employee files an action seeking only section penalties as opposed to an action seeking unpaid wages and section penalties thus,the trial court concluded,the time for plaintiff to file his action had expired.the trial court also concluded that section penalties are not recoverable as restitution under the ucl.the trial court denied plaintiff leave to amend to substitute a new plaintiff in the first cause of action.the court of appeal affirmed in all respects.we granted plaintiff petition for review 
discussion 
section b governs all actions for section penalties 
we first independently review the court of appeal construction of section.imperial merchant services,hunt cal th.in doing so,it is well settled that we must look first to the words of the statute,because they generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous our inquiry ends.if there is no ambiguity in the language,we presume the legislature meant what it said and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citations.in reading statutes,we are mindful that words are to be given their plain and commonsense meaning.citation.murphy,supra,cal th at.thus,we avoid a construction that would produce absurd consequences,which we presume the legislature did not intend.citations.people mendoza cal th.we have also recognized that statutes governing conditions of employment are to be construed broadly in favor of protecting employees.citations.murphy,at smith superior court cal th,smith purpose of is to compel prompt wage payment upon separation from employment.we therefore begin our inquiry by reviewing the pertinent statutory language.while section is obviously our primary focus,resolving this issue requires that we also be mindful of the statute interplay with several relevant provisions located in the code of civil procedure.
section a provides if an employer willfully fails to pay,without abatement or reduction,in accordance with sections,and,any wages of an employee who is discharged or who quits,the wages of the employee shall continue as a penalty from the due date thereof at the same rate until paid or until an action therefor is commenced but the wages shall not continue for more than days.italics added.code of civil procedure section,subdivision a provides that a statute of limitations applies to a n action upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture italics added.thus,if section a comprised the entire statute,a suit to recover its penalties would undoubtedly have to be filed within one year of the accrual of the cause of action.
however,code of civil procedure section acknowledges the legislature can,if it so chooses,prescribe a different statute of limitations to govern specific civil actions to that end,section b provides,suit may be filed for these penalties at any time before the expiration of the statute of limitations on an action for the wages from which the penalties arise.actions for final wages not paid as required by sections and are governed by code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,which provides that a statute of limitations applies to a n action upon a liability created by statute,other than a penalty or forfeiture.
as we noted in murphy,supra,cal th at page,in enacting section b the legislature obviously intended to alter the statute of limitations that would otherwise have applied to actions to recover section penalties.indeed,no one disputes that when an employee sues to recover both unpaid final wages and the resulting section penalties,the suit is governed by the same limitations period that would apply had the employee sued to recover only the unpaid wages.the disputed issue in this case is whether a different statute of limitations applies to an action to recover section penalties when,as here,an employee sues to recover only section penalties.
plaintiff urges us to conclude the legislature intended for a single statute of limitations the one set forth in section b to govern the filing of any and all suits for section penalties,regardless of whether a claim for unpaid final wages accompanies the claim for penalties.he contends this is the only plausible construction of section,and his contention has merit.absent explicit statutory language to the contrary,common sense would suggest that,where the legislature has set forth a statute of limitations in one part of a statute,the prescribed limitations period governs the filing of actions provided for in another part of the same statute.in providing when s uit may be filed for section penalties b,the legislature could have employed language unambiguously limiting the application of section b limitations period to those suits that seek both unpaid wages and penalties.for example,it could have provided that s uit for unpaid final wages and these penalties may be filed at any time before it did not.
urging this court to adopt a contrary interpretation,defendant contends the legislature did explicitly provide that an action to recover only section penalties is not governed by section b.defendant relies on the phrase action for the wages from which the penalties arise,arguing this language demonstrates the legislature intended for section b to apply only when a claim for penalties is accompanied by a claim for unpaid final wages.defendant reasons that when an employee sues for section penalties alone because his or her final wages have been paid,albeit late,there is no action for the wages from which the penalties arise and section b is thus inapplicable.accordingly,defendant concludes,the limitations period that generally applies to actions for penalties controls.the court of appeal,relying on mccoy superior court th,mccoy,adopted this reasoning.we conclude,however,that this is an unreasonable reading of the statutory language.
defendant interpretation misapprehends the purpose of the provision reference to the statute of limitations on an action for the wages from which the penalties arise.the only plausible inference to be drawn is that the legislature intended to ensure that the statute of limitations on an action for section penalties tracks the statute of limitations governing actions for unpaid final wages.in so doing,the legislature wanted to make certain employees would not face different limitations periods for claims that arise out of the same underlying facts,nonpayment of final wages,and that would usually,but not always,be asserted in the same suit.the language offers the additional benefit of maintaining consistency in the event of future statutory alteration.by generally referencing the statute of limitations for unpaid final wages,rather than specifically providing that section penalties are governed by a statute of limitations,the statute ensures that any changes by a future legislature to the limitations period governing unpaid final wages would automatically change the limitations period governing section penalties without any need to amend the statute.
moreover,defendant interpretation ignores the legislature grammatical choices specifically,its use of definite and indefinite articles in section b.use of the indefinite articles a or an signals a general reference,while use of the definite article the or these in the instance of plural nouns refers to a specific person,place,or thing.garner,the redbook a manual on legal style ed.in section b,the use of the definite article the before statute of limitations and the indefinite article an before action for the wages supports plaintiff,rather than defendant,construction.section b reads suit may be filed for these penalties at any time before the expiration of the statute of limitations on an action for the wages from which the penalties arise.italics added.the italicized language suggests the legislature was referring to the specific limitations period governing any and all suits for unpaid final wages,not a particular suit filed by an employee for unpaid final wages by contrast,had the legislature used the definite article the before actions for the wages,as in suit may be filed for these penalties at any time before the expiration of the statute of limitations on the action for the wages from which the penalties arise,it would suggest the legislature was referring to a specific suit for unpaid final wages filed by an employee who seeks section penalties as well 
finally,adopting defendant interpretation would undermine the purposes of limitations periods.as we have recently explained,statutes of limitations serve a number of functions including to prevent stale claims,give stability to transactions,protect settled expectations,promote diligence,encourage the prompt enforcement of substantive law,and reduce the volume of litigation.citations.stockton citizens for sensible planning city of stockton cal th.to that end,a limitations period necessarily fix es a definite period of time citation norgart upjohn cal th,and begins to run when a cause of action has accrued,that is,when the cause is complete with all of its elements.citations.fox ethicon cal th,see black law dict.ed.
under defendant construction,it is unclear what limitations period begins to run when a section claim accrues,nor is it clear how fixed and definite the period is.an illustration reveals the problems with defendant interpretation.assume three employees a,b,and all three leave their jobs on the same day and their employers fail to pay them their final wages as required by sections and.a employer never pays the owed wages and so a can,any time before three years have expired,timely file suit for both unpaid final wages and the days of accumulated section penalties.by contrast,b employer pays the owed final wages,albeit six months late.as a result,no claim for unpaid wages remains and,under defendant construction,the limitations period that once would have governed b available section claim is now,six months after the statute of limitations began to run,a limitations period.finally,c employer pays the final wages over a year after they were due.no claim remains for the now paid final wages and,as defense counsel acknowledged at oral argument,c would no longer have a claim for section penalties,as more than a year has passed since the claim initially accrued defendant interpretation would,at best,lead to unwieldy and inconsistent results eroding the stability that statutes of limitation are intended to afford at worst,defendant construction would risk permitting employers to game the system and control what limitations period governs their employees section claims.absent explicit evidence to the contrary,we presume the legislature did not intend such an absurd result.see smith,supra,cal th at.
in light of the unambiguous statutory language,as well as the practical difficulties that would arise under defendant interpretation,we conclude there is but one reasonable construction section b contains a single,limitations period governing all actions for section penalties irrespective of whether an employee claim for penalties is accompanied by a claim for unpaid final wages.we accordingly disapprove mccoy,supra,th.
even if defendant interpretation constituted a plausible alternative reading of the statutory language,requiring us to examine extrinsic evidence of the legislature intent,such as legislative history,we would still conclude plaintiff construction is the correct one.the legislature first enacted a civil penalty provision similar to section in.stats,ch.like section,the act provided that,when an employer failed to timely pay final wages,the employee wages would continue as a penalty until paid,up to days.stats,ch.in,the legislature repealed the then existing law,but adopted essentially the same provisions in a new act.stats,ch,see smith,supra,cal th at,fn.at the time,the bureau of labor statistics bls was the agency that recommended and enforced such legislation.citation.smith,at.for that reason,we have previously consulted its biennial reports for whatever light they may shed regarding the purpose of the wage payment legislation.see people ex rel.lungren superior court cal th,although not necessarily controlling,the contemporaneous administrative construction of a statute by those charged with its enforcement and interpretation is entitled to great weight.smith,at.the bureau of labor statistics bls biennial reports demonstrate the penalty provision was intended to induce,if not to compel,the employer to keep faith with his employee and to rectify a wrong which not only injures the employee but is an injury to the public in its tendency to deprive the public of an incidental benefit which comes from the employee labor.citation.bls,biennial.the bls views confirm the penalty provision was seen as an important tool in ensuring prompt wage payment.
then,in,as part of the act establishing the labor code,section was enacted stats,ch.the first iteration of section consisted of a single paragraph containing language virtually identical to that present in the current section a in its original form,section contained no reference to a statute of limitations and,thus,actions for its authorized penalties were governed by code of civil procedure section,which then,as now,set forth a statute of limitations for actions seeking penalties stats,ch.thus,if an employer failed to timely pay final wages to an employee who quit or was fired the employee would have had one year to sue for the section penalties but,under code of civil procedure se
