claude grant,oralene day,princess martindale,faletha reid,darryl mckibbens,darrel gant,antonio mckissack,pamela tucker,and sandra derrick the plaintiffs brought suit against their employer,the metropolitan government of nashville and davidson county metro,on their own behalf and on behalf of a class of all similarly situated employees,alleging that they were discriminated against on account of their race.after a trial on most of the issues,the jury found in favor of metro.the plaintiffs then moved for a new trial pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,arguing that the verdicts were against the clear weight of the evidence and that the proceedings were prejudiced by the conduct of metro counsel.relying on these grounds,the district court granted the plaintiffs motion.
metro has appealed the grant of the rule motion and has filed a petition for a writ of mandamus that requests us to reinstate the jury verdicts and order the district court to rule on the claims that were reserved for the court to decide.for the reasons set forth below,we dismiss metro appeal as premature,grant the petition for a writ of mandamus to the extent of directing the district court to rule on the outstanding claims within days from the filing of this opinion and prior to any retrial,deny the remainder of the petition,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the plaintiffs contend that metro discriminates against its employees in how it allocates job assignments,promotions,salaries,accommodations,discipline,and other aspects of employment.all but one of the named plaintiffs are current employees in metro water services division,and all raised claims of disparate treatment,disparate impact,and exposure to a hostile work environment.in addition,the plaintiffs moved for and were granted class certification by the district court.they subsequently raised class claims on behalf of past,present,and future employees of metro water department from january,to present.
the case went to trial in april and lasted nine days,with the plaintiffs raising more than separate claims for relief.evidence at the trial consisted of testimony from the individual plaintiffs,competing expert witnesses who presented statistical analyses of metro personnel decisions,and current metro employees who were involved in employment decisions.in addition,numerous internal documents were admitted as exhibits.
toward the end of the trial,the district court granted metro motion that requested the court,rather than the jury,to decide the plaintiffs claims.the remaining claims were submitted to the jury,which returned verdicts for metro on all of them.presumably because the plaintiffs claims have yet to be resolved,the district court never entered a final judgment in the case,although the court did enter a order dismissing with prejudice the claims and reserving decision on the claims.
roughly two weeks after the jury returned its verdicts,the plaintiffs moved for a new trial pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,specifically requesting relief on the class claims for intentional discrimination and each of the eight individual claims for intentional discrimination.the motion alleged that the jury verdicts were against the clear weight of the evidence and that metro counsel had unfairly prejudiced the proceedings.ten months later,the district court granted the motion for a new trial.the court relied on the same two grounds that the plaintiffs had raised in their motion,although the court order discussed evidence and incidents of alleged prejudicial behavior by metro counsel that the plaintiffs had not mentioned.on the other hand,the court did not specify the claims to which the order applied,stating only that plaintiffs motion for a new trial on their individual and class claims should be granted.
metro filed a notice of appeal with the district court and,contemporaneously,a petition for a writ of mandamus with this court.we subsequently consolidated the mandamus petition with metro direct appeal,ordered the plaintiffs to file a response to the petition,and invited the district court judge to respond if he wished to do so.the district court declined to respond to the petition.
on appeal,metro argues that the district court exceeded its jurisdiction in granting a new trial,and that its order constitutes an erroneous and appealable sanction of metro trial counsel.in addition,metro asserts that the district court erred so seriously in granting a new trial that we should grant mandamus and reinstate the jury verdicts,as well as direct the district court to rule on the outstanding claims.the plaintiffs respond by arguing that we lack jurisdiction to consider a direct appeal from the grant of a rule motion,and that mandamus is inappropriate because the district court decision to grant a new trial was sound.
ii.analysis 
appeal from the grant of a rule motion for a new trial 
although metro seeks to directly appeal the district court order granting a new trial,such an order is generally not appealable.see allied chem.daiflon,an order granting a new trial is interlocutory in nature and therefore not immediately appealable.pellarino ford motor,cir it is settled that an appeal will not lie from an order granting a new trial.this is because such an order does not qualify as a final decision under and thus is not reviewable until a final judgment has been entered by the district court.see pellarino,at.accordingly,a party who wins at trial but whose opponent is granted a new trial is generally prohibited from defending the initial verdict on appeal until after a subsequent retrial.charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure ed.
we do have jurisdiction to hear a direct appeal from the grant of a new trial,however,where the district court exceeded its own jurisdiction in so doing.see fuller quire,cir holding that the district court did not exceed its jurisdiction,and thus rejecting the defendant attempt to appeal a nonfinal order granting a motion for relief from judgment.metro argues that the district court below exceeded its jurisdiction by disregarding rule and thus acted without authority.the applicable portions of rule read as follows 
a in general.
grounds for new trial.the court may,on motion,grant a new trial on all or some of the to any follows 
a after a jury trial,for any reason for which a new trial has heretofore been granted in an action at law in federal court or 
b after a nonjury trial,for any reason for which a rehearing has heretofore been granted in a suit in equity in federal court.
b time to file a motion for a new trial.a motion for a new trial must be filed no later than days after the entry of judgment.
d new trial on the court initiative or for reasons not in the motion.no later than days after the entry of judgment,the court,on its own,may order a new trial for any reason that would justify granting one on a party motion.after giving the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard,the court may grant a timely motion for a new trial for a reason not stated in the motion.in either event,the court must specify the reasons in its order.
e motion to alter or amend a judgment.a motion to alter or amend a judgment must be filed no later than days after the entry of the judgment.
metro specific argument is that the district court exceeded its own jurisdiction by granting the plaintiffs a new trial for a reason not stated in the ir motion.see id.at d.the court did not order a new trial until more than months after the initial trial,and metro contends that the order was therefore entered far later than days after the entry of judgment.see id.thus,according to metro,if the district court had wished to grant a new trial for a reason not stated in the plaintiffs motion,it would have needed to give metro and the plaintiffs notice and an opportunity to be heard.see id.the district court did not do so.metro therefore contends that the district court exceeded its own jurisdiction.
entry of judgment 
the argument that we have jurisdiction hinges on metro contention that the district court issued an entry of judgment regarding the claims that were presented to the jury.see id.a review of the district court docket,however,reveals no entry of judgment on these claims.in its petition for a writ of mandamus,metro argues that the district court order dismissing with prejudice the claims addressed by the jury serves as an entry of judgment.but that document is not titled as an entry of judgment,does not use the term judgment at all,and,because it specifically reserves the claims for the judge to decide,is not a final,appealable order.see levy paint,wl,at cir,in the absence of certification as a final judgment under.b,an order disposing of fewer than all parties or claims in an action is not a final,appealable order.as a result,the order referenced by metro does not meet the definition of the term judgment.see.a defining a judgment as a decree and any order from which an appeal lies.
metro alternatively argues that even if the district court order adopting the jury verdicts and formally dismissing the majority of the plaintiffs claims is not an entry of judgment,it nevertheless eventually qualified as an entry of judgment under rule c b of the federal rules of civil procedure.rule c b provides that judgment is entered automatically when days have run after a judgment appears on a district court docket.this argument,however,ignores the unique rules that apply in cases where a court order disposes of fewer than all of the claims pending in a case.
specifically,rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure provides that w hen an action presents more than one claim for relief,as in the present case,the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more,but fewer than all,claims only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.here,the jury trial did not resolve all of the claims,and thus the court would have had to make an express determination that there was no just reason for delaying the entry of final judgment on the claims for the same to become appealable.see bonner perry,cir a grant of partial summary judgment that does not dispose of all parties and all claims is generally not immediately appealable unless the district court issues a.b certificate.daleure kentucky,cir explaining that a district court certifying an order under rule b must clearly explain why it has concluded that immediate review of the challenged ruling is desirable citation and internal quotation marks omitted emphasis in original acquisition,gencorp,cir explaining that,in order to enter judgment on some but not all of the claims in a case,the district court must expressly direct that judgment as to certain claims is final and expressly determine that there is no just reason to delay review internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court did not make such a determination in the present case.there is nothing in its order indicating that the court was directing an entry of judgment on the claims.kelly lee old fashioned hamburgers,cir en banc holding that the requirement in rule b that the district court make an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and an express direction for the entry of judgment is met where the record reflects the district court unmistakable intent to enter a partial final judgment emphasis added.
where a court fails to enter such a judgment,any order or other decision,however designated,that adjudicates fewer than all of the claims does not end the action as to any of the claims and may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims.b.accordingly,because the jury verdicts dealt with fewer than all of the plaintiffs claims and because the district court never expressly entered a partial final judgment on the claims resolved by the jury,there was never a rule b entry of judgment in this case.see leelanau wine cellars,black red,app x,cir holding that the court partial grant of summary judgment was not an entry of judgment under rule b and thus did not trigger rule e timing provision.there being no entry of judgment in the present case as required to trigger rule d timing provisions,metro argument that the district court exceeded its jurisdiction under rule d is without merit.
attorney sanctions as a basis to appeal 
metro alternative contention is that we have jurisdiction over this case because the district court order amounts to a finding that metro counsel committed sanctionable misconduct.in some circuits,a particularized finding of misconduct by a district court constitutes enough of an injury to make that finding appealable.see united states barnett in re harris,app x,cir citing cases.this circuit,however,has never reached such a conclusion.see id.at explaining that t his court has not yet addressed the extent to which a district court written order can constitute a sanction that would create an injury sufficient to provide standing to appeal.
moreover,the circuits vary in how they apply this rule.see,bowers ncaa,cir holding that attorneys whose behavior was declared sanctionable could appeal despite not receiving any additional monetary or disciplinary sanctions beyond factual findings and language in the actual order that the conduct of those attorneys merited sanctions butler biocore med,cir allowing attorneys to appeal orders that directly aggrieve them williams united states in re williams,cir allowing attorneys to appeal orders criticizing their conduct only where the district court identified the criticism as a reprimand or a sanction walker city of mesquite,cir allowing an appeal from a district court order reprimanding an attorney for misconduct despite the lack of a fine or other punishment clark equip.lift parts,cir rejecting an attorney attempt to appeal a district court order that was critical of his conduct where he could not show that he suffered any monetary harm from the criticism.
metro offers no argument for why we should set a new precedent by declaring that an attorney who is sanctioned or,as in this case,who is found to have prejudiced a trial based on improper conduct,suffers an appealable injury.it also fails to make any argument about why,if we do establish such a precedent,we should adopt the most lenient standard available.
moreover,we find the reasoning in our unpublished decision in barnett,which dealt with very similar circumstances,to be persuasive.the district court in that case accused the federal prosecutor of knowingly presenting perjured testimony after several government witnesses testified inconsistently about their level of illegal activity.barnett,app x at.when the jury returned a verdict convicting barnett,the district court granted a motion for a new trial,partially on the ground that the prosecutor knowingly introduced false testimony.id.at.the case was retried and barnett was convicted once again.after the retrial,the prosecutor filed an appeal challenging the order granting a new trial,arguing that the district court findings as to her conduct constitute an appealable sanction.id.
the opinion in barnett explained that even if this court were to adopt the position that an order containing particularized findings of professional misconduct is an appealable sanction,the prosecutor fails to demonstrate that the district court made such a finding.id.at.in that case,the district court repeatedly stated that it was not finding the prosecutor guilty of misconduct,and instead simply addressed her conduct in the context of its legal conclusions.id.
this treatment of alleged misconduct in barnett parallels how the district court in the present case dealt with metro counsel.the court here never specifically sanctioned or formally charged metro counsel with misconduct.instead,the court simply relied on its conclusion that metro counsel had prejudiced the jury as part of its rationale for granting a new trial.
indeed,the prosecutor in barnett may have had an even a stronger argument that she suffered an appealable injury because the district court in that case sent a letter to the department of justice suggesting an investigation into her possible misconduct although the sending of such a letter is,in itself,pl
