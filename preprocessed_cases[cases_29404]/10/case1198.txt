background 
the named plaintiff,delores lewis,filed this case in california state court on december.the complaint concerns charges billed by the defendant,verizon,on behalf of enhanced services billing,esbi,a billing processor,or aggregator,for vendors who offer services.this includes weather and traffic reports,sports scores,stock tips,and of which are known as premium content.esbi bills customers for this premium content through local landline telephone providers,like verizon,which places a charge on a subscriber bill.
lewis claims verizon billed her for services that she never ordered.describing these charges as unauthorized,she seeks to represent a class of landline verizon customers in california who have been billed for such services that they never expressly agreed to or requested.the operative complaint states no fixed amount for damages sought.
on march,verizon filed a notice of removal in the district court for the central district of california alleging that the case satisfied the million amount in controversy requirement under cafa,d.that section provides in relevant part t he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action in which the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of,exclusive of interest and cost id.at d.
in support of their notice of removal,verizon submitted a declaration of paul glover,verizon senior consultant for product management and development,to establish that members of the class were billed more than million during the relevant period 
i have reviewed verizon records for charges billed by verizon on behalf of esbi to landline telephone subscribers in california from march,to the present.the records show that these subscribers were billed more than million,exclusive of fees and interest,from march,until the present for esbi charges 
on april,plaintiff filed a motion to remand the action to state court on the ground that verizon failed to carry its burden of demonstrating that the case satisfies cafa amount in controversy requirement.plaintiff motion to remand proffered no evidence or new allegation that the amount the class might be entitled to receive was less than verizon total esbi billings.nor did plaintiff concede that the class sought a recovery of less than million.instead,plaintiff contended that,because the complaint challenged only unauthorized charges,there was a distinction between unauthorized and authorized charges for the purposes of determining the amount in controversy.relying on such a distinction,plaintiff attacked the glover declaration as incompetent,since it only spoke to the amount of verizon gross billings to consumers for esbi content.on june,the district court granted plaintiff motion to remand,and on september,we granted verizon petition for permission to appeal the remand pursuant to c,authorizing interlocutory review of a cafa removal order.
in ordering the matter remanded to the state court,the district court adopted plaintiff distinction between authorized and unauthorized charges to hold that the complaint placed only the unauthorized charges into controversy.lewis verizon commc ns,wl,at cal.june.thus,according to the district court,the glover declaration did not satisfy the defendant burden to demonstrate the requisite amount in controversy,since it describes the total sum of all esbi charges billed by verizon,not just the unauthorized ones.id.at.there was,however,no evidence to support the premise that some portion of the charges alleged in the complaint were authorized.nor did any pleading suggest the class recovery would be less than million.
verizon contends on appeal that,given the plaintiff refusal to limit the damages sought and verizon showing that the total billings exceed million,the total billings constitute the amount in controversy.we agree.

cafa was also designed to settle jurisdictional issues early.thus,appeals must be filed not less than days after a remand order.c.if the court of appeals accepts the appeal,the court must issue a final judgment not more than days later.id.at c.and if the court of appeals does not issue judgment within the time allowed,the appeal shall be denied.id.at c.
although cafa is relatively new,the concept of an amount in controversy has a long history.congress originally created a jurisdictional amount for diversity jurisdiction in the judiciary act of.that statute established a jurisdictional amount,intended as a floor for the size of cases that could reach the federal courts.congress has used the requirement of an amount in controversy to limit the original and derivative access to the lower federal courts.thomas baker,the history and tradition of the amount in controversy requirement a proposal to up the ante in diversity jurisdiction.over the years,congress has seen fit to increase the amount,but its purpose has remained the same to ensure that a dispute is sufficiently important to warrant attention.exxon mobil,at.the
