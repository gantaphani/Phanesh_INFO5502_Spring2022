until it became a subsidiary of sundstrand in,sullair corporation had a pension plan.distinctive features of that plan still apply to persons who worked at sullair before the acquisition.a plan uses a structure with pension payments linked to years of work and high salary to buffer the uncertainty of a system where pension payments depend on the performance of investments in each employee account.see brengettsy ltv steel republic hourly pension plan,cir regina jefferson,rethinking the risk of defined contribution plans.tax.sullair plan was an employee stock ownership plan.employees were entitled to buy sullair stock,which the esop would hold for their account.an esop is a investment employees retirement wealth is undiversified,so if something happens to the firm a retiree can end up with little beyond social security benefits,while if the firm prospers he may live in the lap of luxury.a component ensures that retirees have some supplement to social security even if the employer or the stock market goes south.the principal question in this class action is how the plans interact when an employee quits sullair after pension benefits have vested,but before retirement age.
sullair plan gives retirees the greater of the amount and the value of an annuity that could be purchased with the stock held for the retiree benefit by the esop.if the annuity that could be purchased with the esop stock is less than the amount,then the plan pays the difference,topping up the employee pension.two aspects of this arrangement give rise to the question at hand.first,the employee does not surrender the esop units in order to receive a supplemental payment from the plan the employee is free to cash out the esop and buy an annuity but also is free to keep the stock and continue to bear the risk.second,and essential in light of the first,the coordination between plans is done with a hypothetical annuity,which presents the question how the monthly annuity benefit will be calculated.
an example shows how the arrangement works.suppose that a given employee who retires at age would be entitled to a monthly pension from the plan.this serves as the floor.if this employee has a balance in the esop,the plan administrator determines how large an annuity the could purchase.that would be about per month assuming annual interest and a life expectancy.sundstrand then would offset the hypothetical annuity and pay the retiree per month the esop balance is the retiree to annuitize,hold,or invest as he pleases.if,however,the employee has a esop balance on retirement,an amount that could purchase an annuity of about monthly,then the payment from the plan would be zero.again the retiree retains the ability to draw down or invest the esop balance.everything works smoothly when the employee starts receiving pension benefits immediately on leaving sullair.
what happens when there is a gap between leaving sullair and retiring the plan administrative committee calculates the monthly amount based on the employee length of service and terminal salary.that much is uncontroversial.what about the offset the plan takes the value of the employee esop account on the day he left sullair employ and places that amount in a hypothetical savings account,at the same interest rate used in the annuity calculations,until the day the employee becomes eligible for retirement at that point the balance is annuitized,and the resulting monthly benefit subtracted from the amount.so if an employee quits at age,with in the esop account,and plans to retire at age,the plan assumes that this balance will compound for years at the going rate in our example,producing a kitty of almost by retirement.this sum,when annuitized,is about per month,so the monthly is zero but,as always,the employee can do what he pleases with the esop balance from age onward.this process is equivalent to asking what monthly annuity an employee could buy with today,when payments on the annuity would be deferred for years.the parties call this approach the deferred rate calculation.the other approach,which the plaintiffs favor and call the immediate rate calculation,asks how large an annuity a could buy with for immediate commencement.that would be about than the calculated in our first example because payments would be expected to last years instead of.under the calculation,then,the retiree benefit from the pension plan would be monthly,starting at age.meanwhile the esop balance is likely to grow to by age,so this person total monthly benefit will be about the from the plan,plus the monthly that could be obtained by using the esop balance at age to purchase an annuity.the difference between deferred and immediate calculation can be substantial though there will be no difference if even the calculation exceeds the monthly pension generated by the component.the functional question is who gets the benefit of interest between quitting and retirement age,the employee or the plan 
any pension plan giving retirees the greater of two amounts,as opposed to the sum of these amounts,can be described as confiscating the difference.that the nature of a plan the retiree always loses the balance principal and interest up to the floor in the plan.what the employee loses,the plan receives.using the esop to fund part of the promise makes any given level of promised benefits cheaper to the employer and so may increase the fallback pension.but under erisa that is neither here nor there.the employee retirement income security act does not require employers to establish plans that are particularly favorable to employees.there is no fiduciary duty to employees when establishing plans provisions.see hughes aircraft jacobson,d lockheed spink,d.the employer fiduciary duty,as plan administrator,is to implement faithfully the provisions of the plan as written.thus we arrive at the critical language of the sullair plan we quote the version,which has not been altered substantively 
the amount of monthly pension which could be provided on a straight life annuity basis by application of an amount equal to the fair market value as of such specified date of the participant vested interest in the balance credited to his account under the sullair corporation employee stock ownership plan,and,for this purpose,such amount of monthly pension shall be determined on the basis of the annuity purchase rates in effect as of such specified date under and as set forth in the group contract.
so the hypothetical calculation uses the annuity purchase rates whatever they are.in and for many subsequent years they were set by bankers life now principal mutual life insurance,which underwrote the plan with a group annuity contract.the first time the issue came up,bankers life used an approach,but it reversed itself before any benefits were paid and told the plan benefit committee in may that a approach should be used.the committee agreed,and a approach has been in force ever since.
plaintiffs observe that calculations are used for persons still on sullair payroll at retirement,and they demand the same for themselves.moreover,when the plan uses a calculation for persons who leave sullair before retirement age,the system loses some or all of its function.the calculation assumes that the balance in the esop will grow at some steady rate to retirement age.if it grows less or even shrinks,the employee bears the whole loss,without any assistance from the component,although an employee who works at sullair through retirement receives the assurance that if the esop value collapses at the last moment,the floor still is there.a person who leaves sullair before retirement does have the option,however,of rolling the esop balance over into a more diversified fund,thus protecting against risks.
if calculations are used,however,then employees who leave sullair before retirement age obtain a big advantage over those who the plan assuredly deprives lifetime employees of some or all value of growth in the esop account.think again about our hypothetical employee,who accumulates a value of in the esop by age.if the employee quits and retires years later,an calculation provides that person with the full value of the
