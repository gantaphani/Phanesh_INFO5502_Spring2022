this is a class action lawsuit filed against avon products,by women who sell or sold beauty products for avon as independent sales representatives.the sales representatives allege that avon shipped them products they did not order and,when they returned and paid for the unordered products,avon refused to credit their accounts and engaged in various other practices to dissuade them from returning unordered products.they allege causes of action for fraudulent concealment,breach of contract and unfair business practices,among others.avon successfully demurred to several causes of action and successfully moved to strike the class action allegations of the complaint,resulting in two writ petitions and an appeal by the sales representatives.
we conclude that both the writ petitions and the appeal have merit.in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we find 
the plaintiffs stated facts sufficient to support an action for fraudulent concealment 
the plaintiffs stated facts sufficient to support an action for breach of contract and 
the trial court erred in eliminating plaintiffs blakemore,smith and lane from the case on the ground their second amended complaint was inconsistent with averments in earlier versions of the complaint.
in the published portion,we conclude 
the third amended complaint properly stated a claim for violation of the unfair and fraudulent prongs,but not the unlawful prong,of the unfair competition law,business and professions code section 
the trial court erred in striking the plaintiffs class action allegations and 
no basis exists for plaintiffs request to remand the case to a different trial judge.
factual and procedural background 
raven blakemore and several other women collectively,blakemore plaintiffs who sell or sold beauty products as independent sales representatives for avon products,brought a class action lawsuit against avon.the crux of their complaint is that avon engages in a practice they characterize as channel stuffing,in which avon forces or stuffs products onto its sales channels of distribution by deliberately shipping them products they did not order,or products far in excess of the quantities they ordered.when the sales representatives return the unordered products for credit,avon refuses to grant the credit,in violation of its own return policy.blakemore complaint alleges avon falsely denies receiving the returned products coerces the representatives to accept and pay for unordered products rather than return them for credit unfairly requires the representatives to pay the return shipping costs revokes its policy of instant credit and requires the representatives to pay for unordered products until avon completes its lengthy return process refuses to ship any further products until the representatives pay for their entire orders in advance,which most can not afford to do threatens to terminate the representatives businesses if they persist in returning unordered products for credit and,when representatives quit or are terminated,submits claims to collection agencies based on unordered products that were returned to avon in order to harass the representatives into paying monies they do not owe.blakemore complaint describes a nationwide class,and a california subclass,consisting of all avon sales representatives who,since march,received products from avon they did not order,thereafter returned the unordered products to avon,and did not receive credit for those returned products 
blakemore alleges several causes of action in several iterations of the complaint,and avon filed demurrers and motions to strike in each case.we first describe the pleadings and the trial court rulings which precipitated the writ petitions and appeal now under review.
blakemore first amended complaint.
in the first amended ruling on which is not at was the only named plaintiff.she specifically alleged that avon shipped her products she never ordered and,when she tried to return them under avon policies and her contract,avon either failed to acknowledge the return or failed to credit her for the returns,and thereafter demanded payment for products she never ordered.when blakemore refused to pay money to avon for products she did not order,her alleged past due account was sent to collections by avon,and avon continued to claim that blakemore owed avon money for the unordered and returned products.blakemore asserted causes of action for violation of the unfair competition law bus,et,breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and money had and received.
the trial court sustained avon demurrer to the first amended complaint on the ground blakemore had failed to plead any cognizable pecuniary damages,and gave blakemore days leave to amend to bring in one or more plaintiffs who suffered actual pecuniary damages.
blakemore second amended complaint.
the second amended complaint added three named smith,lupe lane and elda added a cause of action for fraudulent concealment blakemore added allegations that,in august,she returned unordered products to avon and paid the return shipping costs,and also paid for the returned products in the sum of,with the expectation that she would receive credit for that amount in future account statements she received.avon failed to give any credit to blakemore for those products.thereafter,blakemore received other unordered products for which she was charged,and promptly returned them and paid the shipping costs.avon denied receiving the returned products and refused to grant any credit.when blakemore refused to pay any further amounts for unordered products that she returned to avon,avon sent a false claim to a collection agency,which threatened to sue her and take other adverse actions to collect monies she does not owe.smith,lane and garcia likewise allege the details concerning their return of unordered products,payment of shipping costs,and payment for unordered products with the expectation that they would receive credit for that amount in their future account statements pursuant to avon return policy.
incorporating the allegations described,the blakemore plaintiffs assert causes of action for fraudulent concealment,breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and violation of the unfair competition law ucl.the second amended complaint includes the following allegations 
fraudulent concealment.avon conduct constituted the fraudulent concealment of material facts regarding its ordering,shipping,and return policies and practices.avon represented to its sales representatives that a the company would ship and charge only for products that were ordered by the representatives b representatives could return products they did not order for full credit c the company would immediately grant credit to the representatives accounts for unordered products that they return to avon and d the representatives would not receive certain preferred preview products if they contacted avon to decline receipt avon failed to disclose,however,a that it deliberately ships and charges for unordered products b that the sales representatives must pay the return shipping costs c that avon does not honor its return policy and refuses to grant credit for unordered products that are returned d that avon deliberately ships preferred preview products whether or not the sales representative contacts avon to decline receipt e that avon denies credit for unordered products by falsely claiming the returns were not received f avon seeks payment for unordered products that are returned by submitting false claims to collection agencies g that avon initially grants credit and later reverses the credit in future account statements and so on.these undisclosed policies were material facts which avon had a duty to disclose to the representatives,because they materially qualified the representations avon made,or rendered those representations likely to mislead the representatives,and because the facts were known or accessible only to avon.avon concealed these material facts with the intent to defraud the representatives into enlisting or remaining active sales representatives,accepting unordered products,returning them,and paying avon for unordered products they returned.the blakemore plaintiffs were unaware of the material facts concealed,and would not have enlisted or remained active sales representatives,ordered products from avon,accepted unordered products from avon,returned unordered products to avon,or paid avon for unordered products.
breach of contract.plaintiffs entered into substantially identical written contracts with avon,which avon from time to time has amended and modified both orally and in writing,including but not limited to in its training guides,sales brochures,marketing pamphlets,and promotional materials implied in the contract is a covenant of good faith and fair dealing that avon will do nothing to deprive plaintiffs of the benefits of the contract.material benefits plaintiffs were to receive under the contracts were that avon would ship only the products plaintiffs ordered would charge for only those products would grant credit for unordered products plaintiffs returned would not refuse to grant credit for unordered products plaintiffs returned by denying receipt when in fact it received those products would not penalize plaintiffs for returning unordered products by requiring them to pay the return shipping costs,or revoking their instant credit,requiring advance payment for future orders,or threatening to terminate plaintiffs and would not falsely claim plaintiffs owed monies for unordered products that they returned and submit those false claims to collection agencies.avon breached the contract by shipping unordered products,charging for them,refusing to grant credit,falsely denying receipt of returned products,requiring payment of return shipping costs,revoking credit,and so on.
violation of the ucl.avon conduct was fraudulent,unfair,unlawful in violation of the ucl.specifically 
the practices were fraudulent in that they are likely to deceive members of the general public about avon ordering,shipping,and return policies and practices by falsely representing that avon would ship and charge only for those products that were ordered,without disclosing it deliberately ships unordered products,which deceives new and existing sales representatives into selling and ordering avon products 
avon practices were unfair in that they are immoral,unethical,oppressive,unscrupulous substantially injurious to consumers specifically,the deliberate shipment of unordered products unfairly requires the sales representatives to pay the shipping costs of returning the unordered products even though they were not at fault for receiving such products and thus should not bear the cost of doing so avon unfairly revokes the instant credit of,and unfairly requires prepayment from,representatives who return unordered products,under the guise that they are making excessive returns.since many sales representatives can not afford to sell avon products without instant credit,the unfair revocation of their credit economically coerces sales representatives into accepting and paying for unordered products so that they can continue servicing their clients and operating their businesses similarly,avon unfairly threatens to terminate sales representatives who persist in returning unordered products for credit,and unfairly submits false claims that representatives owe avon money to collection agencies in order to harass them into paying monies they do not owe.
avon practice of shipping unordered products to sales representatives is an unlawful practice under the ucl because it violates a federal statute prohibiting the mailing of unordered merchandise.
avon again demurred and moved to strike the second amended complaint,arguing that none of the four causes of action were supported by applicable law and,in particular,that blakemore allegations of pecuniary harm were directly contradicted by the prior complaints filed by her avon argued the same was true of smith and lane because,while the first amended complaint was pending,blakemore sought permission to file a proposed second amended complaint,in which smith and lane did not allege they paid for products they returned,but only alleged,like blakemore in the first amended complaint,that avon failed to credit them for returned products and continued to claim they owed avon money for returned products.the fourth plaintiff,garcia,was not named in the proposed second amended complaint.as to garcia,avon argued her allegations of harm were spurious and too absurd to be believed.
on march,the trial court 
sustained avon demurrer to the cause of action for fraudulent concealment without leave to amend,because all plaintiffs knew that they had not ordered the product and were not deceived.
sustained avon demurrer to the breach of contract claim without leave to amend,because there is still no allegation of any contract term that was breached.
overruled avon demurrer to the unjust enrichment claim.
sustained,with leave to amend,the ucl claim,observing that the complaint fails to plead shipments were made by united states mail,therefore violat ing united states code section.at the hearing,counsel for avon asked the court for clarification of its tentative ruling granting leave to amend to allege use of the mail,stating that he counsel read that to mean we working with the unlawful prong of and the unfair and fraudulent prongs are out of the case.the court responded,that was my thinking,yes.
sustained,without leave to amend,avon demurrer as to blakemore,smith and lane.the court concluded they were not proper class representatives because they had alleged that they did not pay,and now allege that they did pay.
overruled the demurrer as to garcia 
six weeks later,blakemore filed a petition for writ of mandate,challenging the trial court rulings on the fraudulent concealment and contract claims and on the elimination of blakemore,smith and lane as class representatives.on june,this court deferred ruling on the petition,in anticipation of a further petition for writ relief with respect to subsequent rulings made by the trial court in its order dated june.
blakemore third amended complaint.
meanwhile,on april,the remaining plaintiff,elda garcia,filed a third amended class action complaint,alleging causes of action for unjust enrichment and violation of the ucl.avon again filed both a demurrer and a motion to strike.on june,the trial court 
again overruled avon demurrer to the unjust enrichment claim,giving avon days to answer.
sustained avon demurrer to the ucl claim,without leave to amend.this time,the court observed that the statute prohibiting the mailing of unordered merchandise allow ed consumers to keep the product for free.here we are dealing with avon representatives,not consumers,and there is not a contention that they should have been able to keep the product without payment.
granted avon motion to strike the class allegations.the court observed that garcia,who paid for product that she did not order and did return,is not typical.common questions do not exist.the reasons stated as to why a representative paid for an unordered product have been varied and are inconsistent with the alleged return policy which allowed for instant credit.
in response to the trial court order,garcia took two actions.first,on june,she sought reconsideration of the trial court ruling striking the class allegations,based on the issued opinion in prince cls transportation,th,d prince.prince observed that it is only in mass tort actions or other actions equally unsuited to class action treatment that class suitability can and should be determined at the pleading stage,and that i n other cases,class suitability should not be determined by demurrer.id.at,d,fn.omitted.second,on june,garcia filed a writ petition challenging the court ruling on her ucl claims,arguing that her complaint properly stated claims under all three prongs of the is,that avon practices were unlawful,unfair and fraudulent.
on june,this court ordered the consolidation of the two writ petitions,and issued an alternative writ of mandate,suggesting that the trial court vacate both its orders and issue a new ruling a overruling the demurrers as to the fraudulent concealment claim,the ucl claim,and the inclusion of blakemore,smith and lane as plaintiffs,and b sustaining the demurrer to the contract claim with further leave to amend.the trial court did not vacate its orders,and on july,it denied garcia motion for reconsideration.the trial court observed that prince,supra,th,d,did not make new law,but rather acknowledged that the facts of each case need to be considered as to a community of interest,which is what this court has done.
garcia filed a timely appeal from the portion of the trial court june,order striking garcia class action allegations and from the july,order denying her motion for reconsideration of that order.we heard oral argument on the appeal and the writ petitions at the same time and,on our own motion,consolidate the matters for decision 
discussion 
we discuss the several issues raised in the writ petitions and the appeal in the general order in which they arose.for purposes of review,we necessarily accept as true the facts alleged in the complaints.
iv.the trial court erred in sustaining avon demurrer to garcia cause of action for violation of the ucl 
in the third amended complaint,garcia alleges that avon and charging for unordered products,denying credit to sales representatives who return unordered products,and so the ucl,business and professions code sections et.conduct violating the ucl includes any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice by proscribing unlawful business practices,the ucl borrows violations of other laws and treats them as independently actionable.in addition,practices may be deemed unfair or deceptive even if not proscribed by some other law.thus,there are three varieties of unfair competition practices which are unlawful,or unfair,or fraudulent.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.garcia sufficiently alleges a violation of the ucl under the unfair and fraudulent prongs of the statute,but not under the unlawful prong.
garcia alleges facts constituting an unfair or fraudulent business practice under the ucl.
having determined that the blakemore plaintiffs alleged a sufficient claim for fraudulent concealment see part i,ante,we necessarily conclude that the practices alleged are sufficient to constitute an unfair or fraudulent business practice under the ucl.
the term fraudulent as used in business and professions code section requires only a showing that members of the public are likely to be deceived.committee on children television,general foods cal d.unlike common law fraud,a section violation can be shown even without allegations of actual deception,reasonable reliance and damage.ibid.in this case,garcia alleges that avon represented it would ship and charge only for ordered products,and representatives could return unordered products for full credit,while in actuality avon practice was to ship unordered products and refuse to grant credit for returned products,thus deceiving its sales representatives into accepting and paying for unordered products with the expectation their accounts would be credited in the future.these allegations are sufficient to state a section claim based upon deception.see,pastoria nationwide ins.th,d allegations that insurer did not notify purchasers of insurance policies of impending material changes in policy benefits and premiums until after they purchased the insurance were sufficient to state a section claim based on deception.because the allegations are sufficient to state a ucl claim based upon deception,the same allegations necessarily suffice to state a claim under the unfairness prong of the ucl.a practice which is deceptive is necessarily unfair 
garcia can not state a ucl claim predicated on conduct that is unlawful under united states code section.
the third amended complaint also alleges that avon practices were unlawful business practices under the ucl because the shipment to its representatives of unordered products violated federal law prohibiting the mailing of unsolicited merchandise,and section of the federal trade commission ftc act.a.section,a part of the postal reorganization act,provides,with irrelevant exceptions,that 
the mailing of unordered merchandise or of communications prohibited by subsection c of this section prohibiting bills or dunning communications relating to such merchandise constitutes an unfair method of competition and an unfair trade practice in violation of section a of title,subd.a.
unordered merchandise is defined as merchandise mailed without the prior expressed request or consent of the recipient,subd.d.the statute also provides that a recipient of such merchandise may treat it as a gift,subd.b.
we conclude that section does not prohibit the mailing of unordered merchandise as between parties to an ongoing contractual relationship involving the sale of the same merchandise.the language of the statute does not expressly limit its application to consumers,instead using the word recipient.however,the legislative history of the statute as reported in case precedents,similar state statutes,and the ftc own orders enforcing section show that it is addressed to the mailing of unordered merchandise by the seller to the consumer of that merchandise,not to parties who have contracted with each other to promote the sale of the same merchandise to third persons.
first,the legislative history of section was reviewed by the ninth circuit in kipperman academy life ins.cir kipperman 
section main purpose is to combat an old and pernicious practice of mailing unsolicited merchandise by enabling the federal trade commission to attack the practice as a per se violation of unfair trade laws and by allowing the consumer to keep the item received w hat is now section was introduced as an amendment to the senate version of the act on the same evening the act was passed.the purpose of the amendment was to control the unconscionable practice of persons who ship unordered merchandise to consumers and then trick or bully them into paying for it.at june,remarks of magnuson.the senate amendment was accepted by the conference committee without comment.cong.admin.news.kipperman,supra,at.
thus,the legislative intention was to prevent the practice of shipping unordered merchandise to consumers and then tricking them into paying for it.ibid.other cases have made similar references,crosley lens express.no,wl.lexis,crosley i t is clear that section,like the federal unfair trade practices act that it references,is designed to protect consumers from the unfair trade practices the statute reason for being is not the postal service rather,it is the need to protect consumers from dishonest business persons kashelkar rubin rothman d,section concerns the mailing of unsolicited merchandise to customers.
second,as kipperman points out,the practice with which section is concerned traditionally has been governed by state law.kipperman,supra,at.the state of california has such a statute,governing the unsolicited sending of goods or services,and it is similarly directed at sellers marketing products or services to consumers.california statute,like federal law,applies to goods not actually ordered or requested by the recipient,and the statute repeatedly refers to the seller and the consumer.while the existence of a state statute on the same subject does not control the interpretation of a federal law,it serves to demonstrate the similarity of purpose in the protection of consumers from sellers of unsolicited goods or services.
third,the ftc,the agency responsible for enforcing section,indicated in a consent order that a recipient does not include a person or business establishment which does not purchase the merchandise for consumption.in re commercial lighting products,wl,ftc lexis.in commercial lighting products,the ftc initiated an investigation of alleged violations of section by a company in the business of selling light bulbs,and the parties entered into a consent order.the order requires the company to cease and desist from certain practices,including s hipping products or causing products to be shipped,without the expressed request or consent of a person.id.at.the order defines person as a recipient of products from the company,with the express proviso that person shall not mean a natural person,business establishment or institution which does not purchase said products for consumption,independent jobbers or wholesalers.id.at.
in sum,section forbids the mailing of unordered merchandise by sellers to consumers,and was not intended to apply to independent jobbers or wholesalers or,as in this case,where a contractual relationship exists between the parties relating to the sale of the merchandise consequently,garcia can not state a violation of the ucl under its unlawful prong predicated on a violation of section.this does not mean that the practice alleged may not be an unfair or deceptive practice under federal law,just as it may be unfair or deceptive under the ucl pt,ante.we hold only that the conduct alleged in the complaint is not an unlawful practice under the ucl by virtue of section 
v.the trial court erred in striking the class allegations at the pleading stage of the case.
t wo requirements must be met to sustain a class action.the first is existence of an ascertainable class,and the second is a community of interest in the questions of law and fact involved.vasquez superior court cal d,vasquez.the second community of three factors 
predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.richmond dart industries,cal d.
a demurrer to class allegations may be sustained without leave to amend only where it is clear that there is no reasonable possibility that the plaintiffs could establish a community of interest among the potential class members and that individual issues predominate over common questions of law and fact.clausing san francisco unified school dist.d.whenever there is a reasonable possibility plaintiffs can plead a prima facie community of interest among class members,the preferred course is to defer decision on the propriety of the class action until an evidentiary hearing has been held on the appropriateness of class litigation.brown regents of university of california d,quoting rose medtronics,d.
in this case,the trial court struck the class allegations in garcia third amended complaint,giving the following explanation 
plaintiff garcia,who paid for product that she did not order and did return,is not typical.common questions do not exist.the reasons stated as to why a representative paid for an unordered product have been varied and are inconsistent with the alleged return policy which allowed for instant credit.
we conclude the trial court erred.
the standard of review.
avon contends we must apply an abuse of discretion standard in evaluating the trial court order striking the class allegations,because the ruling was tantamount to an order denying class certification,which is reviewed under a standard affording great discretion to the trial court.linder thrifty oil cal th,d,linder.avon is mistaken.a motion to strike,like a demurrer,challenges the legal sufficiency of the complaint allegations,which are assumed to be true.see clauson superior court th,d an order striking punitive damages allegations is reviewed de novo.unlike a motion to strike,a motion for class certification occurs at a later stage of the case,after notice and hearing la sala american sav.loan cal d,la sala,a procedure which allows the judge as much insight into the case as possible in making his determination.beckstead superior court d.beckstead.as linder observed i n the absence of other error,a trial court ruling denying class certification supported by substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed unless improper criteria were used or erroneous legal assumptions were made.linder,supra,cal th at,d.in this case,by contrast,there is no substantial evidence to review.avon motion to strike the class allegations raises only the narrow issue whether this suit as a matter of law lacks sufficient community of interest to sustain a class action.la sala,supra,cal d at.matters of law are questions we review de novo.
typicality.
first,we can not discern any basis for the conclusion that garcia is not typical.we can only speculate the reason for this conclusion is the one asserted by avon that the description of the representatives who received products from avon they did not order,thereafter returned the unordered products to avon,and did not receive credit for those returned products does not explicitly state that the class members paid for the returned products,while garcia alleges she paid for the returned products.as avon states it,while garcia claimed that she was entitled to a refund of money she allegedly paid,the purported class members only sought credits for products they returned but never paid for.
avon argument draws a distinction without a difference.a class member who continues to sell for avon would likely be satisfied by a credit to her account.one who no longer sells for avon would require a refund.moreover,even if there is a difference between seeking credit and seeking a refund,the point would be easily remedied by a simple modification of the class description.the significant point is that,in response to the trial court initial ruling that plaintiffs had failed to plead any cognizable pecuniary damages,the blakemore plaintiffs amended the complaint to do just that,alleging throughout the complaint that they paid for returned products.in short,it is impossible to read the complaint without understanding that the class alleged consists of avon representatives who received unordered products,returned them,paid for them,and now want a credit or a refund.garcia and the other blakemore plaintiffs who so allege are clearly typical of the class.
community of interest.
the broader question of a community of interest in the questions of law and fact involved vasquez,supra,cal d at,ultimately requires a determination of whether,given an ascertainable class,the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.collins rocha cal d.in this case,the third amended complaint alleges that common questions included whether avon 
was unjustly enriched by refusing to grant credit after sales representatives paid for products they did not order and returned to avon 
shipped and charged for products it knew or should have known were not ordered 
refused to grant credit for unordered products that were returned 
penalized representatives returning unordered products for credit by 
requiring them to pay return shipping costs 
revoking their instant credit 
requiring prepayment of future or pending orders 
threatening to terminate their businesses and 
submitting false claims to collection agencies.
the trial court found that common questions do not exist.again,we do not understand why the above listed issues should not be considered questions common to all members of the putative class.if each class member brought a separate suit,each one would have to prove avon applied the very same practices to her it shipped unordered products,refused to grant credit when they were returned,required payment of return shipping costs,and utilized one or more of the alleged means of penalizing her for returning unordered products for credit.we are unable to discern why those issues can not be jointly tried collins rocha,supra,cal d at,with a view to establishing whether avon engaged in the practices alleged.
the trial court apparently reasoned that the plaintiffs had varied reasons for paying for unordered products,and that those reasons were inconsistent with the alleged return policy which allowed for instant credit.we fail to understand the relevance of the court rationale,which appears to question why the plaintiffs would pay for unordered and returned products when avon allowed instant credit.the point,however,is that avon announced policies were allegedly not its actual policies.moreover,the relevance of the plaintiffs reasons,varied or not,for paying for unordered products is not apparent.if in fact they paid for unordered products which they because they believed their accounts would be credited in due course,because they did not want avon to terminate their businesses,because their instant credit was revoked,or for any other refusal to provide credits or refunds contrary to its stated policies would arguably constitute unjust enrichment and an unfair business practice.
avon offers several reasons for concluding the trial court correctly found that common questions of law or fact do not exist.first,avon asserts that the complaint,which alleges the common questions of law and fact described above,demonstrates on its face that there is a lack of commonality.this is because only named plaintiff in the third amended not allege that avon required her to prepay for pending or future orders,that avon threatened to terminate her business,or that avon submitted a false claim on her account to a collection agency items c through e ante.other plaintiffs in earlier iterations of the complaint,however,did allege avon submitted false claims to collection agencies,and those plaintiffs were erroneously eliminated from the case.see part iii,ante.moreover,the complaint alleges avon imposes increasingly onerous penalties to deter representatives from returning unordered products for credit,beginning with the imposition of shipping costs and continuing in severity up to referring the representatives accounts to collection agencies.the fact that not all class members experienced the more severe penalties does not detract from the obvious community of interest in the substance of the practice alleged shipping unordered products and refusing to grant credits or refunds when those products were paid for and returned.
second,avon insists that the third amended complaint shows that diverse factual issues preclude this case proceeding as a class action,and that obvious individual issues predominate specifically,each member must show that avon actually shipped her a good she did not order,she paid for a particular good,returned it to avon,and that avon actually received it and refused to provide her a refund.this essentially argues that each class member had a separate transaction with avon.obviously that is so,but it is well established that the fact separate transactions are involved does not prevent a finding of the necessary community of interest 
the mere fact that separate transactions are involved does not of itself preclude a finding of the requisite community of interest so long as every member of the alleged class would not be required to litigate numerous and substantial questions to determine his individual right to recover subsequent to the rendering of any class judgment which determined in plaintiffs favor whatever questions were common to the class.vasquez,supra,cal d at.
taking plaintiffs unfair business practices claim as an example,if the class representatives prove avon engaged in the practices alleged,each class member need not separately establish avon liability for engaging in that practice.the class members need only show they are members of the who paid for unordered products they the amount of their damages.the law unequivocally provides that each class member may establish damages independently without threatening the integrity of the class action.rose city of hayward d.see also reyes board of supervisors d.the necessity for class members to individually establish eligibility and damages does not mean individual fact questions predominate.
in prince,supra,th,d,the court analyzed the differences between cases in which the suitability of a class action can and should be decided at the pleading stage,and those in which that question should not be determined by demurrer.the court pointed out that it is only in mass tort actions or other actions equally unsuited to class action treatment that class suitability can and should be determined at the pleading stage.id.at,d.avon asserts this lawsuit falls in that category,but avon is mistaken.in the mass tort cases and in others found not suitable for class treatment,it is apparent from the complaint that each class member must adjudicate separately numerous issues affecting the defendant liability,as well as damages.see,silva block th,d proposed class of persons wrongly and unjustifiably attacked by police dogs used by sheriff department question of liability to individual class members would depend upon the particular conduct in which the suspect was engaged and the facts apparent to the handler before the police dog was employed clausing san francisco unified school,supra,d at.proposed class of handicapped students who had allegedly been abused,beaten,and publicly humiliated by school district employees each individual would have to prove overwhelmingly numerous separate issues,including the fact that he or she was a victim of abuse,the identity of the abuser,the capacity in which the abuser acted,and others even if it could be determined that the district policies and practices encouraged abuse of students,this determination could not resolve the lawsuit,which would still require a full trial on each and every alleged incident of abuse with respect to fault,causation,damages,and affirmative defenses.
by contrast,the pleadings in this case do not show that individual issues affecting avon liability will predominate.we discern little difference between this case and numerous others,such as consumer fraud and wage and hour lawsuits,that have been allowed to proceed as class actions beyond the demurrer stage.see vasquez,supra,cal d,consumer fraud see fn,ante daar yellow cab cal d,class of taxicab users seeking recovery of alleged overcharges by taxi company allegations establishing a well defined community of interest in questions of law and fact affecting the class included that each class member was known to defendant and exact amount of overcharge could be ascertained from defendant books and records and from information within defendant knowledge prince,supra,th at,d trial court finding that individual issues predominated in wage and hour action alleging employer paid its drivers only for the time they were on driving assignments,rather than for the full duration of their shifts,was simply wrong the plaintiff alleged institutional practices by the employer that affected all of the members of the potential class in the same manner see also city of san jose superior court,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted commenting that in daar and vasquez,the issue of the defendant liability to the class as a whole could be determined by facts common to all l iability to the class could be established by evidence defendant engaged in an illegal scheme to cheat or overcharge patrons,coupled with a showing from defendant own books that defendant was successful in his scheme.
in sum,daar and vasquez represent california judicial policy of allowing potential class action plaintiffs to have their action measured on its merits in order to effect this judicial policy,the california supreme court has mandated that a candidate complaint for class action consideration,if at all possible,be allowed to survive the pleading stages of litigation.beckstead,supra,d at.absent strong factual showings in the complaint that negate the possibility of a community of interest,determination of the propriety of a class action should be deferred until a time when the court may better make the decision.id.at,fn.omitted.so it is here.we do not hold that a class action is appropriate in this case.that issue is for the trial court to determine at a later stage of the case.as in beckstead,we hold only that no argument has been made which would allow the judge to rule at the pleading stage that the suit was without the realm of probability of being properly tried as class litigation.beckstead,supra,d at.
vi.remand to a different trial judge is not appropriate.
finally,garcia requests this court to remand this case to a different trial judge under section of the code of civil procedure,which provides that 
c at the request of a party or on its own motion an appellate court shall consider whether in the interests of justice it should direct that further pr
