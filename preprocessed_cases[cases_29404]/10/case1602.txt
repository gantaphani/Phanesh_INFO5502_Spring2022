plaintiff sued attorneys who handled a class action in los angeles,based on the attorneys handling of the settlement proceeds in that action an action in which plaintiff was not a party.defendants filed an motion to strike the complaint,asserting that plaintiff lawsuit dealt with protected activity and that she could not demonstrate a likelihood of prevailing on the merits.the trial court denied the motion under the first step of the analysis,and did not reach step two.
defendants appeal,and we review the matter de novo,concluding first that plaintiff lawsuit arose out of protected activity.and we go on to decide step two,and hold that plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a likelihood of prevailing on the merits.we thus reverse,with instructions to enter an order granting the motion to strike,and to hold a hearing to determine the amount of attorney fees to which defendants are entitled for their success in having the lawsuit stricken.
background 
the parties 
according to the allegations of her verified complaint,anne thayer thayer and her spouse were of a resort membership.thayer spouse,the alleged,is ernest thayer thayer.thayer is a very experienced attorney,who was admitted to the california state bar in.and,his declaration would support,thayer is apparently quite successful,as in his last year of working as an attorney,he earned approximately million.thayer represented his wife below,and represents her on appeal.
are kabateck brown kellner llp,a los angeles law firm,and richard kellner,a member of the firm for convenience,usually referred to collectively as kabateck.kabateck along with another firm whose identity is not pertinent here filed a class action litigation in los angeles involving resort memberships,litigation referred to below as the abercrombie kent litigation.
the abercrombie kent litigation 
in,kabateck entered into letter agreements with members of luxury destination clubs to provide legal services.the letter agreement provided that it was between attorneys and client,and was for this purpose.services to be provided.the legal services to be provided by attorneys to client are as follows consultation and advice to client including representation for claims in a series of mass action lawsuits the case to be brought against abercrombie kent,geoffrey kent,andrew harper travel,intrawest corporation,fortress investment group and related individuals and entities defendant pertaining to the fraudulent sale of the resort memberships.
on august,thayer signed such a letter agreement,and that same day he signed a joint prosecution agreement.no such agreements were ever signed by thayer.
as to the origin of the joint prosecution agreement,the prospective plaintiffs for the mass action came through a steering committee made up of several individual plaintiffs appointed by the larger group of prospective plaintiffs,which committee was to seek out and retain the best counsel available to represent the group.as part of the process to have the steering committee represent their interests,each client signed a separate agreement with the steering committee,providing it with full authority to make all litigation related decisions,including settlement.
in january,the class action lawsuit was filed,in los angeles superior court.it named as defendants abercrombie kent and related entities and individuals,and alleged fraud in connection with the sale of memberships in luxury destination clubs.
in october,the steering committee agreed to settle the litigation for some.the settlement was approved by the honorable peter lichtman,who ordered that he would retain jurisdiction over the matter to enforce the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement if necessary.
kabateck prepared and delivered to all plaintiffs a memorandum explaining the basis for the settlement and the distribution method of the settlement proceeds.shortly thereafter,kabateck sent an faq to all plaintiffs,including thayer,explaining the distribution and allocation of the settlement proceeds as established by the special master appointed by the steering committee.the faq also explained how a plaintiff could appeal an allocation determined by the special master.
on january,thayer signed a general release in consideration of the settlement of the abercrombie kent litigation.the release provides that it is signed on my own behalf and on behalf of my spouse,agents,representatives,heirs,assigns and any entity thayer also signed a disbursement authorization of the settlement proceeds for his portion.
while thayer was signing those documents in january,he did so having already filed the lawsuit involved here.
the subject lawsuit 
on december,thayer filed a complaint naming as plaintiff thayer,on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated.the complaint was verified by thayer,and it named six defendants,including,as pertinent here,kabateck and kellner.it purported to allege eight causes of action,styled as follows commission of fraud and deceit tortious interference with protected property interest violation of the consumers legal remedies act violation of business professions code section violation of business professions code section declaratory relief conversion and breach of trust.with two exceptions all causes of action are essentially based on the general allegations in the first paragraphs.we thus focus on the essential charging allegations in those paragraphs,which include the following 
thayer and her spouse are of a resort membership.on august,thayer spouse entered into a written contract with kabateck concerning that membership thayer spouse entered into a written contract with steering committee concerning that membership 
defendants entered into identical written contracts with more than other owners of resort memberships.
thayer spouse and defendants intended their contracts to affect thayer,and she is a beneficiary of those contracts.
each of those contracts requires defendants to prosecute group or mass actions on behalf of the above mentioned owners,excluding thayer but including her spouse,against the same named entities and related individuals and entities pertaining to the fraudulent sale to those owners of the resort memberships.
defendants prosecuted actions on behalf of thayer spouse and the other owners,excluding thayer,pertaining to the fraudulent sale to them of their resort memberships.defendants prosecuted those actions against some,but not all,of the entities that are named in the contracts as being entities against which defendants would bring suit.defendants also prosecuted those actions against other entities that are not so named in the contracts thus,defendants sic representation of their clients required them to exclude from the lawsuits entities named in the contracts that had no liability,and to include in the lawsuits entities not named in the contracts that nevertheless might have liability.
thayer spouse called to defendants attention an entity,rob mcgrath,who had probable liability and whom defendants had not named.defendants replied that their contracts specifically limited them to suing only the entities named in the contracts as proposed defendants,that they had not sued mcgrath,and that they did not know whether or not an action against mcgrath would be.
defendants contracts provided that thayer spouse and the other owners would have the right to make substantive decisions in the handling of these actions.however,defendants gave thayer spouse no opportunity to do so.defendants settled the action as to those entities that were named therein as defendants,and notified thayer spouse of the amount recovered,and of the amounts that defendants would deduct from that recovery for attorneys fees and costs.thayer spouse called to defendants attention,in writing,an error in the computation of costs,but defendants made no response.
the complaint then goes on to allege that thayer spouse asked for a breakdown of the disbursements,and then alleges this 
following defendant collection of the proceeds of the settlement,d efendants have prepared and sent to each owner for signature and return,a disbursement authorization dated november,according to that document,defendants have volunteered to donate a portion of each owner share of those proceeds to a fraud fund.defendant steering committee previously had provided a confidential memorandum dated october concerning,among other things,this fraud fund.thayer spouse has not agreed to any requirement of confidentiality concerning this memorandum 
a substantial portion of the owners who,according to defendants,are participating in the fraud fund,are doing so only because of defendants obscuration.defendants announcements of the existence of this fund,the way in which to avoid assessment therefor,and the deadline for doing so,are buried in type at pages and of the abovementioned confidential memorandum.
when thayer spouse asked defendants for a breakdown of the costs that they have designed the fraud fund to cover,defendants replied that we as your attorneys have no oversight,interest or control over the fraud fund.however,the contracts require defendants to collect and disburse the proceeds of any recovery 
thayer spouse also asked defendants,in writing,for lists of those owners that have opted out of making a contribution to the fraud fund,and that have not approved the settlement.defendants have ignored both of those requests.
defendants refuse to disburse to thayer spouse his share of the recovery until he has signed and returned to them a general release and the abovementioned disbursement authorization,both of which defendants have prepared 
thayer complaint,therefore,is essentially premised on the following theory kabateck settled the abercrombie kent litigation for just over million and held the settlement funds in trust pursuant to a decision of the steering committee,kabateck notified its clients that,unless they affirmatively opted out of a fraud fund to be used in a related criminal prosecution,kabateck would deduct percent from the clients net recoveries and kabateck told thayer that his notification was late and therefore deducted percent of his settlement proceeds,or.and,of course,all claimed interactions with kabateck were with thayer spouse not thayer.
the anti slapp motion 
on february,kabateck filed a special motion to strike the complaint under code of civil procedure section slapp or.though simple and straightforward,the motion cited cases,most of which were cited in support of kabateck argument that thayer lawsuit arises from the lawyers constitutionally protected speech and activity on behalf of their clients in the abercrombie kent litigation.the papers filed with the motion included declarations of two attorneys,kellner,and harry chamberlain,counsel for kabateck in this case.kabateck papers also included a request for judicial notice of six documents filed in various california courts

the request for judicial notice attached what were referred to as true and correct copies of the documents.
on march,thayer filed her opposition to kabateck three motions,one request for judicial notice,and two requests for attorneys fees costs.that opposition was a total of nine pages in length,and included opposition to two other motions in addition to the,those to change venue and to strike punitive damages from the complaint.thayer brief opposition to the motion argued essentially three things that kabateck has not proven that they ever sought to exercise their political or legal rights that thayer suit is a class action and therefore exempt from the statute and that a breach of the settlement agreement is not an exercise of right of petition or free speech.thayer opposition went on to argue that there is a probability of thayer success in this action,an argument that was all of lines.
on march,kabateck filed a reply memorandum,accompanied by another declaration from kellner.
the ruling on the slapp motion 
the slapp motion was originally set to be heard on march.it apparently did not come on that day and,as there is no register of actions or transcript of any hearing,we do not know precisely what did occur.what we glean from the record is that a notice of taking matters under submission and schedule to file supplemental briefs was filed on may signed april,which provided in pertinent part as follows after reading the tentative rulings into the record concerning defendants kabateck brown kellner et special motion to strike under code of civil procedure section,motion to strike punitive damages allegations,and motion for change of venue,the court ordered as follows kabateck may have until may to file their supplemental brief,thayer until may.
the tentative ruling is likewise not in the record,so we do not know what it ruled.what we do have is kabateck supplemental brief which begins as follows 
this court should address the merits of the anti slapp motion.
the tentative states i t is clear that the timing of this motion deprives plaintiff of an opportunity to amend her complaint per the court previous rulings on the defendant demurrer.kabateck supplemental brief goes on to argue why a potential amended complaint is irrelevant to a pending motion.
thayer submitted her supplemental brief on may 
two months later,on july,the trial court entered what it called orders on the motions of defendants to strike and to change venue.it was seven lines long and provided in its entirety as follows defendants special motion to strike is denied.the activity that constitutes plaintiff claim in the complaint does not constitute protected litigation related speech and petitioning activity.jespersen zubiate beauchamp th,d.because the issue regarding the disbursement of settlement funds was mooted by plaintiff husband signing of the release after the complaint was filed,there is no longer a basis for a change of venue to los angeles.accordingly,the change of venue motion is denied.
kabateck filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
slapp law and the standard of review 
subdivision b of section provides that a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.subdivision e elaborates the four types of acts within the ambit of a slapp,including,as pertinent here,any statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration by a judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law.
a process is used for determining whether an action is a slapp.first,the court decides whether the defendants have made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity,that is,by demonstrating that the facts underlying the plaintiff complaint fits one of the categories spelled out in subdivision e.if the court finds that such a showing has been made,it must then determine the second step,whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.navellier sletten cal th,d.
the legislature enacted section to prevent and deter lawsuits referred to as slapp brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances,subd.a.because these meritless lawsuits seek to deplete the defendant energy and drain his or her resources citation,the legislature sought to prevent slapps by ending them early and without great cost to the slapp target citation.section therefore establishes a procedure where the trial court evaluates the merits of the lawsuit using a procedure at an early stage of the litigation.varian medical systems delfino cal th,d.
finally,and as subdivision a of section expressly mandates,the section shall be construed broadly.
with these principles in mind,we turn to a review of the issues before us,a review that is de novo.grewal jammu th,d.grewal 
thayer lawsuit is within the slapp statute 
as noted,the slapp statute is to be construed broadly.doing so,we look for the principal thrust or gravamen of plaintiff cause of action.martinez metabolife,th,d.the critical consideration is what the cause of action is based on.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d.thayer action is based on kabateck conduct in the abercrombie kent litigation.this activity,we conclude,is protected under the slapp statute.
numerous cases have held that the slapp statute protects lawyers sued for speech and activity.see rusheen cohen cal th,d,jarrow formulas,lamarche cal th,cabral martins th,d mindys cosmetics,dakar cir.put otherwise,legal advice and settlement made in connection with litigation are within section,and may protect defendant attorneys from suits brought by third parties on any legal theory or cause of action arising from those protected activities.rubin green cal th,d,pursuing litigation and settling a client claims are acts in furtherance of protected activity kashian harriman th,d.
the court of appeal gave examples of all this in kashian harriman,supra,th at,d several other decisions likewise have adopted a fairly expansive view of what constitutes activities within the scope of section.the defendant in dove audio,rosenfeld,meyer susman th,d,an action for defamation,was a law firm conducting an investigation in anticipation of filing a complaint with the attorney general.church of scientology wollersheim th,d involved an action to set aside a court judgment the defendant had received in a prior lawsuit.and wilcox superior court th,d,a suit for defamation and restraint of trade,concerned statements made by the defendant in exhorting others to contribute to the cost of proposed litigation.in each case,the court held the statute applied.
the supreme court also confirmed much of this,in rusheen cohen,supra,cal th at,d,a cause of action arising from defendant litigation activity may appropriately be the subject of a section special motion to strike.citation.any act includes communicative conduct such as the filing,funding,and prosecution of a civil action.ludwig superior court th,d.this includes qualifying acts committed by attorneys in representing clients in litigation.see,chavez mendoza th,d dowling zimmerman th,d.
thayer claims here arise from kabateck constitutionally protected activity undertaken on behalf of the actual clients represented in the abercrombie kent litigation.they are within the slapp statute.
arguing to the contrary,thayer makes four arguments,the first consisting of several pages,with the other three being particularly brief,consisting of no more than two paragraphs.the first argument asserts that kabateck did not prove that the complaint could be read to come within section based on the abercrombie kent litigation because kabateck never proved that litigation.in thayer words,kabateck adduced no admissible evidence that the abercrombie kent litigation ever had existed.kabateck allegedly described that litigation and its supposed settlement in great detail in their memorandum.citation.but not once in either of their supporting declarations did they authenticate any document therefrom.and although they requested the trial court to take judicial notice of four documents which they claimed to have been from the abercrombie kent litigation citation,none was either sworn to or certified.united states dibble cir.and although thayer relied upon dibble,both in the trial court citation and in this court in her successful opposition to defendants writ petition no,kabateck makes no mention thereof in their opening brief.we are nonplussed.
as quoted above,thayer verified complaint discussed the abercrombie kent litigation at great length.indeed,the exhibits attached to the complaint included two exhibits the engagement letter and joint protection agreement signed by thayer.the exhibits had this reference re abercrombie kent et.litigation.
the statute provides that in ruling on a slapp motion,the court shall consider the pleadings,and the supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability is based,subd.b.as the leading practical treatise puts it,this portion of the should be interpreted to allow the court to consider the pleadings in determining the nature of the cause of action.weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group.
thayer reference to dibble is equally misplaced.relying on it,thayer argues that the documents attached to kabateck request for judicial notice were not sworn or certified and,so the argument runs,there is no evidence that the abercrombie kabateck litigation ever existed.
the documents were attached to a request for judicial notice,not an affidavit,as was the case in dibble.and a request for judicial notice allows parties to introduce records of any court of the state of california,subd.d.there is no requirement that those records be sworn or certified before a court can take judicial notice of the documents.see.
in sum and in short,thayer complaint clearly involves things that happened in the abercrombie kent litigation a litigation,not incidentally,to which she was not even a party.
thayer next argument is that her suit is a putative class action,and therefore exempt from the special motion to strike of ccp section.thayer is wrong,as shown,for example,by a recent case from our colleagues in division one stewart rolling stone llc th,d.there,the court of appeal reversed a trial court denial of an motion brought by the publishers of rolling stone magazine,ordering stricken the complaint in a class action brought on behalf of a putative class of independent music performers.id.at,d also see maughan google technology th,d.
the two cases cited by thayer goldstein ralphs grocery th,d and northern cal.carpenters regional council warmington hercules associates th,d are easily distinguishable.those cases are premised on the exemption in section,and apply only to actions brought solely in the public interest or on behalf of the general public.and the exemption pertains only if the case meets certain specified conditions,one of which is that the plaintiff does not seek any relief greater than or different from the relief sought for the general public or a class of which plaintiff is a member goldstein ralphs grocery,supra,at,fn,d northern cal.carpenters regional council warmington hercules associates,supra,at,d.
here,thayer seeks general damages,special damages,and,under civil code section,subdivision b.general damages includes pain and suffering,emotional distress,and other subjective items.beeman burling d.special damages means losses that can be documented.and civil code section,subdivision b applies only to senior citizens.it is clear that thayer seeks relief much greater than the relief sought for the purported class.
thayer next argument is that a breach of a settlement agreement reached in an underlying action is not within the slapp statute,an argument that consists of all of lines,as follows in applied business software,pacific mortgage exchange,th,d,applied business software,abs sued pacific mortgage exchange,pme in the underlying action,which the parties settled.thereafter,abs sued pme again,this time for an alleged breach of the parties settlement agreement in the first action.in the second action,pme filed a special motion to strike the complaint pursuant to ccp section,asserting that it was retaliatory.the trial court denied pme motion,and the appellate court affirmed.that court held that a breach by pme of a settlement agreement can not reasonably be said to have been taken by defendant pme in furtherance of its right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue.page.applied is unavailing.
the setting there was that the two parties reached a settlement later,one of the parties brought suit against the other for breach of the settlement agreement.applied business software,pacific mortgage exchange,supra,th at,d.the court found that a claim for a simple breach of the settlement agreement after the underlying action had been concluded did not arise from constitutionally protected activity.id.at,d.this is not the case here,where thayer lawsuit claims a breach of an entirely different agreement thayer agreement with kabateck in connection with its handling of the abercrombie kent litigation.
thayer final argument is that actions for breaches of fiduciary duty and fraud are not proper subjects of an motion,in claimed support of which thayer cites the same two cases she cited below hylton frank rogozienski,th,d hylton prediwave simpson thacher bartlett llp th,d prediwave.
neither applies here,as any candid reading of the cases makes clear.hylton sued his former attorney,defendant frank rogozienski hylton,supra,th at,d and prediwave corporation sued a law firm and a lawyer who had previously represented both prediwave and its former president and ceo.prediwave,supra,th at,d.both cases involved lawsuits by former clients against their former attorneys.neither case stands for the proposition that the statute should not govern claims by a nonclient such as thayer.
indeed,both hylton and prediwave agree with peregrine funding,sheppard mullin richter hampton llp th,d if the plaintiff is a nonclient who alleges causes of action against someone else lawyer based on that lawyer representation of other parties,the statute is applicable to bar such nonmeritorious claims.the discussion in prediwave is illustrative in determining the applicability of the statute,we think a distinction must be drawn between clients causes of action against attorneys based upon the attorneys acts on behalf of those clients,clients causes of action against attorneys based upon statements or conduct solely on behalf of different clients,and nonclients causes of action against attorneys.in the first class,the alleged speech and petitioning activity was carried out by attorneys on behalf of the plaintiffs in the lawsuits now being attacked as slapp,although the attorneys may have allegedly acted incompetently or in violation of the professional rules of conduct.prediwave,supra,th at,d.
in other words,only the first class of claims those brought by former clients against their former attorneys based on the attorneys acts on behalf of those clients may not be within the ambit of slapp.the other kinds of actions clients causes of action against attorneys based upon statements or conduct solely on behalf of different clients,and nonclients causes of action against attorneys are.prediwave,supra,at,d.that,of course,is the situation here.
finally,we note that jespersen zubiate beauchamp,supra,th,d,the lone case cited by the trial court,does not support thayer.there,several plaintiffs sued their attorneys for their claimed mishandling of a civil litigation,resulting in a court order requiring plaintiffs to provide verified responses to discovery requests,and ultimately causing them to be sanctioned.jespersen zubiate beauchamp,supra,th at,d.defendants filed a slapp motion,which the trial court denied.the court of appeal affirmed,concluding that defendants were sued for their failure to comply with a discovery statute and two court orders to do so,conduct which did not amount to constitutionally protected speech or petition.id.at,d.
jespersen was a legal malpractice claim by clients against lawyers,clearly not within the slapp statute.see prediwave,supra,th at,d.here,of course,thayer was not a client.and no malpractice claim was alleged.
thayer has failed to demonstrate a likelihood of prevailing on the merits 
the second step in the slapp analysis is to determine whether plaintiff has shown a probability of prevailing on the claim.here,because the trial court found,however erroneously,that plaintiff lawsuit was not within the slapp statute,it did not reach prong two.nevertheless,we can decide it.see roberts los angeles bar th,d.and now turn to that decision.
we confirmed the applicable law in grewal,supra,th at,d we decide the second step of the analysis on consideration of the pleadings and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based,subd.b.looking at those affidavits,w e do not weigh credibility,nor do we evaluate the weight of the evidence.instead,we accept as true all evidence favorable to the plaintiff and assess the defendant evidence only to determine if it defeats the plaintiff submission as a matter of law.citation.that is the setting in which we determine whether plaintiff has met the required showing,a showing that is not high,gradient analytics,th,d.in the words of the supreme court,plaintiff needs to show only a minimum level of legal sufficiency and triability.linder thrifty oil cal th,fn,d.in the words of other courts,plaintiff needs to show only a case of minimal merit.peregrine funding,sheppard mullin richter hampton llp,supra,th,d,quoting navellier sletten,supra,cal th,fn,d.
while thayer burden may not be high,she must demonstrate that her claim is legally sufficient.navallier sletten,supra,cal th at,d.and she must show that it is supported by a sufficient prima facie showing,one made with competent and admissible evidence.tuchscher development enterprises,san diego unified port dist.th,d evans unkow th,d.thayer demonstration does not measure up.
it is probably enough to note that thayer was not,as she concedes,a client of kabateck.rather,she alleges she was a third party beneficiary.thayer has produced nothing supporting such a claim.and the two exhibits attached to the complaint exhibits signed only by thayer do not support her.
the rule is that for one to succeed as a third party beneficiary,the contract must be expressly for the benefit of a third party.hence,a person only remotely benefited,or a mere incidental beneficiary can not enforce it.witkin,summary cal.law ed.contracts,and numerous cases and authorities there collected.
thayer response to this is relegated to a footnote,where she observes defendants contend that plaintiff has no ownership in the trust,and no standing to assert any of the claims which she makes in this action.citation.that contention is simply fanciful.plaintiff has alleged in her verified complaint that her spouse and defendants intended their contracts to affect her citation,and defendants have adduced no evidence to the contrary.hence,plaintiff is undeniably a beneficiary of those contracts.plaintiff was not a signatory of the contracts which are exhibits a and b of her complaint.citation.nevertheless,she is an owner,along with her husband who was a signatory,of the settlement funds of which the defendants were trustees.hence,her simultaneous status as a beneficiary of those contracts is not a necessary qualification for her status as plaintiff therein.
to begin with,thayer can not rely on her complaint,even if verified,to demonstrate a probability of success on the merits.paiva nichols th,d roberts los angeles county bar,supra,th at,d.
thayer cites nothing to show she was an owner of the settlement funds.moreover,various legal principles defeat thayer footnote,including that an attorney duty depends on the existence of an relationship if that relationship does not exist,the fiduciary duty to a client does not arise.daniels desimone th,d accord,chang lederman th,d.an attorney who undertakes to represent one spouse does not become the legal representative of that client wife or husband a community property or marital interest in the spouse recovery does not create either an attorney client relationship or a duty to the spouse.mallen smith,legal malpractice identifying the client.
applying these and similar principles,courts have observed that we are wary about extending an attorney duty to persons who have not come to the attorney seeking legal advice and whom the attorney has never met.hall superior court
