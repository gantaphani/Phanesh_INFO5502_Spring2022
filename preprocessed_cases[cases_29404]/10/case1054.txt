jocelyn allen and others plaintiffs sued the boeing company boeing and landau associates landau in a washington state court alleging that for over forty years boeing released toxins into the groundwater around its facility in auburn,washington,and that for over a decade landau had been negligent in its investigation and remediation of the pollution.boeing removed the case to the district court for the western district of washington claiming federal jurisdiction based on diversity and the class action fairness act cafa.the district court remanded the case to state court holding that landau was not fraudulently joined,and thus there was not complete diversity,and plaintiffs action came within the local single event exception to cafa federal jurisdiction,d b ii i.boeing sought and was granted leave to appeal pursuant to c.we hold that plaintiffs action does not come within the local single event exception to cafa,and that,therefore,the district court has federal jurisdiction under cafa.we affirm the district court determination that boeing failed to show that landau was fraudulently joined.we refer plaintiffs assertion that their action falls within the local controversy exception to federal jurisdiction under cafa,d a,to the district court for consideration in the first instance.
background 
from the to the,boeing used solvents that allegedly contained hazardous chemicals in its aircraft parts manufacturing plant in auburn,washington.in,the washington state department of ecology department of ecology initiated requirements for the treatment,storage and handling of hazardous materials.in,boeing entered into an agreement with the department of ecology to investigate and remediate releases of hazardous substances from its manufacturing plant and retained landau to conduct the investigation and remediation.
in november,plaintiffs filed an action against boeing and landau in king county superior court,washington.plaintiffs alleged that they incurred property damages as a result of groundwater contamination by hazardous chemicals at and around boeing auburn plant from the to the present.they further alleged that boeing and its contractor,landau,are liable for negligently investigating,remediating,and cleaning up the contamination and for failing to warn plaintiffs of the contamination.based on these allegations,plaintiffs asserted state law claims of negligence,nuisance,and trespass against boeing and negligence against landau.
in april,boeing removed the action to the district court for the western district of washington.it asserted two independent bases for federal jurisdiction diversity jurisdiction and cafa.with respect to diversity jurisdiction,boeing alleged that landau had been fraudulently joined to defeat complete diversity.
on september,the district court held that landau had not been fraudulently joined,but that the action fell within the local single event exception to federal jurisdiction under cafa,and remanded the case to the state court.

a defendant generally may remove a civil action if a federal district court would have original jurisdiction over the action.a.the supreme court has clarified that no antiremoval presumption attends cases invoking cafa,which congress enacted to facilitate adjudication of certain class actions in federal court.dart cherokee basin operating owens,d.this clarification reinforces our holding that the objecting party bears the burden of proof as to the applicability of any express statutory exception under d a and b.serrano connect,cir 
federal jurisdiction 
boeing alleged federal jurisdiction based on diversity,a,and on the ground that plaintiffs action was a mass action pursuant to cafa,d b.a mass action is defined as any civil action in which monetary relief claims of or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs claims involve common questions of law or fact,except that jurisdiction shall exist only over those plaintiffs whose claims in a mass action satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirements under subsection a.d b i.there is no real question that plaintiffs action fits within this definition.
however,d b ii sets forth certain exceptions to cafa jurisdiction.in particular,subsection d b ii i provides that the term mass action does not include a civil action in which all of the claims in the action arise from an event or occurrence in the state in which the action was filed,and that allegedly resulted in injuries in that state or in states contiguous to that state.it is the district court holding that plaintiffs action falls within this local single event exception to federal jurisdiction under cafa that commands our attention.
we addressed the local event exception in nevada bank of america,cir.in that case,nevada brought a parens patriae action alleging that bank of america misled nevada consumers about the terms and operation of its home mortgage modification and foreclosure processes,in violation of nevada law.id.at.in the process of concluding that the parens patriae action was not a mass action,id.at,we stated 
the district court ruled that this action does not qualify as a mass action under the event or occurrence exclusion in cafa,which expressly provides that the term mass action excludes any civil action in which all of the claims in the action arise from an event or occurrence in the state in which the action was filed,and that allegedly resulted in injuries in that state u.d b ii i.the district court reasoned that it lacked mass action jurisdiction because the claims all allegedly arise from activity in nevada and all injuries allegedly resulted in nevada.this was a misapplication of the event or occurrence exclusion.
the event or occurrence exclusion applies only where all claims arise from a single event or occurrence.c ourts have consistently construed the event or occurrence language to apply only in cases involving a single event or occurrence,such as an environmental accident,that gives rise to the claims of all plaintiffs.lafalier cinnabar serv,wl,at.moreover,the legislative history of cafa supports this interpretation,making clear that the exception was intended to apply only to a truly local single event with no substantial interstate effects in order to allow cases involving environmental torts such as a chemical spill to remain in state court if both the event and the injuries were truly local,at,reprinted in.the complaint in this case alleges widespread fraud in thousands of borrower interactions,and thus this action does not come within the event or occurrence exclusion.
the district court,however,thought that this action against boeing was more similar to abraham croix renaissance group,cir.er.in abraham,plaintiffs alleged that defendants purchased property knowing that bauxite and piles of red mud on the property had the propensity to disperse in wind,causing injuring plaintiffs and their property.id.at.the defendants removed the case to district court.id.the plaintiffs argued that removal was improper because their action fell within the local single event exception.id.the defendants responded that 
the exclusion for an event or occurrence did not apply because it requires a single incident and the plaintiffs complaint alleged that there were multiple events and occurrences over many years.it emphasized that the exclusion requires that to avoid removal there had to have been just an event or occurrence a single event or occurrence.
id.at.the third circuit rejected the defendant perspective and held that the action fell within the local single event exception,explaining 
as the district court explained,the word event in our view is not always confined to a discrete happening that occurs over a short time span such as a fire,explosion,hurricane,or chemical spill.for example,one can speak of the civil war as a defining event in american history,even though it took place over a period and involved many battles.the court construction of the word is consistent with the word common usage.important events in history are not always limited to discrete incidents that happened at a specific and precise moment in time.
as further support for this construction,we note that the plain text of the exclusion and the statutory scheme do not delimit the words event or occurrence to a specific incident with a fixed duration of time.because the words event and occurrence do not commonly or necessarily refer in every instance to what transpired at an isolated moment in time,there is no reason for us to conclude that congress intended to limit the phrase event or occurrence in d b ii i in this fashion.accordingly,where the record demonstrates circumstances that share some commonality and persist over a period of time,these can constitute an event or occurrence for purposes of the exclusion in d b ii i.
in short,treating a continuing set of circumstances collectively as an event or occurrence for purposes of the exclusion is consistent with the ordinary usage of these words,which do not necessarily have a temporal limitation.giving the words event or occurrence their ordinary meaning is not at odds with the purpose of the statutory scheme of cafa.congress clearly contemplated that some mass actions are better suited to adjudication by the state courts in which they originated.this intent is evident in both the event or occurrence exclusion for mass actions,as well as the and exceptions in d a and b for class actions.these provisions assure that aggregate actions with substantial ties to a particular state remain in the courts of that state.
at internal citations omitted.
the exception is limited to a single happening.
we must consider whether the district court determination that plaintiffs action comes within the local single event exception based on the third circuit opinion in abraham,should be,or can be,reconciled with our opinion in nevada.with due respect to the third circuit,we do not agree with its definition of event or occurrence as that term is used in cafa.we find that such a broad definition renders portions of cafa redundant and is not supported by legislative history.furthermore,even if event or occurrence could be interpreted to cover one continuing activity or tort,plaintiffs in this case seek relief from at least two distinct activities.
initially,we note that to the extent that the definition of event or occurrence in abraham conflicts with the definition in nevada,we are bound by our opinion in nevada.rodriguez v.at t mobility services llc,cir holding that we are bound by prior panel decisions and can only reexamine them when their reasoning or theory of that authority is clearly irreconcilable with the reasoning or theory of intervening higher authority.
however,even were we free to interpret the phrase as we would,we would not adopt the third circuit approach.in context,it is clear that the phrase event or occurrence was not intended to cover something like the civil war.the common definition of event is something especially something important or notable that happens or a thing that happens,esp.one of importance.similarly,the common definition of occurrence is something that happens or an incident or event.this is not to say that in recounting the history of the united states,the civil war may not fairly be described as an event.but,in the context of determining whether a legal cause of action concerns an event or an occurrence for purposes of cafa,the terms most commonly and reasonably refer to a singular happening.there is no reason to think that congress intended anything else.
a careful parsing of cafa reveals no support for a broader reading of the term.instead,the phrase event or occurrence in d b ii i is used to limit the types of mass actions for which there is not federal jurisdiction.a civil action is exempt only if all of the claims arise from an event or occurrence and the resulting alleged injuries occurred in a single state or in contiguous states.id.in other words,the statute requires that the district court review the allegations of a complaint to determine whether all the claims are based on a singular happening.
indeed,giving event or occurrence a broader definition is inconsistent with the overall structure of cafa.cafa contains a number of detailed exceptions to its grant of federal jurisdiction principal among these is the local controversy exception,d a giving event or occurrence a broad definition tends to obfuscate the boundaries between the exceptions.for example,if the single happening requirement is read out of the local event exception d b ii i,then the criteria for the local controversy exception d a become redundant at least where the alleged spill does not cross a state line.there would be no need to consider the local controversy exception criteria,such as whether at least of the members of a class were citizens of the state or at least one significant defendant is a citizen of the state,if the local single event exception applied to all circumstances that share some commonality and persist over a period of time.see abraham,at.
the singular nature of the term is also supported by legislative history.the senate committee report includes the following passage 
the committee finds that mass actions are simply class actions in disguise.they involve a lot of people who want their claims adjudicated together and they often result in the same abuses as class actions.in fact,sometimes the abuses are even worse because the lawyers seek to join claims that have little to do with each other and confuse a jury into awarding millions of dollars to individuals who have suffered no real injury.
for these reasons,it is the committee intent that the exceptions to this provision be interpreted strictly by federal courts.the first exception would apply only to a truly local single event with no substantial interstate effects.the purpose of this exception was to allow cases involving environmental torts such as a chemical spill to remain in state court if both the event and the injuries were truly local,even though there are some defendants.
at,reprinted in,this passage reflects that the senate sought to exclude from the exception cases where the plaintiffs sought to join claims that have little to do with each other and to limit the exception to cases that arise out of a truly local single event with no substantial interstate effects.moreover,the report states that the exception is to be interpreted strictly by federal courts.the concluding quoted sentence does not alter this reading because,rather than expand the exception to apply to all cases involving environmental torts,the report states that the exception applies to a chemical spill not chemical spills thus,the legislative history draws the line between a chemical spill and a continuing course of pollution,contamination,or conduct that occurs over a period of years.for example,if an oil refinery has an accident and,as a result,releases toxic materials into the air or water,a suit against the refinery based on the accidental release of contaminants would fall within the exception,but an action against the refinery alleging a continuous course of pollution over a number of years would not.
furthermore,the admonition in the report that exceptions to cafa are to be strictly interpreted has been endorsed by the courts.in dart,the supreme court noted that there was no presumption against removal jurisdiction and that cafa should be read with a strong preference that interstate class actions should be heard in a federal court if properly removed by any defendant.at quoting,at.see also jordan nationstar mort.llc,wl,at cir,noting the supreme court reference to congress overall intent to strongly favor the exercise of federal diversity jurisdiction over class actions.the supreme court opinion in dart reinforces our holding in serrano,at,that the objecting party bears the burden of proof as to the applicability of any express statutory exception under d a and b.
in sum,even accepting that the meaning of event or occurrence as used in d b ii i is ambiguous,we are constrained to read it as referring to a single happening because this definition reflects the most common understanding of the terms is consistent with,and furthers the purposes of cafa conforms to the judicially endorsed admonition in cafa that exceptions to federal jurisdiction under cafa are to be strictly construed and is consistent with,if not compelled by,our opinion in nevada.
plaintiffs action does not come within even a broad interpretation of event or occurrence.
even if the single local event exception were to be read as covering some allegations of a continuing nature,plaintiffs action would not come within such an expanded definition.the fifth circuit adopted such an approach in rainbow gun club,denbury onshore,cir.in that case,the plaintiffs brought an action in louisiana state court alleging that denbury breached its duty to act as a reasonable and prudent operator of the well that was drilled under their leases.id.at.in other words,the well had been depleted and was no longer producing.id.at.denbury removed the case to federal court under cafa,but the district court remanded it to state court,finding that it came within the local single event exclusion.id.at.on denbury appeal,the fifth circuit concluded a lthough the exclusion certainly applies in cases in which the single event or occurrence happens at a discrete moment in time,the single event or occurrence may also be constituted by a pattern of conduct in which the pattern is consistent in leading to a single focused event that culminates in the basis of the asserted liability.id.at.
the fifth circuit approach is neither helpful to plaintiffs nor necessarily contrary to nevada.the case before the fifth circuit concerned a single event or occurrence,the failure of a well,although the precise timing of the failure was not clear.referring by analogy to the deepwater horizon spill,the fifth circuit noted that the spill resulted from a number of individual negligent acts related to each other,all of which came together to culminate in the single event.id.at.similarly,although the alleged underlying acts in rainbow gun club may have occurred over a period of time,they resulted in a single happening,the failure of the well,which produced the alleged injuries to the plaintiffs.
in contrast,here plaintiffs do not allege a single event or occurrence resulting from boeing or landau acts.rather,boeing is alleged to be responsible for the leeching of hazardous materials over forty years and landau is alleged to be responsible for negligently failing to remediate the pollution but not to have caused the pollution for over a decade.thus,even under the fifth circuit approach to the local single event exception,plaintiffs have not alleged the requisite singular happening.perhaps,under the fifth circuit approach,plaintiffs action would fit within the local single event exception if they had sued only boeing for its alleged pollution,or only landau for its alleged negligence.however,plaintiffs action asserts claims against two distinct defendants for at least two separate activities.
we adhere to our decision in nevada,that the local single event exception is limited to a local single event,but,in this case,even if we were to accept the fifth circuit approach that this term could include a continuous pattern that led to a single event,plaintiffs action would not come within that definition because plaintiffs challenge several distinct actions on the part of boeing and landau.
iii.fraudulent joinder 
as discussed below,unless another cafa exception applies,our determination that the plaintiffs action does not come within the local single event exception establishes federal jurisdiction under cafa,and thus negates the need for boeing to establish complete diversity based on landau alleged fraudulent joinder.nonetheless,we address boeing allegation of fraudulent joinder because it is relevant to another possibly applicable cafa exception,the local controversy exception,which we refer to the district court.see supra.
standard of review 
in hunter philip morris usa,cir,we indicated that a denial of a motion to remand to state court is reviewed de novo.we noted that a joinder is fraudulent when a plaintiff failure to state a cause of action against the resident defendant is obvious according to the applicable state law.id.at.agreeing with the fifth circuit,we held that 
a summary inquiry is appropriate only to identify the presence of discrete and undisputed facts that would preclude plaintiff recovery against the defendant and reasoned that the inability to make the requisite decision in a summary manner itself points to an inability of the removing party to carry its burden.smallwood illinois central,at cir en banc.the court further stated that t he party seeking removal bears a heavy burden of proving that the joinder of the party was improper.id.at.
id.at.we also agreed with the eleventh circuit,that if there is a possibility that a state court would find that the complaint states a cause of action against any of the resident defendants,the federal court must find that the joinder was proper and remand the case to the state court.hunter,at quoting tillman reynolds tobacco,cir per curiam.
b.the contentions 
boeing argues that plaintiffs complaint contains only conclusory allegations that do not suffice to satisfy the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure b.although the complaint alleged that landau failed to act reasonably in investigating,evaluating,remediating,eliminating,and the hazardous substances,and failed to warn plaintiffs about the presence of hazardous substances,boeing claims that the complaint contains not a single allegation tying any duty owed by landau to any of these plaintiffs.boeing argues that plaintiffs were not parties to the contract between boeing and landau the parties to the contract did not intend to create an obligation to third parties and the parties,in fact,expressly disclaimed that there were any third party beneficiaries.boeing further asserts that plaintiffs claims fail because landau was acting under the direction of the department of ecology,a government agency that oversaw and supervised each step of landau work.
plaintiffs respond that under washington state law engineering firms owe a duty to third parties,even without privity,that plaintiffs have alleged that landau owed them a duty of care,and that they are third party beneficiaries of defendants contract despite their attempts to disclaim such benefits.
the district court,citing warner design build homes,found that,under washington state law,a third party beneficiary contract exists when the contracting parties at the time they enter into the contract,intend that the promisor will assume a direct obligation to the claimed beneficiary.the district court further held,again relying on warner,that the test of intent is an objective one whether performance under the contract necessarily and directly benefits the third party.the district court recognized that there was no indication that boeing and landau intended to benefit residents near and around the auburn plant.however the district court concluded 
it is clear that landau performance of its obligations under the contract would necessarily and directly benefit the plaintiffs in this action.indeed,part of its obligations included remediation services and engineering services.plaintiffs allege that the remediation services were performed negligently.therefore,the court finds that it is conceivable based on plaintiffs amended complaint that landau voluntarily undertook remediation services to benefit the plaintiffs and performed those services negligently.
boeing has not met its heavy burden of showing that there is no possibility that washington law might impose liability on landau.it seems clear that some,if not most,of the remediation efforts undertaken by landau were intended to benefit plaintiffs and their property.thus,even accepting boeing representations that its contract expressly disclaimed any intent to create third party beneficiaries,and that neither boeing nor landau had any intent to create third party beneficiaries,a court could reasonably conclude that the contract did
