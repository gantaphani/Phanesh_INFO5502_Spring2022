this opinion addresses of the district court order denying in part,and granting in part,paul lozano class certification motion.lozano appeals the district court denial of a nationwide class for his federal communications act fca and declaratory relief claims.lozano also appeals the court denial of a california subclass on these claims,as well as his breach of contract claim.at t wireless services,aws appeals the district court certification of a california subclass for lozano state law claims.we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure and e.for the reasons stated,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
lozano is a customer of aws and brought this putative class action based on aws disclosures relating to its billing practices for cellular services on october,lozano filed a second amended complaint in the district court.in his complaint,lozano asserts claims under the fca,the declaratory judgment act dja,california contract law,the california consumer legal remedies act clra,and california unfair competition law ucl.lozano bases these claims on allegations that aws billed its customers for cellular telephone calls during a billing period other than the billing period in which the calls were made,a practice termed billing.lozano contends that by doing this,aws assessed charges for cellular telephone calls that would not have been assessed if the calls had been billed during the billing period in which the calls were made.aws,according to lozano,did not fully and adequately disclose its billing practice to its customers at the time they entered into contracts with aws.
billing occurs when the local calling area for a customer plan includes areas that are not covered by aws cellular network.when a customer places or receives a call in an area not covered by aws network,the call is routed through another wireless carrier,and the call is termed a roaming call.due to the nature of the routing process,aws does not immediately learn of the roaming call,and consequently,does not immediately charge the call against the customer allotted minutes.occasionally,aws will learn of the roaming call only after the customer monthly billing cycle has ended.when this occurs,aws bills the customer for the roaming call in the next billing cycle,which may put the customer over the allotted minutes for that cycle.for example,a roaming call made in the august billing cycle may be billed in the september invoice because of the late receipt of information from the other carrier.assuming the customer had already reached his or her allowable minutes for september,and had not for august,the august roaming call could result in an overage fee on the september invoice.according to aws,billing occurs infrequently,and when it does occur,it is just as likely to result in a reduction in fees as opposed to an increase.that is,under the above scenario,the customer could benefit from billing by avoiding an overage fee in august if she used all her minutes in august,but not september.
in or about may,lozano contracted with aws to receive cellular telephone service for one year.lozano cellular plan with aws provided him with a minimum of free anytime minutes and night and weekend minutes per month.as part of a promotional offer,aws gave lozano an additional free anytime minutes.based on the information aws provided,lozano believed that he would not be charged for cellular calls unless he exceeded anytime minutes or night and weekend minutes in one billing cycle.
when lozano received his september,invoice from aws,however,he was surprised to discover that his september invoice included calls that were made during the previous billing cycle.the addition of these extra minutes caused his september usage to exceed the free minutes set forth in his contract with aws.because he exceeded his allotted usage,aws charged lozano an overage fee for the calls that it billed from the previous cycle.
lozano called aws to inquire as to why there were calls from the previous billing cycle on his current invoice.an aws representative explained to him that roaming cellular telephone calls are billed to its customers based on the date that aws receives the information regarding the call,not on the date the call was actually made.the aws representative offered to reimburse lozano for the overage charges,but would not do so unless he agreed to for another year of service with aws.lozano declined the offer.on october,after lozano lodged additional complaints with aws,it issued him a credit for the charges he incurred as a result of billing.the aws representative who issued the credit wrote in the customer notes that it was a one time courtesy cr edit for delayed billing the representative informed lozano that billing could happen again.lozano filed the instant suit a few weeks later,and the credit appeared on lozano november invoice from aws 
aws contends it fully discloses the implications of billing in its welcome guide,which customers receive when they for service.lozano does not dispute that he received a copy of the welcome guide when he purchased his service from aws.indeed,lozano admits that the aws salesperson paged through the welcome guide with lozano,and gave him the opportunity to ask any questions.lozano instead contends that these disclosures are not adequate to inform the consumer of aws billing practices.
arbitration agreement 
the welcome guide lozano received also contains an arbitration agreement that prohibits class actions 
any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement or to any product or service provided in connection with this agreement whether based in contract,tort,statute,fraud,misrepresentation or any other legal theory will be resolved by binding arbitration y ou and we both waive any claims for punitive damages and any right to pursue claims on a class or representative basis.
shortly after lozano filed this putative class action lawsuit,aws moved to compel arbitration.
the district court initially granted aws motion to compel arbitration.aws then filed for a writ of mandamus with this court.we denied the writ,but instructed the district court to reconsider its ruling in light of ting v.at t,decided after the district court order compelling arbitration,cir finding class action waivers in arbitration agreements to be unconscionable when contained in adhesion contracts.on august,after reconsidering its order in light of ting,the district court vacated the order compelling arbitration.in so doing,the district court relied both on ting,and the subsequent case of ingle circuit city stores,cir holding that an essentially unilateral bar on classwide arbitration is substantively unconscionable.the district court held that the limitation on class action relief contained in aws welcome guide was both procedurally and substantively unconscionable and therefore unenforceable under california law 
lozano injury 
the district court considered aws motion for summary judgment before lozano sought class certification.in its summary judgment order,the district court addressed whether lozano had any legally cognizable injuries,in order to determine whether he had standing to bring his claims.aws argued that because it had reimbursed lozano for the overage fees in october,and he did not bring suit until november,he could not show injury.the district court disagreed.while recognizing that aws reimbursement to lozano before suit raised concerns regarding lozano ability to meet an essential element of his claims,damages,the district court nevertheless concluded that aws could not avoid a class action by reimbursing the potential representative prior to filing suit and lozano suffered damages based on a reservation injury,and that aws use of billing continued to injure lozano.the reservation injury,as described by the district court,relates to those aws customers who are aware of billing,and in turn,reserve a certain percentage of minutes each month to compensate for any roaming calls from the previous billing cycle.the customer is thereby denied the full use of his or her allotted minutes each month.on these bases,the district court found that lozano sufficiently alleged the presence of an injury,and had standing to bring these claims 
class certification 
the district court next considered lozano motion for class certification.in his motion,lozano requested that the court certify two classes a one national class for claims based on fca violations,declaratory relief,and breach of contract and b another california subclass based on lozano claims brought pursuant to the clra and ucl.lozano termed the first class as the class and the subclass as the california subclass.
lozano proposed definition for the class included 
all residents of the united states of america who initiated cellular telephone service with at t wireless on or after march,and who at any time between march,and the date of filing the second amended complaint in this action have been charged by at t wireless for cellular telephone calls during a billing period other than the billing period in which the calls were made.
lozano proposed an identical subclass for his state claims,except that this definition only included residents of the state of california.
the district court declined to certify a national class for lozano fca and derivative dja claims because to do so would require a analysis of conscionability jurisprudence with respect to the enforceability of class action waivers.the court also denied lozano request for class action status for his breach of contract claim.the district court certified a california class action for lozano clra claim,based on aws inclusion of an unconscionable term in its agreement,the class action waiver the district court declined to certify a class for lozano other theories of liability pursuant to the clra.finally,the district court certified a class action on two theories of liability under the ucl one claim based on a violation of the clra the derivative ucl claim and a second claim based on the unfairness prong of the ucl.
ii.standards of review 
class certifications are governed by federal rule of civil procedure.as the party seeking class certification,lozano bears the burden of demonstrating that he has met each of the four requirements of rule a and at least one of the requirements of rule b see zinser accufix research,cir.we review the district court decision regarding class certification for abuse of discretion.see valentino,cir.the district court abuses its discretion if its certification order is premised on impermissible legal criteria.see moore hughes helicopters,cir.finally,while we review the district court factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard,husain olympic airways,cir,we review the district court determination of standing and mootness de novo.see kootenai tribe of idaho veneman,cir standing audubon,davis,cir mootness.
iii.discussion 
arbitration of fca claims 
lozano first contends that the district court erred by finding predominance of individual claims based on differing state laws on whether class action waivers are unconscionable.the district court,according to lozano,should not have considered the variances in state law on this issue because,as a matter of federal law,no claim can be subject to arbitration under the fca.lozano contends that the fca plain language precludes adjudication by arbitration.whether the fca permits adjudication by binding arbitration is a question of law that we review de novo.see guide,cir.
the federal arbitration act faa provides that a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.the faa sets forth a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration and reverses years of hostility by the courts towards arbitration agreements.moses cone mem.hosp.mercury constr,d.contractual arbitration agreements are equally applicable to statutory claims as to other types of common law claims.see mitsubishi motors soler,d.indeed,the mitsubishi court went so far as to state that,absent the sort of fraud or overwhelming economic power that would provide grounds for the revocation of any contract,the faa provides no basis for disfavoring agreements to arbitrate statutory claims by skewing the otherwise hospitable inquiry into arbitrability.id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
this does not mean that all statutory rights are suitable for arbitration.there are some statutes where congress has evinced an intent to preclude arbitration of claims.the burden is on the party opposing arbitration,however,to show that congress intended to preclude arbitration of the statutory claims involved.see.express mcmahon,d nghiem nec,cir.lozano attempts to meet this burden by arguing that congress,by limiting fora to the federal communications commission fcc and federal district courts,evidenced an intent to preclude other fora,including arbitration.as additional support,lozano points to this court decision in at t coeur tribe,cir,as controlling authority on the issue.
the district court rejected both of lozano arguments.relying on the standard set forth in mitsubishi,the district court found no evidence of a congressional intent to prohibit arbitration of fca claims the district court also found our holding in coeur tribe to be confined to the adjudication of claims in the tribal forum.we agree.
congressional intent 
if congressional intent to bar arbitration exists in the fca,it must be found in the text of the statute,its legislative history,or an inherent conflict between arbitration and the fca underlying purpose.gilmer lane,d.lozano argues that because important public policy considerations are litigated in fca claims,congress intended to limit the adjudication of these claims to the fcc and the federal district courts,and to the exclusion of an arbitral forum.lozano also argues that,due to the inherent inequality in unequal bargaining power between telecommunications providers and consumers,congress intended to preclude providers from keeping consumers out of a judicial forum.while we recognize these as important public policy considerations,the united states supreme court has rejected these same arguments in other statutory contexts,in light of the strong public policy favoring arbitration.
for example,the supreme court in mcmahon evinced a strong desire to permit arbitration of statutory claims by upholding an arbitration agreement that encompassed federal claims arising under the securities exchange act of,and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico statutes.at.the court found rico claims arbitrable even in the face of rico strong public policy considerations.see id.the special incentives necessary to encourage civil enforcement actions against organized crime do not support nonarbitrability of civil rico claims brought against legitimate enterprises.see also mitsubishi,at.reasoning that arbitral tribunals are readily capable of handling the factual and legal complexities of antitrust claims gilmer,at.holding that employment claims brought pursuant to the age discrimination in employment act of are subject to mandatory arbitration green tree fin l randolph,d holding claims brought under the truth in lending act,a statute designed to further important social policies,are arbitrable.accordingly,we conclude that,even considering the important public policy concerns associated with fca claims,these claims are arbitrable absent evidence of congressional intent to the contrary.
lozano also argues that,based on the inequality in bargaining power between consumers and communications companies,fca claims should not be arbitrable.the supreme court has likewise rejected this argument.in gilmer,the court held that m ere inequality in bargaining power is not sufficient reason to hold that arbitration agreements are never enforceable in the employment context.relationships between securities dealers and investors,for example,may involve unequal bargaining power,but we nevertheless held in rodriguez de quijas and mcmahon that agreements to arbitrate in that context are enforceable.at.citing rodriguez de quijas.express,d and mcmahon,at.neither the public policy considerations in the fca,nor the inequality of bargaining power between the parties,is sufficient to show congressional intent to preclude arbitration.
coeur tribe 
lozano next argues that,pursuant to our decision in coeur tribe,fca claims are not subject to mandatory arbitration.although,in coeur tribe,we discussed the limited fora for adjudication of fca claims,we did not consider the appropriateness of arbitration as a possible forum.
the issue in coeur tribe was whether tribal courts had jurisdiction to adjudicate claims brought pursuant to the fca.at.relying on section of the fca,we determined that the tribal court did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate these claims based on the plain language of section 
any person claiming to be damaged by any common carrier subject to the provisions of this chapter may either make complaint to the commission as provided for,or may bring suit for the recovery of the damages for which such common carrier may be liable under the provisions of this chapter,in any district court of the united states of competent jurisdiction but such person shall not have the right to pursue both such remedies.
in coeur tribe,we held that,by restricting jurisdiction to the fcc and the federal district court,congress intended to leave no room for adjudication in any other it state,tribal,or otherwise.at.lozano argues that the arbitral forum is therefore precluded.
in coeur tribe,this court did not determine whether the same statutory language barred the arbitral forum,which as stated above,requires that we find a strong showing of congressional intent.we do not.the fact that congress drafted the amendments to the fca to include the designation of fora for the adjudication of its claims,without more,does not establish congressional intent.for example,the jurisdictional language for suits pursuant to the sherman act,et,has similar language to the fca.compare fca may bring suit in any district court of the united states of competent jurisdiction with a sherman act may sue therefor in any district court of the united states.faced with this similar language,the court in mitsubishi held that claims under the sherman act are subject to arbitration.at.we likewise hold that fca claims may be subject to agreements to arbitrate.
differing state laws on class action waivers 
lozano next contends that the district court abused its discretion by going beyond the factors enumerated in rule b and seizing on aws premature argument that if a class is certified,and it seeks to compel arbitration,predominance is defeated.lozano argues that the district court erred in resting its finding of predominance of individual issues on speculation as to aws future litigation strategy.in the alternative,lozano contends that determining whether the class action waiver in this case is unconscionable for all fifty states is not impractical and should not destroy predominance.
the district court properly considered the effect of aws intent to seek to arbitrate the class action claims.as discussed above,while the district court found the class action waiver to be unconscionable under california law,it also recognized that the waiver may not be unconscionable under other states laws.the district court therefore determined that predominance was defeated because aws intent to seek arbitration of the class would necessitate a review of contract conscionability jurisprudence.while lozano argues that the district court analysis of aws future intent was an abuse of discretion,we find the district court practical consideration of future events reasonable.in fact,in in re hotel telephone charges,this court expressed dissatisfaction over the district court unwillingness to address the impact of future individual questions in its analysis of predominance,cir however difficult it may have been for the district court to decide whether common questions predominate over individual questions,it should not have sidestepped this preliminary requirement of the rule by merely stating that the problem of individual questions lies far beyond the horizon in the realm of speculation.moreover,the law on predominance requires the district court to consider variations in state law when a class action involves multiple jurisdictions.id.in blackie barrack,for example,we held that the trial court properly considered the future course of the litigation in determining whether class certification was appropriate,cir t he district judge is necessarily bound to some degree of speculation by the uncertain state of the record on which he must rule.citations and quotations omitted.
furthermore,the fact that aws intended to compel arbitration was not speculative.by the time the district court decided lozano class certification motion,aws had already moved to compel arbitration of lozano claims,and appealed the district court denial of that motion.finally,with respect to his second claim of error,that the district court should have determined whether the class action waiver in this case would be enforceable for each state,we note that lozano offers no explanation of how the district court was to conduct this analysis and how practical such analysis would be in this context.thus,although he suggests that the district court should be required to engage in this analysis,he makes no attempt to do so himself.nevertheless,we reject the notion that the district court was obligated to conduct a comprehensive survey of every state law on this issue.
based on our conclusion that the district court did not abuse its discretion in considering aws intent to move to compel arbitration of the class,and that it was not required to conduct a analysis of this issue,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to certify a class on this basis.
lozano also claims the district court erred when it held that lozano dja claim could not be certified as a class because it was parasitic of lozano fca claim.although the district court did not specifically articulate its decision regarding class certification of the dja claim,its ultimate conclusion is sound.if the certification of a potential nationwide class would require a legal analysis of the arbitration agreement,and its accompanying class action waiver,then the same predominance analysis applies with equal force to preclude lozano dja claim.lozano does not contend that his dja claim is exempt from the arbitration agreement,or that his dja claim requires a separate analysis.lozano simply,and unconvincingly,contends that the district court failed to articulate its reasoning for denying class certification of the dja claim.counsel for lozano conceded as much at oral argument,agreeing that the dja claim is parasitic of the fca claim,but requested a separate analysis of the claim under rule b.as discussed infra,however,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to certify a class under rule b for lozano fca claims.
rule b injunctive relief 
lozano argues that the district court failed to address his request for rule b injunctive relief.this is incorrect.the district court addressed lozano request for injunctive relief pursuant to rule b and held that,based on the type of relief requested by lozano in his second amended complaint,lozano was seeking primarily monetary damages,which defeats class certification under rule b.see in re paxil,finding a proposed class that is aimed at obtaining monetary relief to be inappropriate for certification under rule b see also molski gleich,cir focusing on the intent of the plaintiffs in bringing the suit.here,the district court determined that lozano sought primarily monetary damages,and thus,rule b certification was not appropriate.indeed,even on appeal,lozano does not contend that he is seeking primarily injunctive relief.because the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to certify a class pursuant to this provision,we affirm.
california subclass for fca and dja claims 
at a minimum,lozano claims that the district court should have considered certifying a california subclass for his fca and dja claims.lozano contends that a smaller california class would not be barred by issues of predominance.lozano never requested that the district court consider a california subclass for these claims.importantly,in requesting certification,lozano distinguished his breach of contract claim by requesting that a nationwide class,or alternatively,a california subclass,be certified on this claim.lozano did not make a similar,alternative request with respect to the fca and dja claim.
the district court did not err in failing to consider whether lozano could bring his fca and dja claims as part of the california subclass because lozano never requested it.see mpoyo litton,cir cruz am.airlines,holding that its decision rests on its discretion not to consider claims that litigants fail to raise sufficiently below and on which district courts do not pass see also hawkins,cir holding that plaintiff bears the burden of constructing and proposing subclass,not the district court quotations and citations omitted.we therefore reject lozano appeal on this issue.
clra claim 
the clra makes it unlawful to use unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the sale of goods or services to a consumer.cal.the district court certified a class action based on aws inclusion of an unconscionable class action waiver in an arbitration agreement pursuant to section a of the clra subsection a.id.at a stating that the inclusion of an unconscionable provision in a contract is an unlawful business practice.the district court certified this class pursuant to a theory that was neither pled,nor properly considered by the district court when granting class certification.accordingly,we reverse this district court order certifying a california class for lozano clra claim.
in his complaint,lozano asserts allegations under subsection a,but none relate to class action waivers.instead,lozano alleges that b y engaging in the practice of billing while making inadequate and incomplete disclosures to consumers defendants have violated,and continue to violate,the clra in at least the following respects d in violation of section a of the clra,defendants have inserted an unconscionable provision in a contract.thus,there is little doubt that lozano subsection a claim,as originally pled,was tied entirely to aws failure to adequately disclose its billing practices and not the class action waivers.after the district court held aws class action waiver to be unconscionable pursuant to ting and ingle,however,lozano argued that his subsection a claim included the unconscionable class action waiver.
the district court rigorously analyzed the rule a factors in considering whether to certify a class based on aws practice of billing and its disclosures relating to this practice.the district court did not analyze lozano clra claim based on the unconscionability of the class action waiver against any of the four prerequisites for class action litigation numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation.see staton boeing,cir.the only class action factor the court considered was whether rule b predominance of class issues was satisfied.because a class may be certified only if the district court is satisfied after a rigorous analysis that the prerequisites of rule a have been met,we reverse the district court decision to certify a class action based on the unconscionability of aws class action waiver.see chamberlan ford motor,cir citing.of the falcon,d.
the district court failure to analyze the rule a factors in determining whether to grant class certification based on lozano unconscionability claim also resulted in its certifying a theory with no definable class.as stated above,the district court adopted a class definition for the california subclass based solely on billing.
the class the district court certified under subsection a is wholly unrelated to this definition.any class certified under subsection a necessitates a class definition that includes individuals who sought to bring class actions in california,but were precluded from doing so because of the class action waiver in aws arbitration agreement,and suffered some resulting damage.see wilens td waterhouse group,th,d,holding a court may not presume damages based on the mere insertion of an unconscionable clause in a contract.the new class would be unrecognizable from the class definition adopted by the district court.the district court failure to analyze lozano section a claim,and resulting failure to identify a class based on a violation of this section,was manifest error.accordingly,based on all the above reasons,we reverse the district court on this issue 
the district court granted class certification for lozano ucl claim based on his theory that aws written disclosures were inadequate to inform aws customers about the possibility of billing.aws claims the district court erred by granting lozano motion for class certification for his ucl claim because lozano has no damages and therefore lacks standing lozano damages,if any,are not typical of the class and individual issues predominate over class issues.
the ucl is a broad remedial statute that permits an individual to challenge wrongful business conduct in whatever context such activity might occur.commc ns,los angeles cellular tele,cal th,d,citation omitted.it prohibits unfair competition,which it broadly defined as including any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising cal.bus.because the statute is written in the disjunctive,it is violated where a defendant act or practice is unlawful,unfair,fraudulent,or in violation of section false or misleading advertisements,d at.each prong of the ucl is a separate and distinct theory of liability thus,the unfair practices prong offers an independent basis for relief.south bay chevrolet motors acceptance,th,d,citation and quotation omitted.lozano asserts that aws conduct was unfair because it did not fully and adequately disclose its billing practices at the time customers contracted with it to obtain cellular services.
aws argues that lozano lacks standing under the ucl because he suffered no damages from billing.when lozano filed this action,any person could assert a ucl claim on behalf of the general public regardless of whether they suffered an actual injury.cal.bus.thus,as originally drafted,the ucl gave any person authority to assert a ucl claim on behalf of the public as a private attorney general.in,lozano filed this putative class action both as a private attorney general and as an injured plaintiff.
after filing this lawsuit,but before the district court granted class certification,the voters of california enacted proposition,which eliminated private attorney general standing for ucl claims.cal.bus.after proposition,a person asserting an unfair competition claim must allege that he or she suffered injury in fact,and lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition.id.while proposition did not expressly declare that the new standing requirements applied to cases pending at the time of its enactment,in july,the california supreme court answered the question in the affirmative.see californians for disability rights mervyn,llc,cal th,d,for a lawsuit properly to be allowed to continue standing must exist at all times until judgment is entered and not just on the date the complaint is filed.
the district court did not consider lozano standing as a private attorney general,but focused instead on whether his claimed injuries were such that he had standing to bring a ucl claim as an injured plaintiff.the district court,incorporating its findings from its summary judgment order,found that lozano had sufficient evidence of actual injury as a result of aws inadequate reimbursement of which the district found to be an attempt to avoid with an injury it termed the reservation injury.thus,we must determine whether the type of injury articulated by the district court is sufficient to establish lozano standing pursuant to section,as amended by proposition.
the parties do not dispute that lozano suffered pecuniary loss as a result of his alleged unawareness of aws billing practices.shortly after contracting with aws for cellular service,lozano received an invoice stating that he had been charged fees as a result of minutes from his previous invoice.the record also supports a finding that,during the course of his contract with aws,aws would occasionally charge lozano an overage fee based on billing.aws contends,however,that these charges were offset by the benefits lozano received from billing.in considering these claims of error,we must address the effect of aws reimbursement to lozano for his charges prior to his filing suit,and the effect of the claimed offset of benefits lozano received during the same time.
with respect to the former issue regarding the effect of aws reimbursement prior to suit,the district court found that aws reimbursed lozano only after realizing that lozano was instigating legal proceedings against it.based on this factual finding,which we review for clear error,the district court concluded that it was not divested of its power to hear the case.in so concluding,the district court relied on united states grant,where the supreme court held that the voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not deprive the tribunal of power to hear and determine the case,unless there is no reasonable expectation that the wrong will be repeated otherwise,the defendant is free to return to his old ways.citations and quotations omitted see also defunis odegaard,d.the district court found that it did not need to speculate as to whether aws would return to its old ways because aws position was that its practice of billing was legal and adequately disclosed to its customers.
while we agree with the district court ultimate decision regarding the justiciability of lozano claim,we analyze the claim differently to address issue of both standing and mootness.as stated above,the district court relied on grant and defunis to support its finding that lozano injuries,capable of being repeated,were justiciable.both cases are based on mootness,plaintiff had standing when he or she filed suit but due to a changed circumstance his or her claim became moot.here,aws argues that lozano did not have standing to bring this action in the first instance.while some courts have characterized mootness simply as the doctrine of standing set in a time frame,see arizonans for official english arizona,d,a careful analysis should distinguish the two doctrines.
in determining mootness,the defendant bears the burden of showing that its voluntary compliance moots a case by convincing the court that it is absolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.friends of the earth laidlaw,d citation omitted.by contrast,in determining standing issues the court considers whether the plaintiff has demonstrated that,if unchecked by the litigation,the defendant allegedly wrongful behavior will likely occur or continue,and that the threatened injury is certainly impending.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.thus,lozano bears the initial affirmative burden of showing that aws conduct is likely to continue and that the threatened injury is certainly impending.conversely,to establish mootness,aws must convince the court that its conduct is not reasonably expected to recur.
based on the facts before us,we find that lozano,when faced with the realistic threat that aws would continue to charge him for calls,had standing to bring this claim.likewise,there is nothing in the record that supports a finding that lozano claim is now moot.we base our decision on the following lozano continues to be a customer of aws cellular service,subject to aws billing practices after this suit was filed,lozano suffered another overage charge as a result of billing and if the disclosures were inadequate,then lozano may show that as a result of the inadequacies of the disclosures,he did not receive the full benefit of his contract with aws.this latter injury is what the district court defined as the reservation injury.that is,lozano contracted for free anytime minutes.yet,due to,he reserved,and therefore lost,a certain number of those minutes each billing period to account for the roaming calls.
the next question we address is whether these injuries are recoverable under the ucl.the only types of relief available under the ucl actions are injunctive and restorative.cal.bus.see also,d at.while restoring lozano overage payments,if any,fits squarely within the restorative context of the ucl,we question whether restoring lozano reserved minutes falls into this category.restitution in the ucl context,however,includes restoring money or property that was not necessarily in the plaintiff possession.the california supreme court has stated that the concept of restoration or restitution,as used in the ucl,is not limited only to the return of money or property that was once in the possession of that person.instead,restitution is broad enough to allow a plaintiff to recover money or property in which he or she has a vested interest.see juarez arcadia,th,d,citing korea supply lockheed martin,cal th,d.here,lozano has a vested interest in free anytime minutes.due to billing,however,lozano found it necessary to reserve,and therefore lose,a certain number of those minutes each billing period.accordingly,we find that lozano has properly stated an injury that he did not receive the full value of his contract with aws due to its alleged failure to disclose billing,and that this injury is redressable under the ucl.see daghlian devry,d,accepting plaintiff theory that he suffered injury under the ucl because he paid thousands of dollars of tuition to defendant university and did not receive what he had bargained for due to its alleged unfair business practices.
typicality 
aws next contends that,even if lozano could show injury,his injury is not typical of the class,and he therefore is an inadequate class representative.aws bases its contentions on the fact that lozano was reimbursed for his billing charges,he benefitted overall from billing over the course of his contract with aws,and his claimed damages for reserving minutes is unique to him.
under rule a,it is not necessary that all class members suffer the same injury as the class representative.see negrete allianz life ins.of,citing rosario livaditis,cir further citations omitted see also simpson fireman fund ins,in determining whether typicality is met,the focus should be on the defendants conduct and plaintiff legal theory,not the injury caused to the plaintiff.quoting rosario,at.
we agree with the district court that lozano injuries are typical of the class.the class definition includes all california customers that aws charged for calls made during a billing period other than the billing period in which the calls were made.given aws policy of offering a reimbursement to customers who complain when they receive an invoice containing charges for calls,along with an explanation of billing,it does not strain the parameters of typicality to presume that many of these customers will thereafter reserve minutes to account for aws billing practice.thus,the class is likely to include customers who were charged for overage fees,as well as customers who,after learning of billing,reserved their minutes.we therefore do not find that the district court erred in holding lozano claims typical of the class.
predominance of common issues 
aws argues that because all of lozano claims involve some proof of individual knowledge and expectations,all should fail under rule b because individual issues would necessarily predominate over common issues.the district court itself found that individual issues predominated in lozano breach of contract and clra claims,but found that common issues predominated in the ucl claim.
in its order on class certification,the district court found that lozano breach of contract and clra claims required an individualized analysis of awareness and knowledge of aws billing practices,such that the predominance prong of rule b was not met.aws now argues that the district court finding,that predominance was not fatal to class certification of lozano ucl claim,is inconsistent with its findings with
