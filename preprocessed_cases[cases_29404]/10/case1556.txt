introduction 
this is dagmar hale second appeal in a class action against sharp healthcare and sharp grossmont hospital together sharp contending sharp unfairly charged her and other uninsured patients more for emergency services than the fees it accepted from patients covered by private insurance or governmental plans.in the first appeal,we partially reversed a judgment of dismissal following a demurrer.the trial court thereafter certified the class.after engaging in discovery,sharp moved to decertify the class arguing a class action is inappropriate based on lack of ascertainability and lack of predominantly common issues.the trial court considered the evidence presented and found there is no reasonable means to ascertain the members of class without individual inquiries of more than patient records and continued class treatment is not appropriate because individualized issues,rather than common issues,predominate,particularly with respect to whether or not class members are entitled to recover damages.finding no abuse of discretion,we affirm the order decertifying the class.
factual and procedural background 
hale was admitted to sharp grossmont hospital in january and received medical treatment,central services,lab work,medication,emergency hospital care and ct scans.she was uninsured at the time and signed an admission agreement,which stated,you hereby individually obligate yourself to pay the account of the hospital in accordance with the regular rates and terms of the hospital.sharp billed hale for the services provided.sharp offered hale financial assistance for her emergency room visit and substantially discounted her bill.
hale filed this action challenging the unreasonable,unconscionable and unlawful charges billed to uninsured persons for medical treatment at sharp hospitals and healthcare facilities.she alleges sharp does not charge uninsured patients regular rates but charges uninsured patient significantly more for the same services than they charge other,insured or patients.she alleges sharp engages in a pattern and practice of charging unfair,unreasonable and inflated prices for medical care to their uninsured patients,charging them exponentially more than other patients for the very same treatment.
in hale first appeal,we reversed in part a judgment of dismissal because we concluded hale sufficiently stated causes of action under the unfair competition law ucl bus,et and the consumers legal remedies act clra,et.hale sharp healthcare th.
after remand,the trial court granted hale motion for class certification and certified the class with the following definition all individuals who from august,to december,a received medical treatment at a sharp hospital and signed the defendant sharp healthcare standard form admission agreement and b were not covered by insurance or government healthcare programs at the time of treatment the class the court stated,t he case presents a single common issue that predominates over any single issue,whether defendant sharp healthcare represented to its uninsured patients in its standard form admission agreement that it would provide services at defendant sharp healthcare regular rates,but failed to do so.
sharp developed a protocol to search its electronic records and identified over potential class members who may have had unfunded emergency department visits between august,and december.however,sharp advised the court it could not conclusively determine whether a potential uninsured emergency department patient signed an admission agreement without reviewing individual records and the potential class members included patients who had all or part of their expenses paid by a third party.
the court ordered notice be disseminated to potential class members by individual mailings and publication.a third party mailed individual notices to potential class members in may and provided publication notice.
sharp filed a motion to decertify the class in march,based in part on evidence obtained from putative class members in discovery.sharp argued the class is not ascertainable because sharp does not keep records in such a way to reasonably and readily identify those included in the class definition without individualized inquiries.sharp also argued the class action device is not a superior method to litigate this matter because there is no manageable way to prove entitlement to damages on a classwide basis without individual inquiries 
sharp presented evidence all emergency room patients,whether insured,uninsured or covered by governmental healthcare benefits,are billed at rates listed on a publicly available charge description master commonly referred to as a chargemaster.it also explained,due to state law prohibiting discussion of financial issues until a patient is stabilized,many times a determination of whether a patient is insured or not does not occur until after a patient is admitted and receives treatment.additionally,although a patient may be listed as or uninsured when they present to the emergency department,the billing department is trained to work with patients to help them determine if coverage might be available through private insurance,government programs or other financial assistance programs.patients commonly do not believe they are eligible for government benefits and indicate on the intake forms,but later qualify for and receive such benefits.
sharp does not regularly update the initial revenue code in its electronic records to correct payer status so patients who ultimately receive benefits may still be listed as.to determine what a patient paid or to determine if a patient qualified for some form of coverage or assistance,sharp argued it would be required to conduct individual reviews of each of the more than patient records initially identified during the class period.
sharp presented evidence patients on average pay sharp less than other payors.sharp cited statistics indicating uninsured patients on average paid percent of the chargemaster rates whereas medicaid paid percent,medicare paid percent and private insurance companies paid percent of the chargemaster rates.some uninsured patients pay nothing for their visits.
sharp also presented evidence from a sample of absent class members.two paid nothing in connection with multiple emergency room visits.two had their bills paid or reimbursed by third parties.the other absent class members paid less than the full chargemaster rate for services after obtaining negotiated discounted rates from sharp ranging from an average of to percent.
hale opposed the motion arguing the fact all patients are charged the same chargemaster rates is irrelevant because the issue of differing payment obligations is a matter for the trier of fact as is the interpretation of sharp regular rates or reasonable rates.she argued sharp policies show that there are several different methods of fixing sharp regular rates or reasonable rates on a basis.hale produced a chart from sharp outlining price quotes and discount options,including a charity care adjustment and tiered discounting based on the amount of the bill.she also submitted an excerpt of a policy regarding financial assistance for uninsured or low income patients.hale argued she would attempt to establish a reasonable value for services on a basis using an expert to testify to an reduction of the charged fees,such as percent of medicare,which is sometimes used by sharp.
hale also argued the class definition is not overbroad and the class is ascertainable and manageable.hale conceded there are undoubtedly some potential class members who were sent notice but who turn out to have suffered no harm or damages,patients who received fully charity care discounts,whose bills were covered by government or nongovernmental third party payers,who paid little or nothing to the hospital and whose bills have been as bad debt with no adverse consequences,but argued this does not present any problem,since those potential class members will not be subject to refunds or injunctive relief.
in reply,sharp contended the class is not ascertainable or manageable without a analysis.sharp also disputed hale proposal to establish liability by setting an reasonable rate by reducing charged fees by a set percentage,such as to percent of medicare.sharp presented evidence hale did not accurately represent the policies she relied upon and rates of percent of medicare would not necessarily be reasonable for emergency department patients without insurance even though some financial assistance policies and prescheduled and prepaid procedures are set at such a rate.
after a hearing,the trial court granted the motion to decertify the class.the court determined the class is not reasonably ascertainable and there is not a community of interest in the questions of law and fact involving the affected parties.as to lack of predominance,the court identified a significant problem in determining the right to recover damages on a basis.the court also noted hale herself obtained a discount on her bill,which not only illustrated why individual inquiries are necessary but also raised concerns about whether her claim is typical.the court observed,perhaps her claim is typical,which underscores the points raised above with ascertainability of a class in the first instance.
hale applied ex parte for an order allowing her to move to amend the class definition before her time to appeal the decertification order expired.the court denied the application finding no new facts or law were cited to reconsider the court decertification ruling.however,on the merits,the court found the proposed class definition by plaintiff does not cure the essential problems identified by the court in ruling on the decertification.
discussion 
istandard of review for class certification decisions 
a party seeking class certification has the burden of establishing the prerequisites to certification and more than a reasonable possibility that class action treatment is appropriate.miller bank of america,th.because trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action,they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification.drug stores,superior court cal th.

as a result,we will reverse a trial court certification ruling only if a manifest abuse of discretion is present.citation.a certification order generally will not be disturbed unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence,it rests on improper criteria,or it rests on erroneous legal assumptions.citations.citations.citation.we must p resum e in favor of the certification order the existence of every fact the trial court could reasonably deduce from the record thompson automobile club of southern california th,thompson,quoting brinker restaurant corp superior court cal th.

class certification 
the party advocating class treatment must demonstrate the existence of an ascertainable and sufficiently numerous class,a community of interest,and substantial benefits from certification that render proceeding as a class superior to the alternatives.citations.in turn,the community of interest requirement embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.ayala,supra,cal th at.
the court in this case decertified the class finding the class itself is not reasonably ascertainable without an individualized or analysis and there is no community of interest because diverse individual issues predominate regarding the entitlement to or the fact of damages.as we shall explain,we find no abuse of discretion.
lack of ascertainability 
whether a class is ascertainable is determined by examining the class definition,the size of the class,and the means available for identifying class members.reyes board of supervisors d.class members are ascertainable where they may be readily identified without unreasonable expense or time by reference to official records.thompson,supra,th at.class certification is properly denied for lack of ascertainability when the proposed definition is overbroad and the plaintiff offers no means by which only those class members who have claims can be identified from those who should not be included in the class.miller bank of america,th.
in this case,the court noted the class definition here those who received after august,and who were not covered by insurance or government healthcare programs at the time of treatment is clear enough on the surface.either a party has insurance or does not.however,the court found the class definition is not so clear when considering sharp evidence that a determination of who is uninsured does not necessarily occur until after the patient receives treatment and could in fact change throughout treatment and parties often change their payer status during the course of treatment.the court concluded the class definition of uninsured at the time of treatment thus appears to be by including patients who may obtain insurance at some point in time after they present but before they pay a bill.the definition could be to the extent that it excludes patients who,for whatever reason,lose insurance after they present as insured.
hale argues the court ruling makes no sense because,according to hale,the only relevant question is whether the patient has insurance at the time they present themselves at sharp emergency room.emphasis in original.she then contends whether sharp records at the time of admission are entirely accurate,or its determination as to who is responsible and billed for services is made days or weeks after treatment is rendered,makes no difference whatsoever because t he question is simply whether bills are paid by medicare,medicaid,an insurer or solely by the patient.
it is hale later formulation of the question that presents the problem.hale focus on an oversimplified class definition fails to consider the second prong of ascertainability,which requires class members to be readily identifiable without unreasonable time and expense.the concern about the overbreadth of the class has to do not with patients who later obtain insurance that is not retroactive as hale argues,but with patients who are later determined to qualify for coverage in some form for the emergency visit at issue.it is the inability to reasonably discern those individuals from individuals who were actually uninsured and then to identify any disparity in amounts paid that makes it unreasonable to ascertain the defined class.
here,sharp presented evidence showing there is no reasonable way for sharp to ascertain who has claims and who does not without an individualized analysis of each patient payment record.sharp director and vice president of patient financial services declared sharp often does not determine whether a patient is insured or not until after the patient is admitted and receives treatment because state law prohibits discussion of financial issues until a patient is stabilized,which may occur minutes or days after admission.sharp billing department is trained to work with patients and many who initially come into the emergency room representing themselves as uninsured later are determined to be entitled to coverage through private insurance,government programs or are otherwise eligible for financial assistance.it is common for patients to think they are not eligible for government health benefits at the time they present for treatment,and have the records indicate,only to later qualify for such a program and receive benefits.additionally,patients may qualify for partial or full charity financial assistance based on the level of the patient income.
however,sharp does not regularly update its patient records to correct the initial payer status code.as a result,a computer program searching for a code necessarily includes patients who applied for and received benefits from another source,resulting in an overbroad class.sharp does not maintain patient information in a manner that permits access to payment status on an aggregated basis.instead,sharp would have to conduct an individual inquiry into each of the patient records to determine what a patient paid for an encounter,if the patient qualified for government assistance,if the patient was offered a charity discount and what payments were made,if any,sharp incurred considerable time and expense to write a program to attempt to initially identify unfunded patients seen in sharp emergency departments during the class period to give notice to the defined class.however,the results were over inclusive and it would take significant additional time and expense to make individual inquiries and construct a new database of patient information based on the services rendered to the patients,discounts offered and the status of collection efforts 
after considering the evidence,the court stated,sharp persuasively argues that it does not maintain patient information in a manner that easily permits access to data points like whether the patient was finally determined to be on an aggregated basis an individual inquiry into each of the patients is required as indicated in the motion and declarations sharp was required to create a computer program to attempt to isolate unfunded patients that fit the class definition.sharp contends that the computer program has been unsuccessful in that the results are.there is no requirement that sharp maintain this data at least in aggregate form and the court does not impose such requirement.citation.where the administrative cost in identification and processing of past general relief recipients claims is so substantial to render the likely appreciable benefits to the class de minimis in comparison,the class action should not be certified.
the trial court exercised its discretion to decertify the class after concluding the class is not reasonably ascertainable.we find no abuse of discretion.
lack of predominance of common issues 
hale argues the trial court applied the wrong standard to determine the class lacked predominantly common issues and improperly focused on individual issues regarding damages when it decertified the class.we are not persuaded.
a class may be certified when common questions of law and fact predominate over individualized questions.ali cab calapp th,ali.the ultimate question for predominance is whether the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.citations.the answer hinges on whether the theory of recovery advanced by the proponents of certification is,as an analytical matter,likely to prove amenable to class treatment.duran bank national cal th,duran.
hale relies on wage and hour cases in which courts have held individualized issues regarding proof of the amount of damages class members may recover does not defeat class action so long as there are common questions of liability amenable to class resolution.bluford safeway th,common issue regarding liability was based on policies and procedures applied uniformly to all class members so individual damage issues did not defeat class certification falkinbury boyd associates,th,common issues of fact predominated for subclasses related to meal,rest and overtime violations because liability could be determined classwide based on uniform policies,or lack thereof individual issues,such as whether individuals took rest breaks,went to the issue of damages and did not preclude class certification jones farmers ins.exchange th,a uniform policy denying compensation for preshift work presented predominantly common issues of fact and law because liability depended on the existence of the uniform policy,rather than individual damages determinations benton telecom network specialists,th,theory that defendant violated wage and hour requirements by failing to adopt meal and rest break policies is amenable to class treatment whether employee was able to take required breaks goes to damages bradley networkers international,llc th,class certification proper where plaintiff theory that employer uniform policy violated labor laws regarding meal and rest breaks can be determined by common facts individual proof of damages does not bar certification.the common theme in these cases is that plaintiff theory of liability could be determined based on common uniform policies applicable to the class as a whole.
recently in hall rite aid th we determined the trial court erred in basing its decertification order on an assessment of the merits of the claim rather than on whether the theory of liability was amenable to class treatment.citing the foregoing cases,we noted rite aid had a uniform policy of not allowing its cashiers to sit while they performed checkout functions at a register,which allegedly violated california law and this theory of recovery was amenable to common proof.id.at.we concluded as long as the plaintiff posited theory of liability is amenable to resolution on a classwide basis,the court should certify the action for class treatment even if the plaintiff theory is ultimately incorrect at its substantive level,because such an approach relieves the defendant of the jeopardy of serial class actions and,once the defendant demonstrates the posited theory is substantively flawed,the defendant obtain s the preclusive benefits of such victories against an entire class and not just a named plaintiff.id.at,quoting brinker,supra,cal th at,italics in original.
the problem identified by the court regarding hale action here does not involve individual issues regarding calculation of the amount of damages a class member may recover once liability is established,but determination of the fact of damage.in other words,whether there is any common proof to establish entitlement to or,as the trial court put it,the right to recover damages.
the trial court found the facts presented here to be similar to those in ali,supra,th.in that case the court determined common questions pertaining to the fact of damage did not predominate.id.at.the ali court anticipated a trial of a class action involving whether a cab company failed to provide workers compensation coverage and to pay minimum wages would involve a parade of drivers presenting individual issues such as whether the drivers suffered injuries and whether they earned net income equaling or exceeding minimum wage.although the leases and training manuals are uniform,the court reasonably found the testimony of putative class members would be required on the fact of damage.id.at.
similarly here,the declarations and deposition testimony of a sampling of putative class members showed some patients did not pay anything for their care,some had their bills paid or reimbursed by third parties and others obtained negotiated rates.based on this evidence,the court stated a ll of this means that each individual will have to litigate numerous and substantial issues to determine the right to recover in this case issues such as whether a third party ultimately paid for the bill,the amount of the negotiation of the bill by sharp,the discounted rate and the calculation for that rate,italics added.quoting morgan,superior court th,the court concluded,i f plaintiffs have stated claims of illegality and impact which can be proved predominantly with facts applicable to the class as a whole,rather than by a series of facts relevant to only individual or small groups of plaintiffs,then prosecution of this case as a class action is appropriate and desirable.if classwide proof of illegality and impact is not possible,the class must be decertified.in this case,the class would be
