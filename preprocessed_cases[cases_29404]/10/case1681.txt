appellants randy haro and robert ballin filed an action against respondent city of rosemead,alleging in their complaint that this is a collective action brought under b,seeking compensation for all hours worked.title of united states code section is part of the fair labor standards act of flsa.the trial court denied appellants motion to certify as a class under california code of civil procedure section section individuals who worked for respondent as nonexempt employees.this appeal is from that order.
we find that appellant flsa action can not be maintained as a class action under section.for the reasons we state below,we conclude that the trial court order was not appealable.appellants also appeal an order denying leave to amend the complaint,which is not an appealable order.we dismiss both appeals.
flsa actions 
title of united states code sections and respectively govern minimum wages and maximum hours.in pertinent part,title of united states code section b provides that a ny employer who violates the provisions of section or section of this title shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages,or their unpaid overtime compensation,as the case may be,and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.section b goes on to provide that an action under this provision may be brought against any employer in a federal or state court by any one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated.no employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.the italicized sentence is colloquially referred to as an provision wright,miller kane,fed.practice and procedure ed,and it is this provision that this purported appeal addresses.
the feature of flsa actions has been called p robably the most significant difference in procedure between the flsa and,in federal practice,class actions under federal rules of civil procedure,rule rule.wright et,federal practice and procedure,supra.as one court has put it there is a fundamental,irreconcilable difference between the class action described by rule and that provided for by flsa b.in a rule proceeding a class is described if the action is maintainable as a class action,each person within the description is considered to be a class member and,as such,is bound by judgment,whether favorable or unfavorable,unless he has opted out of the suit.under b of flsa,on the other hand,no person can become a party plaintiff and no person will be bound by or may benefit from judgment unless he has affirmatively opted into the class that is,given his written,filed consent.lachapelle,supra,at,fn.omitted.
the fact that the feature is irreconcilable with a class action has not only been reaffirmed as a matter of federal civil procedure whalen grace cir,fn,at least one california court has held that the feature can not be adopted in california class actions.hypertouch,superior court th,d hypertouch.we return to hypertouch below.
while actions involving provisions have been called collective actions as opposed to class actions wright et,fed.practice and procedure,supra,the label is not important.the critical,but by no means the only,difference between flsa actions and class actions is the versus the feature.other differences are the tolling of the statute of limitations the definitions of parties similarly situated,and the considerations affecting the trial court involvement in an flsa action in the process of notifying potential additional plaintiffs 
the procedural dynamics of a collective action when plaintiffs opt in are different from the class action when parties may opt out of the class.as the united states supreme court has noted,the problems generated by the notice of the pending action to potential plaintiffs in a collective action with the feature call for early and active intervention by the trial court.a trial court can better manage a major adea action if it ascertains the contours of the action at the outset.the court is not limited to waiting passively for objections about the manner in which the consents were obtained.by monitoring preparation and distribution of the notice,a court can ensure that it is timely,accurate,and informative.both the parties and the court benefit from settling disputes about the content of the notice before it is distributed.this procedure may avoid the need to cancel consents obtained in an improper manner.roche sperling,supra,d.this differs markedly from a class action when the trial court role,at least at the outset of the action,is more passive and restricted to ruling on whether the action should be certified as a class action.
in sum,flsa actions are not class actions,whether the class action is governed by the federal rules of civil procedure or,in california,by section and rule et of the california rules of court.
appellants motion and the trial court ruling 
the case was set for trial on september.on july,appellants filed a motion for class certification under section.there is no ambiguity about this motion it is in every respect a motion to certify as a class of approximately current and former employees of respondent.the principal charging allegation of the motion,as of the complaint,was that respondent did not pay these employees the wages to which they were entitled.in accordance with appropriate class action procedure,appellants requested that the trial court certify the following class for purposes of determining both liability and damages in this matter,all individuals who have been or are currently employed by respondent at any time since september.
we digress at this point to clear up a matter that appellants have stressed both in their brief and in oral argument.that is appellants claim that it was the trial court who initially mandated a hearing on class action certification the suggestion is that it was the trial court,and not appellants,who initially channeled the case toward a motion to certify a class under section.
the record does not bear this out.as we have noted,appellants complaint initially pleaded that the requirements of a section class were met,the requirements of numerosity,commonality and typicality were satisfied.in the case management conference held on february,the trial court simply inquired when the motion for class action certification would be filed.the trial court did not indicate,or even remotely suggest that,in the court opinion,this was a case that potentially qualified as a class action under section.in other words,contrary to appellants suggestion,the court did not direct,suggest or intimate that appellants should bring a motion to certify a class under section.the court was simply dealing with scheduling the disposition of an issue raised by appellants complaint.
respondent opposed the motion principally on the ground that an flsa action can not be prosecuted as a class action.the opposition pointed out that flsa actions are collective actions where plaintiffs must opt in in order to participate in the action.
in their reply,appellants contended that the federal courts treated flsa actions as class actions similar to rule class actions but easier to certify,exactly as discussed in appellants motion.appellants contended that respondent was in error in claiming that an flsa action could not be a class action but that respondent gets one thing flsa action is rather than.appellants counsel made a typo in the motion,and should have requested that the court certify an class.
the trial court found that even though this was an flsa collective action,appellants had not moved to certify an collective action pursuant to the flsa.strictly speaking,an collective action is not certified as such.instead of a certification,there is the preparation of a notice of the pendency of the flsa action to persons who are similarly situated as the plaintiff s.in any event,the trial court was correct in noting that appellants never crossed the threshold of an flsa action when there are persons who are similarly situated as the
