in this appeal,market street mortgage corporation market street contends that the district court erred in certifying a class of persons represented by edward and lori friedman,in which the stated common question of law is whether market street violated subsection b of the real estate settlement procedures act of respa,codified at b,by requiring loan borrowers to pay an escrow waiver fee for which market street had performed no services.because we find that this class certification order violated the law of the case and because we also hold that subsection b does not apply to settlement fees that are alleged to be excessive,we reverse the district court certification order and remand the case with instructions to dismiss the friedmans complaint with prejudice.
the facts and procedural history are presented in part i of this opinion.part ii discusses the application of the mandate to the friedmans case.part iii reads the plain language of subsection b and holds that it is not a price control provision intended to police the reasonableness of settlement fees.part iv concludes.
edward and lori friedman refinanced their home mortgage on september,with a loan amount of.according to the standard mortgage contract of the lender,market street,a borrower is required to make monthly payments into escrow for items such as taxes,insurance premiums,and other items which can attain priority over this security instrument as a lien or encumbrance on the property.the escrow payments therefore protect the lender interest in the property securing the loan.
the majority of loans originated by market street are escrowed loans.however,certain borrowers may prefer a different arrangement.at their sole option,borrowers can obtain a waiver of the escrow requirement by paying a escrow waiver fee and assuming the primary responsibility to make payments for taxes and insurance premiums directly the benefit to borrowers who choose a loan is that the borrowers retain control over the monies that would otherwise be paid into escrow until such time as they make the payments directly.
the friedmans requested and received a loan,for which they signed a standardized escrow waiver agreement.pursuant to that agreement,the friedmans agreed to make timely payments to the appropriate tax and insurance entities and to provide copies of the receipts to market street as evidence that the payments were made.as was disclosed on the settlement statement signed by the friedmans at the time of closing,the friedmans were charged an escrow waiver fee of a quarter of one percent of the total loan amount,or.
consistent with common industry practice,market street subsequently sold the friedmans mortgage loan on the secondary mortgage market to washington mutual bank.on october,market street notified the friedmans that the transfer of the loan servicing rights to washington mutual would be effective on november.
on april,the friedmans filed suit against market street in the united states district court for the southern district of florida,alleging that no services were performed by market street in exchange for the escrow waiver fee in violation of subsection b of respa.that section reads,in pertinent part 
no person shall give and no person shall accept any portion,split,or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed.
market street moved to dismiss the action under federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing that the friedmans did not state a claim under subsection b because they did not allege that the escrow waiver fee was shared or split with a third party.on june,the friedmans filed a motion for class certification on behalf of a ll persons who after april,were charged an escrow waiver fee by market street mortgage corporation and thereafter market street mortgage corporation did not provide escrow services.consistent with the holdings of the fourth,seventh,and eighth circuits the district court agreed that the plain language of the statute requires that a subsection b claim must contain an allegation that the defendant has shared or split an unearned settlement fee with a third party,and granted market street motion to dismiss the friedmans complaint on july.
our subsequent decision in sosa chase manhattan mortgage corporation contained language that a single party can be held to violate subsection b by marking up the charge of another settlement service provider,because g iving a portion of a charge is prohibited regardless of whether there is a culpable acceptor,and accepting a portion of a charge is prohibited regardless of whether there is a culpable giver.sosa,cir.on august,the friedmans appealed the district court judgment dismissing their complaint,arguing that sosa required reversal of the district court decision.
in a may,unpublished decision,a panel of this court declined to decide whether the language in sosa is controlling or is dicta,and affirmed the district court judgment because the only allegation in the friedmans complaint is that market street rendered no services in exchange for the fee,and it is clear from the pleadings that some services were contemplated in exchange for the fee,such as monitoring the payment of taxes and insurance.friedman market street mortgage friedman i,slip op.at.cir.
in its opinion,the friedman i panel expressly declined to entertain an argument that the friedmans had not presented to the district court in their complaint,namely,that subsection b prohibits the charging of fees that are excessive in relation to services actually performed.however,the panel apparently felt that the friedmans ought to have an opportunity to present an claim to the district court because its mandate included a proviso that the friedmans be given a limited opportunity to amend their complaint so as to allege that market street charged an excessive fee in exchange for the services contemplated.id.at 
the friedmans filed an amended complaint on june,which that market street rendered no services in exchange for the escrow waiver fee,and also alleged,in accordance with the friedman i mandate,that the escrow waiver fee was excessive in relation to services performed.then,on march,they filed a second motion for class certification,requesting the certification of a ll persons who after april,were charged an escrow waiver fee by market street mortgage corporation.in a memorandum in support of the motion,the friedmans argued that no individualized analysis of the value of the services and thus the reasonableness of the fee charged was required because their amended complaint alleged that no services whatsoever were rendered by market street.
on june,the district court certified a class of a ll persons who after april,were charged an escrow waiver fee by market street mortgage corporation and whose mortgage loan was sold by market street mortgage corporation within one year from the date of the closing of said loan.the court found that t he overriding common question of law is whether market street mortgage corporation violated respa by charging an escrow waiver fee under such circumstances where no service was rendered by the defendant.emphasis added.this order is now before us pursuant to the grant of market street petition for review under federal rule of civil procedure f.
the friedmans primary argument on appeal is that nothing in the friedman i opinion precluded them from the claim that no services were performed by market street in exchange for the escrow waiver fee.indeed,the friedmans go even further by arguing that in friedman i,this honorable court allowed plaintiffs the opportunity to replead and to conduct discovery to determine whether,in fact,market street actually performed post closing services in monitoring that the homeowner taxes and insurance premium was paid,year after year.
we are deeply troubled by this argument.the mandate in this case was clear and specific.we held,without equivocation,that some services were rendered in this case t he only allegation in the friedmans complaint is that market street rendered no services in exchange for the fee,and it is clear from the pleadings that some services were contemplated in exchange for the fee,such as monitoring the payment of taxes and insurance.the question of whether services were rendered in this case was settled.if the friedmans thought it was not settled,they could have moved for clarification of the mandate,or for rehearing.they did neither.instead,the friedmans simply obtained the district court leave to amend their complaint so as to allege that the escrow waiver fee was excessive in relation to services performed by market street.
on limited remand for the specific purpose of giving the friedmans the opportunity to allege that the escrow waiver fee was excessive,the friedmans effectively urged the district court to disregard the clear instructions set forth in the revisiting the question of whether no services were rendered in exchange for the escrow waiver contravention of the mandate rule.the mandate rule is a specific application of the law of the case doctrine which provides that subsequent courts are bound by any findings of fact or conclusions of law made by the court of appeals in a prior appeal of the same case.robinson parrish,cir citation omitted piambino bailey,cir.the law of the case doctrine and the mandate rule appl y to all issues decided expressly or by necessary implication.piambino,at.a trial court,upon receiving the mandate of an appellate court,may not alter,amend,or examine the mandate,or give any further relief or review,but must enter an order in strict compliance with the mandate.id.at.contrary to the friedmans contention,the friedman i panel in no wise directed the district court to reexamine whether market street rendered no services in exchange for the escrow waiver fee,nor did the panel postpone the resolution of that issue pending further discovery on remand.friedman i established the law of this case that some services had been rendered.again,the friedmans did not file a motion for clarification of the mandate or for rehearing as such,the district court was not free to ignore the mandate and reexamine the issue.see litman.mut.life ins,cir.
the friedmans cite oladeinde birmingham,cir,in support of the proposition that a plaintiff may return to district court and a claim,notwithstanding the fact that a court of appeals has affirmed the dismissal of the claim on the merits.that case is wholly inapposite.in oladeinde,which involved a civil rights action against police officers,we affirmed the district court order denying qualified immunity for the police officers because of the limited nature of the record at the motion to dismiss stage.oladeinde,at.but that affirmance did not establish the law of the case.we explained we stress,however,that defendants retain the right to assert the defense at the next stage of the proceedings and,for that matter,throughout the proceedings as more facts are developed.id.the fact that we expressly permitted the defendants to the qualified immunity defense as the facts developed in oladeinde does not even remotely approach the proposition that a district court may revisit an issue already decided by an appellate court.
we now consider whether the district court was otherwise justified by exceptional circumstances in deviating from the law of the case established in friedman only three such exceptions are recognized where the evidence on a subsequent trial was substantially different,controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of the law applicable to such issues,or the decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.united states,cir quoting white murtha,cir 
there has been no intervening change in controlling authority,and the friedmans make no such claim.rather,the friedmans contend that this case falls under the remaining two exceptions.we disagree.
as to the first exception,we are not persuaded that the new evidence proffered by the friedmans is substantially different so as to warrant a departure from the doctrine of the law of the case.the friedmans contend that discovery has established a that market street charges a separate fee for a third party tax monitoring service and,therefore,no part of the fee is charged for that service,and b that market street performed no insurance premium payment monitoring services for the friedmans,or any of the other class members,because it sold their loans on the secondary market before any such payments were due.such evidence,however,is not substantially different it is of a piece with what was contemplated by the allegations in the complaint before the friedman i panel.the friedman i panel had before it the friedmans mortgage loan documents,including the escrow waiver agreement the fact that the friedmans were charged a separate fee for third party tax monitoring services was then apparent,because item of the settlement statement listed the escrow waiver fee of separately from item,the tax service fee of.the friedman initial complaint also alleged that the friedmans mortgage was resold in the secondary market soon after closing,and that the class action was brought on behalf of borrowers for whom market street provided no escrow services and,in fact,sold or transferred the loan.all of this was before the friedman i panel,and the panel duly concluded that it is clear from the pleadings that some services were contemplated in exchange for the fee,such as monitoring the payment of taxes and insurance.
as for the friedmans invocation of the third exception to the law of the case doctrine,we are not convinced that the panel decision in friedman i was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.the friedmans assertion of clear error and manifest injustice is essentially a restatement of their claim that the discovery of new evidence requires a departure from the law of the case,a contention that we have already rejected.moreover,further discovery on remand does not indicate clear error in this case.steven chiou,market street corporate representative,testified during his deposition that the charged as a tax service fee is used to pay a third party contractor to perform tax monitoring services.it does not necessarily follow,however,that no portion of the escrow waiver fee is charged for services related to tax service monitoring.in sosa,the defendant,chase manhattan mortgage corporation chase,outsourced the task of providing messenger or courier services in connection with loan closing.sosa,at.chase charged borrowers a fee for messenger or courier services,but paid only part of the fee to the third party contractor.id.at.we held that even if chase could not be credited with the actual delivery,chase benefitted the borrowers by arranging for third party contractors to perform the deliveries.under these circumstances,we find it impossible to say that chase performed no services for which its retention of a portion of the fees at issue was justified.id.at.similarly,market street performs the service of locating and arranging for a third party contractor to perform tax monitoring services.
chiou also testified that certain services are rendered on all loans,regardless of whether they are subsequently resold within one year of their origination.such services include 
setting up the servicing system for those loans prior to their transfer capturing and entering the current tax and hazard insurance information making arrangements for and payments to a tax service company in connection with the servicing of that loan and following up with the new for the first several months to ensure that the tax and insurance information was correctly transferred,and to resolve any problems that might arise with regard to the loan servicing 
the friedmans do not contend that these services are not performed,but rather attempt to downplay the value of such services by arguing that market street has the temerity to suggest that it performs a service by merely opening up its file.
in sum,none of the exceptions to the law of the case doctrine apply in this case.
the friedman i opinion expressly declined to decide whether a settlement service provider
