this case involves the unsuccessful effort by four former state prisoners to certify a class action challenging their lack of access to mental health care while incarcerated in the el paso county,colorado jail.the district court denied them class certification and dismissed the suit based on its conclusion that under the prisoner litigation reform act the relief the plaintiffs sought was beyond the competence and the jurisdiction of the court.shook bd.of county comm rs of county of el paso.
the plaintiffs now appeal,arguing that the district court applied the wrong standard in denying class certification.we take jurisdiction under and,agreeing with the prisoners,reverse and remand for further proceedings.
background 
a.the jail 
the el paso county jail is located in colorado springs,colorado.the jail houses both men and women,including recent arrestees,persons awaiting trial,and persons convicted and sentenced to terms of two years or less under state law.each of the four named plaintiffs in this suit was incarcerated in the jail sometime between and,either as a pretrial detainee or as an inmate.
b.the class action complaint 
on april,the prisoners filed a class action complaint under seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against the el paso county board of county commissioners and the sheriff of el paso county in his official capacity.they sought to certify a class of all persons with serious mental health needs who are now,or in the future will be,confined in the el paso county jail.app.at.
in their complaint,the named plaintiffs allege that jail officials have violated the prisoners constitutional rights by acting with deliberate indifference to their mental health needs contrary to the eighth amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and the fourteenth amendment prohibition against punishment of pretrial detainees.in particular,the plaintiffs allege that jail personnel subjected them to inadequate housing and overcrowding inadequate inpatient care inadequate mental health facilities for women inmates improper treatment through the use of special detention cells,restraints,and pepper spray inadequate supervision to prevent or suicide inadequate methods of distributing medication and inadequate mental health staffing.they also assert that el paso management of the jail has created a substantial risk of future harm to class members.
the individual plaintiffs each assert slightly different factual allegations to support their claims of deliberate indifference.the first,mark shook,maintains that he has been receiving psychiatric care since childhood for his conditions of asperberger syndrome a form of autism and bipolar disorder.before he came to the jail in fall,he regularly took drugs prescribed by his psychiatrist to control his symptoms.he alleges that after his arrival at the jail,he had no access to doctors or medications for three weeks.when jail officials finally allowed him to see a doctor,the doctor refused to prescribe his regular medications because they were not on the jail list of approved medications.
plaintiff dennis jones asserts that he is bipolar,suffers from depression and anxiety,and has considered suicide.prior to entering the jail in september he claims a prescription of a combination of various drugs successfully controlled his symptoms.jones claims that jail officials denied him access to any medications for nearly a month after his incarceration,and when he finally obtained a prescription,he received only an insufficient dose of one of the drugs he needed.in addition,he alleges that jail staff who monitored the levels of his medication through blood sample testing took the samples too soon or too long after he received his medication for the tests to be accurate.
shirlen mosby alleges that she is bipolar and has experienced numerous attacks of anxiety,depression,feelings of hopelessness,and suicidal thoughts.she asserts that after her incarceration began in april,jail officials improperly placed her in special detention cells and jail staff belittled her condition.she also maintains that because of inadequate supervision she was able to attempt suicide three times while housed in the jail.
finally,james vaughan asserts that he is bipolar and has nearly continuous depression and anxiety.he claims that he had inadequate access to psychiatrists during his incarceration as a pretrial detainee beginning in may.he also claims that he was deprived of medication for several days after he arrived at the jail and never received the blood tests necessary to monitor the medication he finally did receive.
the plaintiffs allege that their lack of access to adequate mental health care is.for example,they claim that the jail officials deliberate indifference to prisoners mental health needs has led to the deaths of at least four prisoners and resulted in injuries to others.
c.the procedural history 
el paso moved to dismiss the class action complaint,arguing that each class member was required to fully exhaust his or her administrative remedies under the prisoner litigation reform act.a plra.el paso asserted that because only the class representatives had exhausted their remedies,the class could not be certified.on its own motion,the district court requested supplemental briefing from both parties regarding the impact of the plra remedial provisions on the issue of certifying a class seeking prospective relief.app.at citing.
after oral argument,the district court issued an order denying both the defendants motion for dismissal and the plaintiffs motion for class certification.although the district court noted that the plaintiffs had each alleged facts sufficient to show that el paso was deliberately indifferent to their mental health needs in violation of the eighth amendment,see shook,at citing estelle gamble,d,the court ultimately concluded that the plra precluded class certification because the breadth of relief sought made the proposed class action not manageable with the court limited jurisdiction.id.at.
in light of its ruling,the court granted the plaintiffs thirty days in which to file an amended complaint for individual relief.id.at.by this time,however,none of the plaintiffs remained in the jail and therefore they no longer had standing to seek individual relief.the district court accordingly dismissed the action.app.at.
the prisoners now appeal the district court denial of class certification.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
whether the district court applied the correct legal standard in its decision to grant or deny class certification is reviewed de novo.thiessen general electric capital,cir.when the district court has applied the proper standard in deciding whether to certify a class,we may reverse that decision only for abuse of discretion.adamson bowen,cir.however,that discretion must be exercised within the framework of rule.stirman exxon,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs where the district court misapplies the rule factors in deciding whether class certification is appropriate.see see also valdez,cir there is no abuse of discretion when the trial court applies the correct criteria under rule to the facts of the case.citations omitted.we review de novo whether the district court correctly determined that the plra applied to the rule class certification analysis.see dang unum life ins.of,cir we review the district court decisions on questions of law de novo.
although the party seeking to certify a class bears the burden of proving that all the requirements of rule are met,see reed bowen,cir,the district court must engage in its own rigorous analysis of whether the prerequisites of rule a have been satisfied.of the falcon,d.in doing so,the court must accept the substantive allegations of the complaint as true,at see also eisen carlisle jacquelin,d,although it need not blindly rely on conclusory allegations which parrot rule and may consider the legal and factual issues presented by plaintiff complaints,at,quoting herbert newberg alba conte,newberg on class actions ed.
b.the district court order 
we now turn to the district court denial of class certification.rule a requires an analysis of four elements which are preconditions to class certification numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of the named parties to represent the class.a.the court must then look to the category of class action under rule b for additional prerequisites involving certification of a class.
in this case,the district court appropriately began its analysis by referring to rule a four prerequisites to class certification.instead of applying rule a framework to the facts alleged,however,it moved to other considerations controlling the motion for class certification,including 
whether the named plaintiffs and interveners have standing to assert the claims made on behalf of the putative class,whether the members of the class can be identified,whether the class allegations are broader than the constitutional claim,whether the putative class is manageable and,whether the court has the authority to order the prospective remedy requested.
shook,at.the court evaluation of these factors turned primarily on whether the prisoners could in fact show an eighth amendment violation and whether their allegations,if proven,would entitle them to the relief they requested.the court did not address rule b.
in evaluating whether the prisoners could allege an eighth amendment violation,the court reached two conclusions.it first determined that because the jail population was inherently fluid,the plaintiffs could only prove that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the class needs if the jail used an intake diagnostic procedure to determine persons having serious mental health needs.id.at.however,it concluded that intake screening was not constitutionally required and therefore could not form the basis for a constitutional violation.
the court then determined that the prisoners complaint was really an attempt to reform jail practices rather than to redress past constitutional torts and prevent their reoccurrence.id.at.the problem here,according to the court,was that the plra limited the federal court ability to address such a complaint.since it concluded that under the plra it could neither prescribe jail practices for humane treatment of prisoners nor interfere with the executive and legislative branches ability to structure prisons as they saw fit,the relief the plaintiffs sought was beyond the competence and the jurisdiction of the court.id.at 
c.the effect of the plra on rule 
we first consider whether,as the district court concluded,the plra has changed the requirements for class certification under rule.el paso argues that the plra has changed the prison condition litigation landscape in a fundamental way that must be considered in the rule class action certification analysis.the prisoners respond that the plra affects only the remedies they can ultimately obtain and does not alter rule.
the district court analysis of the plra centered around the following provision that limits prospective relief in cases involving prison conditions 
prospective relief in any civil action with respect to prison conditions shall extend no further than necessary to correct the violation of the federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs.the court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn,extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the federal right,and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the federal right.the court shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief.
while the court determined that this provision did not entirely prohibit class action certification,it held that it did constitute a significant limitation on its jurisdiction to entertain class action suits by prisoners.shook,at.the question for us,then,is whether courts may consider the relief the prisoners seek in determining whether to certify a class under the plra.our review of the plra leads us to conclude that it does not limit class certification decisions in this way.
in interpreting the plra,w e begin,as we do any instance of statutory construction,with the language of the statute.in re geneva steel,cir citing yankee atomic.land,cir see also guidry sheet metal workers int l ass n,local,cir the objective of reading the statute is to determine the intent of congress.the text of the statute itself is the best evidence of that intent.citations omitted.the text of the plra says nothing about the certification of class actions.based on the statute absence of direction in that area,we presume that congress intended to leave rule intact.see dep t of hous.urban dev.rucker,d concluding that congress is presumed to be aware of a statute interpretation when it amends another part of the same statute without addressing the part at issue edelman lynchburg,d explaining that congress amendment of the law without repudiating the regulation suggested consent to ongoing use of the regulation.this presumption is buttressed by the fact that the plra includes provisions relating to the administration of class action suits,suggesting that congress recognized that class actions would continue to remain available to challenge conditions of confinement founding church of scientology of,director,fed.bureau of investigation,noting that because congress did not expressly waive the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement when it amended the federal tort claims act,that requirement remained applicable to class actions under rule.
our conclusion that the plra does not alter the class certification analysis under rule has been reached by other courts.the fifth circuit,for example,held that a is not implicated until the court undertakes to fashion prospective relief.williams edwards,cir the district court has fashioned no prospective relief and the provisions of a have yet to be triggered.the court did,however,explain that if,after examining the plaintiffs claims,the district court found a violation of a federal right,then any remedy it might fashion must conform to the standards set forth in the act.id.thus,because the fashioning of prospective relief does not occur at the class certification stage,it logically follows that a does not bear on a court class certification analysis.
in addition,courts have continued to allow prison conditions cases to be certified as long as the elements of rule have been met,even cases broadly challenging conditions of confinement.for instance,in anderson garner,d,when the defendants argued that under a courts should diligently refrain from certifying classes which would require the federal courts to maintain security and control of the state prison system,the court emphasized that s ection a addresses only the type of relief courts may use to redress constitutional violations,and says nothing about the nature of the proceedings underlying the remedy ordered by the court.id.at citations omitted see also armstrong davis,cir reviewing the propriety of class certification under rule,then separately reviewing whether district court injunctive relief was narrowly tailored under a skinner uphoff,certifying class action challenging prison conditions because plaintiffs satisfied elements of rule jones el berge,wl,allowing amended prisoner class action complaint challenging prison conditions because plaintiffs satisfied elements of rule.
thus,we conclude that congress did not intend the plra to alter class certification requirements under rule and that the district court erred in concluding otherwise.
federal rule of civil procedure 
having held that the plra does not add new elements to the class certification analysis,rule remains the appropriate analytical framework for class certification questions.we now turn to the issue of whether the district court properly applied rule certification requirements to the facts of this case.
in determining the propriety of a class action,the question is not whether the plaintiff or plaintiffs have stated a cause of action or will prevail on the merits,but rather whether the requirements of rule are met.anderson city of albuquerque,cir quotation omitte
