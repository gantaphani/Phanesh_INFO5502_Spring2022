background 
petitioner is a citizen of mexico who came to the united states at the age of one in.he became a lawful permanent resident eight years later.petitioner was arrested in april,charged with being removable based on past drug and theft convictions,and detained thereafter by the department of homeland security.petitioner contested his removability before an immigration judge ij,who determined he was subject to mandatory removal based on either of his past offenses.the board of immigration appeals bia reversed the ij finding that petitioner was removable on the basis of his drug offense,but upheld the ij finding that his theft conviction was an aggravated felony requiring removal.petitioner appealed the bia finding that his theft offense constituted an aggravated felony and we stayed his removal pending our decision.the appeal has been held in abeyance pending determination of a separate appeal to the united states supreme court.during his detention petitioner received three custody reviews from immigration and customs enforcement that determined to continue his detention,the latest occurring in september.in conjunction with these reviews,petitioner received no hearing or notice explaining ice decision beyond mention that his ninth circuit appeal was pending 
on may,petitioner filed the current petition for writ of habeas corpus against the secretaries of the departments of homeland security and justice,the field office director in the central district of california for immigration and customs enforcement ice,and the head officials of various alien detention facilities in the district respondents.petitioner seeks relief on behalf of himself and a class of aliens in the central district of california who are or will be detained for longer than six months pursuant to one of the general immigration detention statutes pending completion of removal proceedings,including judicial review,and have not been afforded a hearing to determine whether their prolonged detention is justified.pet.for writ of habeas corpus.petitioner asserts that the detention of the members of the proposed class is not authorized by statute,and,in the alternative,that if their detention is authorized it violates the fifth amendment guarantee of due process.petitioner requested relief includes the certification of the proposed class,appointment of petitioner counsel as class counsel,and injunctive and declaratory relief providing all members of the class individual hearings before an immigration judge,at which respondents will bear the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that petitioner and each class member is a sufficient danger or risk of flight to justify his detention in light of how long he has been detained already and the likelihood of his case being finally resolved in favor of the government in the reasonably foreseeable future.pet.for writ of habeas corpus.
on june,petitioner filed a motion for class certification,which was opposed by respondents on the same grounds now raised in this appeal.ice released petitioner from detention under an order of supervision approximately a month later pursuant to.respondents subsequently filed a motion to dismiss petitioner action on mootness grounds in light of his release.
the district court denied petitioner motion for class certification and the respondents motion to dismiss on march,in a order.petitioner filed the current appeal of the denial of class certification on july.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court decision to deny class certification for abuse of discretion.zinser accufix research,cir,amended,cir.however,a district court decision as to class certification is not afforded the traditional deference when it is not supported by sufficient findings.molski gleich,cir quoting local joint executive bd.of trust fund las vegas sands,cir.here,where the district court made no findings whatsoever in support of its denial of class certification,but the record before us is sufficiently developed,we may evaluate for ourselves whether the class should be certified.las vegas sands,at respondents contend that we should afford the full deference normally accorded the district court order on the basis that its findings and reasoning can be derived implicitly from respondents opposition to class certification filed below.respondents,however,offered multiple reasons for denying class certification.we would be engaging in mere guesswork were we to assume the district court relied on any particular reason or reasons.we,therefore,follow las vegas sands in reviewing the district court determination.
iii.definition of proposed class 
petitioner seeks to certify a class of detainees who are held pursuant to what petitioner labels the general immigration statutes.respondents assert that petitioner use of the phrase general immigration statutes creates an undefined class.while not a model of clarity,petitioner habeas corpus petition and request for class certification together indicate that general immigration statutes refers narrowly to,b,and a.whether d a is also included in the definition is ambiguous,as it is only referenced in petitioner subsequent filings.this is of no practical importance,however,as section d a merely provides for discretionary parole of detainees,which,upon revocation,returns the detainees to the form of legal detention they were in prior to parole.d see clark martinez,d discussing effect of section d on detention status.hence,we conclude petitioner proposed class is adequately defined for certification.
iv.immigration detention statutes 
the three immigration detention statutes implicated by the proposed class govern detention of aliens at different stages of the admission and removal process.b provides for discretionary detention of aliens pending a determination of admissibility provides for both discretionary detention generally and mandatory detention for certain narrow categories of aliens pending a determination of their removability a provides for mandatory detention of aliens ordered removed during the day removal period and discretionary detention after the end of the removal period petitioner request for relief raises the question of whether prolonged detention without a bond hearing is authorized under any of these statutes and,in the alternative,even if it is authorized,whether such detention is constitutional.these are not new questions for this court.in a series of decisions,the supreme court and this court have grappled in fashion with whether the various immigration detention statutes may authorize indefinite or prolonged detention of detainees and,if so,may do so without providing a bond hearing.each decision has undertaken interpretation of the immigration detention statutes against the backdrop of the serious constitutional issues raised by indefinite or prolonged detention.we review these decisions to provide the necessary context to aid in determining the appropriateness of class relief.
discretionary detention 
in zadvydas davis,d,the supreme court first took up the question of whether an immigration discretionary detention statute authorized indefinite or prolonged detention.the alien there was detained pursuant to section a,authorizing discretionary detention of aliens after the removal period.the court held that a a statute permitting indefinite detention of an alien would raise a serious constitutional problem.id.at.the court found section a ambiguous as to whether it authorized indefinite detention and,therefore,interpreting the statute to avoid a serious constitutional threat,conclude d that,once removal is no longer reasonably foreseeable,continued detention is no longer authorized by statute.id.at.the court determined that for six months following the beginning of the removal period an alien detention was presumptively authorized.id.at.however,after that period,once the alien provides good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future,the government must respond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing in order to continue to detain the alien.id.though zadvydas dealt only with aliens detained pursuant to section a who were removable under section a c,a or a,the supreme court subsequently extended its holding to the other two categories of aliens governed by the statute aliens inadmissible under section and aliens determined by the secretary of homeland security to be a risk to the community or a flight risk.see clark,at.see also xi ins,cir.we have further extended the zadvydas framework to discretionary detention pursuant to section b and a,finding that indefinite detention under these statutes poses the same constitutional concerns present in zadvydas.see clark,cir nadarajah gonzales,cir.
having applied the zadvydas framework to determine when prolonged discretionary detention is authorized,we have also begun to determine what sort of bond hearing,if any,is needed to justify prolonged discretionary detention for individual petitioners.as we stated in,even when detention is authorized by statute,due process requires adequate procedural protections to ensure that the government asserted justification for physical confinement outweighs the individual constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical restraint.at quoting zadvydas,at.in dep t of homeland,cir,we determined that section a authorized detention of the petitioner at issue and proceeded to discuss what bond hearing,if any,he was entitled to.we concluded that section a provided authority for the attorney general to release an alien detained under the section on bond following a bond hearing.id.because the prolonged detention of an alien without an individualized determination of his dangerousness or flight risk would be constitutionally doubtful,we further concluded that a must be construed as requiring the attorney general to provide the alien with such a hearing.id.emphasis omitted.hence,we held that an alien detained under section a is entitled to release on bond unless the government establishes that he is a flight risk or will be a danger to the community.id.at internal quotation marks omitted see also mukasey,cir,at finding three bond hearings for section a detainee satisfied due process tijani willis,cir finding alien detained for nearly three years could not be mandatorily detained under section c and ordering bond hearing,impliedly finding alien was detained under section a.
in diouf mukasey,cir,by contrast,we refused to reach the issue of whether a bond hearing was required under section a.we held the detention of the petitioner at issue beyond the six month period was authorized under section a.id.at.we then turned to the issue of what bond hearing,if any,the petitioner was entitled to for determining the necessity of his detention.we concluded that while release on bond was clearly authorized by section a and its implementing regulations,it was unclear whether a bond hearing was required under the statute for petitioner and what burden if any should be placed on the government at such a hearing.id.at.because the district court had not had an opportunity to reach this question,we declined to reach it in the first instance and remanded.id.at.however,in doing so we noted that the issue was somewhat similar to that in,strongly implying that the district court determination should at least be informed by its reasoning.diouf,at.
mandatory detention 
we have also dealt with indefinite or prolonged detention under immigration mandatory detention provisions,including sections c,a,and a c.section c provides for mandatory detention of criminal aliens for expedited removal.the supreme court has held that detention pursuant to section c does not raise any due process concerns.demore kim,d.however,in upholding section c,the court interpreted it to authorize mandatory detention only for the limited period of the alien removal proceedings,which the court estimated lasts roughly a month and a half in the vast majority of cases in which it is invoked,and about five months in the minority of cases in which the alien chooses to appeal his removal order to the bia.id.at.we have subsequently clarified that,in order to avoid the serious constitutional questions raised by indefinite mandatory detention,detention of an alien beyond an expedited period ceases to be mandatory under section c and instead becomes discretionary under section a.see,at tijani,at.
we have additionally held that detention pursuant to section a poses no due process issues,regardless of whether removal of the detained alien is foreseeable,because the statute authorizes detention for only the removal period and therefore does not create any danger of unconstitutionally indefinite detention.khotesouvan morones,cir.we have taken the same view when an alien is detained pursuant to the related provision of a c,which allows the removal period to be extended and detention to continue beyond ninety days if an alien conspires or acts to prevent his own removal.pelich ins,cir.the court,while expressly declin ing to endorse or reject any inferred limitation to a c found that,in any case,an alien can not assert a viable constitutional claim when his indefinite detention is due to his failure to cooperate with the ins efforts to remove him.id.at see also lema ins,cir we conclude that a c authorizes the ins continued detention of a removable alien so long as the alien fails to cooperate fully and honestly with officials to obtain travel documents.key to this determination was the court view that t he risk of indefinite detention that motivated the supreme court statutory interpretation in zadvydas does not exist when an alien is the cause of his own detention.pelich,at.
alleged bars to class relief 
petitioner seeks to end our rulings in habeas actions on the necessity of bond hearings to justify prolonged detention in the immigration context and have the courts address the issue on a basis across the various general immigration detention statutes.while ordinarily disfavored,the ninth circuit has recognized that class actions may be brought pursuant to habeas corpus.cox mccarthy,cir see also mead parker,cir finding habeas relief to be appropriate in cases where the relief sought can be of immediate benefit to a large and amorphous group.respondents assert,nonetheless,that various constitutional,statutory,and procedural bars to class relief exist in this case.
respondents initially challenge class certification on the ground that petitioner individual claim has been rendered moot by his release from detention.in fact,mootness of the petitioner claim is not a basis for denial of class certification,but rather is a basis for dismissal of petitioner action.because the district court did not dismiss petitioner action,but only denied class certification,we see no reason to conclude it based its denial on a finding of mootness.if it had made such a finding,it would have been in error.petitioner was released pursuant to,which provides that t he executive associate commissioner shall have authority,in the exercise of discretion,to revoke release and return to service custody an alien previously approved for release under the procedures in this section.l.while the regulation provides the detainee some opportunity to respond to the reasons for revocation,it provides no other procedural and no meaningful substantive limit on this exercise of discretion as it allows revocation when,in the opinion of the revoking official t he purposes of release have been served or t he conduct of the alien,or any other circumstance,indicates that release would no longer be appropriate.id.l i,iv emphasis added.this places petitioner in a position analogous to the petitioner challenging his prolonged detention in clark martinez,who was released from detention pursuant to a discretionary parole provision while his suit was ongoing.the supreme court found his case was not mooted 
if benitez is correct,as his suit contends,that the government lacks the authority to continue to detain him,he would have to be released,and could not be taken back into custody unless he violated the conditions of release or his detention became necessary to effectuate his removal his current release,however,is not only limited to one year,but subject to the secretary discretionary authority to terminate thus,benitez continue s to have a personal stake in the outcome of his petition.
clark,at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.petitioner asserts that the government can not detain him unless it can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence at a hearing before an immigration judge that he is a sufficient danger or flight risk to justify his detention.if petitioner is successful in his petition he would be entitled to such a hearing where the government would need to meet its burden or offer him a nondiscretionary release until such time as it can make the requisite showing or has an independent statutory basis to detain him.this would place petitioner in a far different situation from his current one,released pursuant to the government independent determination but subject to revocation on the government discretion without hearing before a neutral and without burden of justification on the government.hence,like the petitioner in clark,petitioner here retains a personal stake in the determination of his claim such that it is not moot.
we further note that petitioner current release is subject to a number of restrictions,including the requirements that he remain within feet of his home from to every night and wear an ankle monitoring device at all times.petitioner proposes that he receive a bond hearing to determine not only whether he should be released,but also under what conditions such release would take place.the strict limitations on petitioner freedom,therefore,provide an additional reason why his case presents a live controversy.carafas lavallee,d holding that when habeas petitioner was released from custody,but his felony conviction prevented him from engaging in certain businesses,voting,and serving on juries,underlying habeas case still presented live controversy.
respondents additionally argue that class certification must be denied because the claims of the proposed class are not all yet ripe a claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated,or indeed may not occur at all.bova city of medford,cir internal quotation marks omitted.respondents first argue that the claims of proposed class members detained pursuant to section a are unripe because there is no indication yet that the government is refusing to comply with ruling.this argument rests on a misunderstanding of what constitutes membership in the proposed class.members of the proposed class are by definition aliens who have been detained without a bond hearing.if an alien who would otherwise be a member of the class receives a bond hearing pursuant to or any other ruling they would cease to be a member of the class.hence,the government full compliance with could reduce the size of the class,but it could not render the claims of class members unripe.respondents additionally argue that the proposed class suffers from ripeness issues because it references future class members.the inclusion of future class members in a class is not itself unusual or objectionable.see,probe state teachers ret,cir laduke nelson,cir.when the future persons referenced become members of the class,their claims will necessarily be ripe.hence,we conclude that the requirement of ripeness raises no bar to certification of the class.
respondents assert that f,section a of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,bars class certification in this case.section f provides 
regardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the identity of the party or parties bringing the action,no court other than the supreme court shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of the provisions of part iv of this subchapter,as amended by iirira,other than with respect to the application of such provisions to an individual alien against whom proceedings under such part have been initiated.
f.part iv includes.see catholic soc,ins,cir en banc.respondents argue that section f bars the proposed class from receiving any injunctive relief,thereby requiring denial of class certification.
respondents are doubly mistaken.section f can not bar certification of the class unless it bars the proposed class from receiving any class relief.respondents do not argue,and it is not the case,that section f bars petitioner from receiving declaratory relief on behalf of the class.the supreme court has recognized as much by its plain terms,and even by its title,section f is nothing more or less than a limit on injunctive relief.it prohibits federal courts from granting classwide injunctive relief against the operation of,but specifies that this ban does not extend to individual cases.reno,d.hence,for this reason alone,section f did not provide the district court with a basis to deny class certification.
in addition,we conclude that section f does not bar injunctive relief for the proposed class.section f prohibits only injunction of the operation of the detention statutes,not injunction of a violation of the statutes.this is a distinction we have made before in a decision vacated on unrelated grounds.see ali ashcroft,cir,vacated on unrelated grounds sub nom.ali gonzales,cir.we held there 
section f limits the district court authority to enjoin the ins from carrying out legitimate removal orders.where,however,a petitioner seeks to enjoin conduct that allegedly is not even authorized by the statute,the court is not enjoining the operation of part iv of subchapter ii,and f therefore is not implicated.
id.analogously,petitioner here does not seek to enjoin the operation of the immigration detention statutes,but to enjoin conduct it asserts is not authorized by the statutes.petitioner argues only that the immigration detention statutes,to the extent they can not be interpreted as requiring provision of a bond hearing,must be enjoined as unconstitutional.however,as this latter argument for relief may never be reached,it can not be a basis for denial of class certification.
respondents assert that we should not adopt the reasoning of the vacated opinion in ali,but instead follow our decision in catholic soc,ins,cir,aff in part and rev in part en banc,cir.there we found that injunctive relief for a class asserting that the ins misinterpreted legalization provisions of the immigration control and reform act was barred by section f.we stated 
r egardless of the fact that the injunction provides relief for a harm ostensibly created by the ins misinterpretation of the legalization provisions of part v,insofar as it would interfere with the operation of part iv,the injunction here is contrary to the plain language of f and the district court lacked the jurisdiction to enter it.
id.at.we subsequently reversed this conclusion on en banc review,however,on the basis that the ordered injunction was issued under part v of the subchapter,rather than part iv and,therefore,not within the terms of section f.catholic soc,at.were we nonetheless to accept the panel reasoning as persuasive,it would not control here.the requested injunction at issue does not seek to enjoin the operation of part iv provisions to relieve harm caused by misinterpretation of other statutory provisions,but to enjoin conduct alleged not to be authorized by the proper operation of part iv provisions.the sound reasoning of ali persuades that this is not barred by the plain terms of section f 
rumsfeld padilla 
finally,respondents claim that the supreme court holding in rumsfeld padilla,d,renders class action relief inappropriate in this case.in padilla,the supreme court stated that longstanding practice confirms that in habeas challenges to present physical confinement core challenges the default rule is that the proper respondent is the warden of the facility where the prisoner is being held,not the attorney general or some other remote supervisory official.id.at.respondents argue that this statement mandates that the proper respondents for members of the proposed class are the various wardens overseeing their individual custody.respondents assert that this renders class relief impossible because,at a jurisdictional minimum,all proposed class members must be under the immediate supervision of the same custodian.resp ts answering br.respondents fail to recognize that padilla specifically reserved the question of whether the proper respondent in habeas challenges brought by an alien detained pending deportation would be the immediate custodian of the alien.padilla,at.we need not reach it because,even were the supreme court statement in padilla applicable here,respondents argument is baseless.respondents cite no authority or rationale for the proposition that we do not have jurisdiction to provide class relief in a habeas corpus action that meets the requirements for certification merely because class members are in the immediate custody of different facilities.such actions have been maintained previously against single and multiple respondents.see schall martin,d class of juveniles sought habeas corpus relief from pretrial detention under state law ex rel.sero preiser.cir class of young adults sought habeas corpus relief from serving terms in state reformatories.regardless of who the proper respondents for the class are,we conclude certification of the class will not pose any jurisdictional concerns.
in addition to raising various bars to class relief,respondents assert that the proposed class fails to comply with the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure,governing class certification.rule a provides that a class may be certified only if 
the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable 
there are questions of law or fact common to the class 
the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class and 
the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.
a.the party seeking certification must meet all of these requirements and rule b further provides that for certification the class must fall into one of three categories.zinser,at t he party seeking class certification bears the burden of demonstrating that she has met each of the four requirements of rule a and at least one of the requirements of rule b.petitioner seeks certification under the category provided for in rule b,which requires that the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.b.respondents challenge the proposed class compliance with all aspects of rule except the numerosity requirement,which respondents concede is met.we discuss the proposed class compliance with the remaining requirements individually.
commonality 
the commonality requirement serves chiefly two purposes ensuring that absentee members are fairly and adequately represented and ensuring practical and efficient case management.walters reno,cir.we have construed this requirement permissively.hanlon chrysler,cir.it is not necessary that a ll questions of fact and law be common to satisfy the rule.id.we have found t he existence of shared legal issues with divergent factual predicates is sufficient,as is a common core of salient facts coupled with disparate legal remedies within the class.see,marisol giuliani,cir the commonality requirement is met if plaintiffs grievances share a common question of law or of fact.baby neal for by kanter casey.cir the commonality requirement will be satisfied if the named plaintiffs share at least one question of fact or law with the grievances of the prospective class.nor does common as used in rule a mean complete congruence.in re first alliance mortg,cir.we find the claims of the class share sufficiently common questions of law to meet the requirement of rule a.
respondents challenge the commonality of class members claims on the ground that class members suffer detention for different reasons and under the authority of different statutes.respondents assert that,as a result,the question of whether individual class members detention may be continued without a bond hearing turns on divergent questions of statutory interpretation and consideration of different factual circumstances.respondents are undoubtedly correct that members of the proposed class do not share every fact in common or completely identical legal issues.this is not required by rule a.instead,the commonality requirements asks us to look only for some shared legal issue or a common core of facts.this the proposed members of the class certainly have.in each case in which we have interpreted the scope of various statutes providing for both discretionary and mandatory detention in the immigration context,our determinations have been guided,if not controlled,by the question of whether indefinite or prolonged detention generating serious constitutional concerns is present.a form of that question is posed here may an individual be detained for over six months without a bond hearing under a statute that does not explicitly authorize detention for longer than that time without generating serious constitutional concerns this question will be posed by the detention of every member of the class and their entitlement to a bond hearing will largely be determined by its answer.see,at because the prolonged detention of an alien without an individualized determination of his dangerousness or flight risk would be constitutionally doubtful,we hold that a must be construed as requiring the attorney general to provide the alien with such a hearing.emphasis omitted tijani,at interpreting statutory framework to provide bond hearing because it is constitutionally doubtful that congress may authorize imprisonment of this duration for lawfully admitted resident aliens who are subject to removal.the nature of the particular statute authorizing the detention of individual class members will play some role in determining whether class members are entitled to relief,as well.nonetheless,the constitutional issue at the heart of each class member claim for relief is common.
we also note that a finding of commonality here serves the purposes of the requirement.answering comprehensively in a class setting the constitutional question that is at the center of the proposed class claims will facilitate development of a uniform framework for analyzing detainee claims to a bond hearing.this would render management of these claims more efficient for the courts.it would also benefit many of the putative class members by obviating the severe practical concerns that would likely attend them were they forced to proceed alone.in many of the cases where we have adjudicated these immigration detention claims,the petitioner had been detained well beyond six months,the point at which counsel contends that the putative class members should be entitled to a bond hearing.see,tijani,at cir ordering a bond hearing after an alien was detained for nearly three years.without certification,theref
