these appeals arise from some of the donning and doffing litigation,a series of cases brought around the country by employees alleging that their employers owe them compensation under the fair labor standards act for time spent putting on and taking off protective or sanitary clothing that is necessary for their work.see,gorman consol.edison,cir ballaris wacker siltronic,cir tum barber foods,cir,aff in part,rev in part sub nom.ibp,alvarez,d de asencio tyson foods,cir.
the lawsuits underlying these appeals grew out of an earlier one that led to our decision in anderson cagle,cir.they include the same companies operating chicken processing plants in the state of many of the same potential plaintiffs as the anderson case did.the issues stem from the statutory requirement that no employee may be a party plaintiff in an flsa collective action until his written consent is filed in the court where the action is pending.see b.
the complaint in the anderson lawsuit was filed in september by three named present or former employees of cagle,and nine named present or former employees of equity division,llc then called cagle foods jv,llc.see anderson,at.they alleged on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated individuals that the two companies had violated the flsa by not compensating their employees for the time required to don and doff the protective clothing they were required to wear while working on the chicken processing line.id.at.
the district court followed the procedure for managing flsa collective actions that we had described in hipp liberty national life insurance,cir,by conditionally certifying the collective action and allowing counsel to notify potential plaintiffs of their right to participate in the proceedings anderson,at.
to carry out the notification process,the plaintiffs lawyers sent notices to a ll current and former hourly wage employees of cagle,and equity group.issued under the anderson cagle,case style,the notice summarized the basic allegations in the complaint,described the people who were eligible to join the lawsuit,and told recipients how they could join if they wished to do so.for example,one section,entitled your right to join this suit as a party plaintiff,said this 
if you believe that either cagle,equity group has failed to properly compensate you for your time spent changing into and out of protective before and after your shift,for your lunch break,you have the right to make this claim against cagle,or equity group as a plaintiff in this lawsuit.
the notice referred interested readers to an attached consent to become party plaintiff form,but told them it is entirely your own decision whether to join this lawsuit.you are not required to take any action unless you so desire.
the consent form itself also bore the style of the anderson cagle,case.by signing the consent form,an employee agreed to the following three propositions stated in the form 
i hereby agree to pursue my claims against cagle,equity group and any related companies,arising out of federal state laws in the lawsuit.
i understand and acknowledge that this lawsuit is being brought under the federal fair labor standards act of,as amended,et,to secure unpaid minimum wages,unpaid overtime wages,liquidated damages,attorneys fees,costs,and other relief arising out of my employment with cagle,equity group and any related companies.i hereby consent,agree,and to become a party plaintiff and to be bound by any settlement of this action or adjudication by the court.
i hereby designate gordon,silberman,wiggins and childs,the law office of grant morris,and gardner,willis,sweat goldsmith to represent me in the proposed suit.
the forms concluded by asking employees to indicate the plant in which they had worked,the dates of their employment,the positions they had held,and their union status.although some current and former employees of the two anderson defendants signed and returned these forms,several hundred of them were thereafter dismissed from the lawsuit based on reasons such as the statute of limitations or their failure to comply with discovery requests.anderson,at.those dismissals left just over plaintiffs remaining.see id.
after discovery,the district court granted the motions of the two defendants,severing the claims against cagle,from those asserted against equity group,and decertifying the collective action.id.the court did that because the differences in work locations,work assignments,compensation structures,and protective clothing meant that the plaintiffs were not similarly situated enough to maintain a collective action under the flsa.id.at.
after the court the class,both cagle,and equity group filed motions for summary judgment.id.at.before the district court could rule on these motions,the remaining named plaintiffs in the lawsuit against cagle,settled their claims,which led the district court to deny cagle,motion for summary judgment as moot.id.the court then granted equity group motion for summary judgment and entered a judgment against the remaining named plaintiffs in the equity group lawsuit on all of their claims.id.on appeal,we affirmed the district court orders decertifying the collective action,granting summary judgment,and entering judgment in favor of equity group.id.at.
in june,which was about two months after the district court issued its decertification order in anderson,the lawyers who had represented the anderson plaintiffs filed two substantially identical complaints initiating the present two lawsuits.the complaint in abdullah equity group,listed several hundred plaintiffs in its caption,all of whom,the complaint said,were former plaintiffs from anderson who are current or former employees of equity group at its camilla processing facility.the complaint in albritton cagle,listed hundreds of former anderson plaintiffs,all of whom were current or former employees of cagle,at its macon,perry,pine mountain valley,or atlanta processing facilities.each of the named plaintiffs in these two lawsuits had signed and returned consent forms in the anderson lawsuit during,but the attorneys purporting to represent them concede that they did not obtain new consent forms from any of the plaintiffs before filing these lawsuits in.
the two complaints before us list far more individuals as named plaintiffs than the complaint in anderson did.in anderson there were only named plaintiffs but there were approximately plaintiffs of whom were dismissed for one reason or another,leaving about at the time the court the class.anderson,at.by contrast in the present two lawsuits there are a total of approximately named plaintiffs by the district court count and no plaintiffs.and,of course,what was originally a single lawsuit against both defendants has been refiled as two separate lawsuits,one against each.considered together,the two lawsuits allege the same facts and make the same claims that the anderson lawsuit did.
like the anderson complaint,the complaints in these two lawsuits are attempts to bring an flsa collective action.each complaint is labeled collective action complaint for violations of fair labor standards act of.although both complaints do state in one place that the plaintiffs are join ing their individual claims pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,their principal thrust is the assertion by the named plaintiffs of claims on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated.the complaints expressly invoke the collective action provision found in b of the flsa,codified at b,stating in their introductions,for example,that t his suit is brought on behalf of the plaintiffs and all others similarly situated pursuant to b of the flsa.
in each case the defendant employer moved to dismiss the complaint,contending primarily that the plaintiffs had not complied with the requirement of flsa b.the plaintiffs counsel responded that individual,named plaintiffs in a collective action are not required to file consent forms,and that even if they were,the forms that had been filed in the anderson lawsuit should suffice to authorize the current lawsuits.
the district court disagreed.focusing on the specifics of the notice
