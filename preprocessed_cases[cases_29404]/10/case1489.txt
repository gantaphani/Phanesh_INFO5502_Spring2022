by march of,the bureau of indian affairs bia had processed all lineal descendant applications and,based on initial eligibility determinations,had determined that there were approximately eligible lineal descendants.at the same time,appeals were pending for additional applicants.the aberdeen area office of the bia requested authority in both march and october of to make a partial distribution of to each eligible lineal descendant,but the secretary denied these requests.in,the bia,after resolving the appeals,completed the roll of eligible lineal descendants and scheduled payment for may.by this time,each of the tribes had received payment of its share of the judgment fund.
