on the heels of the denial of class certification against employer and respondent dollar financial group,dollar,in a suit alleging violation of meal and rest break labor laws,appellant caren bufil pursued class certification in a new suit which significantly narrowed the class definition.relying on the doctrine of collateral estoppel,the trial court granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of dollar.also relying on this doctrine as well as traditional concerns relevant to the issue of certification,the court denied bufil motion for class certification.we reverse.
factual background 
dollar operations and policies 
dollar provides check cashing and western union services as well as consumer lending,through its retail stores in california.products and services vary from store to store,and in turn this variety impacts the number and duration of employee transactions in each store,as does variation in store location and hours of operation.each retail store has its own manager who is responsible for hiring employees and staffing the store and setting employee work schedules,including meal and rest breaks.there is no staffing guideline or policy establishing the level of staffing.rather,each manager determines staff based on the services offered,volume and seasonal fluctuation in customer demand.
scheduling conflicts occur that sometimes prevent an employee from being able to leave a store for an meal break.in particular,this may occur if the employee is the only employee in the store on a particular shift or is working solely with a newly hired employee who is not certified to cash checks or transact business without supervision.according to melissa soper,the of human resources for dollar at the relevant times and the person most knowledgeable pmk about dollar meal and rest break policies,a single employee working a shift or supervising a new employee when no one else is on duty is not authorized to do any of the following for consecutive minutes every four hours lock the store tell customers they are off duty ignore customer traffic or stop monitoring customer traffic and go off duty or leave his or her teller station.in other words,while working a shift as a single employee or a single employee with an trainee,the employee is on duty at all times.
industrial welfare commission wage order wage order governs an employer obligation for providing meal and rest breaks to hourly employees.it provides no employer shall employ any person for a work period of more than five hours without a meal period of not less than minutes,except that when a work period of not more than six hours will complete the day work the meal period may be waived by mutual consent of the employer and the employee.unless the employee is relieved of all duty during a minute meal period,the meal period shall be considered an on duty meal period and counted as time worked.an on duty meal period shall be permitted only when the nature of the work prevents an employee from being relieved of all duty and when by written agreement between the parties an paid meal period is agreed to.the written agreement shall state that the employee may,in writing,revoke the agreement at any time,tit,subd.a section.
in dollar introduced the california meal agreement in an attempt to accommodate in a lawful manner the occasions when employees were not afforded an meal break.the agreement is included in all new hire paperwork for california employees,and dollar human resources policy manual provides that these employees will sign the agreement when they complete that paperwork.the agreement states that dollar and the employees acknowledge that the nature of the business may prevent employees from being relieved of all duties during meal periods dollar and the employees agree that an employee may take an meal break,and be paid accordingly and the employees may revoke their right to have the meal break deemed on duty by giving written notice to a supervisor.
dollar introduced an updated meal break policy effective september.this policy reiterates that hourly employees sign the meal break agreement at the time of hire,consenting to an meal break in the event they are unable to be relieved of duty during a meal break.to clarify the circumstances necessitating an meal break,the revised policy spells out that the only acceptable circumstances are that the hourly employee is the only employee in the store working during the entire work shift and is working with only one other employee who has been employed less than days and is not certified to transact business alone.an to store managers in june reiterated this policy.
coinciding with the revised policy,in august dollar implemented a timekeeping the requires,hourly employees to take and record meal breaks,or indicate from three options presented why they were not able to do so.the three options are only employee on duty supervising one new employee or meal break not taken describe in comments section.all california stores received a technical bulletin which described these procedures.
concerning rest breaks,wage order states that every employer must authorize and permit all employees to take rest periods the authorized rest period time shall be based on the total hours worked daily at the rate of ten minutes net rest time per four hours or major fraction thereof.however,a rest period need not be authorized for employees whose total daily work time is less than three and hours,subd.a.
the dollar policy at the relevant times did not require consecutive breaks.rather,it permitted a net minutes of time that could be broken up during the course of a day.a division of labor standards enforcement opinion letter iterates that the net minutes had to be consecutive.and,as stated above,dollar does not authorize single employees working a single shift or supervising a trainee to lock up,tell customers they are off duty,ignore or stop monitoring customer traffic or otherwise relieve the employee of all duty for consecutive minutes every four hours in order to accommodate lawful rest breaks.
further,according to melissa soper,dollar does not notify its employees that they are authorized and permitted to take a consecutive minute rest break every four hours.nor does dollar instruct supervisory personnel to take steps to provide employees with the opportunity to take the required rest breaks.the onus is on the employer to clearly communicate the authorization and permission to its employees.cicairos summit logistics,th,d.
employers who do not comply with the meal and rest break rules shall pay the employee one hour of pay at the employee regular rate of compensation for each workday that the meal period or rest period is not provided,subds.b,b.dollar did not pay hourly employees extra compensation for missed rest or meal periods.
stanley lawsuit 
in may hourly employee stanley chin sued dollar,claiming to represent a class comprised of all california based hourly store employees who were employed for a period of more than five hours without a meal period of not less than minutes,not authorized or permitted to take a rest break for every four hours of work.chin dollar financial group super.los angeles county,no.the class certification motion defined the class as all hourly store employees employed by dollar in california at any time since may,to the present and who were denied meal periods and rest breaks in compliance with california law.chin alleged causes of action under the unfair competition law ucl as well as for violation the labor code and wage orders.chin complained that he and putative class members were illegally denied off duty rest and meal periods,asserting that the type of work he and the putative class members performed was such that they could and should have been,but were not,relieved of all duties during those periods.supporting his motion,chin presented declarations of potential class members who asserted that dollar forced them to execute a meal agreement as a condition of employment.
the trial court denied class certification in the case.among other matters,the court determined there was insufficient commonality based on the evidence presented,defendant liability to every putative class member may not be determined by the proffered facts,supposedly common to the class.for example plaintiff contends that the core of this action is defendant uniform policy concerning meal periods and rest breaks,yet there is no evidence presented by plaintiff that any uniform policy or training with regard to meals and breaks existed prior to the adoption of the california meal agreement executed by plaintiff in.in order to maintain class adjudication,the plaintiff would have to establish a uniform policy of violation.after any putative class member that executed the meal agreement did not have a claim against defendant for a meal break violation unless defendant neglected to compensate them for their meal break.defendant pmk has testified that the applicable wage and hour laws were posted at the jobsite with regard to meal breaks and that the meal agreement was capable of revocation in writing,thus,absent proof of a canned presentation by defendant to each employee,each individual employee is given the opportunity to interpret the language of the posted wage and hour sign as well as the language of the meal agreement differently,thus thwarting plaintiff argument of common liability.defendant meal agreement is within california law as such the existence of and signature of said agreement is not in automatic violation of any california law as plaintiff appears to argue.in addition,the time card evidence provided by the defendant to refute the arguments contained in the putative class declarations shows that the same putative class members frequently took minute meal breaks throughout the class period.based upon the foregoing,there are no apparent issues common to each putative class member that can be the basis for common liability.
the court of appeal affirmed,holding that the lower court properly could rule that the action was not suitable for class treatment because common questions of fact and law did not predominate over individualized issues.nguyen dollar financial group may,wl nonpub.opn.elaborating,the court explained that each employee would have to testify as to his or her own understanding of rights under the meal agreement each employee would have to explain why he or she did or did not take breaks notwithstanding evidence to the contrary in their written time cards and an additional factual layer existed concerning the extent to which employees were forced to submit false time sheets.the trial court also could conclude correctly that class treatment would not be beneficial to the judicial process.finally,the reviewing court disagreed with the plaintiff contention that the trial court erroneously resolved the commonality issue by placing improper emphasis on the absence of a uniform policy to violate meal or rest break requirements.it elucidated that the lower court merely concluded that the plaintiff failed to produce evidence of a uniform policy,thereby rendering a finding of commonality on this issue less viable than he claimed.
bufil lawsuit 
less than four months after the appellate court decision in,bufil filed the complaint in this action.she defined the putative class as two subclasses of hourly employees employed by dollar in california between the period september,and the present,namely employees for whom dollar records depicted a meal period not taken due to either single employee per work shift or training.like nguyen,bufil alleged causes of action for violation of the labor code and wage orders,as well as a ucl claim.
bufil and dollar thereafter moved,respectively,for class certification and judgment on the pleadings.dollar asserted that bufil was collaterally estopped from asserting class claims based on the earlier litigation.the trial court agreed and dismissed appellant class action allegations.as well,it denied appellant motion for class certification.this appeal followed.

judgment on the.standard of review 
where the face of a complaint matters subject to judicial notice reveal the invalidity of class allegations,the class issue may be disposed of by demurrer or motion to strike.canon,superior court th,d.a motion for judgment on the pleadings,made after the time for a demurrer has expired,in all other respects is the equivalent of a general demurrer.like a demurrer,grounds for the motion must appear on the face of the complaint or be based on facts capable of judicial notice.we review the complaint de novo to determine whether the complaint states a cause of action,as a matter of law.mccormick travelers ins.th,d.
collateral estoppel principles 
the doctrine of collateral estoppel thwarts the relitigation of issues previously argued and resolved in an earlier proceeding.for the doctrine to apply,the issue must be identical to an issue that was actually litigated and necessarily decided in a prior proceeding,and the decision therein must have been final and on the merits.moreover,issue preclusion must be sought against a person who was a party,or in privity with a party in the earlier proceeding.lucido superior court cal d,alvarez may stores th,d alvarez.a prior judgment operates as a collateral estoppel on issues which were raised,notwithstanding that some factual matters or legal arguments which could have been presented in the prior case were not.interinsurance exchange of the auto.club superior court d.
general principles of collateral estoppel pertain when a prevailing party seeks to enforce a ruling denying class certification against an absent putative class member.alvarez,supra,th at,d.those principles ensure that the interest of the absent party was represented adequately in the prior proceeding.ibid.in alvarez,the employer department store had faced two prior class actions asserting failure to pay overtime compensation.the trial courts denied class certification in both cases and one resulted in a court of appeal affirmance.duran,wl nonpub.opn.duran.id.at,d.the alvarez court held that the duran and alvarez complaints each alleged that the same general misconduct concerning the same policies and procedures,occurring over approximately the same period of time.the parties in both suits sought to certify the same class of employees,and indeed the alvarez plaintiffs conceded that they were,by definition,included within the duran class.further,the duran and alvarez plaintiffs used the same attorneys in their quest for class certification.and,although the causes of action were not identical,the primary right theory which underpins the principle of collateral estoppel does not require an identity of legal theories.the primary right declared in each case was the right to litigate the claims as a class action.id.at,d.concluding that principles of collateral estoppel applied to preclude class certification of the alvarez suit,the court held that the duran plaintiffs were virtual representatives of the alvarez plaintiffs,noting that the interested parties,their claims,and their counsel are the same.id.at,d.
bufil attacks the trial court collateral estoppel ruling,urging that the classes in the two cases are not the same and thus the issues are different.we agree.unlike alvarez,the class that bufil asserts is not identical to the class asserted by chin.rather,it is a distinct subclass restricted to hourly employees who tracked dollar recordkeeping system from september to the present with the designation of not having taken a meal period because the employee was the only employee in the store or was supervising a trainee who could not be left alone.
notwithstanding this obvious narrowing of the class from that defined by chin,the trial court concluded that the same class problems involving liability are implicated here.each employee would still have to present his understanding of the california meal agreement and their perceptions of their rights in signing or refusing to execute it without suffering adverse consequences.this precise issue has been finally and actually litigated in chin 
the court made an erroneous assumption that each class member would need to testify as to his or her understanding of the meal period waiver.this was an issue in but it is
