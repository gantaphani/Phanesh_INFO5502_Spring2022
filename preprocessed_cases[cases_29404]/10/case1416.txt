this appeal requires us to address federal subject matter jurisdiction under b.following the removal of their class action lawsuit to federal district court by federal deposit insurance and federal deposit insurance,william and gladdean castleberry castleberrys moved to remand the case back to alabama state court.the district court denied the castleberrys motion to remand and ultimately granted summary judgment in favor of goldome credit corporation goldome and daiwa finance corporation we affirm.
background 
this appeal arises from the purchase of a home by the castleberrys from masterbuilt homes,masterbuilt.on september,the castleberrys entered into an installment sales contract and security agreement with masterbuilt for the construction and finance of a home on property owned by the castleberrys in talladega county,alabama.the agreement indicated that the purchase price for the home was and that the purchase would be financed by a loan from masterbuilt.pursuant to the agreement,the castleberrys executed a note which outlined a loan with an percent annual percentage rate apr.this arrangement required the castleberrys to pay masterbuilt per month for months.after the construction was completed by masterbuilt and approved by the castleberrys in november,masterbuilt assigned its ownership in the note to goldome to whom the castleberrys began making monthly payments.
at that time,goldome was a subsidiary of goldome secondary markets,which in turn was a subsidiary of goldome federal savings bank goldome bank,a new york bank.on may,as a result of the failure of goldome bank,the new york superintendent of banks took possession of goldome bank and placed it in receivership under.pursuant to this role,arranged for the liquidation of goldome bank assets,which included selling the portfolio of retail credit obligations containing the castleberrys note to daiwa in.
on january,the castleberrys filed a class action lawsuit against goldome in alabama state court and alleged fraud,conspiracy to defraud,suppression,and the charging of excessive finance rates by goldome in connection with the agreement the castleberrys negotiated with masterbuilt.the castleberrys alleged that masterbuilt operated as goldome agent and that goldome instructed masterbuilt to inflate the purchase price of their house to disguise certain finance fees and rates.according to the castleberrys,goldome and masterbuilt had previously agreed upon a discount rate at which goldome would purchase sales contracts financed by masterbuilt and that goldome instructed masterbuilt how to increase quoted purchase prices to cover the discount.these price increases were allegedly applied only to customers who,like the castleberrys,were purchasing houses on credit these increases allegedly would not have been applied if a customer opted to pay cash.because the alleged discount agreement between masterbuilt and goldome was not disclosed to credit customers but rather disguised in an increase in the purchase price of the home,the castleberrys maintained that they were defrauded.moreover,because increasing the purchase price resulted in a lower apr,the castleberrys alleged that the true finance rate of the masterbuilt loan exceeded the rate allowed under alabama law.in the case of the castleberrys,they alleged that the quoted purchase price of their home included in hidden finance fees and that the true cash price was,which made the true interest rate on their loan percent,in contrast to the percent apr disclosed in the loan agreement.at.
on april,the castleberrys amended their complaint to add daiwa and other defendants to the litigation.the action was subsequently certified as a class action.on december,without obtaining leave from the state court,daiwa filed a against goldome and joined and as defendants.daiwa claimed that these three entities had an obligation to indemnify daiwa for any liability from the class claims arising out of the debt obligations portfolio it purchased from goldome.on december,and removed the action to federal district court pursuant to b b.the castleberrys then filed a motion to remand and argued that removal by and was untimely,improper pursuant to b d,or ineffectual because daiwa had not properly joined them as parties pursuant to alabama law.the district court denied the motion to remand and found that it had subject matter jurisdiction.
subsequently,following discovery,goldome moved for summary judgment.to support their claims,the castleberrys offered to prove the arrangement between goldome and masterbuilt through the deposition testimony of george hicks,a prospective dealer for goldome.although hicks admitted that he never participated in any transaction for goldome,he testified as to his understanding of goldome practices based on letters and rate charts he received from goldome when he was contemplating acting as a dealer who sold loan contracts to goldome.he testified that his understanding was that goldome would instruct a builder to charge an inflated cash price for a home to cover the amount of the discount at which goldome would subsequently purchase the loan.the district court found that hicks derived this understanding from a november letter sent to hicks by goldome which read 
our builder program is designed so that the builder is always paying a discount to provide us with the required yield at the time of purchase.in other words,the disclosed to the customer is always less than our required yield and the builder must buy down the rate.of course this discount is disclosed up front to the builder and shows on the commitment letter.
at.hicks also produced rate charts sent to him by goldome that instructed builders on increasing purchase prices to cover discounts.while the district court found that hicks did have sufficient firsthand knowledge under federal rules of evidence and to testify as to goldome financing practices,it concluded that his testimony alone was insufficient to stave off summary judgment.the district court noted that hicks lack of personal experience in selling a loan contract to goldome undercut the relevance of his testimony.in addition,because the goldome materials referenced by hicks were sent to him three weeks after the castleberrys entered into their agreement with masterbuilt,the district court found that these documents did not raise a reasonable inference that masterbuilt had employed the practices outlined in the materials when negotiating with the castleberrys.moreover,the district court found that neither hicks testimony nor any other evidence offered by the castleberrys proved that they would have paid less if they paid for their house in cash.furthermore,the district court found that masterbuilt was not the agent of goldome and that goldome did not ratify any fraud that may have been committed by masterbuilt.for these reasons,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of goldome on the castleberrys fraud and conspiracy claims.the district court likewise granted summary judgment on the suppression and excessive finance charge claims because it found that neither goldome nor masterbuilt had a duty to disclose that the castleberrys loan contract could be sold at a discount.accordingly,on may,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of goldome against the castleberrys on all of their claims.
on appeal,goldome,and argue that our court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the castleberrys failed to timely file notice of appeal for their part,the castleberrys argue that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction following removal and erred by denying their motion to remand.finally,assuming the district court had jurisdiction,the castleberrys argue that its grant of summary judgment was improper.we will address each argument in turn.
ii.discussion 
subject matter jurisdiction 
jurisdiction is a prerequisite to the legitimate exercise of judicial power.accordingly,in every appeal,the first and fundamental question is that of jurisdiction.steel citizens for a better env t,d internal quotations and citations omitted.thus,prior to our review of the district court disposition of the castleberrys claims on the merits,we must determine as a threshold matter whether our court has jurisdiction on appeal and whether the district court had jurisdiction following removal.see steel,at.at every federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction,but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review internal quotations and citations omitted.
appellate jurisdiction 
compliance with the requirements of federal rule of appellate procedure a for timely filing notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional.coleman thompson,d.an appellate court lacks jurisdiction over an appeal if a party to an otherwise appealable district court order fails to file notice of appeal within the time limits prescribed by rule a.see zipperer ex rel.zipperer school,cir.referencing this precedent,and argue that we lack jurisdiction because the castleberrys appeal was untimely.we disagree.
rule a provides that,in a civil case where an agency of the united states is a party,notice of appeal must be filed within days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.fed.a b the time period for filing notice of appeal,however,does not begin to run until entry of a final judgment.leal.dep t of,cir per curiam parker strickland,cir per curiam.in a case involving multiple claims,in the absence of a federal rule of civil procedure b certification a district court disposition of fewer than all the claims does not constitute an appealable final judgment.see williams bishop,cir per curiam concluding that the grant of summary judgment in favor of two of the three named defendants was not an appealable final judgment because it disposed of fewer than all the claims or parties.in addition,notwithstanding the entry of a final judgment or a rule b certification,the filing period is tolled for all parties if any party files a postjudgment motion under federal rule of civil procedure see fed.a a finch city of vernon,cir per curiam.
based on the foregoing,we find that we have appellate jurisdiction in this case because the castleberrys timely filed notice of appeal.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of goldome against the castleberrys on may,but did not issue a rule b certification at that time.on march,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of daiwa against the castleberrys and goldome.because in this order the district court certified for appeal pursuant to rule b the claims of the castleberrys and the by daiwa against goldome,the time period began to run.on april,however,goldome timely filed a rule motion as to the district court disposition of daiwa.this rule motion,although limited to daiwa,nonetheless tolled the filing period for all parties,including the castleberrys.see finch,at stating that if any party files a postjudgment motion under rule,the filing period for all parties is tolled emphasis added see also richardson oldham,cir finding that a plaintiff rule motion as to one defendant also tolled the time period to file notice of appeal as to the claims against two defendants not referenced in the rule motion.we thus reject the argument that goldome rule motion did not toll the period as to the castleberrys claims because the motion was limited to a that was separate from the main action.neither the plain language of rule a nor our precedent permits such a distinction.moreover,daiwa was a party to the action initiated by the castleberrys,and its was interrelated with that action.scott fancher,cir by definition must be closely related to the existing action.internal quotations and citation omitted.as such,goldome rule motion was sufficient to arrest the running of the filing period for the castleberrys,and,because the castleberrys filed notice of appeal within days of the district court disposition of that rule motion,the castleberrys appeal was timely.accordingly,we have jurisdiction.
district court removal jurisdiction 
we review de novo whether a district court had federal subject matter jurisdiction following removal.see henson,cir per curiam.
section,includes special provisions regarding removal and jurisdiction for civil suits in which the fdic is a party specifically,provides that the fdic may remove any action,suit,or proceeding from a state court to the appropriate united states district court before the end of the period beginning on the date the action,suit or proceeding is filed against the fdic or the fdic is substituted as a party.b b.moreover,because provides that any civil suit in which the fdic is a party shall be deemed to arise under the laws of the united states,b a,federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over removed actions involving the fdic pursuant to granting original jurisdiction to federal district courts in all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.against this background,we proceed to analyze each of the castleberrys jurisdictional arguments.
timeliness of removal by and 
the castleberrys first argue that the district court lacked jurisdiction because removal was untimely.they argue that,because goldome bank was declared insolvent and placed into receivership under in may,their case against goldome,a subsidiary of goldome bank,was removable when filed in january.alternatively,they cite lazuka fdic,cir and rtc fragetti,cir for the proposition that the case was removable when goldome referenced in its february answer under either theory,because and did not remove the case until december,the castleberrys argue that the district court lacked removal jurisdiction.we disagree.
first,contrary to the castleberrys contentions,the action was not removable by the fdic when it was filed.the castleberrys original complaint was filed against goldome and did not name as a party.accordingly,under the plain language of the statute,the castleberrys complaint was not an action filed against the fdic,b b,and therefore the removal period could not have begun when the case was filed.in making this determination,we decline to endorse the castleberrys implied assertion that was made a party ipso facto because the castleberrys filed suit against a subsidiary goldome whose ultimate parent was in receivership under the management of goldome bank.goldome and goldome bank are separate legal entities,and the castleberrys presented neither evidence nor argument that their separate corporate identities should have been disregarded in this case.accordingly,the fdic role in goldome bank receivership can not be attributed to goldome for determining when the removal period began.see in re miami,the mere fact that a parent is in receivership does not mean its subsidiary is part of that receivership.citing greenbaum lehrenkrauss,cir.in essence,then,when the complaint was filed,had no removal right because it was not a named party and because it could not have been considered a party by attribution through its role as goldome bank receiver.see fdic loyd,cir construing and stating that no to a state court proceeding has a mature right to remove that proceeding to federal court.thus,the removal period could not have begun to accrue when the case was filed in january.
second,the castleberrys alternative goldome february answer triggered the fdic removal equally unavailing.under the plain language of the statute,the removal period does not commence until an action,suit,or proceeding is filed against the fdic.b b.construing this provision,we have previously found that filing a counterclaim against the fdic was sufficient to trigger removal rights.see fdic s i,cir.based on this precedent,we can not conclude that goldome does not contain a counterclaim,but rather references in an affirmative defense the fdic role as the receiver of goldome an action,suit,or proceeding within the meaning of.see skrtich thornton,cir describing an answer as a responsive pleading in an action already initiated by a complaint.moreover,goldome answer was insufficient to trigger the provisions of because the answer was filed against the castleberrys and not against any entity of the fdic.see b b requiring that an action be filed against the fdic before the filing period begins to run.in this way,the castleberrys reliance on lazuka and rtc is ineffectual because in each of those cases the predicate act required to trigger s removal filing of an action,suit,or proceeding against the fdic or the filing of an action against a bank and the subsequent filing in court of documentation that was substituted as a party for that been satisfied.see lazuka,at rtc,at.here,by contrast,because goldome was not an entity that entered receivership and thereafter was replaced as a party by,goldome answer is insufficient to trigger the removal provisions of.accordingly,we can not agree with the castleberrys that,pursuant to lazuka and rtc,the removal period began when goldome filed its answer in february.
thus,we reject the castleberrys arguments that removal was untimely.under the plain language of the statute,the removal period does not begin until an action,suit,or proceeding is filed against the fdic or the fdic is substituted as a party.b b see loyd,at summarizing removal by noting that the fdic first had to be a party before the case was removable to federal court.the fdic first became a party to the action in december when daiwa initiated against and.because both entities of the fdic removed the case within days of the filing of daiwa,removal was timely 
propriety of daiwa 
the castleberrys second jurisdictional argument is that daiwa was not a properly filed action,suit,or proceeding under b b because it was filed without leave of the state court in violation of the alabama rules of civil procedure.specifically,the castleberrys claim that a can not be considered a separate pleading under the alabama rules of civil procedure,see.civ.a failing to include a as a separate pleading,and therefore a must be made within a defendant answer.moreover,the castleberrys note that parties in alabama state court must seek the court leave to amend a pleading within days before the first date set for trial.see.civ.a.accordingly,because daiwa filed its initial answer in july,and the case was first set for trial in october,the castleberrys claim that daiwa december must be construed as a motion for leave to amend its answer.because the state court never granted leave to amend,the castleberrys argue that daiwa was never properly filed,and thus could not trigger removal rights.
the castleberrys argument,however,ignores the fact that federal law determines whether the exercise of removal jurisdiction was proper,irrespective of state law procedural violations.see chicago,rock island pac.stude.noting that state procedural provisions can not control the privilege of removal granted by the federal statute.in crafting the removal right in,congress used very strong language to afford the fdic every possibility of having a federal forum,lazuka,at,and state procedural law can not be invoked to frustrate the unambiguous intent of federal legislation,see const.art.vi,cl.consistent with this construction,in farina mission investment trust,our predecessor court declined to adopt the argument that the fdic lacked the power to remove an action under because it was not made a party according to state law procedure when the case was initially filed.see,cir.rather,the court determined the fdic status as a party by interpreting.and.c.see id.accordingly,we must look to the federal rules of civil procedure to determine whether daiwa filed an action against the fdic under.see granny goose foods,of teamsters auto truck drivers,local,d the federal rules of civil procedure,like other provisions of federal law,govern the mode of proceedings in federal court after removal.c.
federal rule of civil procedure e defines when a pleading is considered filed in a federal district court construing the rule,we have found that pleadings should be deemed filed when submitted to the clerk.bragg bill heard chevrolet,cir,cert.denied,d see leggett strickland,cir finding that a complaint was not filed until it was in actual or constructive possession of the clerk.in addition,rule e provides that t he clerk shall not refuse to accept for filing any paper presented for that purpose solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by federal or local rules.e.accordingly,the federal rules establish that a is filed upon the completion of the act of delivering it to clerk,irrespective of any procedural flaws in the pleading itself.
based on this standard,daiwa was filed according to federal law because it was delivered to the clerk of the alabama state court.whether this filing was proper under alabama law is immaterial because federal law controls,and the was filed as defined by rule e.in addition,the language of e,which precludes a clerk from refusing to accept a filing for deficiencies in its form,underscores that we need not inquire into the procedural propriety of the to determine whether it was filed.see mcclellon lone star gas,cir refusing to consider procedural propriety of a complaint to determine when it was filed because rule e gives the clerk no discretion to refuse to accept a submitted pleading.moreover,we note that the plain language of requires that the action be filed it does not require that an action be properly filed.see adams walker,does not suggest in any meaningful way that removal jurisdiction is limited to those instances where the fdic has been properly named a party in the state court action.emphasis in original.accordingly,because it met the requirements in the federal rules,daiwa was filed,and therefore the fdic removal rights under were triggered.
c.the state law exception in b d 
the castleberrys third jurisdictional argument is that the exception in b d divested the district court of subject matter jurisdiction.under the statute,a federal court lacks jurisdiction in any action 
i to which the fdic,in the fdic capacity as receiver of a state insured depository institution by the exclusive appointment by state authorities,is a party other than as a plaintiff 
ii which involves only the preclosing rights against the state insured depository institution,or obligations owing to,depositors,creditors,or stockholders by the state insured depository institution and 
iii in which only the interpretation of the law of such state is necessary 
b d.under the language of the statute,each of these three prongs must be established by a party to defeat removal.see lazuka,at noting that the burden on the three criteria in b d shifts to the party objecting to removal after the prerequisites for removal under b b are met.
applying the factors in b d,we find that the state law exception did not withdraw subject matter jurisdiction from the district court because the second prong can not be met on the facts of this case.the second prong requires that the claims involve only either preclosing rights against the bank or obligations owed by the bank to depositors,creditors,or stockholders.the claims of the castleberrys and daiwa involve neither of these.first,the basis for daiwa is the right to indemnification found in the contracts it signed with in when it purchased the portfolio containing the castleberrys loan.because daiwa involves a right which accrued more than two years after goldome bank entered receivership,the case does not involve only preclosing rights.moreover,even though the castleberrys claims accrued before goldome bank went into receivership,these preclosing claims were filed against goldome and not goldome bank,the state bank.accordingly,the action does not contain only claims that both involved preclosing rights and were filed against an state bank,as required to satisfy the second prong.second,the castleberrys have not demonstrated that any of the claims in the case involved obligations owed by goldome bank to depositors,creditors,or stockholders.accordingly,the castleberrys have failed to meet their burden as to the second prong.because application of the state law exception hinges on the satisfaction of all three prongs in b d,this failure is fatal to the castleberrys claim that the exception applied.see motorcity of jacksonville,southeast bank,cir en banc finding that the state law exception was inapplicable because not all of the three of prong
