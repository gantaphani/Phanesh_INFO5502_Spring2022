plaintiffs dale mills and diane mills the millses appeal the district court order granting defendant foremost insurance company foremost motion to dismiss their class action complaint.after review and oral argument,we reverse the district court order and remand for further proceedings.
background 
a.the complaint allegations 
in february,the millses filed a class action complaint against foremost in florida state court.according to the complaint,the millses are florida residents who own a mobile home that was insured by foremost under a mobile home insurance policy the policy in september,hurricane frances damaged the millses home and personal property covered under the policy.the millses submitted a claim to foremost under the policy and received a loss payment that was less than they were entitled to.specifically,foremost failed to compensate the millses for contractors overhead and profit charges,and for state and local sales taxes on materials,incurred by the millses in having their property repaired or replaced the complaint also alleges that foremost knowingly and unlawfully failed to pay overhead,profit,and taxes in foremost estimates of losses and failed to inform the millses about foremost intention not to pay overhead,profit,and taxes under the policy.we will refer to the unpaid overhead,profit,and taxes collectively as the withheld payments.
the complaint alleges that foremost breached the terms of the policy by failing to compensate the millses for the withheld payments,and unlawfully failed to inform them,before they purchased or renewed the policy,of foremost intention not to pay the withheld payments the complaint seeks damages and declaratory and injunctive relief,both for the millses themselves and on behalf of a class.the complaint defines the class as all of foremost mobile home insurance policyholders in florida who,from august,onward,submitted to foremost claims for hurricane damage to their mobile home or personal property caused by or arising from four hurricanes that struck florida in august and september hurricanes charlie,frances,ivan,and jeanne.
foremost rule b motion 
foremost removed the case to federal court and filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.neither party filed a motion regarding class certification under federal rule of civil procedure.however,foremost rule b motion argued that class action treatment was inappropriate because common legal or factual questions would not predominate over individual issues.
in a november,order,the district court granted foremost b motion.first,the district court held that the millses lacked standing to bring their claims,either individually or as class representatives.it based this standing decision on its interpretation of the policy.the court concluded that,to receive the withheld payments,the millses must satisfy these preconditions in the policy they must complete the repairs or replacement of the damaged property they must actually incur overhead,profit,and sales tax in connection with the repairs or replacement and they must make a further claim for any additional costs including overhead,profit,and sales tax incurred in repairing or replacing the damaged property.the district court concluded that the millses failed to allege that they had completed the repairs or replacement and made a claim for such repair or replacement costs,and thus they do not have standing to maintain individual claims,let alone class claims.mills foremost ins,wl,at.
second,the district court held that in any event the millses claims were inappropriate for class action treatment because the individual inquiry of the facts surrounding the property damage claims of thousands of foremost policy holders under thousands of separate insurance policies would predominate and overwhelm any common issue.id.the district court dismissed the millses complaint and closed the case this appeal followed.

iii.discussion 
on appeal,the millses contend that the district court erred in interpreting the policy and then,on that basis,dismissing their complaint for lack of standing and inability to maintain a class action.we first review florida law governing insurance contracts and then examine the policy provisions in issue.finally,we consider the class action suitability issue.
florida law 
under florida law,i nsurance contracts are construed according to their plain meaning.state farm mut.auto.ins.reis,so d,review denied,so d see also sphinx int l,union fire ins,cir florida courts have said again and again that insurance contracts must be construed in accordance with the plain language of the policy.siegle progressive consumers ins,so d,when an insurance contract is not ambiguous,it must be given effect as written.if the language lends itself to more than one reasonable interpretation,it is ambiguous and should be construed in the insured favor and against the policy drafter.reis,so d at.in other words,ambiguous provisions in an insurance policy should be interpreted in favor of coverage for the insured.taurus holdings,fid.guar,so d.
b.the policy 
the millses policy defines actual cash value,which is central to this dispute,as follows the cost to repair or replace property with new materials of like kind and quality,less allowance for physical deterioration and depreciation,including obsolescence.the policy provides that when a policyholder suffers a partial loss to an insured mobile home foremost will pay benefits using one of two methods replacement cost or actual cash value.as explained below,both methods reference the term actual cash value.
under the policy replacement cost payment method,foremost pays the lowest of the replacement cost of the damage to the home the amount actually spent for necessary repair or replacement of the damaged portion of the home or the amount of insurance shown on the declarations page of the policy.the policy further states that i f the cost to repair or replace the damaged property is more than,foremost will pay no more than the actual cash value of that damage until actual repair or replacement is completed.thus,under the replacement cost payment method,foremost pays only the actual cash value of the damage for claims over until the actual repair or replacement is completed.in other words,foremost will pay up front an estimate of the actual cash value of th e damage before the repairs are actually done.
the policy also provides that the insured may disregard the replacement cost payment method and make a claim on simply an actual cash value payment method.if the policyholder elects the actual cash value payment method,he may make further claim within days after the loss for any additional cost incur red in replacing the damaged property.
thus,under both payment methods,the policy is clear that making the actual repairs first is not required in order to be paid the actual cash value of the damaged property.we see nothing in the language of the policy that even suggests that if the millses never repaired or replaced their property,they would not for that reason be entitled to compensation for the actual cash value of the damaged property accordingly,the proper question becomes what is encompassed within the term actual cash value in the policy.
as noted earlier,the policy defines actual cash value as the cost to repair or replace property with new materials of like kind and quality less certain depreciation.the policy does not say repair or replacement cost less depreciation and profit,overhead,and taxes,and,therefore,the costs of overhead,profit,and taxes are not unambiguously excluded from actual cash value coverage.thus,the inquiry narrows further to what is encompassed within the cost to repair or replace property with new materials.
as to taxes,we easily conclude that the cost to repair or replace property with new materials would necessarily include the state and local taxes on the materials purchased to make the repairs part of the cost of new materials is the taxes paid to purchase those materials.
as to the cost of installing the materials,foremost does not dispute that general contractors routinely charge overhead and profit for their services,but argues that not all hurricane repairs will necessarily require the services of a general contractor,and that the millses did not specifically plead that they needed a general contractor to repair their mobile home.in reply,the millses point out that a contractor overhead and profit is routinely as much a part of the cost to repair as is the contractor labor and materials costs,that their complaint specifically alleges that foremost failed to pay them for overhead,profit,and taxes incurred by them in repairing their mobile home,and that there is no support for foremost exclusion of a contractor overhead and profit charges in the policy broad language of cost to repair or replace property.
for several reasons,we agree that a contractor overhead and profit charges are included within the cost to repair or replace.first,the policy definition of actual cash value does not exclude overhead and profit charged by contractors in their repairs or replacements or otherwise limit the type of repair or replacement costs covered by the policy.since a contractor overhead and profit charges are types of costs routinely charged,those items fall within the cost to repair or replace.second,the millses contracted for the actual cash value of their loss and their recovery is not tied to actually making the repair or replacement,much less actually paying a contractor anything.third,the issue of what is encompassed within the policy language of cost to repair or replace is a separate and distinct issue from whether certain items of repair costs are reasonable and necessary.for example,the millses could not obtain payment for roof materials unless they had roof damage and it was reasonably likely that roof materials would be needed to repair the damage,but that does not mean that roof materials in general are not part of the cost to repair or replace the property.the same holds true for the services of a general contractor.the millses would not be entitled to receive payment for any type of cost charged by a general contractor without showing that they would be reasonably likely to need a general contractor for the repairs in issue.thus,if the estimate of the cost to repair is by a general contractor that lists labor,materials,overhead,and profit,the question is the same for all of these items whether it is reasonably likely that the policyholder would incur these costs in making the repairs.
our conclusion in this regard comports with the weight of authority on the issue.a majority of courts considering the question under similarly drafted insurance policies has determined that an actual cash value payment includes a general contractor overhead and profit charges in circumstances where the policyholder would be reasonably likely to need a general contractor in repairing or replacing the damaged property in issue.see tritschler allstate ins,salesin state farm fire cas,gilderman state farm ins,courts have reached the same conclusion with regard to sales tax on materials.see,ghoman new hampshire ins,d,holding that sales tax,as well as general contractors overhead and profit charges,should be included in an actual cash value payment if it is reasonably likely that the insured would incur them if he repaired or replaced the covered loss.these results hold regardless of whether the insured actually repairs or replaces the property.tritschler,at ghoman,d at gilderman,at 
thus,for all of these reasons,we conclude that the district court erred in determining that preconditions in the policy required the millses to complete repair or replacement of their damaged property and to submit such a replacement cost claim in order to have standing and be entitled to recover the withheld payments.
the district court also erred in treating these particular insurance coverage issues under the policy as standing issues.the complaint alleges that the millses had a mobile home,that foremost issued an insurance policy covering hurricane damage to the mobile home,that a hurricane damaged the millses mobile home,that the millses made a claim under the policy for those damages,and that foremost paid less on the claim than the millses contend they are owed.thus,the millses clearly had standing to sue for damages under the policy.see wooden bd.of regents,cir stating that standing is essentially a determination of whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues,and requires that a plaintiff have suffered a concrete,particularized injury that is caused by the challenged action of the defendant and can be redressed by a favorable court decision.
whether the withheld payments were covered by the policy is an issue of whether the millses complaint fails to state a claim for relief under the a standing issue.whether the millses complaint pled sufficient facts is likewise a issue.we thus reject foremost standing arguments as to the millses individual claims against foremost on this basis as well.
class action standing 
having concluded that the millses have stated a claim for the withheld payments,we next conclude the millses have standing as putative class representatives.to have standing to represent a class,a party must not only satisfy the individual standing prerequisites,but must also be part of the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.ex rel.prado bush,cir quoting.of the sw.falcon,d.put another way,
i t is not enough that a named plaintiff can establish a case or controversy between himself and the defendant by virtue of having standing as to one of many claims he wishes to assert.rather,each claim must be analyzed separately,and a claim can not be asserted on behalf of a class unless at least one named plaintiff has suffered the injury that gives rise to that claim.
wooden,at quotation marks and citation omitted.the millses have alleged two individual claims that foremost breached the terms of the policy by not compensating them for the withheld payments and that foremost unlawfully failed to inform them,before they purchased or renewed their policies,of foremost intention not to make those payments.the two claims that the millses have attempted to raise on behalf of a class are identical.therefore,we conclude that with respect to each class claim,the millses have standing not just individually,but also as putative class representatives.
nonetheless,we stress that the fact that the millses have standing as putative class representatives is an issue distinct from whether they qualify under rule to represent the class.see wooden,at only after the court determines the issues for which the named plaintiffs have standing should it address the question whether the named plaintiffs have representative capacity,as defined by rule a,to assert the rights of others.quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,we now turn to the class certification issue.
