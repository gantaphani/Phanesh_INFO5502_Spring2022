in,the city of los angeles settled chakhalyan city of los angeles chakhalyan,a class action lawsuit.the suit alleged the city had an unlawful practice of charging a trash disposal fee to customers living in dwellings who received no trash disposal services from the city.cunningham city of los angeles,another class action lawsuit asserting similar allegations,was simultaneously pending.the named plaintiff,brian cunningham,did not opt out of the chakhalyan class or exclude himself from the settlement.following approval and finalization of the settlement in chakhalyan,the city successfully moved for summary judgment of cunningham claims.however,the trial court permitted cunningham to amend the complaint to add two additional named plaintiffs.
the two new plaintiffs,terence schoshinski and thomas ballatore collectively plaintiffs,also alleged the city unlawfully charged them and others the trash disposal fee.the city again moved for summary judgment,offering evidence that in connection with an injunctive relief provision in the chakhalyan settlement,the city had already reimbursed the plaintiffs for all improper charges.the city argued plaintiffs claims were now moot and they lacked standing to prosecute the action.the trial court agreed and granted summary judgment.
on appeal,plaintiffs argue the trial court erred in concluding they could not continue representing the class defined in their complaint.plaintiffs assert their individual claims are not moot because they did not receive all of the relief they demanded in their complaint.they also rely on caselaw indicating a defendant attempts to unilaterally resolve a class representative claims,or pick off the representative,do not necessarily eliminate that plaintiff standing to continue prosecuting claims alleged in a class action complaint.
we conclude plaintiffs individual claims are moot because a court could grant them no further relief beyond what they have already received.further,unlike other cases in which the pick off exception has been applied,here,the injunctive relief provisions in the chakhalyan stipulated settlement and judgment required the city to reimburse plaintiffs and other putative class members.the city complied with this obligation before plaintiffs filed the second amended complaint naming them as parties.under these particular circumstances,the pick off exception does not apply.
factual and procedural background 
in august,lilith chakhalyan filed a class action lawsuit against the city of los angeles alleging it improperly collected solid resource fees from her and other class members,through entities such as the department of water and power dwp and the department of public works.chakhalyan claimed the city was improperly billing and collecting solid resource fees from herself and others who live in dwellings apartment buildings.plaintiff claimed that the fee collected from her was illegal because the city is prohibited from collecting the fees from dwellings if the city does not collect trash from the building.
in april,brian cunningham filed a separate class action suit against the city and various entities collectively the city,alleging the city had improperly charged him and others the solid resource fee.according to the complaint,in,the city settled a lawsuit regarding a fee improperly imposed for trash collection services,yet it continued unlawfully charging the same fee under a different name.
on june,the trial court conducted a final approval hearing,and on june,the court entered a final order and judgment in chakhalyan.the judgment adopted the terms and conditions of a settlement agreement the parties had entered and executed in december.the judgment finally certified a class defined as all customers of the los angeles department of water power who,between october,and february,inclusive,paid a solid resource fee overcharge and who did not exclude themselves from the class.
under the settlement,all class members were entitled to full reimbursement of all solid resource fee overcharges paid from october,through february,the city was to pay all class member claims no later than days after entry of the final order and judgment thus,by approximately late december.
the settlement,incorporated into the judgment,also provided for injunctive relief.this included the following the city will alter its billing system,policies and practices to ensure that the solid resource fee overcharges are halted and do not recur.these alterations have or will include the actions set forth in exhibit the city will routinely monitor its billing system,policies and practices to ensure that the solid resource fee overcharges do not recur.in the event it identifies future solid resource fee overcharges through such monitoring,the city will promptly and fully reimburse any persons so identified according to the city refund policy and make further appropriate modifications to its billing system,policies and practices.
exhibit g,referenced in the agreement,included measures such as a billing insert to be sent to all new residential customers explaining bureau of sanitation rates the posting of notices regarding refunds or credits for solid resource fee overcharges in dwp offices and on the dwp website and ongoing bureau of sanitation projects related to preventing and correcting billing errors 
the judgment additionally provided without affecting the finality of this judgment in any way,this court hereby retains continuing jurisdiction over a implementation of the settlement and any award or distribution to the class members,including any dispute regarding an individual entitlement to receive a settlement benefit or its amount and b all parties for the purpose of enforcing or administering the stipulation,pursuant to or otherwise.
in december,the city filed a motion for summary judgment in cunningham.plaintiffs opposition to the motion,filed on february,included a declaration from terence schoshinski.schoshinksi declared he had been charged,had paid,and continued to pay the solid resource fee,despite not receiving trash services from the city for his residential property.schoshinski declared he had repeatedly contacted the city and requested that it cease charging him the fee,to no avail.
on march,the city issued an over credit to schoshinski dwp account.
on april,cunningham counsel provided the city counsel a copy of a proposed second amended complaint,which named schoshinksi and ballatore as plaintiffs.
on april,the city issued an over credit to ballatore dwp account.
on april,cunningham filed an ex parte application asking the court to specially set a hearing on his motion for leave to file a second amended complaint so that it could be considered before or with the city motion for summary judgment.
on april,the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city on cunningham complaint.the court concluded the city offered sufficient evidence to show cunningham claims are precluded based upon the valid and binding chakhalyan settlement and the of res judicata and lack of standing.cunningham presented no evidence to raise a triable issue of material fact.however,the court granted cunningham leave to file the second amended complaint adding schoshinski and ballatore as plaintiffs.according to plaintiffs,on that day,after the court hearing,they learned for the first time that the city had credited their accounts for the overcharges they had paid.
on april,plaintiffs filed the second amended complaint.
in june,the city again moved for summary judgment.the city argued res judicata barred ballatore from pursuing some of his claims because he was a class member in the chakhalyan suit.the city further asserted both plaintiffs lacked standing because their claims were moot.according to the city,the chakhalyan settlement resulted in a continuing injunction within the court jurisdiction,prohibiting and redressing the very conduct of which plaintiffs complain in this lawsuit and about which they might claim any standing the city further argued by virtue of these mandatory injunctive obligations,the city is required to provide prospective relief to all individuals it discovers have been mischarged solid resource fee overcharges,in addition to ceasing the billing of those charges.on this basis,plaintiffs and others have already obtained relief regarding srf overcharges and plaintiffs can not obtain any effectual relief,or relief that would not just duplicate the already mandatory chakhalyan obligations.
in support of the motion,the city offered declarations from several city employees.a city database architect declared since conclusion of administration of to and identified chakhalyan class members,in the course of my duties as a database architect for the bureau of sanitation,i continue to review and determine whether there are any accounts that need adjustment the stopping of solid resource fees.i do so consistent with the injunctive obligations on the city pursuant to chakhalyan.to this end,since january,i am aware of such accounts for which such adjustments were made,including the accounts of thomas ballatore and terence schoshinski the declaration was dated june.
another city employee declared billing records indicated ballatore paid the solid resource fee from september,through april,the charges were stopped effective april,and the city issued a on that date for all of the solid resource fee charges ballatore paid from october through april.the employee similarly declared billing records showed the city stopped charging schoshinksi the solid resource fee effective february,and it issued him a on march.the declaration concluded tom ballatore and terence schoshinksi received the aforementioned pursuant to the injunctive obligations arising from chakhalyan city of los angeles 
the city also offered the declaration of an employee who,in addition to supervising tasks related to claims review for chakhalyan class members,supervise s oversee s compliance with the injunctive obligations on the city as a result of chakhalyan.the employee declared consistent with the pending injunction,customer accounts,including those of thomas ballatore and terence schoshinksi,have had solid resources fee charges stopped and issued.
the parties stipulated to narrow the issues presented for summary judgment to the city assertion that the plaintiffs claims were moot and they therefore lacked standing since,prior to joining the action,they obtained relief pursuant to the chakhalyan injunction 
plaintiffs opposed the motion,on these narrowed grounds.ballatore declared he began receiving private trash collection services in october.according to ballatore,the city told him in that he had to pay the solid resource fee,even though he was not receiving trash collection services from the city.he declared that in,the city again told him he had to pay the fee,even after he called in response to a city letter informing residents they should not be charged a solid resource fee if they lived in a dwelling that did not receive refuse collection services from the city.ballatore declared that when he received a notice regarding the chakhalyan settlement he discarded it.the city charged him the solid resource fee as late as april.the credit to his dwp account was applied without his knowledge or consent.it appeared on his june dwp account statement 
schoshinski declared he informed the city in august that he was using a private trash collection service for his dwelling.according to schoshinski,the city did not stop charging him the sanitation fee.he did not learn until april,that the city had,without his knowledge,applied a credit to his dwp account.
plaintiffs argued the city did not stop charging them the solid resource fee,or attempt to refund the charges,until after it learned of their participation in the lawsuit.to support this claim,plaintiffs pointed to the timing of the refunds and plaintiffs declarations indicating the refunds appeared on their accounts without explanation.they contended there was a triable issue of fact as to whether the city had engaged in an improper attempt to pick off plaintiffs to avoid class action litigation and liability.
the city stated as undisputed the fact that plaintiffs had received a refund for all solid resource fees they were improperly charged.plaintiffs purported to dispute that fact with only the following statement it is unknown what the credit on the plaintiffs dwp accounts for or whether,if in fact it represents a refund,it is accurate.
the trial court granted the city motion.the court reasoned,in part,that plaintiffs received refunds from the city after the chakhalyan settlement was approved and this alone appeared sufficient to indicate they lacked standing to act as class representatives.the court rejected the pick off theory,noting the city payments were mandatory under the chakhalyan settlement,not voluntary.the court indicated plaintiffs offered no evidence to rebut the city evidence showing the basis of the payments to them was the chakhalyan settlement.the court concluded all of plaintiffs claims were subsumed by that settlement and it provided all of the relief plaintiffs sought,thus plaintiffs had no valid claims 
this appeal followed 
discussion 
plaintiffs claims are moot 
plaintiffs argue that despite the city act of reimbursing them for the solid resource fee overcharges they paid,their individual claims are not moot because they have not received complete relief on their claims.they additionally contend that even if their individual claims are moot,the pick off exception to mootness applied,preserving their standing to continue prosecuting claims on behalf of others.
we disagree.the undisputed facts established plaintiffs claims are moot and the pick off exception has no application under the circumstances presented here.
standard of review 
because this case comes before us after the trial court granted a motion for summary judgment,we take the facts from the record that was before the trial court when it ruled on that motion.citation.we review the trial court decision de novo,considering all the evidence set forth in the moving and opposing papers except that to which objections were made and sustained.citation.we liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.citation.citation.lonicki sutter health central cal th.similarly,standing is a question of law we review de novo.ibm personal pension plan city and county of san francisco th.
standing and mootness in the class action context 
in general,a named plaintiff must have standing to prosecute an action.as a general principle,standing to invoke the judicial process requires an actual justiciable controversy as to which the complainant has a real interest in the ultimate adjudication because he or she has either suffered or is about to suffer an injury of sufficient magnitude reasonably to assure that all of the relevant facts and issues will be adequately presented to the adjudicator.citations.to have standing,a party must be beneficially interested in the controversy that is,he or she must have some special interest to be served or some particular right to be preserved or protected over and above the interest held in common with the public at large.citation.the party must be able to demonstrate that he or she has some such beneficial interest that is concrete and actual,and not conjectural or hypothetical.without standing,there is no actual or justiciable controversy,and courts will not entertain such cases.citation.citation.cashcall,superior court th.
related is the problem of mootness.when a plaintiff has received all that he or she has demanded in the complaint,the case is considered moot in other words,there is no further relief the court could provide.generally,courts decide only actual controversies which will result in a judgment that offers relief to the parties.citations.larner los angeles doctors hospital associates,lp th,larner.
the pivotal question in determining if a case is moot is therefore whether the court can grant the plaintiff any effectual relief.citations.if events have made such relief impracticable,the controversy has become overripe and is therefore moot.citations.thus,m ootness has been described as the doctrine of standing set in a time frame the requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation standing must continue throughout its existence mootness.citations.citations.when events render a case moot,the court,whether trial or appellate,should generally dismiss it.wilson wilson city council of redwood city th,united states parole comm geraghty,geraghty.
because a class action suit involves potential relief to absent class members in addition to the plaintiff who brings the suit,courts have recognized the duty a named plaintiff owes to the class,and the flexible character of mootness in such actions.geraghty,supra,at la sala american sav.loan cal d,la sala.thus,even when the named plaintiff claims are moot,courts have under some circumstances applied exceptions to the mootness doctrine to allow the plaintiff to continue prosecuting the suit.plaintiffs invoke one such exception the pick off exception which we discuss at length below.
still,the duty a plaintiff has to other class members should not be confused with an additional claim for relief.a representative plaintiff still possesses only a single claim for relief the plaintiff own.that the plaintiff has undertaken to also sue for the benefit of all does not mean that the plaintiff has somehow obtained a class claim for relief that can be asserted independent of the plaintiff own claim.t he right of a litigant to employ class action procedure is a procedural right only,ancillary to the litigation of substantive claims.should these substantive claims become moot,by settlement of all personal claims for example,the court retains no jurisdiction over the controversy of the individual plaintiffs.citation.watkins wachovia th,watkins,quoting deposit guaranty nat.bank roper,roper.
thus,we first consider whether plaintiffs individual claims are moot.
no triable issue of fact that plaintiffs individual claims are moot 
plaintiffs assert their claims are not moot because they have not received all of the relief they demanded in their complaint.we disagree.
i.the evidence established the city fully satisfied plaintiffs monetary claims 
the city offered evidence that plaintiffs dwp accounts were credited for the solid resources fee overcharges plaintiffs had paid before plaintiffs joined the litigation.plaintiffs offered no evidence to dispute the fact.they instead asserted they did not know what the credits were for,or if they were accurate.this was insufficient to raise a triable issue of fact on that point.sangster paetkau th,responsive evidence giving rise to no more than mere speculation is insufficient to establish a triable issue of material fact.plaintiffs proffered no evidence indicating they are entitled to further monetary relief to be reimbursed for the solid resource fee overcharges they paid.indeed,plaintiffs do not argue on appeal that they have not received all of the monetary relief they demanded in their complaint as to their individual claims.
ii.the chakhalyan judgment provides the injunctive relief plaintiffs seek in their complaint 
the chakhalyan settlement and judgment placed into effect in all material aspects the injunctive relief plaintiffs seek in their complaint.it is undisputed that this case concerns the same overcharges alleged in chakhalyan.in the second amended complaint,plaintiffs demand injunctive relief that would require the city to cease improperly charging the solid resource fee,reimburse all improperly obtained fees,and authorize the court to maintain jurisdiction over the case and any injunction issued until the court,in its discretion,determines to dissolve and dismiss the injunction.
pursuant to the chakhalyan settlement and judgment which incorporated its terms,the city is to alter its billing system,policies and practices so the overcharges cease and do not recur and promptly and fully reimburse any persons who pay future overcharges.the court is to retain jurisdiction for purposes of enforcing the settlement,which includes the injunctive relief provisions.this is exactly the injunctive relief plaintiffs seek in their second amended complaint.
as we understand their argument,plaintiffs assert their demand for declaratory relief would require additional measures,such as an order that class counsel be charged with retaining,at defendants expense,an accountant to review data regarding the amount of fees charged to each class member and payments made,and that the accountant determine the amount owed to each class member.the declaratory relief demand also seeks an order that the city pay the amount owed to all class members into a fund to be distributed to class members by the court,and that the court oversee the disbursement of funds to the class.
we disagree that these additional measures render the demand for injunctive relief materially different from the chakhalyan provisions,such that plaintiffs claims are not moot.plaintiffs suggest in their briefing on appeal that their complaint seeks ongoing independent reporting or auditing of the city with respect to future conduct.but their actual complaint demands reporting and auditing related only to the calculation and distribution of funds to the class identified in the complaint.this speaks to administration of an award,but not a remedy for the essential harm alleged in the complaint the city act of unlawfully charging the solid resource fee.this remedy was addressed in chakhalyan with the injunctive relief provision requiring the city to stop overcharging customers and to reimburse those overcharged the same remedy plaintiffs demand in their own injunctive relief request.
the chakhalyan settlement and judgment has already put into place the injunctive relief plaintiffs seek as a remedy for the harms alleged in their complaint.see,caro procter gamble th,previously entered consent decree addressed the conduct raised in plaintiff complaint,rendering prayer for relief effectively moot class certification not appropriate where policies of disgorgement and deterrence had been vindicated in other proceedings chen allstate ins,plaintiff had received complete relief on individual claims plaintiff gave no reason to believe that defendant consent to injunctive relief would be inadequate or that plaintiff could obtain broader relief after trial on the merits.
iii.the chakhalyan injunctive relief provisions bind the city and are prospective 
plaintiffs contend that although the chakhalyan settlement and judgment provides that the trial court will retain continuing jurisdiction pursuant to code of civil procedure section section,this applies only to the parties to the chakhalyan action and they were not parties under the terms of the stipulated settlement.as we understand this argument,plaintiffs assert the chakhalyan court had no jurisdiction over them.this contention does not advance plaintiffs ultimate claim.it is undisputed that the city was a party to the chakhalyan settlement.as such,the city was,and continues to be,subject to the chakhalyan judgment.the court has express continuing jurisdiction over the city as a party,with respect to the stipulated settlement and judgment.any uncertainty regarding who may,or who will,seek to enforce the settlement and judgment against the city does not mean the city is free to abandon the obligations to which it stipulated and the court approved.
under section,the trial court has continuing jurisdiction to enforce the judgment,which incorporates the stipulated settlement,against the city.lofton wells fargo home mortgage th,retention of jurisdiction under section includes jurisdiction over both the parties and the case itself it is broader than what typically remains following entry of a judgment and it includes the court equitable authority.the settlement includes the injunctive relief provisions.plaintiffs fail to offer any argument to explain their assertion that continuing jurisdiction to enforce the chakhalyan settlement would not include the terms regarding injunctive relief.
moreover,plaintiffs argument that the court had no jurisdiction to enforce the stipulated injunction with respect to period claims is inconsistent with the actual language of the stipulated injunctive relief.in the agreement,the city is bound to monitor its systems to ensure that the overcharges do not recur,and in the event it identifies future overcharges through such monitoring,it is to promptly and fully reimburse the charges.
it would be absurd to read this language as applying only to claims the city had already been made aware of and would reimburse through other provisions in the agreement.mount vernon fire ins.busby th,contract interpretation requires a commonsense interpretation which avoids absurd results in re tobacco cases i th,in enforcement actions consent decrees are treated as contracts for purposes of interpretation.the stipulated settlement is explicitly prospective,intended to provide relief should future overcharges occur.
to the extent plaintiffs contend the injunctive relief provision only required the city to stop overcharging chakhalyan class members,or only to reimburse future overcharges assessed to chakhalyan class members,we reject the argument.the injunctive relief provisions contain no such limiting language,whereas other portions of the stipulated settlement identify class members explicitly.further,the provision regarding reimbursement of future overcharges refers to those assessed to any persons so identified,a term distinct from class members.we therefore disagree that the settlement and judgment may be construed as requiring the city to only reimburse future overcharges if they are imposed on chakhalyan class members.
iv.plaintiffs have not shown their claims are not moot because they have a continuing economic interest based on shifting costs and fees to a class 
finally,we reject plaintiffs argument that even though they received complete relief before they filed their complaint,they continued to have a stake in the litigation because of their interest in shifting part of the litigation costs and attorney fees to other class members.
cases that have endorsed this theory have done so in a context in which the defendant satisfies the plaintiff claim after the plaintiff has filed suit,and often after the plaintiff has engaged in significant litigation.in the seminal case on this issue,roper,the plaintiffs litigated the case through an unsuccessful motion for class certification,filed a motion for an interlocutory appeal,and only then did the defendant present an offer of judgment.roper,supra,at.under these circumstances,the court noted the plaintiffs claimed a continuing economic interest in shifting the costs of litigation to other class members.id.at,fn.this interest was one basis for the conclusion that the plaintiffs had a personal stake in the appeal of the lower court denial of their motion for class certification 
subsequent cases call into question the continuing validity of the roper analysis on this point.in lewis continental bank,lewis,the high court reasoned an interest in attorney fees is,of course,insufficient to create an article iii case or controversy where none exists on the merits of the underlying claim,see diamond charles,diamond.where on the face of the record it appears that the only concrete interest in the controversy has terminated,reasonable caution is needed to be sure that mooted litigation is not pressed forward,and unnecessary judicial pronouncements on even constitutional issues obtained,solely in order to obtain reimbursement of sunk costs.lewis,supra,at genesis healthcare symczyk,noting the court would not decide whether roper analysis is still valid in light of lewis.
in premium plus partners goldman,sachs cir.premium plus,the seventh circuit court of appeals applied lewis in a putative class action context.after the district court twice denied class certification,the representative plaintiff accepted an offer pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure rule,but also sought to continue litigating the action in order to have a class certified.premium plus,at.the plaintiff argued its claim was not fully resolved because if the class litigates,and wins,some of the expenses that premium plus has incurred along the way could be allocated to the class,and its net recovery therefore would be larger.the logical implication of this position is that a person whose claim is moot still can file suit seeking attorneys fees.id.at.
the premium plus court disagreed that position was advanced,and flopped,in diamond,supra,at,and again in lewis,svpra,at it fares no better when advanced by a class representative.the court said flatly in lewis that an interest in attorney fees is insufficient to create an article iii case or controversy where none exists on the merits of the underlying claim that equally true of costs and the other expenses that premium plus hopes to offload to the class.premium plus,supra,at.
although in premium plus the plaintiff accepted an offer of judgment,we find the court reasoning persuasive here,in that plaintiffs claims are equally moot.in addition,we are aware of no legal authority supporting the proposition that a plaintiff whose claims are fully satisfied before the plaintiff files a complaint has a continuing economic interest in shifting attorney fees and costs to others that is sufficient to constitute the personal stake in the litigation required to avoid a finding of mootness roper did not consider such facts.see steel citizens for a better environment,a plaintiff can not achieve standing to litigate a substantive issue by bringing suit for the cost of bringing suit.the litigation must give the plaintiff some other benefit besides reimbursement of costs that are a byproduct of the litigation itself.
the monetary relief the city provided to the plaintiffs,and the injunctive relief it agreed to in the chakhalyan stipulated settlement and judgment,resulted in plaintiffs directly and indirectly receiving what they demanded in their suit,before they filed the second amended complaint that marked their formal involvement in the litigation.there was no further relief to be afforded the plaintiffs on their individual claims.see simi garamendi th,case is moot when a court ruling can have no practical impact or can not provide the parties with effective relief chen allstate ins,supra,at interpreting gomez,a lawsuit or an individual claim becomes moot when a plaintiff actually receives all of the relief he or she could receive on the claim through further litigation.
ii.the trial court properly rejected the pick off exception to mootness in this case 
plaintiffs argue that even if their individual claims are moot,they raised a triable issue of fact as to whether the pick off exception to mootness in class action cases should be applied here.we conclude the exception does not apply to this case.
a.the pick off exception 
courts have been extremely skeptical of defense efforts to take unilateral actions that moot a representative plaintiff claims in an attempt to avoid litigating class claims.however,these cases involve a defendant voluntary actions,most concern such actions taken after the named plaintiff has filed a complaint,and they address the defense attempt to provide a remedy to the named plaintiff alone,rather than to the entire class.
for example,in la sala,supra,cal d,the plaintiffs brought a class action against a savings and loan association,challenging a provision in the association trust deed that permitted it to accelerate if the borrower executed a junior encumbrance on the secured property.id.at.after the plaintiffs filed their complaint,but before the hearing on a demurrer,the defendant offered to waive its right to accelerate against the named plaintiffs.on its own motion,the trial court ruled there was no justiciable issue the court later dismissed the case,ruling there was no individual plaintiff remaining who was or could be construed to be a representative of the class.id.at.
the california supreme court reversed the decision,concluding the defendant offer to provide relief to the plaintiffs did not necessarily make them unfit to continue representing the class.la sala,supra,cal d at.the court reasoned when a plaintiff sues on behalf of a class,he assumes a fiduciary obligation to the members of the class,surrendering any right to compromise the group action in return for individual gain.even if the named plaintiff receives all the benefits that he seeks in the complaint,such success does not divest him of the duty to continue the action for the benefit of others similarly situated.id.at.
the la sala court further concluded that even if the trial court found the plaintiffs were no longer suitable representatives and,after having a chance to amend the complaint,no suitable representative was named,the court was required to notify the class of the proposed dismissal.the court explained any other resolution would allow the defendant to repeatedly offer relief to the named class representative,then have the case dismissed.such a procedure could be followed ad infinitum for each successive group of representative plaintiffs.if defendant is permitted to succeed with such revolving door tactics,only members of the class who can afford to initiate or join litigation will obtain redress relief for even a portion of the class would compel innumerable appearances by individual plaintiffs.yet the function of the class action is to avoid the imposition of such burdens upon the class and upon the court.citation.if we sanction the defendant tactic defendants can always defeat a class action by the kind of special treatment accorded plaintiffs here and thus deprive other members of the class of the benefits of the litigation and any notice of opportunity to enter into it.la sala,supra,cal d at.
we are mindful of the context of the la sala court reasoning.the plaintiffs had already filed their complaint when the defendant offered to provide the relief they demanded.their claims were not moot before the plaintiffs filed suit.the defendant offered to satisfy the named plaintiffs claims,but it had not already done so.its offer to resolve the claims was purely voluntary,rather than required by law or contract.further,the offer to waive acceleration would apply only to the plaintiffs,not any other members of the class.
in kagan gibraltar sav.loan cal d kagan,disapproved of an another ground by meyer sprint spectrum cal th,footnote,the california supreme court interpreted provisions of the consumer legal remedies act clra as specifically prohibiting a defendant from picking off prospective class representatives by offering them relief while not providing similar relief to the entire proposed class.id.at.when the plaintiff in kagan sent the defendant a demand letter challenging certain practices,including assessment of a particular fee,the defendant provided only a portion of the relief the plaintiff demanded.id.at.the plaintiff subsequently filed a class action suit.id.at.
the court concluded the defendant attempted pick off was invalid under the clra and would not necessarily render the plaintiff unfit to represent a class and bring the action.there was no evidence the defendant complied with the statute requirements that it identify similarly situated plaintiffs,notify other consumers that it would provide them similar relief,and provide relief to similarly situated consumers.kagan,at.it remained in the discretion of the trial court to determine whether the plaintiff was a suitable representative for the class,in accord with la sala.kagan,at.
federal courts have similarly addressed the pick off exception,concluding when a defendant seeks to provide relief to the representative plaintiff in a strategic attempt to moot the plaintiff claims and avoid a class action,the plaintiff may continue to prosecute the suit,at least to attempt to secure class certification wilson gordon cir.two united states supreme court cases considered whether a plaintiff whose claim was expired or satisfied could appeal an order denying class certification.in geraghty,the named plaintiff challenged parole release guidelines on behalf of a class.he was paroled after his motion for class certification was denied and while his appeal of the ruling was pending.the court held he could still prosecute the appeal,despite the expiration of his individual claim.geraghty,supra,at.
in roper,the high court held that when,after the denial of class certification,a defendant made an offer of judgment for the maximum amount each plaintiff could have recovered in the litigation,and the court entered judgment over the objection of the plaintiffs,the plaintiffs could still appeal the denial of class certification.roper,supra,at.
most recently,in,supra,the high court concluded an unaccepted settlement offer or offer of judgment under rule does not moot a named plaintiff claims,at.however,the court did not decide whether the result would be different if a defendant deposits the full amount of the plaintiff individual claim in an account payable to the plaintiff,and the court then enters judgment for the plaintiff in that amount.ibid.
i.the chakhalyan stipulated settlement and judgment distinguishes this case 
the critical factor that distinguishes this case from prior authorities on pick off is the existence of the chakhalyan judgment.pursuant to that judgment,the city had a legal obligation to reimburse plaintiffs for the solid resource fee overcharges they had paid.moreover,that legal obligation applied equally to any other persons subjected to solid resource fee overcharges.
plaintiffs point out the chakhalyan judgment requires the city to routinely monitor its billing system,policies and practice,and in the event the city identifies future solid resource fee overcharges through such monitoring,the city will promptly and fully reimburse any persons so identified plaintiffs argue the city did not identify them as persons subjected to overcharges through such routine monitoring,rather,the city discovered plaintiffs because of their anticipated involvement in the cunningham litigation.
the chakhalyan settlement and judgment do not define routinely monitor or specify exactly what form such monitoring will take.further,while the measures identified in exhibit g include items that would appear to be or would facilitate routine monitoring,the city offered no evidence establishing it learned of the plaintiffs through any specific measures identified in that exhibit.however,we do not narrowly interpret the chakhalyan settlement and judgment as requiring the city to reimburse solid resource fee overcharges only when it discovers overcharges through the city internal measures.
the settlement express purpose is to halt the overcharges,ensure they cease,and compensate those overcharged at the time of the settlement and in the future.to deem credits made to individuals the city discovers through threats of litigation to be purely voluntary,and outside the scope of the chakhalyan settlement injunctive relief provision,would be entirely inconsistent with the stated objectives of the stipulation.we can only understand the stipulated settlement as a whole by interpreting persons identified through such monitoring as broad enough to include persons who threaten litigation or otherwise become known to the city through some form of adversarial process.
pursuant to the chakhalyan judgment,the city has a legal obligation to reimburse dwp customers against whom it has improperly assessed solid resource fee overcharges.by crediting the plaintiffs accounts,the city was complying with the obligations it agreed to in the resolution of chakhalyan.the evidence further established it had done so for other dwp customers between january and june.in la sala,the defendant offered to provide relief only to the representative plaintiffs.any other putative class members would have no recourse except to file their own suits.the same was true in kagan.in contrast,here,the chakhalyan judgment created a remedy for the harm alleged in plaintiffs complaint,and the city has afforded that remedy to plaintiffs and many others.
the policy concerns underlying the pick off exception are the desire to avoid revolving door litigation,whereby the defendant uses a tactic to avoid a class action,to the detriment of putative class members who can not afford to initiate or join litigation,and inviting a waste of judicial resources.roper,supra,at la sala,supra,cal d at.her
