defendant stewart title guaranty stewart appeals the district court order certifying a class in this case alleging violations of the real estate settlement procedure act respa and related state law claims.based on our conclusion that individual factual issues predominate the respa claim,we reverse the district court order certifying a class on that claim.although we see no legal impediment to the certification of a class on the state law claims,given our reversal of the federal class certification,we remand to allow the district court to consider whether to exercise its discretion to retain pendent jurisdiction over those claims.
stewart is a title insurance underwriter that uses a network of agents to sell and issue title insurance policies.plaintiffs allege that they are among numerous consumers who refinanced their home mortgages and failed to receive a mandatory discount on their premiums for new title insurance policies acquired from stewart.residential lenders in texas generally require borrowers to purchase title insurance to protect the lender against defects in title to the property as well as the lender first lien position.when a borrower refinances an existing mortgage,the new lender requires a new title policy for its benefit.texas department of insurance rate rule entitles the borrower to a discount on a policy issued after refinancing if the policy is issued within seven years of the closing of the prior mortgage.the discount starts at on renewals occurring within years of the time a prior policy was issued and decreases by for each additional year after the prior policy up to seven years.in order to qualify for the discount,rule requires that the mortgage a be fully taken up,renewed,extended or satisfied,and b have been previously insured with lender title insurance.see basic manual of rules,rates and forms for the writing of title insurance in the state of texas iii rate rule.
the plaintiffs allege that they refinanced their loans within the discount period and did not receive the reissue credit to which they claim they were entitled.they further allege,with sampling data to support that allegation,that stewart,through its agents,consistently failed to provide the reissue insurance discount and that stewart and the agents split the illegal,unearned charges on the policies.
on these facts,the plaintiffs allege,in addition to various state law claims,a violation of b of the real estate settlement procedures act respa,which provides 
no person shall give and no person shall accept any portion,split,or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a mortgage loan other than for services actually performed.
stewart filed a motion to dismiss arguing that the plaintiffs failed to state a violation of respa as a matter of law.the district court denied the motion.mims stewart title guar,d.plaintiffs then moved for class certification.the district court granted the motion for class certification for both the federal and state law claims,with modifications narrowing the proposed class.mims stewart title guar.stewart then filed a petition for permission to appeal under federal rule of civil procedure f.this court granted the petition.
stewart argues first that the district court erred in certifying the plaintiffs proposed respa class when the named plaintiffs lack standing to assert a claim.although stewart references article iii standing and cites the appropriate factors from lujan defenders of wildlife,d,the substance of its argument is that the plaintiffs fail to state a claim under respa on the merits.if the defendants were actually challenging the plaintiffs article iii standing,this court could clearly address that issue before deciding the propriety of class certification there is no serious question that the plaintiffs have standing to bring this claim.they have alleged an overpayment of premiums for title insurance issued upon refinancing their mortgage,causation the defendants overbilled for the premiums and redressability if plaintiffs are successful,they will be refunded the overpayment.
stewart argument asks this court to address,not article iii standing however,but whether the plaintiffs allegations state a claim under respa.we may not reach that issue because our review of an appeal under rule f is limited and does not permit a general inquiry into the merits of the plaintiffs claim.this court addressed the scope of its jurisdiction in a rule f appeal in regents of the university of california credit suisse first boston.
rule f states that a court of appeals may in its discretion permit an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying class action certification under this rule if application is made to it within ten days after entry of the order.fed.civ.f.the text of the rule makes plain that the sole order that may be appealed is the class certification no other issues may be raised.bell,at.the fact that an issue is relevant to both class certification and the merits,however,does not preclude review of that issue 
although we may not conduct an independent inquiry into the legal or factual merit of this case as though we were reviewing a motion under federal rule of civil procedure b or,we may address arguments that implicate the merits of plaintiffs cause of action insofar as those arguments also implicate the merits of the class certification decision.
regents of the of cal.credit suisse first boston,cir.in regents,the plaintiffs filed suit against several banks alleging that the banks entered into partnerships and transactions with enron corporation that allowed enron to misstate their financial statements.the district court certified a class of persons who purchased enron securities during the certain time period during which these transactions were reported.the class certification decision rested on the district court conclusion that a deceptive act under rule c includes participating in a transaction whose principal purpose and effect is to create the false appearance of revenues,that rule a prohibition against schemes to defraud gives rise to joint and several liability for defendants who commit individual acts of deception in furtherance of the scheme and that plaintiffs were entitled to rely on the classwide presumption of reliance for omissions and fraud on the market.id.at.this court reversed the order certifying the class because it found that the district court erred by including in its definition of deceptive act not only failure to satisfy a duty to disclose material information to the plaintiff,but also failure to satisfy that duty by means of a scheme or act.id.at.an act can not be deceptive under b where the actor,like the banks,had no duty to disclose.id.at.without a deceptive act or straightforward failure to disclose,the plaintiffs were not entitled to the presumption of reliance on an omission under the theory,which was critical to class certification.without a classwide presumption of reliance,the plaintiffs would be left to prove individual reliance on the defendants conduct precluding class certification.id.at.therefore class certification was improper and this court reversed.in doing so,this court by necessity considered the defendants arguments against class certification that also implicated the merits of the plaintiffs cause of action,but only to the extent the merits affected whether class issues would predominate the litigation.
stewart relies on washington csc credit services,cir,to support its contention that this court can consider whether the plaintiffs have stated a claim in an appeal of class certification.that reliance is misplaced.in washington,the plaintiffs brought a claim under the fair credit reporting act fcra.the district court certified a class based on its intermediate ruling that the plaintiff can bring an action under the fcra for failure to maintain the reasonable procedures required by a without first showing that a report was disclosed in violation of.id.at.this court first addressed this crucial issue before addressing the merits of class certification.id.the inquiry was phrased as a question of individual standing,but addressed the merits of the plaintiffs claims,not traditional article iii standing under lujan.id.at.however,washington does not support a conclusion that this court may address the merits of all appeals of class certification decisions,because a later decision of this court recognized that washington was in a different procedural posture than this case.see bertulli,at.washington was appealed under b,not rule f.the court certified for appeal all issues fairly presented in the court order,so this court appellate review was not limited to issues of class certification.id.
accordingly,under the standard rule application to appeals under rule f,the merits of the plaintiffs claims under b of respa may only be considered in this case if relevant to the class certification question.
this court reviews the certification of a class for abuse of discretion.stirman exxon,cir.we review de novo whether the district court applied the correct legal standard to grant certification.washington,at.where a district court bases its legal analysis on an erroneous understanding of the governing law,it has abused its discretion.regents,at.under.b,a class action may be maintained if the court finds that questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.stewart argues that the district court failed to undertake a rigorous analysis of the class claims to determine if class issues predominate and the class action is the superior method by which to try plaintiffs claims.
understanding stewart argument against class certification requires some background on respa.plaintiffs federal claims assert a violation of section b of respa,which states 
no person shall give and no person shall accept any portion,split,or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a mortgage loan other than for services actually performed.
b.this provision was designed to prohibit kickback and referral fee arrangements that had increased closing costs to real estate buyers.it prohibits a person who performs a settlement service from giving or rebating any portion of the charge to any other person who did not perform a settlement service.haug bank of,cir krzalic republic title,cir.section c of respa contains several exceptions to the general rule and specifically allows the payment of a fee by a title company to its duly appointed agent for services actually performed in the issuance of a policy of title insurance.c b.
the real estate settlement service at issue in this case is the provision of title insurance.the charge the title insurance premium is split between stewart and its agents who actually sell the title insurance or reissue insurance.the question in this case narrows to whether stewart charges a fee and shares that fee with its agents other than for services actually performed.there is no question that both stewart and its agents perform services in return for the title insurance premium.the plaintiffs argue that because texas law sets the premium rate that stewart must charge and the discount on that premium stewart must allow on reissue policies,only the discounted portion of the premium is for services actually performed.they argue that the discount that was improperly withheld is a charge for which no services are performed,and therefore a violation of b of respa.
the plaintiffs argument thus rests on the theory that the title insurance premium can be split between the amount allowed under rule after the appropriate discount is applied and the amount in excess of that amount they argue that this excess amount represents a charge for which no services were actually performed.in its ruling on stewart motion to dismiss,the district court accepted plaintiffs argument that fees charged by a title agent that exceeded the value of the agent services were in the nature of kickbacks and gave rise to a claim under b 
although plaintiff allegations are vague,they can be fairly read to support the following argument stewart charged excessive premiums.stewart gave,and title agents accepted,a portion of the excessive premiums.the portion accepted by the title agents was excessive and not for services actually performed,but instead were in the nature of kickbacks or referral fees.

plaintiffs theory which was accepted by the district court that fees can be split between fees reasonable in relation to the services performed and those that are not comes from a hud interpretation of respa.
a single service provider may be liable under section b when it charges a fee that exceeds the reasonable value of goods,facilities,or services provided.hud regulations as noted state if the payment of a thing of value bears no relationship to the goods or services provided,then the excess is not for services or goods actually performed or provided.

given our limited jurisdiction in this rule f appeal,we have no authority to review the district court conclusion that the plaintiffs have stated a claim for these alleged overcharges under this theory.but accepting for purposes of this appeal the district court theory of liability under respa b set forth in its ruling on the motion to dismiss,that liability theory leads us to conclude that its class certification decision is an abuse of discretion,because the district court liability model for violations of respa b requires an inquiry into the facts of each individual class member title insurance transaction.in its denial of stewart motion to dismiss,the district court accepted the plaintiffs argument that the fee for reissue title insurance can be divided two portions that portion authorized by the rate rule which is for services actually performed and the excess charge.the district court did not find that the excess charge standing alone represented a violation of b.rather it found that stewart split with the title agents may not have been for services actually performed,and hence in violation of section b,if the title agent compensation was not reasonable in relation to the services they performed.in other words,the district court concluded in the motion to dismiss that to establish a respa violation,the plaintiff in each individual case must establish that the agent from whom he purchased the policy charged an unreasonable fee.however,in its class certification order,the district court rested its decision on plaintiffs allegations that as a matter of fact,neither the title agent nor stewart provided services in any of the transactions to justify the excess charge and that this contention was capable of being tested on a basis without individualized inquiries into the circumstances of each transaction.no explanation was provided to connect the two rulings.
