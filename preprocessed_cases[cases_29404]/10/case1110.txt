since at least,california prosecutors have brought public nuisance actions in state court to curtail the activities of street gangs.see matthew mickle werdegar,note,enjoining the constitution the use of public nuisance abatement injunctions against urban street gangs,stan.the scope of this effort has been broad.according to amicus curiae los angeles city attorney office,that city,for example,has obtained fortyfour civil injunctions against street gangs in the past two decades.typically,the injunctions forbid members of the enjoined gang from engaging in a broad swath of legal and illegal activities,individually and with others,in certain areas.
our question concerns not the substance of such orders but the procedures constitutionally required before individuals denied the opportunity to defend against imposition of the order against them can be subjected to it.although california courts have grappled for more than years with various substantive and procedural issues posed by injunctions,no court either state or federal has previously addressed the particular due process issue presented here.
the district court approached this case with the utmost care,first denying a preliminary injunction and then,after full discovery,presiding over an bench trial.in a comprehensive opinion,the district court concluded that the constitutional issue should be decided,as no applicable abstention doctrine justified declining to do so and in the particular posture of this case,and given the breadth of the state court injunction at issue,due process requires that the plaintiff class members be afforded an adequate opportunity to contest whether they are active gang members before they are subjected to the injunction.we affirm the district court in principal part.
california street terrorism enforcement and prevention step act,see code,creates both a private and a public cause of action to enjoin,abate,and prevent a nuisance created by a building or place used by members of a criminal street gang for the purpose of the commission of various criminal offenses,see id.a a.the california supreme court has held that the step act nuisance provision is not the exclusive remed y to abate criminal gang activities,and that the general public nuisance statutes,namely california code of civil procedure and california civil code,provide independent authority for actions to enjoin a gang and its members from engaging in nuisance activity.see people ex rel.gallo acuna,cal th,d.
this appeal has its origins in an action to abate gang activity under california general public nuisance statutes.our analysis depends in significant part on the procedural history of the state case.we therefore describe the parties litigation decisions and the relevant state and federal orders in some detail.
in february,the orange county district attorney office ocda,on behalf of the state of california,filed a public nuisance action in orange county superior court against the orange varrio cypress criminal street gang ovc and named individuals.the named individuals were alleged to be members,agents,servants,employees,or persons acting under,in concert with,for the benefit of,at the direction of,or in association with ovc.of the individual defendants,were minors.ocda further alleged that ovc criminal and nuisance activities included attempt ed murders,shootings,robberies,assaults,burglaries,felony gang graffiti and the illegal sale of controlled substances the use of private residential yards and commercial property as escape routes from law enforcement and vandalism,loitering,and drinking alcohol in public.ocda sought a permanent injunction restraining ovc and its members from engaging in a broad range of specified activities,lawful and unlawful,joint and individual,performed within a area of the city of orange.we discuss the scope of the requested relief which,as we explain,the state court granted in principal part in greater detail below.
concurrently with its complaint,ocda filed an application for a preliminary injunction against all defendants.in support,ocda filed various exhibits,many under seal the superior court also granted ocda ex parte application to serve the complaint on ovc,which had no known address,via a named defendant,patrick deherrera.in addition,ocda served numerous individuals named in the state court complaint,including the current plaintiffs appellees,with the complaint and the unsealed documents in support of the preliminary injunction.
individual defendants filed answers or general denials in the state court action or otherwise formally appeared.some juvenile defendants and their parents also attempted to file pleadings or enter appearances but were not permitted to do so.the court declined to designate the defendants parents as guardians ad litem without an appointed guardian,the juvenile defendants could not appear.see a.
the superior court granted a preliminary injunction against ovc and the adult individual defendants who had not appeared.soon thereafter,the court issued a preliminary injunction against eighteen adult defendants unrepresented by counsel,including plaintiffs appellees manuel vasquez and gabriel bastida.the court denied ocda motion for a preliminary injunction as to some adult defendants,and continued until may,the hearing as to certain other adult defendants and all juvenile defendants.the court also set a trial date of july.
in advance of the may hearing,some of the adult defendants represented by counsel including plaintiff appellee miguel lara filed motions opposing the entry of a preliminary injunction against them as individuals.in support,they filed their own declarations declarations of community members disputing the need for an injunction and declarations of experts who averred that the ocda evidence,including the orange police department opd declarations,was insufficient to establish that the named defendants were active members of ovc.through counsel,those defendants also propounded written discovery requests on ocda the parties established a schedule for twenty depositions during may and june.
at the may hearing,the state court denied ocda preliminary injunction motion as to all unrepresented juvenile defendants on the ground that any injunction would be immediately voidable by those defendants.the court also denied a preliminary injunction as to some adult and juvenile defendants represented by counsel,including plaintiff appellee randy bastida,on the ground that there was insufficient evidence of those individuals active participation in the gang.among the other defendants as to whom the court denied a preliminary injunction for lack of sufficient evidence was patrick deherrera,the person on whom ocda chose to serve the complaint on behalf of ovc as an entity.the court granted a preliminary injunction as to other defendants,including plaintiff appellee miguel lara.as of may,ocda had failed to obtain a preliminary injunction against at least twenty of the defendants originally named in the complaint.
shortly thereafter,ocda filed a request to dismiss from the case,without prejudice,individual defendants,including the adults and juveniles who had filed a general denial or an answer and all unrepresented juvenile defendants.ocda did so because of the aggressive effort on the part of those individuals to defend themselves in court,and because of the concerns that the state court judge raised regarding entering a judgment against unrepresented juveniles.the court granted ocda dismissal request.
ocda then requested and obtained a default judgment,including a permanent injunction the order,against ovc as an entity,including ovc members,participants,agents,associates,servants,employees,aiders,and abettors whose membership,participation,agency,association,service,employment,aid,or abetment is more than nominal,passive,inactive,or purely technical,and all persons acting under,in concert with,for the benefit of,at the direction of,or in association with ovc.the order names as parties all individual defendants who had not been voluntarily dismissed by ocda and as to whom the superior court had granted a preliminary injunction we attach a copy of the order as exhibit 
the order forbids the enjoined parties from engaging in a variety of activities in any public place,any place accessible to the public,or in public view within a square mile area the safety zone comprising about sixteen percent of the city of orange the prohibited activities include both unlawful and otherwise lawful conduct,such as 
stand ing,sit ting,walk ing,driv ing,bicycl ing,or gather ing or appear ing with any other enjoined parties,including family members 
confront ing,intimidat ing,annoy ing,harass ing,threat ening,challeng ing,provok ing,assault ing,or batter ing anyone,or remain ing in the presence of or assist ing anyone the enjoined party knows to be performing such conduct 
unlawfully using any drug,or remain ing in the presence of or assist ing anyone the enjoined party know s is unlawfully under the influence of any drug 
possess ing,transport ing,or sell ing guns or various other weapons,or remain ing in the presence of such weapons 
us ing,display ing,or communicat ing by means of any words,phrases,physical gestures,hand signs,or symbols that the enjoined party know s describe,represent,or refer to the ovc,or remain ing in the presence of or assist ing anyone the enjoined party know s is performing such conduct 
wear ing,display ing,exhibit ing,or possess ing any clothes or accessories that the enjoined party know s refer s to the ovc gang,including clothes or accessories that display,exhibit,or feature the word orange,the color orange or remain ing in the presence of anyone that the enjoined party know s is wearing such clothing 
drinking alcohol possessing an open container of alcohol or knowingly remaining in the presence of a person drinking or possessing such an open container,without exception for a person eating or working in a restaurant

for adults,being in a public place,vacant lot,or business establishment between and unless on a sidewalk in front of or adjacent to the person dwelling in,or en route to or from,a place of lawful entertainment,recreation,culture,or charity during that place operating hours,or in,or en route to or from,lawful employment or volunteer activity en route to or from,or engaged in,an official school,official religious,or other expressive activity within the scope of one rights under the first amendment responding to an emergency situation or in a vehicle engaged in interstate travel.
as noted,the order applies not only to the named parties,but also to ovc members,without regard to whether such individuals were acting on behalf of ovc or,except as specified in the order,with other ovc members,when engaged in proscribed activities.the order does not provide any procedures for the parties or the superior court to determine which,if any,unnamed parties were members of ovc and therefore subject to the order terms.the order has no expiration date.
a few weeks after default entry of judgment,the opd,at ocda instruction,began serving the order not only on the individual defendants against whom the injunction had issued,but also on individuals originally named as defendants in the state court case but voluntarily dismissed by ocda.by september,ocda and opd had served at least individuals who had been named in the nuisance suit against ovc but whom ocda voluntarily dismissed.
along with the order,ocda and opd served the following notice 
you are hereby put on notice that on may,judge kazuharu makino signed an order for permanent injunction against the orange varrio cypress criminal street gang.
all members of the gang are subject to the terms of the permanent injunction.
all members of the gang,whether or not named in the original lawsuit and later dismissed from the lawsuit are subject to the terms of the permanent gang injunction 
all persons described above will face criminal prosecution pursuant to penal code section a for any willful violation of any provision listed in the permanent gang injunction.
the superior court had no role in reviewing or approving the notice.
about four months after entry of the order,four individuals on whom ocda and opd served the order and notice filed this action under against the heads of ocda and opd district attorney tony rackauckas and chief of police robert gustafson in their official capacities collectively orange.alleging that ocda and opd strategy violated the procedural due process clauses of the and california constitutions,plaintiffs sought a declaration of the unconstitutionality of orange conduct and an injunction barring orange from enforcing the order against plaintiffs without first providing them with a full constitutionally adequate hearing.plaintiffs presented no challenge to the terms of the order they challenged only the adequacy of their opportunity to contest the application of the order to them.
the four named plaintiffs sought to represent two classes adults and minors named as individual defendants in the state case,who appeared in the orange county superior court to defend themselves and were voluntarily dismissed by ocda,and minors named as individual defendants in the state case for whom no guardian ad litem was appointed and who were voluntarily dismissed by ocda.the proposed class definitions excluded any individuals who were already being prosecuted for state criminal contempt proceedings for violating the order 
the district court denied plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction granted plaintiffs motion to certify both classes and denied the parties cross motions for summary judgment.the district court then held an elevenday bench trial,hearing testimony from fourteen witnesses,receiving more than exhibits,and personally touring the area of the city of orange covered by the order.the court concluded that defendants deprived the plaintiffs and those similarly situated of their constitutionally protected liberty or property interests without adequate procedural protections.the court also granted an injunction barring defendants from enforcing the order against the plaintiffs.the court emphasized that it was not instructing the state court as to the nature of any hearing t he court order is directed to the defendants,and not the state court.emphasis in the original.
orange timely appealed to this court.
before turning to the merits of the due process claim,we address orange contentions that under various comity and federalism doctrines,the district court should have dismissed this suit rather than deciding the issue raised and granting equitable relief.
orange maintains,first,that the suit should have been dismissed under the doctrine established in younger harris,limiting federal courts authority to enjoin ongoing state court proceedings in some instances.in addressing younger abstention issues,district courts must exercise jurisdiction except when specific legal standards are met,and may not exercise jurisdiction when those standards are met there is no discretion vested in the district courts to do otherwise.san jose silicon valley chamber of commerce political action comm.city of san jose,cir alteration omitted.we review de novo a district court determination as to whether younger abstention is warranted.see gilbertson albright,cir en banc.
as relevant here,usually,federal plaintiffs who are not also parties to pending litigation in state court may proceed with their federal litigation without being barred under younger.green city of tucson,cir en banc,overruled on other grounds,gilbertson albright,cir.only under quite limited circumstances may younger oust a district court of jurisdiction over a case where the plaintiff is not a party to an ongoing state proceeding.id.at.such circumstances are present only when a federal plaintiff interests are so intertwined with those of the state court party that interference with the state court proceeding is inevitable.id.
the district court properly declined to abstain under younger.ocda initially named plaintiffs as parties in the superior court action but unilaterally dismissed them.ocda did so precisely because of plaintiffs effort to fight that is,to present a defense in state court.younger abstention can not apply to one who is a stranger to the state proceeding.id.at quoting gottfried med.planning servs,cir.orange made plaintiffs stranger s to the state case by denying them an opportunity to be heard in state court on the question whether they were gang members.id.
moreover,as parties dismissed from the state case,plaintiffs interests are not intertwined with those against whom the order was issued,namely,ovc and the remaining,named defendants.id.at.the question plaintiffs raise in this case the adequacy of ocda and opd determination arose precisely because plaintiffs were dismissed from the state court litigation and so could not defend against the imposition of an injunction on them in that litigation.those covered by name by the order did not attempt to present a defense and were not dismissed from the litigation.the circumstances and interests of those covered by name in the order and the plaintiffs are therefore entirely divergent as to the procedural issues raised here.
in addition,the relief sought in federal court would not disturb the validity of the order as to any of the parties against whom it issued.plaintiffs do not challenge the terms of the order.there is therefore nothing about plaintiffs interests that is currently intertwined with those of the named state defendants against whom the injunction issued.
orange next contention is that plaintiffs action is a de facto appeal of the superior court order,barred by the rooker feldman doctrine.see court of appeals feldman,d rooker fid.trust.we review de novo the district court decision that rooker feldman does not bar plaintiffs action.see bell city of boise,cir.
as this court recently reiterated,the de facto appeals barred by rooker feldman are those in which a federal plaintiff asserts as a legal wrong an allegedly erroneous decision by a state court.id.at quoting noel hall,cir emphasis added.in contrast,if a federal plaintiff asserts as a legal wrong an allegedly illegal act or omission by an adverse party,rooker feldman does not bar jurisdiction.id.quoting noel,at emphasis added.e ven if a plaintiff seeks relief from a state court judgment,such a suit is a forbidden de facto appeal only if the plaintiff also alleges a legal error by the state court.id.
here,plaintiffs assert as a legal wrong only ocda and opd allegedly unconstitutional enforcement of the order.see id.at.they present no challenge to the terms of the order,nor do they otherwise allege a legal error by the superior court.see id.plaintiffs suit is therefore not a forbidden de facto appeal under rooker feldman.see id.
orange also asserts that the district court should have abstained from hearing plaintiffs case under more general principles of comity,equity,and federalism,unmoored from any particular abstention doctrine heretofore endorsed by the supreme court or our court.we review for abuse of discretion the district court decision not to abstain under doctrines other than younger.see united states hinkson,cir en banc green,at.
orange argument hinges on three cases somewhat similar to this one but,in other respects,significantly different.in each of those cases,the federal court plaintiffs sought to enjoin prosecutors from enforcing injunctions against individuals not named in the state injunctions.in each case,the district court abstained from issuing the requested injunction,and the court of appeals affirmed the abstention.see gottfried,at mckusick city of melbourne,cir hoover wagner,cir.
in the case before us,the district court initially relied on these authorities in denying plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction.at that point,plaintiffs were seeking an expansive injunction that would have required judicial hearings s,with specific,prescribed procedural protections,before opd and ocda could enforce the order against them.the district court concluded that such relief would result in an inappropriate invocation of the equity powers of the federal court,because the remedy would require the involvement of a state judicial officer.
after plaintiffs clarified and narrowed the injunctive relief sought,and after trial,the district court issued a permanent injunction against orange,simply barring it from enforcing the order against the plaintiffs.in so doing,the court emphasized that it was not instructing the state court as to the nature of any hearing.
we need not address whether the district court would have abused its discretion in denying an injunction along the lines originally sought by plaintiffs.nor need we decide whether gottfried,mckusick,and hoover properly state the contours of an abstention doctrine that a district court might follow under circumstances not present here.we do hold that in the posture of this case,the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to abstain from granting declaratory and injunctive relief after trial.
first,and most important,in the cases,the plaintiffs challenged the terms of the state injunction.not so here.instead,plaintiffs challenge only orange policy of enforcing the order against them,given that they were dismissed from the state case and so deprived of that opportunity to adjudicate their membership in ovc before being subjected to the order 
second,the plaintiffs here have neither sued the state judge who issued the relevant injunction,nor sought any relief from the state court.instead,they seek to enjoin only the police and prosecutors whom the district court found,after trial,to have a policy of enforcing the order against the same class of people dismissed from the state case.gottfried,at injunction sought against state judge hoover,at,same.
third,as we construe the district court order,see infra section v,the federal relief granted does not pose an undue risk of thrust ing the federal court into an unseemly,repetitive,supervisory role over administration of the state court injunction.mckusick,at.ocda and opd retain the broad discretion to enforce the order,including against plaintiffs,provided they provide the process guaranteed by the constitution.see infra section nor was the relief the district court granted based on nebulous and speculative fears that the order would be enforced against them.hoover,at.as we discuss in section,the district court decision was based on particularized evidence introduced at trial that orange has sought to enforce the state order against the entirety of the plaintiff class.see wooley maynard,d upholding an injunction against a state prosecution when a genuine threat of prosecution exist ed steffel thompson,d holding that federal declaratory relief is not precluded when no state prosecution is pending and a federal plaintiff demonstrates a genuine threat of enforcement.
these distinctions matter because they eliminate the danger of an affront to comity.see hoover,at.issuing equitable relief against ocda and opd does not create a conflict with any decision by the state court,nor does it preemptively decide any question the state court may be called upon to address in any pending proceeding of which we are aware.gilbertson,at noting that younger abstention is inappropriate where a federal claim is wholly unrelated to the issues in a pending state proceeding.
orange nonetheless vigorously asserts that the federal court injunction leaves them caught between conflicting orders.that is simply not so.orange fundamentally misreads the state court order.
nothing in that order authorizes the police or district attorney to subject plaintiffs to that order,much less requires them to enforce the order against the individual plaintiffs in this case without further procedural protections.indeed,the order does not require that its provisions be enforced against anyone.and nothing in it states what procedures orange should use to determine which unnamed parties are covered by the order or against which such parties the order should be enforced 
people ex rel.totten colonia chiques,th,d,does not change our understanding of the state court order.that case held that a trial court could enter an injunction against a gang and its active members,without any individuals being named as parties in the case.see id.at,d.the court reasoned that 
it is simply not practical to require the state to name colonia chiques gang members individually as defendants.there are approximately members,and membership is continually changing.new members are joining the gang,while old members are leaving it or becoming inactive.if the gang could not be sued,the state would have to bring a new action for injunctive relief against each new member.the legislature surely did not intend to impose such an onerous burden on officials who are trying to mitigate california state of crisis which has been caused by violent street gangs.
id.at,d quoting code.colonia chiques supports orange position that under california law,it was not required to name all of a gang active members as parties to obtain an injunction against the gang but nothing in either colonia chiques or the state proceedings that preceded this case addressed the separate question of what process is due before a individual can be subjected to an injunction as a purported member of an enjoined gang.
we note finally that the fact that the equitable relief sought by nonparties to a proceeding bears some relationship to that state proceeding would not be a sufficient basis for a district court to abstain from deciding a federal constitutional question.as we explained in green,
the principle that plaintiffs need not exhaust available state judicial or administrative remedies necessarily means that the mere availability of a state judicial proceeding that allows the opportunity to vindicate federal rights is insufficient to justify abstention under younger there is no principled difference,with regard to the comity principles underlying younger,between requiring a plaintiff to begin his or her own state court or administrative proceeding when that is possible and requiring the plaintiff to intervene in someone else state court suit when that is possible.either way,the requirement is inconsistent with the longstanding principle that plaintiffs can ordinarily go forward in federal court if they choose to do so,and need not bring their cause to state court first.
green,at.that rule is especially apt here,as any comity concerns are largely of ocda own making.
in short,under the circumstances of this case,the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to abstain from granting relief under general principles of comity and federalism.
orange final contention is that the district court erred under a line of cases originating with brillhart excess ins.of,by accepting jurisdiction over plaintiffs action,which included a claim for a declaratory judgment.the argument is twofold first,that the district court was obliged under brillhart to state its reasons for exercising its discretion to consider plaintiffs claim for declaratory relief but did not do so second and closely related that even assuming the district court had adequately stated its reasons,its decision to entertain plaintiffs declaratory relief claim was an abuse of discretion under brillhart 
orange first contention relies on dizol,at,which held that when a party timely objects to a district court exercise of discretionary jurisdiction under the declaratory judgment act,and the district court fails to make a sufficient record of its reasoning to exercise jurisdiction,the case must be remanded to the district court to record its reasoning in a manner sufficient to permit the proper application of the abuse of discretion standard on appellate review.id.quoting wilton seven falls,d 
dizol remand rule does not apply to claims that exist independent of the request for a declaration.scotts.llc seeds,cir internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.a claim is independent in this context if it would continue to exist if the request for a declaration simply dropped from the case.id.orange acknowledges this standard but argues that it is not satisfied here,on the theory that plaintiffs claim for injunctive relief is predicated on an initial declaration that plaintiffs have suffered a violation of their constitutional rights.
we disagree.plaintiffs claim for injunctive relief is independent because it would be viable without the declaratory claim.see id.at.scotts,for example,held that a claim for specific performance of a contract which is,essentially,an was independent of a claim for declaratory relief because it would be viable without the declaratory claim.scotts,at.other circuits have similarly rejected the argument that a request for an injunction is merely ancillary to a request for declaratory relief.see black sea,united heritage,cir chase brexton health,maryland,cir.
because dizol discretionary rule does not apply,we proceed to consider orange second argument,namely,that the district court abused its discretion in entertaining plaintiffs claim for declaratory relief in light of the related state court proceedings.because the declaratory judgment claim was related to the independent nondeclaratory judgment claim for injunctive relief we evaluate under the colorado river doctrine,rather than under brillhart,the district court discretionary decision to grant relief.see scotts,at.
under colorado river,considerations of wise judicial administration,giving regard to conservation of judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of litigation,may justify a decision by the district court to stay federal proceedings pending the resolution of concurrent state court proceedings involving the same matter.holder holder,cir citations omitted.here,as the district court recognized,there is no ongoing state proceeding that could provide plaintiffs relief on their due process claim.id.at.as there are no concurrent state proceedings that will resolve plaintiffs claims,id.at,the colorado river doctrine does not apply.see intel advanced micro devices,cir.the district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in carrying out its virtually unflagging obligation to exercise jurisdiction,and to grant declaratory relief,rather than staying plaintiffs action under colorado river.see gilbertson,at 
the final issue we must consider before addressing the merits of plaintiffs due process claim is a narrow one.defendant rackauckas,sued in his official capacity as the head of ocda,argues that plaintiffs claim against him under the procedural due process clause of the california constitution is barred by pennhurst state school hosp.halderman,d.we agree.
a federal court may not grant injunctive relief against state officials on the basis of state law,when those officials are sued in their official capacity.pennhurst,u.at see pena gardner,cir per curiam.for purposes of liability,whether a california county district attorney acts as a state rather than local official depends on the particular acts challenged in the suit.see weiner san diego,cir.a california district attorney is a state officer when deciding whether to prosecute an individual,and when investigating and proceeding with criminal prosecutions.id.at accord goldstein city of long beach,cir.plaintiffs allegations all of which attack ocda policies for enforcing the state order against plaintiffs through criminal contempt proceedings fall squarely within that category of state,rather than local,official action.weiner,at.given the particular official conduct at issue,plaintiffs can not seek injunctive relief in federal court against rackauckas for alleged violations of the california constitution.we accordingly reverse the district court judgment against rackauckas on plaintiffs second claim for relief.see pennhurst,at weiner,at.
pennhurst,of course,has no bearing on rackauckas amenability to suit in federal court for alleged violations of federal law.the district court determined that plaintiffs were entitled to relief under the federal constitution before proceeding to address their claims under the california constitution,and awarded the same declaratory and injunctive relief on each independent ground.rackauckas immunity argument does not impact our analysis of plaintiffs federal due process claim or the corresponding relief granted,to which we turn 
the district court grant of declaratory and injunctive relief was based on its conclusion that by subjecting plaintiffs and those similarly situated to the enforcement of the order,orange deprived plaintiffs and those similarly situated of their constitutionally protected liberty interests without adequate procedural protections.reviewing the factual findings underlying the district court analysis for clear error and the district court legal conclusions regarding the due process claim de novo,we affirm the district court.see hinkson,at ting v.at t,cir.
we analyze a procedural due process claim in two steps.the first asks whether there exists a liberty or property interest which has been interfered with by the state the second examines whether the procedures attendant upon that deprivation were constitutionally sufficient.united states juvenile male,cir,cert.denied,d internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
as to the first step of the procedural due process analysis,we agree with the district court that the order profoundly implicates liberty interests protected by the due process clause,including rights of free movement,association,and speech,and that orange conduct interferes with those protected liberty interests of the plaintiffs.
freedom of speech and the other freedoms encompassed by the first amendment always have been viewed as fundamental components of the liberty safeguarded by the due process clause.first bank of boston bellotti,d.t he freedom to loiter for innocent purposes is also part of the liberty protected by the due process clause.city of chicago morales,d plurality opinion.the constitution likewise guarantees the fundamental right of free movement to both adults and minors.see nunez ex rel.nunez city of san diego,cir invalidating a juvenile curfew ordinance under strict scrutiny review.the order places a heavy burden on the exercise of these protected liberty interests 
as noted,the order prohibits anyone subject to its terms from associating with any other enjoined parties including family members in any public place,any place accessible to the public,or in public view in the safety zone.the do not associate prohibition extends to stand ing,sit ting,walk ing,driv ing,bicycl ing,or gather ing or appear ing.the order also establishes curfews for both minors and adults,prohibiting nighttime presence in a public place,vacant lot,or business establishment unless an enumerated exception applies.these provisions directly interfere with an individual fundamental right of free movement,and an individual decision to remain in a public place of his choice,morales,at.related terms of the order that bar remain ing in the presence of other individuals engaged in various acts such as possessing firearms or drinking alcohol further affect these same liberty interests.those terms restrict freedom of movement and use of public places because of the actions of others,over which one may have no control,and do so without regard to whether the individual engaging in the banned activities is an ovc gang member.
the do not associate provision and other limitations on association have no exception for individuals to engage in first amendment protected expressive activity,such as attending religious services,participating in political demonstrations,or otherwise associat ing with others in pursuit of the wide variety of political,social,economic,educational,religious,and cultural ends protected by the first amendment.see roberts jaycees,d.the same provisions also burden the constitutionally protected freedom of intimate association,see id.at,by barring association with family members in public places such as schools,churches,parks,libraries,stores,and restaurants and in some instances,at home,if in public view,see supra.
the do not use gang hand signs or symbols provision,in turn,restricts freedom of expression by banning the use or display by means of any words,phrases,physical gestures,hand signs,or symbols that an enjoined party know s describe s,represent s,or refer s to the ovc gang,or remain ing in the presence of individuals using such words or gestures this proscription would,for example,ban a covered individual from referring to the ovc gang,or listening to someone else refer to the ovc gang,in the designated locations,while discussing this lawsuit or the state court order.see city of paul,d noting that c regulations are presumptively invalid under the first amendment mccoy stewart,cir.also possibly affecting freedom of expression is the prohibition on wearing orange clothing and clothing that feature s the word orange.sammartano first judicial dist.court,in for cnty.of carson city,cir.
in sum,a host of the order terms implicate constitutionally protected liberty interests.
aside from the terms of the order itself,orange actions subjecting plaintiffs to the order also constitute further interfere nce with liberty interests triggering scrutiny under the due process clause.see juvenile male,at.although the order did not name plaintiffs individually,orange subjected plaintiffs to the order notified plaintiffs they could face criminal prosecution for violating the order terms and testified in this litigation to a policy of arrest ing,transport ing,and book ing those plaintiffs alleged to have violated the order and hold ing them pending bond or arraignment,rather than citing and releasing them,as well as a policy of seeking increased bail amounts for violations of the order.opd and ocda policy gave plaintiffs a choice between refraining from a wide variety of otherwise lawful,constitutionally protected activities,or going to jail,quite possibly for some time.
based on the evidence presented at trial,the district court found that some plaintiffs have in fact refrained from exercising their rights,particularly their right of free movement.see nunez,at.plaintiff vasquez,who has lived his entire life in the safety zone,has curtailed going to parks,stores,restaurants,and the mall,for fear of being arrested.vasquez no longer goes anywhere in the injunction area with his brother,with whom he lives and who has also been served with the order.plaintiff lara no longer goes with his family,including his twin brother,who also has been served with the order,to their favorite restaurants,to the local pool where lara learned to swim,to parks where the family previously picnicked,or to the city of orange annual street fair.the remaining named plaintiffs the bastida brothers no longer drive through the injunction area together or visit family together,or attend family functions that are held outdoors,for fear of violating the order.when their grandfather had a stroke and was taken to a hospital in the safety zone in the middle of the night,their mother was forced to decide whether to permit the brothers to visit the publicly accessible hospital,an act that would violate both the curfew and association provisions of the order.
the district court similarly found that plaintiff lara used to participate in vigils,demonstrations,and protests within the injunction area,but ceased doing so after being served with the order,for fear he would be violating its terms by confronting and challenging government policies and associating with individuals on the injunction list.such persons include his twin brother,who also has been served with the order.the bastida plaintiffs likewise refrained from participating in protests out of fear of violating the order.
because orange unilateral decision to restrict plaintiffs constitutionally protected liberty interests constituted an interfere nce by the state,see juvenile male,at,we turn to an examination of whether orange was obligated to provide plaintiffs with additional procedural protections.
mathews eldridge,d,provides the familiar framework for the second step of our analysis,namely whether the procedures attendant upon orange deprivation of plaintiffs liberty interests were constitutionally sufficient.see juvenile male,at.mathews directs us to examine 
first,the private interest that will be affected by the official action second,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and finally,the government interest,including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.
brittain hansen,cir quoting mathews,at.in balancing the mathews factors,we are mindful that the requirements of due process are flexible and call for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.wilkinson austin,d quoting morrisey brewer,d.
the district court correctly determined that the mathews factors weigh clearly in favor of the conclusion that orange violated plaintiffs procedural due process rights by failing to provide any form of hearing before subjecting them to the order.
it follows from our analysis of plaintiffs liberty interests in section that plaintiffs private interest s are very strong.see brittain,at.the scope of conduct covered by the order is wide,intruding considerably on the daily lives of those subject to it.as the district court found after personally touring the safety zone,the geographical area covered by the order encompasses dense residential areas,several schools,at least four parks,the chapman university campus and its surroundings,the historic downtown orange area which includes a vibrant commercial district,government buildings and offices including orange city hall,the police station,and the public library,a hospital,and hundreds of retail and commercial business,and hundreds of homes and apartments.as the district court also correctly noted,for individuals who have spent much of their lives living in and around the area,the order terms impose significant restrictions on plaintiffs liberty interests.
moreover,that the order is permanent it lacks an expiration or sunset date,compounds the deprivation.t he possible length of wrongful deprivation is an important factor in assessing the impact of official action on the private interests.see mathews,at.
in sum,under the first mathews factor,plaintiffs interests are truly weighty 
under california law,f or the purposes of a gang abatement injunction,an active gang member is a person who participates in or acts in concert with a gang,where t he participation is more than nominal,passive,inactive,or purely technical.people englebrecht,th,d see broderick boys,th at,d.california courts have held that under state law,the state has the burden of demonstrating active gang membership by clear and convincing evidence,rather than a lower preponderance standard,given the importance of the interests affected by such an injunction.englebrecht,th at,d see broderick boys,th at,d.
in applying the second mathews factor,we address the nature of assessing whether an individual is an active gang member or participant the adequacy of the procedures orange used in making that determination the value of additional procedural safeguards and the sufficiency of postdeprivtion remedies.mathews,at.
a where a factual issue depend s on the credibility of witnesses and assessment of conditions not subject to measurement,and is not susceptible of reasonably precise measurement by external standards,t he risk of error is considerable when such determinations are made after hearing only one side.chalkboard,brandt,cir.determining whether an individual is an active gang member presents a considerable risk of error.the informal structure of gangs,the often fleeting nature of gang membership,and the lack of objective criteria in making the assessment all heighten the need for careful factfinding.
gangs are often loose knit and without structure.att y gen.youth gang task force,of justice of the state of california,report on youth gang violence in california.the step act so recognizes,codifying a definition of criminal street gang that includes groups whether formal or informal.code f 
for our part,we have recognized that many g angs do not have,organizational minutes,or any other normal means of identification.united states hankey,cir.california courts have also so noted.people valdez,th,d,for example,concluded that many gangs are not public and open organizations or associations like the ymca or state bar association,which have a clearly defined and ascertainable membership.rather,gangs are more secretive,loosely defined associations of people,whose involvement runs the gamut from wannabes to leaders d etermining whether someone is involved and the level of involvement is not a simple matter id.at,d.likewise,colonia chiques noted that the gang there at issue had a membership that was continually changing,with n ew members joining the gang,and old members leaving it or becoming inactive.th at,d 
at trial,plaintiffs two expert witnesses,james vigil,professor of criminology at university of california,irvine,and malcolm klein,professor of sociology at the university of southern california,testified to these same fluid characteristics of gangs in general and ovc in particular.both reported that most gang members eventually leave gangs,making it difficult to determine membership or participation at any single time based on a past report of an individual involvement in a gang.klein also stated that ovc,based in a particular neighborhood in the city of orange,was one of the less cohesive gangs which he had encountered in more than forty years studying gangs.
based on the trial record,including the expert evidence,the district court determined that whether an individual is an active participant of a criminal street gang is a multifactored,complex,and fact specific inquiry.the district court also found that ovc membership would be particularly difficult to determine because gang members and nonmembers often grow up together in the same neighborhood and have social relationships and friendships unrelated to the gang.distinguishing an individual social association with a gang member on a familial or friendship i.related basis,from an association with the gang as an organization is therefore a nuanced task.the district court also noted,based on professor vigil testimony,that many individuals who have grown up in the local neighborhood or who have family members in the gang may be deemed members of the gang without undergoing any kind of initiation.it is therefore often unclear,the district court found,at what point a person becomes a member or participant of a gang.in light of the evidence before the district court,its findings regarding the,complex,and fact specific nature of determining whether someone is an ovc gang member are not clearly erroneous.see hinkson,at.
moreover,the fact that the police observe an individual violate one of the order terms is of little probative value in assessing whether that individual is in fact an ovc gang member.the order prohibits a wide variety of otherwise legal,quotidian conduct not directly correlated with the nuisance and criminal activities that gave rise to the order.much of the behavior covered by the order can occur outside the presence of any other individual even putatively covered by the order.
in short,given the wide variety of information that may be deemed relevant,and the difficulty of reasonably precise measurement in assessing whether someone is an active gang member,t he risk of error is considerable when such a determination is made without any participation by,or opportunity to provide evidence on behalf of,the individual served with the order and,according to orange,putatively covered by it.see mathews,at chalkboard,at.
b as to the procedures actually used to determine which individuals would be served with the order and considered subject to it,the district court characterized those procedures as follows defendants undertook a unilateral,determination,based on and untested evidence and requiring judgmental questions not determined by objective measures.this characterization is well supported by the record.
testimony by deputy district attorney michael hernandez,assistant district attorney john anderson,joel nigro,and aaron drootin,established that orange lacked clear standards for determining on whom to serve the order.as the district court found,hernandez,nigro,and drootin repeatedly testified that they had no fixed list or set criteria to determine whether an individual was an active participant of ovc.throughout trial,these witnesses noted that there was no equation to determine gang membership no bright line rule and every situation can be different.their testimony indicates that opd used inconsistent standards.nigro,for instance,explained that ocda did not provide opd with an explanation as to the meaning of active participant.he believed,based on his conversations with gang participants and police officers and detectives that association can be enough for a person to be an active participant of a gang.detective drootin,in contrast,testified that merely knowing an ovc member was insufficient to establish membership.
orange argues on appeal that the superior court made adequate findings at the preliminary injunction stage regarding gang membership,and that the decision as to which individuals to treat as bound by the order was based on those findings.the district court,as noted,concluded otherwise that orange carried out a unilateral determination.the district court determination was not illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the record.see hinkson,at.
first,the state court never made any findings of gang membership regarding juveniles who lacked a guardian ad litem.the state court denied a preliminary injunction as to those individuals,but orange later served them with the order nonetheless.
second,orange served the order on a number of plaintiff class members as to whom the state court denied a preliminary injunction.although orange maintains that it had new evidence of gang membership not submitted to the state court as to all but one of these individuals,that representation only emphasizes that orange coverage decisions were not determined by whether there had been a previous judicial indication as to coverage.
finally,and most important,for those plaintiffs as to whom the state court did make preliminary findings of gang membership,those findings were exactly what they purported to be preliminary,not final.such a preliminary finding does not amount to an adjudication of the ultimate issue,see cont l baking katz,cal d,namely whether there was clear and convincing evidence as to plaintiffs status as active gang members,see englebrecht,th at,d.there was ample testimony before the district court that some of the evidence of gang membership submitted to the district court was of questionable reliability.by dismissing them from the state court proceedings,ocda deprived the plaintiffs of an opportunity to take discovery from ocda and the opd officers who had submitted declarations in support of a permanent injunction against individual plaintiffs.determination of the ultimate accuracy of the state court preliminary findings was therefore through no fault of the state court entirely undermined by the very procedural tactic that gave rise to this lawsuit.
c i n certain circumstances,a state can cure what would otherwise be an unconstitutional deprivation of life,liberty or property by providing adequate postdeprivtion remedies.zimmerman city of oakland,cir.assuming,without deciding,that the deprivation of liberty interests that plaintiffs have suffered could conceivably have been remedied by some form of postdeprivtion procedure,we conclude that orange has provided no such adequate process 
orange contends that plaintiffs had several opportunities to obtain relief once it provided notice of its intent to enforce the order against them through a removal process administered by ocda by intervening in the superior court proceedings,see colonia chiques,th at,d by moving to modify or dissolve the order,see,and appealing from any order denying such a motion,see a iraheta superior court,th,d,or appealing from the grant of the order,see or in criminal contempt proceedings if arrested for violating the order.we address each possibility in turn.
i according to orange,under ocda removal process,a panel of two senior deputy district attorneys from ocda and a probation department representative may review an individual request to be removed from the ambit of the order.this process is insufficient to provide an adequate postdeprivtion remedy,for at least two reasons.
first,the district court did not clearly err in finding that the precise nature of the process and the potential relief it offers remain unclear.as the district court found,the only written information that exists concerning the procedure is a document served on the named defendants at the outset of the superior court case orange acknowledged at trial that the exclusion process had never been implemented with regard to ovc or any of the five other injunctions the ocda had obtained.moreover,there is no indication in the record that plaintiffs were again given notice of the removal process when they were served with the order.as plaintiffs were dismissed from the superior court case and were not named in the resulting order,it is not clear that the putative removal procedure applied to them.
second,the removal process described suffers from essentially the same defects as the procedures orange used unilaterally to determine against which nonparties to the state court lawsuit to enforce the order.most critically,the burden is on the petitioning individual to demonstrate that he or she is not an active gang participant,even though the state ordinarily has the burden of demonstrating active gang participation by clear and convincing evidence.englebrecht,th at,d.no enunciated criteria govern the determination who is or is not a gang member even though,as discussed earlier,see supra section a,membership is a shifting and sometimes nebulous standard.furthermore,there are no provisions requiring an explanation of the basis for the conclusion that the individual is a gang member,either before or at the hearing.so the alleged gang member is left in a factual vacuum,to prove a negative.anti discrimination comm.reno,quoting joint anti fascist refugee comm.mcgrath.frankfurter,concurring f airness can rarely be obtained by secret,determination of facts decisive of rights.
ii orange relies on colonia chiques for the proposition that plaintiffs as to the superior court case once dismissed could have moved under california code of civil procedure to intervene in that action on behalf of ovc.see colonia chiques,th at,d.intervention in the state case is an inadequate postdeprivtion remedy.
ocda unilaterally dismissed plaintiffs from the state case.the suggestion that plaintiffs should have moved to intervene in an action from which they had just been dismissed has little merit.having been dropped from the litigation,the plaintiffs had no obligation to come back a second time to assert their interest in the matters at issue their interest was evident,but they were excluded from the litigation precisely because of that.we stress once again,in this connection,that the procedural due process problems raised in this case are of orange own creation.they stem from orange decision to thwart plaintiffs efforts to use the procedures available in the state court that all parties agree were constitutionally sufficient.
moreover,there is no indication that plaintiffs could have intervened as a matter of right.ocda would undoubtedly have opposed any intervention motion,as it had just dismissed the plaintiffs as unnecessary to the action.the superior court could have denied an opposed intervention motion.see city of malibu california coastal comm n,th,d.it would have little choice but to do so with regard to the class of unrepresented juveniles those individuals remained without a guardian ad litem,and the superior court had already declined to appoint guardians for them.as to the rest of the plaintiff class,the contingent right to file an opposed motion to intervene,subject to discretionary denial,is not an adequate assurance of due process to meet constitutional standards.
iii a motion to modify or dissolve the order is an inadequate postdeprivtion procedure because plaintiffs take no issue with the terms of the order itself.plaintiffs quarrel is only with orange decision,without any judicial or administrative proceeding,to subject plaintiffs to the order.for the same reason,it is no answer to say that plaintiffs could appeal from the denial of a motion to modify or dissolve the order,or could appeal from the grant of the order.their contention is unrelated to any action of the superior court with regard to the order.
broderick boys is not to the contrary.there,the court held that without having to admit membership in the gang,four men were sufficiently aggrieved by an injunction that they had standing to move to set aside the injunction.th at,d.broderick boys establishes that plaintiffs could have challenged the terms of the order in state court,or,as in broderick boys,argued that the order in its entirety was void for lack of proper notice.but nothing in broderick boys suggests that plaintiffs could have litigated in state court the question presented in their federal action namely,assuming the validity of the order,whether the order could be enforced against them.
iv finally,criminal contempt proceedings would not be adequate to provide full relief from the deprivation of being subjected to the order.see mathews,at.
in california,c ontempt may be punished in two ways in a civil proceeding,for which the maximum penalty is a fine and five days imprisonment,see,or in a criminal misdemeanor proceeding,see code a,for which the maximum penalty is six months imprisonment.see people gonzalez,cal th,d.at trial,orange testified to a policy of prosecuting violations of the order under the latter provision,and of arrest ing,transport ing,and book ing any individual alleged to have violated the order and hold ing them pending bond or arraignment.
ocda representatives also specified that ocda has a policy of seeking increase d bail for violations of the order,to ensure that bail would be higher than it might otherwise be for a misdemeanor offense.a person charged under the criminal contempt provision may spend up to thirty days in jail between arraignment and trial under california speedy trial statute.code a.under orange policy for enforcing the order,then,plaintiffs can expect to face considerable difficulties posting bail and will likely be forced to spend up to a month in jail before obtaining the opportunity to contest their gang membership in a contempt proceeding.
as noted,the order binds ovc members,agents,servants,employees,or persons acting under,in concert with,for the benefit of,at the direction of,or in association with ovc.in that wording,the order is not unlike many abortion buffer zone or labor picketing injunctions.see,madsen women health,d order directed at organizations in re berry,cal d,injunction.what is unique,however,is the combination of orange enforcement policy including the avowed policy of immediate arrest and a request for heightened bail and the breadth and nature of the order.again,the order proscribes a broad range of basic,daily activities by ovc members,and it proscribes such conduct without regard to whether the individual is engaged in that conduct in concert with,as a member or agent of,or with the intent to further the purposes of the gang.
in these respects,this case differs from other contexts in which an injunction runs against an organization and its members,and,we shall assume for present purposes,unnamed members are accorded sufficient process through the opportunity to defend criminal contempt accusations.the abortion and labor cases,for example,involve injunctions restricting a narrow range of conduct,demonstrating in a certain location or with a certain object.engaging in those activities is likely to be highly correlated with whether an individual is in fact a member of the enjoined organization,which had engaged in similar activities.in contrast,the order prohibits an enormous range of quotidian conduct that,on its face,is not indicative of an individual gang membership,or any other connection to the enjoined gang.
moreover,the difference in the scope of the injunctions in these various contexts is relevant because t he more important the interest affected by state action,and the greater the effect of its impairment,the greater the procedural safeguards the state must provide to satisfy due process.haygood younger,cir.further,the lack of an inherent correlation between the enjoined activities and membership in the group covered by the order exacerbates the already significant risk of error in identifying accurately the members of ovc.
under the particular circumstances of this case,then,including the order pervasive interference with plaintiffs liberty interests and the lack of adequate procedural safeguards,contempt proceedings are insufficient to cure the unconstitutional deprivation of liberty,including jail time,that would occur before a criminal contempt trial would be held.see zimmerman,at.
at the final stage of the mathews inquiry,we consider the government interest in providing or not providing specific procedures,including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.see mathews,at haygood,at.here,the operative question is not whether orange has a significant interest in combating gang violence no one doubts that they do but rather whether they ha ve a significant interest in failing to provide a process through which an individual can challenge orange allegations of his active gang membership.humphries cnty.of,cir,rev on other grounds,d.
as the district court noted,orange presented no evidence of an administrative,fiscal or other substantial burden in providing safeguards.in fact,ocda assistant district attorney anderson testified at trial that it was standard procedure in the five other state court proceedings in which ocda previously sought injunctions to name each defendant individually in the initial filing.moreover,at the time ocda chose to dismiss plaintiffs from the superior court proceedings,ocda had obtained preliminary injunctions against ovc as an entity,thereby satisfying any government interest in promptly obtaining relief against ovc itself.
additionally,the record indicates that at least two jurisdictions in california san francisco and oakland regularly provide some form of process for individuals in injunction proceedings,rather than simply seeking injunctions against the gang as an entity and its unnamed members.we need not decide whether these jurisdictions procedures are constitutionally required as a matter of due process we simply cite them as examples of procedures,in addition to the procedures ocda followed in cases prior to this one,that cast further doubt on orange claimed administrative burden in providing protections of some kind.
there is no evidence in the record that further predeprivation procedures would reduce the efficacy of the injunction against ovc and its members.orange expert testified that he had no opinion on whether providing a hearing before subjecting somebody to an injunction would make a gang injunction more or less effective.
in sum,the district court properly concluded that orange established no administrative,fiscal or other substantial burden in providing some procedure for plaintiffs to challenge orange gang membership determination before they were subjected to the terms of the order.see mathews,at haygood,at.
all the mathews factors,taken together,weigh decisively in favor of plaintiffs.the scope of the order is extraordinarily broad,interfering with a wi
