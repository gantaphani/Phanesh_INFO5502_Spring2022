class action settlement magistrate judges 
the panel reversed a magistrate judge order approving a class action settlement in a suit brought against a debt collection agency under the fair debt collection practices act.
the panel held that the magistrate judge had the authority to enter final judgment under c because she obtained the consent of the named plaintiffs and the defendant.joining other circuits,the panel held that the magistrate judge was not required to obtain the consent of the four million additional class members who were not present before the district court.the panel also held that c does not violate article iii of the constitution by permitting magistrate judges to exercise jurisdiction over class actions without obtaining the consent of each absent class member.
the panel held that the magistrate judge abused her discretion by approving the settlement as fair,reasonable,and adequate under federal rule of civil procedure e because there was no evidence that the injunctive relief afforded by the settlement had any value to the class members,yet to obtain it they had to relinquish their right to seek damages in any other class action.there was also no evidence that the absent class members would derive any benefit from the settlement cy pres award.the panel remanded the case to the district court.
watford,circuit judge 
the magistrate judge in this case approved a class action settlement in which the named plaintiffs and class counsel got what they wanted but the remaining four million class members got worthless injunctive relief.in exchange for receiving nothing of value,the class members gave up their right to assert damages claims against the defendant in any other class action.we are asked to decide two issues whether the magistrate judge had the authority to exercise jurisdiction without obtaining the consent of all four million class members and,assuming we get past that issue,whether the magistrate judge abused her discretion by approving the settlement as fair,reasonable,and adequate.
the named plaintiffs are michael koby,michael simmons,and jonathan supler.in april they sued ars national services,a debt collection agency,under the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,et.they alleged that ars violated and of the fdcpa by leaving voicemail messages in which the callers failed to disclose that they worked for ars,that ars is a debt collector,or that the purpose of the call was to collect a debt.the named plaintiffs brought the action on behalf of everyone in the united states who received a voicemail message from ars which failed to disclose that information.the class consists of some four million people nationwide.
the named plaintiffs requested maximum statutory damages,which vary under the fdcpa depending on the nature of the action being brought.in an individual action,a plaintiff may recover any actual damages suffered plus statutory damages up to.a,a a.in a class action,the named plaintiffs may recover actual damages plus statutory damages up to,but the damages award for the rest of the class is capped at or of the defendant net worth,whichever is less.a b.
in august,after the district court denied ars motion to dismiss the case on the pleadings,the parties began discussing settlement.around the same time,ars voluntarily adopted a new,standardized voicemail message which requires its employees to disclose that they work for ars,that ars is a debt collector,and that they are calling to collect a debt.the parties agree that this new voicemail message complies with the fdcpa.
over the course of more than a year,the parties engaged in settlement discussions with the assistance of a magistrate judge.the named plaintiffs and ars eventually consented to having the same magistrate judge conduct all further proceedings in the case,including the entry of final judgment.the district court entered an order authorizing the magistrate judge to exercise jurisdiction over the case,and she presided over all further proceedings.
in january,following a mandatory settlement conference before the magistrate judge,the parties finally hammered out a deal.under the terms of the settlement,the parties agreed to seek certification of a nationwide,class under federal rule of civil procedure b.the proposed class consisted of everyone in the united states who between april and august received a voicemail message from ars that failed to identify ars as the caller,disclose that the call was from a debt collector,or state that the purpose of the call was to collect a debt.the parties chose those dates because april is the beginning of the applicable statute of limitations period and ars ended the alleged fdcpa violations in august,when it adopted the new voicemail message.because the class would be certified under rule b,the parties agreed that no notice of any kind would be sent to the four million class members and that no one would be permitted to opt out of the class.
in terms of monetary payments,ars agreed to pay each of the three named plaintiffs,the maximum they could hope to recover under the fdcpa as none of them had suffered any actual damages.ars represented to the court although it is unclear whether the magistrate judge took any steps to verify this fact that its net worth was only million,which meant the other four million class members could collectively recover no more than.given the impossibility of distributing less than a penny to each member of the class,ars agreed to make a cy pres award to a local san diego charity instead.ars also agreed to pay class counsel the negotiated sum of in attorney fees.
the four million unnamed class members receive no monetary compensation under the settlement.they are,however,the beneficiaries of a stipulated injunction to be entered against ars as part of the settlement.the injunction requires ars to continue using,for a period of two years,the new voicemail message it had already adopted voluntarily back in august.in return for that supposed benefit,the four million class members forfeit the right to seek damages from ars as part of a class action.the class members retain the right to pursue damages claims against ars on an individual basis.
as required by the class action fairness act,see b,ars sent notice of the proposed settlement to the appropriate state and federal officials,none of whom objected to the settlement.
the four million class members did not receive individual notice of the proposed settlement,but one class member the appellant in this case,bernadette helmuth filed an objection.she is the named plaintiff in a separate class action against ars pending in the district court for the southern district of florida.her lawsuit alleges essentially the same fdcpa violations alleged in this case,except that she seeks certification of a much smaller class limited to florida residents who owed money to a particular creditor on whose behalf ars was attempting to collect.after the parties agreed to the settlement in this case,ars asked the district court in florida to stay all further proceedings in helmuth case on the ground that,if approved,the settlement would bar her case from proceeding as a class action.the district court in florida agreed to stay helmuth action pending final approval of the settlement.
in her objection to the settlement,helmuth argued,among other things,that the settlement was unfair and unreasonable because class members would be barred from pursuing damages claims as part of a class action but would receive nothing of value in return.helmuth did not object to the magistrate judge authority to approve the settlement and enter judgment,so we express no view on the propriety of having the same judge who assisted the parties in negotiating a settlement decide whether the settlement should be approved as fair and reasonable.after conducting a fairness hearing at which helmuth counsel,ars counsel,and class counsel presented argument,the magistrate judge certified the proposed class under rule b approved the settlement as fair,reasonable,and adequate under rule e and entered judgment accordingly.having objected to the settlement in the district court,helmuth is entitled to challenge the court rulings on appeal.see devlin scardelletti.
before reaching the merits,we must be sure we have jurisdiction to decide this appeal.that inquiry requires more work here than in most cases.our jurisdiction is triggered only if the magistrate judge had the authority to enter final judgment under c.see anderson woodcreek venture,cir.section c authorizes magistrate judges,u pon the consent of the parties,to conduct any or all proceedings in a jury or nonjury civil matter and order the entry of judgment in the case,when specially designated to exercise such jurisdiction by the district court or courts he serves.c.when a magistrate judge is authorized to enter final judgment,an aggrieved party may appeal directly to the appropriate united states court of appeals from the judgment of the magistrate judge in the same manner as an appeal from any other judgment of a district court.c.
no one disputes that the district court properly designated the magistrate judge to exercise jurisdiction in this case.nor is there any dispute that the named plaintiffs and ars consented to the magistrate judge exercise of jurisdiction.the only question is whether the statute required not just the consent of the named plaintiffs,but also the consent of the four million class members who were not present before the court we will refer to them as the absent class members.we conclude that the statute requires the consent of the named plaintiffs alone and join three other circuits that have reached the same conclusion.see day persels associates,llc,cir.dewey volkswagen aktiengesellschaft,cir.williams general electric capital auto lease,cir.
as a purely linguistic matter,c reference to the consent of the parties could be read to encompass both the named plaintiffs and the absent class members,for the term does not have a single fixed meaning.in some contexts absent class members are treated as parties,see in re cement antitrust litigation,cir.judicial recusal statute,while in other contexts they are not,see snyder harris,diversity jurisdiction statute.as the supreme court has observed,absent class members may be treated as parties for some purposes and not for others.devlin,at.
viewing c as a whole,it seems clear that congress did not intend absent class members to be treated as parties in this context.in c,which specifies the procedures for obtaining party consent under c,the phrase the parties is used multiple times in a way that can not sensibly be read to include absent class members for example,the provision states that when a magistrate judge has been designated to exercise jurisdiction under c,the clerk of court shall,at the time the action is filed,notify the parties of the availability of a magistrate judge to exercise such jurisdiction.in virtually all class actions,it would be impossible for the clerk of court to issue this notice to absent class members at the time the action is filed.the identities of all absent class members will often not be known until later in the case,after at least preliminary discovery has been conducted.even if the identities of all absent class members are known at the outset of the case,the clerk would need to compile their names and contact information in order to send the required notice,since that information will not appear in the complaint.and in large class actions,the cost of sending each class member notice of the availability of a magistrate judge would be prohibitive even for the most district courts.we doubt congress would have imposed these substantial budgetary and manpower burdens on clerks offices across the country without making that intent explicit.
there is an additional reason to believe that congress intended to require the consent of only the named plaintiffs under c.as a general matter,the named plaintiffs in a properly certified class action are charged with conducting the litigation on behalf of the class they represent by definition class actions involve too many plaintiffs to allow each to participate personally.see fed.civ.a.the named plaintiffs serve as representatives of the class and in that capacity are authorized to decide matters of litigation strategy,such as which claims to assert or drop,what discovery to take,what motions to file,and so forth.deciding whether to consent to a magistrate judge is a matter of litigation strategy of the same order.in fact,it is probably less consequential to the outcome than other decisions the named plaintiffs are ordinarily called upon to make,such as deciding whether to consent to a bench trial or choosing which issues to raise on appeal from an adverse verdict.it would therefore have been sensible for congress to assume that the named plaintiffs in a class action will decide,on behalf of the absent class members,whether to consent to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge 
with that issue of statutory interpretation resolved,the jurisdictional analysis is straightforward.congress has authorized magistrate judges to enter judgment in a class action so long as the named parties to the action have consented,and here the named plaintiffs and ars have done so.thus,an appeal from the judgment entered by the magistrate judge may be taken directly to our court in the same manner as an appeal from any other judgment of a district court.c.
the only remaining issue is whether c is constitutionally valid.the national association of consumer advocates,appearing as a friend of the court,argues that the statute is unconstitutional,at least as applied to class actions.in its view,c violates article iii of the constitution by permitting magistrate judges to exercise jurisdiction over class actions without obtaining the consent of each absent class member.
article iii grants judges who wield the judicial power of the united states life tenure during good behavior and a guaranteed salary that may not be diminished.these protections are designed to ensure the independence and impartiality of the judicial officers authorized to decide the merits of a litigant case.the supreme court has held that litigants in federal court have a personal right,conferred by article iii,to insist upon adjudication of their claims by a judge who enjoys the salary and tenure protections afforded by article iii protections that magistrate judges lack.commodity futures trading commission schor,see pacemaker diagnostic clinic of america,instromedix,cir.en banc.but the personal right to an article iii adjudicator may be waived,and a party express or implied consent to adjudication by a magistrate judge constitutes a valid waiver of the right.roell withrow.
so the question becomes whether article iii categorically prohibits the named plaintiffs from waiving,on behalf of the class members they represent,the right to proceed before an article iii judge.a categorical prohibition of that sort might be warranted if the interests of the named plaintiffs and the absent class members frequently diverged with respect to exercise of the right at issue.but the opposite is true of the right to have a case heard by an article iii judge.to serve as class representatives,the named plaintiffs must have claims that are typical of the claims held by the class,and in conducting the litigation the named plaintiffs must fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.fed.civ.a.when those requirements are met,the interests of the named plaintiffs and absent class members will almost always be aligned when it comes to deciding whether to consent to a magistrate judge jurisdiction.barring unusual circumstances,the named plaintiffs will have as strong an interest as the absent class members in having their claims adjudicated by an independent and impartial decisionmaker.the named plaintiffs can therefore be expected to protect the absent class members interests in the exercise of the right conferred by article iii.
there are constitutional limits,of course,on the named plaintiffs authority to waive the rights of their fellow class members,but those limits are imposed by the due process clause,not by article iii.most fundamentally,as mandated by due process and enforced through federal rule
