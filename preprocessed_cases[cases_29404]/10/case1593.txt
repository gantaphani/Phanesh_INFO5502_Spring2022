israel flores and andrea naasz appeal from the trial court order compelling arbitration.this lawsuit arises from their purchase of a previously owned vehicle from west covina auto group,llc,doing business as west covina toyota wct,and alleges both individual and class action claims.wct moved to compel arbitration based on an arbitration clause in the sales contract between the parties.appellants contend that the trial court erred in compelling arbitration because a poison pill provision in the arbitration clause prohibits arbitration wct waived its right to arbitration the arbitration clause is unconscionable there was no meeting of the minds or mutual consent regarding the arbitration clause and as an unexpected term in an contract of adhesion,the arbitration clause is unenforceable.we hold the trial court did not err and affirm.
facts and procedural history 
allegations of the first amended complaint 
naasz was looking to replace her chrysler pacifica in february.she telephoned wct and spoke to a salesman.she told him she was upside down on her current vehicle but wanted to trade it in and purchase a new one.he invited her to wct and told her wct could help her purchase another vehicle.
on or about february,naasz and her husband went to wct and met with the salesman.she told him she still owed approximately on her current vehicle and wanted her monthly payments for her new vehicle to be no more than to a month.naasz and her husband met with the wct fleet manager,who explained that wct could not work her negative equity in her vehicle into a contract for a brand new vehicle.he explained that she had a choice between two previously owned vehicles a nissan titan or a toyota sequoia.wct told naasz and her husband that the sequoia was a certified vehicle.naasz and her husband test drove the sequoia.once back at the dealership,wct told her that the monthly payments would be well over what she wanted,in light of the negative equity in her vehicle.if she found a cosigner for the purchase,however,her payments would be lower.naasz and her husband left wct and returned the same day with naasz father,israel flores,who agreed to be a cosigner.
a wct finance manager prepared the retail installment sale contract for the sequoia.wct instructed naasz and flores where to sign and initial the documents.it was late at night by the time they signed the contract,so naasz left the vehicle at the dealership to be washed and detailed and decided to retrieve it the following day.naasz husband returned to pick up the vehicle the following day.
on or about march,a salesperson from wct called naasz and flores and told them that wct had lowered the price of the vehicle,and they needed to return to wct to sign a new contract.wct told them that the lender required more money as a down payment,but knowing that naasz had no more to put down,wct had decided to lower the price of the vehicle.naasz and flores went to wct and met with a different finance manager,who presented them with an acknowledgement of rewritten contract stating that the original contract between wct and appellants had been mutually rescinded.they signed that and also a new retail installment sale contract that was backdated to february.
after the purchase,naasz experienced a number of problems with her vehicle.naasz took the vehicle to toyota motor sales authorized repair facilities on numerous occasions,but toyota motor sales had been unable to repair it or conform it to the express and implied warranties.she also requested that toyota motor sales buy the vehicle back from her,which it refused to do.
naasz and flores filed a complaint against wct and toyota motor sales alleging both individual and class claims.they alleged class claims for violations of the consumer legal remedies act clra,et,the automobile sales finance act asfa,et,and the unfair competition law ucl bus,et.they alleged individual claims for violations of the clra and ucl,violations of vehicle code sections,and,subdivision b,fraudulent misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation,and violations of the song beverly consumer warranty act,et.
first months of litigation 
appellants filed their complaint in july and the first amended complaint fac in september.wct filed a case management statement in october stating that it was willing to participate in mediation but not arbitration,was requesting a jury trial,expected to file a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication,and intended to complete the depositions of appellants and written discovery by january.in november,wct demurred to all five of the class action causes of action.it also filed a motion to strike the portions of the fac requesting classwide rescission of any sales contracts signed by putative class members.the court overruled the demurrers but granted the motion to strike.appellants filed a writ petition seeking review of the court ruling granting the motion to strike,and wct filed a response to the petition.
wct filed another case management statement in january requesting a jury trial,stating that it was willing to engage in mediation but not arbitration,and anticipating the same motions and discovery it identified in the prior case management statement.in february,wct filed an answer to the fac asserting affirmative defenses,none of which referenced a right to arbitrate.
in march,wct filed a third case management statement in which it again requested a jury trial,stated that it was willing to do mediation but not arbitration,anticipated the same motion practice,and anticipated written discovery and a vehicle inspection.
wct noticed the depositions of naasz and flores in march and served them both with requests for production of documents.it deposed them both on march,at which time both produced documents.appellants served interrogatories,requests for documents,and requests for admission on wct,to which wct responded.appellants also noticed the deposition of wct person most knowledgeable on certain topics and requested documents to be produced at the deposition.wct objected to appellants notice.appellants deposed wct person most knowledgeable in may.
wct motion to compel arbitration 
wct filed a motion to compel arbitration and stay the action on or around june.the sales contract between appellants and wct is a preprinted form contract produced by the reynolds company.the contract contains an arbitration clause with a waiver of the right to classwide arbitration.the clause reads in part 
arbitration clause 
please review important affects your legal rights 
either you or we may choose to have any dispute between decided by arbitration and not in court or by jury trial.
if a dispute is arbitrated,you will give up your right to participate as a class representative or class member on any class claim you may have against including any right to class arbitration or any consolidation of individual arbitrations.
discovery and rights to appeal in arbitration are generally more limited than in a lawsuit,and other rights that you and we would have in court may not be available in arbitration.
if federal law provides that a claim or dispute is not subject to binding arbitration,this arbitration clause shall not apply to such claim or dispute.any claim or dispute is to be arbitrated by a single arbitrator on an individual basis and not as a class action.you expressly waive any right you may have to arbitrate a class action 
if a waiver of class action rights is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason in a case in which class action allegations have been made,the remainder of this arbitration clause shall be unenforceable.
the sales contract provides in another part,separate from the arbitration clause,that f ederal law and california law apply to this contract.in the arbitration clause,it states any arbitration under this arbitration clause shall be governed by the federal arbitration act et and not by any state law concerning arbitration.
wct asserted that it was precluded from moving to compel arbitration earlier in light of the decision in fisher dch temecula imports llc th fisher,which was decided on august,just after appellants filed their original complaint.in fisher,also a putative class action,the plaintiff had purchased a used car and signed a sales contract containing an arbitration clause identical to the one in appellants contract.id.at.in particular,the arbitration clause contained the same poison pill provision stating that if the waiver of class action rights was found to be unenforceable,the entire arbitration clause would be unenforceable.ibid.the fisher plaintiff had also alleged class claims under the clra.fisher,at.the court held that the right to a class action lawsuit or classwide arbitration was an unwaivable statutory right under the clra.fisher,at.the waiver of the class action rights in the arbitration clause was thus unenforceable,which,according to the poison pill provision,meant that the entire arbitration clause was unenforceable.id.at.the fisher court therefore affirmed the trial court denial of the petition to compel arbitration.
wct argued that fisher precluded it from moving to compel arbitration until the united states supreme court decision in at t mobility llc concepcion.concepcion.the court decided concepcion on april,and wct filed its motion to compel arbitration on or about june.according to wct,concepcion held that the federal arbitration act faa et preempted california law and that courts must uphold the terms of an arbitration clause even when it contains a class action waiver.at a status conference on may,wct informed the court and appellants of its intent to compel arbitration in light of concepcion.wct requested that appellants stipulate to arbitration pursuant to concepcion,and when they declined to stipulate,wct filed its motion seeking to compel arbitration.wct asserted that it should be an individual arbitration,not a class arbitration,in light of the waiver of classwide arbitration in the sales contract.
appellants argued that the court should decline to compel arbitration for several reasons.first,they asserted wct had waived its right to compel arbitration by substantially invoking the litigation process for almost a year,which delay prejudiced appellants.second,they argued that the parties did not consent to arbitration because there was no meeting of the minds on the issue.third,they argued that the arbitration clause was unconscionable and thus unenforceable.fourth,they argued that fisher was still applicable,the poison pill provision made the arbitration clause unenforceable,and concepcion did not overrule fisher.
the trial court heard argument and granted the motion to compel arbitration on july.in a minute order issued the same date,the court cited concepcion and explained that concepcion determined the courts must uphold an arbitration provision even if there is a class action waiver.further,the court stated that there was no waiver of the right to arbitration because wct did not have the right to invoke the arbitration clause until april.the court also found no substantive unconscionability.
discussion 
appealability 
ordinarily,an order compelling arbitration is not appealable and may be reviewed only after the parties complete arbitration and appeal from the judgment.muao grosvenor properties,th.but appellants contend that the trial court order is appealable under the death knell doctrine.we agree.
the death knell doctrine holds that an order effectively terminating class claims while allowing individual claims to proceed is immediately appealable.in re baycol cases i ii cal th.what matters is not the form of the order but its impact.an order that effectively rings the death knell for class claims is in essence a final judgment on those claims.ibid.in franco athens disposal,th franco,the court applied the death knell doctrine to an order compelling arbitration.the franco plaintiff filed a putative class action alleging labor code violations against his former employer.id.at.the employer filed a petition to compel arbitration based on a written arbitration agreement,which contained a waiver of class arbitrations.ibid.the trial court granted the petition,effectively limiting the arbitration to plaintiff claims.ibid.the franco court held that the order compelling arbitration and enforcing the class arbitration waiver was the death knell of class litigation through arbitration.id.at.the order was thus appealable.
here,the court order granting the motion to compel arbitration had the same effect.the sales contract arbitration clause contains an express waiver of class arbitrations.the court order did not state that it was compelling only certain claims to arbitration or that it was severing the class claims and staying litigation on those.it simply granted wct motion.in light of the class arbitration waiver,the order compelling arbitration effectively rang the death knell for the class claims.franco,supra,th at.
wct contends that franco is no longer the law and we should follow a more recent case,arguelles romero superior court th.arguelles romero does not assist wct.arguelles romero reviewed a trial court order compelling arbitration,but the case contained no analysis of franco or appealability.as part of the factual and procedural background section,the court recited the following history.the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the order compelling arbitration.arguelles romero,supra,at.the defendant moved to dismiss the appeal as taken from a nonappealable order.ibid.the plaintiffs thereafter filed a petition for writ of mandate,challenging the same order.ibid.the court granted the motion to dismiss the appeal and issued an order to show cause in the writ proceeding.ibid.the court did not analyze the appealability issue beyond this recitation of procedural history.to say that the case rendered franco bad law or determined that the death knell doctrine does not apply in this circumstance is inaccurate.it is axiomatic that a decision does not stand for a proposition not considered by the court.nolan city of anaheim cal th.
having determined that we have jurisdiction over this appeal,we now turn to the merits of appellants claims.
the poison pill provision does not prohibit arbitration 
appellants contend that the sales contract itself prohibits arbitration by way of the poison pill provision that is,the provision stating that if a waiver of class action rights is deemed unenforceable for any reason,the remainder of the arbitration cause shall also be unenforceable.here,they contend,a waiver of class action rights is unenforceable under the clra,thus triggering the poison pill provision.
the parties dispute whether state law or federal law,and specifically the faa,applies to our interpretation and application of the arbitration clause.the sales contract contains a general choice of law provision stating that both federal law and california law apply to the contract.to the extent the two conflict,the supremacy clause of the united states constitution mandates that federal law preempts state law.washington mutual bank superior court th.moreover,section of the faa provides that state laws inconsistent with the faa provisions and objectives are preempted.truly nolen of america superior court th,citing perry thomas.as we discuss below,concepcion reveals a conflict between the faa and the state law on which appellants rely.the faa and concepcion thus control here baker aubry d,when an arbitration agreement is subject to the faa,questions concerning the construction and scope of the arbitration clause are determined by federal law.
the effect of the faa,concepcion,and the poison pill provision is a legal question we review de novo.laswell ag seal beach,llc th,parada superior court th.applying this standard,we conclude that the arbitration clause is enforceable despite the waiver of classwide arbitration rights.
a.the clra and fisher 
our analysis begins with the state law on which appellants rely,the clra and fisher.like appellants,the fisher plaintiff was a consumer who had purchased a previously owned vehicle and alleged clra class claims,among others,against the dealership.fisher,supra,th at.also like appellants,the fisher plaintiff had signed a sales contract with an arbitration clause expressly waiving the right to classwide arbitration.id.at.finally,the sales contract also contained a poison pill provision stating that if the waiver of class action lawsuits or classwide arbitration was found unenforceable,the entire arbitration clause was unenforceable.ibid.
the clra provides that any consumer entitled to bring an action under the clra may also bring his or her claims as a class action suit.it also provides that a ny waiver by a consumer of the provisions of the clra is contrary to public policy and shall be unenforceable and void.
the fisher court held that,under the clra,the plaintiff could not be asked to waive her right to file a class action or request classwide arbitration.fisher,supra,th at.the waiver of class rights in the plaintiff contract was unenforceable,triggering the poison pill provision such that the entire arbitration clause was unenforceable.id.at.the court recognized that the faa incorporated a basic policy objective favoring arbitration,but it noted that the faa also made arbitration agreements subject to the same grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.see also fisher,supra,at.in other words,arbitration agreements were to be placed on the same footing as other contracts and could not be singled out for suspect status.fisher,at.the court thus phrased the issue as whether the waiver of unwaivable statutory rights under the clra constituted a ground that exists at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract id.at,and concluded the answer was yes.the waiver of the unwaivable right under the clra to bring a classwide arbitration violated the public policy underlying that right and constituted a private agreement in contravention of public rights.id.at.the court held the notion that a private contract violated public policy was a generally applicable contract defense not preempted by the faa.ibid.
since fisher,the united states supreme court decision in concepcion has altered the legal landscape substantially.
faa preemption and concepcion 
the faa provides that arbitration agreements shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,except,as discussed above,on such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.this last phrase is referred to as the saving clause of the faa.concepcion,supra.at.
the faa reflects both a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration,citation,and the fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract.concepcion,supra.at.while the saving clause permits agreements to arbitrate to be invalidated by generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,defenses that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue are preempted by the faa.concepcion,at.
concepcion dealt with consumers waiver of class arbitration rights and the discover bank rule.concepcion,supra.at.in discover bank superior court cal th,discover bank,the california supreme court announced a rule that classified arbitration provisions in certain consumer contracts of adhesion as unconscionable because they included a waiver of the consumer right to classwide arbitration.concepcion,at.specifically,the court held in discover bank 
we do not hold that all class action waivers are necessarily unconscionable.but when the waiver is found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages,and when it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money,then,at least to the extent the obligation at issue is governed by california law,the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party from responsibility for its own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another.citation.under these circumstances,such waivers are unconscionable under california law and should not be enforced.discover bank,supra,cal th at.
concepcion held that the faa preempted the discover bank rule.concepcion,supra.at.this was because the discover bank rule stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of the faa.ibid.the court reasoned that the faa purpose is to ensure that private arbitration agreements are enforced according to their terms so as to facilitate streamlined proceedings,and it noted that,in the past,the court had held that parties may agree to limit the issues subject to arbitration,citation,to arbitrate according to specific rules,citation,and to limit with whom a party will arbitrate its disputes.concepcion,at.the point of allowing parties to design arbitration processes was to allow for efficient,streamlined procedures.id.at.the court described one prior case in which it held preempted by the faa a state law rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies before arbitration,because the rule conflicted with a prime objective of arbitration achieving streamlined proceedings and expeditious results.concepcion,at.
the discover bank rule similarly interfered with arbitration,the court held.concepcion,supra.at.the rule essentially permitted consumers to demand classwide arbitration ex post,when the parties did not agree to that.ibid.as such,the rule prevented parties from realizing the principal benefit of their bilateral arbitration agreements,namely a more informal,less costly,and more expeditious resolution to disputes,less likely to generate procedural morass.id.at.requiring the availability of classwide arbitration interfere d with fundamental attributes of arbitration and thus create d a scheme inconsistent with the faa.id.at see also id.at c lass arbitration,to the extent it is manufactured by discover bank rather than consensual,is inconsistent with the faa.
the concepcion court rejected the argument that the discover bank rule fell within the faa saving clause that is,that it was grounded in california unconscionability doctrine and was therefore a ground that exist ed at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.concepcion,supra.at.the court explained that even generally applicable contract defenses may be preempted by the faa when they are applied in a fashion that disfavors arbitration.id.at.
after the high court decision,the consumers waiver of classwide arbitration rights in concepcion was no longer unenforceable as unconscionable under the discover bank rule.laster t mobile usa,may,cv wl remand to trial court in concepcion case.
c.the case at bar 
to review,the clra expressly authorizes consumers to bring class actions.it also declares that any waiver by a consumer of its provisions is contrary to public policy and unenforceable.thus,ordinarily,the clra antiwaiver provision renders waivers of class action rights unenforceable.
we deal here with the clra antiwaiver provision,not the discover bank rule of unconscionability.but,for our purposes,no meaningful distinction exists between the clra prohibition against class action waivers and the discover bank rule.both are state law rules that stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full objectives of the faa by effectively requiring the availability of classwide arbitration.concepcion makes clear that faa preemption extends to state laws standing as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of the faa.concepcion,supra.at 
as in concepcion,appellants and wct agreed to arbitrate their disputes on a bilateral basis and agreed that appellants could not assert class claims in arbitration.designing the arbitration in this manner made it more likely the parties would obtain the prime benefits of arbitration,streamlined proceedings and expeditious results.but enforcing the clra provision against a class arbitration waiver would essentially allow consumers to demand classwide arbitration ex post,when the parties never agreed to that.and as we have just discussed,r equiring the availability of classwide arbitration interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration and thus creates a scheme inconsistent with the faa.concepcion,supra.at.just as the discover bank rule was inconsistent with the faa because it manufactured class arbitration rather than making it consensual id.at,so is the clra antiwaiver provision.applying concepcion,we hold that the clra prohibition against class waiver is preempted by the faa because it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of the faa.concepcion,supra,at.
appellants contend that the clra antiwaiver provision does not mean that parties will be forced into class arbitration when they never agreed to it.instead,they say,when a waiver of class arbitration is unenforceable,parties must forego arbitration and go on to class action litigation.even when this is the result,however,the parties arbitration agreement is not being enforced according to its terms,because the parties agreed to individual arbitration streamlined proceedings relative to litigation,especially relative to class action litigation and are instead in class action litigation.thus,this result is still inconsistent with the overarching purpose of the faa,which is to ensure the enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms so as to facilitate streamlined proceedings.concepcion,supra.at.
appellants also contend that fisher analysis relied on the faa saving clause and held that the clra antiwaiver provision was a generally available contract defense not preempted by the faa.they assert that,as a generally available contract defense,the clra antiwaiver provision survives concepcion.we disagree.concepcion considered and rejected the same argument with respect to the discover bank rule.the discover bank rule held that certain class action waivers by consumers were unconscionable,whether they were waivers of class action litigation or waivers of class arbitration.discover bank,supra,cal th at.the rule did not apply especially to arbitration but was generally applicable to any class action waiver.still,the court held that it was preempted by the faa because of the obstacle it posed to the accomplishment of the faa objectives.concepcion,supra.at.similarly,our holding does not invalidate the clra antiwaiver provision altogether,but holds that it is preempted by the faa for the same reasons as the discover bank rule.
appellants additionally contend that our holding would mean any number of illegal terms placed in arbitration clauses could be enforceable because the state laws making them illegal would be preempted by the faa.they cite,for example,a hypothetical term forcing plaintiffs to hand over their children at the beginning of the arbitration,or a term permitting the defendant to take a free punch at the plaintiff to commence the arbitration.
our holding does not lead to such absurd results.as we discuss in part,post,the defense of unconscionability to terms other than class arbitration waivers survives concepcion.terms requiring parties to hand over children or submit themselves to violence in order to arbitrate are surely so overly harsh as to shock the conscience.pinnacle museum tower pinnacle market development us,llc cal th,pinnacle.we can not imagine how such terms would survive an unconscionability challenge.
in sum,the clra prohibition against class waivers is preempted by the faa.the waiver of class arbitration rights in appellants sales contract is not unenforceable under the clra.the poison pill provision which makes the arbitration clause unenforceable if the class arbitration waiver is unenforceable is thus not triggered.
wct did not waive its right to arbitrate 
appellants next contend that wct waived its right to compel arbitration by acting inconsistently with the right to arbitrate,substantially invoking the litigation process,and prejudicing appellants.generally,the determination of waiver is a question of fact,and the trial court finding,if supported by sufficient evidence,is binding on the appellate court.citations.when,however,the facts are undisputed and only one inference may reasonably be drawn,the issue is one of law and the reviewing court is not bound by the trial court ruling.agnes medical center pacificare of california cal th,agnes medical center.in the case at bar,the essential facts are not disputed.whether we engage in de novo review or substantial evidence review,we agree with the trial court that wct did not waive its right to arbitration.the trial court did not err under either standard.
both the faa and california state law reflect a strong policy favoring agreements to arbitrate and require close judicial scrutiny of waiver claims.agnes medical center,supra,cal th at.the party seeking to establish waiver bears a heavy burden of proof.we do not lightly infer waiver,and any doubts regarding waiver should be resolved in favor of arbitration.ibid.
both state and federal law also hold that no single test delineates the conduct that will constitute a waiver of arbitration,though i n determining waiver,a court can consider whether the party actions are inconsistent with the right to arbitrate whether the litigation machinery has been substantially invoked and the parties were well into preparation of a lawsuit before the party notified the opposing party of an intent to arbitrate whether a party either requested arbitration enforcement close to the trial date or delayed for a long period before seeking a stay whether a defendant seeking arbitration filed a counterclaim without asking for a stay of the proceedings whether important intervening steps,taking advantage of judicial discovery procedures not available in arbitration had taken place and whether the delay affected,misled,or prejudiced the opposing party.agnes medical center,supra,cal th at.appellants focus on the first,second,and sixth factors.
wct did not act inconsistently with a right to arbitrate 
wct contends that it did not act inconsistently with the right to arbitrate because it could not enforce arbitration prior to concepcion,when fisher established that the arbitration clause was unenforceable.we agree.
appellants filed their complaint in july and their first amended complaint in september.fisher was filed just after the original complaint,on august.under fisher,wct could not enforce the arbitration clause the clra antiwaiver provision made the class arbitration waiver unenforceable,which triggered the poison pill provision and made the whole arbitration clause unenforceable.the trial court would have been bound to apply fisher and deny any motion to compel arbitration.auto equity sales,superior court cal d,under the doctrine of stare decisis,all tribunals exercising inferior jurisdiction are required to follow decisions of courts exercising superior jurisdiction decisions of every division of the district courts of appeal are binding upon all the superior courts of this state.it was not until april,that concepcion substantially changed the legal landscape and gave wct strong support for the argument that the class arbitration waiver was enforceable,despite fisher.on may,two weeks after concepcion was filed,wct informed the court and appellants that it intended to compel arbitration.it then filed its motion on or around june.wct moved shortly after it reasonably determined that it would no longer be futile to move to compel arbitration.in other words,it acted consistently with a right to arbitrate,once that right was reasonably established.although the safest and strongest course may have been for wct to mention arbitration in a case management statement or answer,with the caveat that it was not moving to compel arbitration because it believed such a move was futile in light of fisher,we do not think its failure to do so was an intentional waiver,under these circumstances.
the ninth circuit considered this issue in fisher becker paribas cir and held that a party does not act inconsistently with a right to arbitrate when it would have been futile to move for arbitration under existing law.similar to california law,in the ninth circuit,a party seeking to prove waiver must demonstrate an existing right to compel arbitration and acts inconsistent with that right.id.at.the becker defendant moved to compel arbitration after failing to raise arbitration as an affirmative defense and litigating the case for three and a half years,during which time the parties filed pretrial motions and engaged in extensive discovery.id.at.the defendant moved only after the united states supreme court rejected the intertwining doctrine,which held that when it is impractical if not impossible to separate out nonarbitrable from arbitrable contract claims,a court should deny arbitration in order to preserve its exclusive jurisdiction over federal securities claims.id.at.prior to the high court rejection of the intertwining doctrine,the ninth circuit had indicated its approval of the doctrine in a case filed two months before the plaintiffs filed suit against the defendant de lancie birr,wilson cir,fn.becker,at.the court concluded that the defendant had properly perceived that it was futile to file a motion to compel arbitration until the supreme court had rejected the intertwining doctrine.id.at.therefore,the fact that the defendant did not file its motion to compel arbitration until then was not inconsistent with its agreement to arbitrate disputes.id.at.
considering the change in law concepcion wrought,at least two federal district courts in california have concluded that class defendants did not act inconsistently with the right to arbitrate when they did not move to compel arbitration until after concepcion.see quevedo macy,d,only after concepcion did it become clear that the defendant had the right to enforce its arbitration agreement as written and to defend against the plaintiff claims in arbitration on an individual basis because the defendant promptly moved to enforce its arbitration agreement as soon as it became clear that the agreement could be enforced as written,its earlier failure to seek to enforce its agreement did not reflect an intent to forego the right to seek arbitration in re cal.title ins.antitrust litigation,june,wl p rior to the ruling in concepcion,in the absence of a arbitration provision,class arbitration would not have been available.it therefore would indeed have been futile for defendants in this matter to have moved to compel arbitration prior to the decision in concepcion.accordingly,the court finds that plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden to demonstrate that defendants had an existing and therefore waivable right to compel arbitration.
appellants argue that wct had a right to challenge the correctness of existing law in good faith,and wct was thus required to challenge fisher immediately if it thought the case was wrongly decided.this argument is unavailing.fisher was directly on point.it involved the same type of claims and a nearly identical arbitration clause.as we have already noted,the trial court would have been bound to apply fisher.in appellants hypothetical,wct would have had to convince an appellate court that fisher was wrongly decided or distinguishable for some reason,and if it were successful,it likely would have had to defend against a petition for review in our supreme court.we decline to establish a rule that wct should have done everything possible to compel arbitration,no matter how futile,expensive,or protracted the process.
even if there was room for wct to challenge fisher,the futility doctrine may apply even when the authority barring enforcement of an arbitration agreement is not entirely clear or uncontradicted.in becker,supra,at page,at the time the plaintiffs initiated the lawsuit,the ninth circuit had only indicated its approval of the intertwining doctrine in dicta.at the time,two other federal circuits had acknowledged the intertwining doctrine.id.at.it was not until three years into the becker lawsuit that the ninth circuit squarely held the intertwining doctrine was applicable in the circuit.id.at.still,the court did not hold that the defendant should have immediately challenged the intertwining doctrine,even though there was arguably room for a good faith challenge.rather,the court held the defendant properly perceived it was futile to move to compel arbitration until the high court rejected the intertwining doctrine.ibid.
in sum,wct did not act inconsistently with the right to arbitrate by waiting until after concepcion to compel arbitration.moreover,it did not unreasonably delay moving.it informed the court and the parties of its intention to move,and did so move,shortly after concepcion.
wct participation in the litigation process did not result in waiver 
appellants argue that wct waived its right to arbitration by engaging in discovery and pretrial motions without any mention of arbitration for months.they rely on cases holding that defendants had waived their right to arbitration with similar conduct.lewis fletcher jones motor cars,th,lewis delay during which time the parties litigated multiple demurrers and motions to strike and engaged in discovery adolph coastal auto sales,th,adolph delay during which time defendant filed two demurrers,contested discovery requests,and engaged in efforts to schedule discovery guess,superior court th,guess delay during which time defendant moved for a stay,objected to written discovery,and participated in depositions sobremonte superior court th,sobremonte month delay during which time defendant filed two demurrers,and motion to transfer case to municipal court,participated in five hearings,and engaged in extensive discovery.
the critical distinction between those cases and this case is that there was no serious question regarding the enforceability of the arbitration agreements in those cases.lewis,supra,th at adolph,supra,th at guess,supra,th at sobremonte,supra,th at.the defendants thus did not have a reasonable justification for their delay in moving,and their unexcused delay suggested an attempt to game the system.see,guess,supra,at simply put,t he courtroom may not be used as a convenient vestibule to the arbitration hall so as to allow a party to create his own unique structure combining litigation and arbitration.it was the combination of that unjustified delay and the use of the litigation process that prompted these courts to find waiver.by contrast,here,wct had a reasonable justification for not moving immediately.it had no choice but to engage in the litigation process when its arbitration clause was unenforceable.see quevedo macy,supra,d at the defendant participated in the litigation and allowed important steps to take place only because it reasonably believed that it had no meaningful alternative given that its arbitration agreement was not enforceable as written.the court accordingly concludes that this factor also does not support a finding of waiver.
appellants have not shown prejudice 
mere participation in litigation and discovery without prejudice does not necessarily compel a finding of waiver.sobremonte,supra,th at.with this in mind,we turn to whether wct delay prejudiced appellants.under both california and federal law,the prejudice factor is critical in waiver determinations.agnes medical center,supra,cal th at.
california arbitration laws reflect a public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and inexpensive means of dispute resolution.agnes medical center,supra,cal th at.prejudice typically is found only where the petitioning party conduct has substantially undermined this important public policy or substantially impaired the other side ability to take advantage of the benefits and efficiencies of arbitration.for example,courts have found prejudice where the petitioning party used the judicial discovery processes to gain information about the other side case that could not have been gained in arbitration citations where a party unduly delayed and waited until the eve of trial to seek arbitration citation or where the lengthy nature of the delays associated with the petitioning party attempts to litigate resulted in lost evidence ibid.
but b ecause merely participating in litigation,by itself,does not result in a waiver,courts will not find prejudice where the party opposing arbitration shows only that it incurred court costs and legal expenses.agnes medical center,supra,cal th at.
here,we have already determined that wct did not unduly delay seeking arbitration,in light of the law holding that its arbitration clause was unenforceable.and there is certainly no evidence in the record that wct waited until the eve of trial to seek arbitration.further,appellants make no argument that the length of the delay in seeking arbitration resulted in lost evidence.
appellants instead argue that wct used the discovery process to gain information it could not have gained in arbitration.we are not persuaded.wct deposed both appellants,at which time the deponents also produced documents in response to wct documents requests.appellants contend the arbitration clause at issue does not provide for discovery and thus there is no guarantee of discovery.
although there is no guarantee of discovery in arbitration,neither have appellants shown that this discovery would not have happened in arbitration.it appears likely at least some of it would have occurred.the arbitration clause provides that appellants may choose the national arbitration forum naf,the american arbitration association aaa,or any other organization,subject to wct approval.the naf no longer arbitrates consumer disputes and we therefore do not consider its rules.carideo dell,no.jlr wl.at the very least,though,the aaa rules permit discovery of documents.madrigal new cingular wireless services,cv oww sms wl the aaa commercial arbitration rules specifically provide that the arbitrator,a t the request of any party or at the discretion of the arbitrator,may direct the production of documents and other information.moreover,if the parties were to agree on another forum of appellants choosing,such as jams,depositions could also be possible.cronin monex deposit,no.sacv doc wl jams rules require parties to exchange all relevant,nonprivileged documents,allow each side one deposition as of right,and permit either party to request additional depositions.
additionally,insofar as wct learned information in appellants depositions that it could not have gleaned in arbitration,appellants had an equal opportunity when they deposed wct person most knowledgeable.we hesitate to declare that this discovery was prejudicial or used for an unfair advantage when it was reciprocal.
appellants also contend that they were prejudiced because they lost an important remedy in the trial court,rescission,when the court granted wct motion to strike.appellants assert that,by waiting until after the ruling on rescission to compel arbitration,wct insulated the ruling from review,and they will forever lose any chance to regain their claim to rescission.we do not agree that this constituted prejudice.when parties have litigated the merits of arbitrable issues to judgment,that may constitute prejudice.agnes medical center,supra,cal th at.here,however,wct motion and the court ruling did not concern an arbitrable issue.wct moved to strike the portions of the complaint alleging classwide rescission.it based its argument entirely on the notion that rescission is unavailable as a classwide remedy.and as we have discussed,the arbitration is to be on an individual basis,not a classwide basis.the availability of classwide rescission is accordingly not an arbitrable issue.
in short,appellants carry the heavy burden of proving waiver.they have not done so.the cases on which appellants rely find prejudice and waiver when the defendants unduly delayed moving for arbitration without justification.wct had a reasonable justification for not moving immediately,and when that justification no longer existed,it moved almost without delay.wct can not be said to have intentionally undermined the speedy and efficient nature of arbitration when it reasonably determined arbitration was unavailable because the clause was unenforceable.moreover,appellants have not shown prejudice,a critical factor weighing against waiver in this case.
the arbitration clause is not unconscionable 
appellants maintain that the arbitration clause is unenforceable as unconscionable.see,subd.a if the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract.as a preliminary matter,wct urges a broad reading of concepcion and argues that the case precludes any unconscionability defense to the enforcement of an arbitration agreement,whether based on a waiver of class rights or not.we decline to hold that concepcion stands for this broad a proposition.concepcion itself recognizes that the faa saving clause preserves generally applicable contract defenses such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability.concepcion,supra.at,quoting.further,the california supreme court has not held that unconscionability is no longer a viable defense to enforcement of an arbitration agreement.rather,since concepcion,the court has found the faa applied in a construction defect dispute and proceeded to analyze whether the arbitration clause was unconscionable under california law,all without reference to concepcion.pinnacle,supra,cal th at.we therefore consider the merits of appellants unconscionability defense.
unconscionability has both procedural and substantive elements.citations.although both must appear for a court to invalidate a contract or one of its individual terms citations,they need not be present in the same degree t he more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.roman superior court th.

procedural unconscionability

evidence regarding circumstances of execution 
wct did not submit any declarations relating to the circumstances under which appellants executed the sales contract.appellants both submitted declarations stating as follows.when they signed the sales contract on both occasions,wct presented them with a stack of documents and told them where to sign or initial each one.all of the documents were preprinted forms.wct did not give them the opportunity to negotiate any of the terms,and it presented them to appellants on a basis.they felt rushed into signing the documents.neither appellants realized the sales contract had a second,back side with additional terms,which is where the arbitration clause appeared.when they signed the sales contract,wct did not ask them if they were willing to arbitrate any disputes,it did not tell them there was an arbitration clause on the back of the contract,and appellants did not see the arbitration clause before they signed.wct did not give them the option to sign a contract without an arbitration clause.at no point did wct give them the opportunity to use a computer to download any information about arbitration organizations,including their procedures or rules.prior to the filing of wct motion to compel arbitration,they did not understand the effect of the arbitration clause.

the contract is a single page,eight and a half inches wide and approximately inches long.the appellants signed or initialed the sales contract in eight places on the front.they did not sign or initial the contract on the back.the arbitration clause itself is on the backside of the contract.it appears in a area,centered on the page,and as noted in a foregoing part,contains the following heading in boldface,all capital letters arbitration clause please review important affects your legal rights.there are two other provisions on the back page that are,though these provisions appear in much smaller boxes than the arbitration clause.
ii.analysis 
the sales contract represented a degree of procedural unconscionability at the low end of the spectrum.it is undisputed that appellants did not have the opportunity to negotiate the terms of the contract and it was presented to them as a proposition.that it was a contract of adhesion establishes this low degree of procedural unconscionability.
but the degree is no higher than the low end of the spectrum because surprise is not present.first,arbitration is a common means of dispute resolution in this day and age and can not fairly be said to defeat the reasonable expectations of consumers.patterson itt consumer financial th,recognizing arbitration is within the reasonable expectation of most consumers.second,the clause can not fairly be described as hidden or inconspicuous within a prolix form.the contract itself is only one page with two sides.the form points out the existence of the arbitration clause on the front side in all capital letters,directly above the signature lines for the buyer and cobuyer.the arbitration clause is highlighted on the back in that it is outlined with a large box,by far the largest box of the three provisions on the page.the provision boldface,all capital heading further highlights it.and third,naasz admitted that she had a thorough opportunity to read the contract before signing it.her actual surprise did not render the arbitration clause procedurally unconscionable when she failed to take advantage of this opportunity.the general rule that a party can not avoid the terms of a contract because the party failed to read it before signing it applies even to adhesion contracts,when the provisions are conspicuous and clear and do not defeat the reasonable expectations of the parties.madden kaiser foundation hospitals,supra,cal d at.
substantive unconscionability 
given the low degree of procedural unconscionability,appellants were required to show a high degree of substantive unconscionability to render the clause unconscionable.appellants have not made this showing.the arbitration clause was not substantively unconscionable.
substantive unconscionability pertains to the fairness of an agreement actual terms and to assessments of whether they are overly harsh or.citations.a contract term is not substantively unconscionable when it merely gives one side a greater benefit rather,the term must be so as to shock the conscience.pinnacle,supra,cal th at.
even though a provision is unduly,it may not be unconscionable when the party who is imposing the provision offers a legitimate business justification for it.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th.a contract can provide a margin of safety that provides the party with superior bargaining strength a type of extra protection for which it has a legitimate commercial need without being unconscionable.id.at.u nless the business realities that create the special need for such an advantage are explained in the contract itself,they must be factually established.ibid.
appellants maintain that several individual provisions of the arbitration clause are substantively unconscionable.we address them seriatim.
requesting a new arbitration when outlier results occur or injunctive relief awarded 
the arbitration clause provides that t he arbitrator award shall be final and binding on all parties,except that in the event the arbitrator award for a party is or against a party is in excess of,or includes an award of injunctive relief against a party,that party may request a new arbitration under the rules of the arbitration organization by a panel.
appellants assert that this provision is unconscionable because the buyer will rarely benefit from it the dealership is the party more likely to be liable for an award over,and the dealership will be the primary party against whom injunctions are sought.in either of those cases,the dealership will be able to initiate a second round of arbitration.to begin with,appellants have not convinced us that wct is likely to often suffer an award of against it,given that classwide arbitration is not possible under the agreement.that is especially true in this case,when the amount being financed for appellants through the sales contract was only.even were appellants to recover the amount they paid for their alleged lemon,it is far from.it is thus not at all clear that wct would be able to frequently seek a new arbitration for awards over.assuming an award did exceed this amount,it is not so harsh as to shock the conscience that the dealership would be entitled to some review of exaggerated damages.see chin advanced fresh concepts franchise th,requirement of panel when damages claims exceeded was reasonably justifie d as providing a measure of protection against exaggerated damage claims.
additionally,appellants argument ignores the fact that a party who recovers nothing has the same right to a new arbitration.the party who recovers nothing could just as easily be the buyer as the dealership.permitting buyers to initiate a new arbitration when they lose,instead of making any such ruling final and binding,is a boon to buyers.generally parties do not,as a matter of right,get another shot at arbitration just because they lost.moreover,both parties will benefit from the finality of awards in their favor over and under.the provision for a new arbitration applies to extreme,outlier results on both ends of the spectrum that might adversely affect both buyer and dealership.
as for the right to a new arbitration when injunctive relief is awarded,assuming arguendo appellants are correct that the dealership is more likely to suffer an injunction than buyers,the dealership would be required to pay all the costs for the second arbitration as we discuss in the following subpart if it wanted to rearbitrate.appellants concern that this would lead to higher costs for buyers is relevant only to the extent that the arbitrators decided to reallocate costs for this second arbitration after a final determination,which is entirely speculative.appellants are also concerned that this right to a new arbitration would lead to delay in the arbitration process.but to the extent buyers win a prohibitory injunction against the dealership,such an injunction would not be delayed or stayed pending a new arbitration.food grocery bureau garfield cal d,prohibitory injunction,versus mandatory one,is and operation not stayed by appeal.
on the whole,this provision is facially neutral and gives each side
