class actions 
the panel reversed the district court order dismissing as untimely a class action alleging that china agritech,and its managers and directors violated the securities exchange act of,and remanded for further proceedings.
the panel explained that the district court invitation to file a complaint in a separate individual suit does not render the district court dismissal of the class action complaint.the panel also wrote that appellate jurisdiction is proper,notwithstanding that the plaintiffs did not wait for the district court to set forth its judgment in a separate document,because the district court order was a full adjudication of the issues that clearly evidenced its intention that the order be final.
the panel held that the plaintiffs class action is not time barred,where the plaintiffs were unnamed plaintiffs in two earlier class actions against many of the same defendants based on the same underlying events class action certification was denied in both cases the earlier actions were timely and under american pipe construction co utah,and crown,cork seal parker,the statute of limitations for the individual claims of class members in the earlier actions was tolled during the pendency of those actions.
the panel wrote that permitting future named plaintiffs,who were unnamed members in previously uncertified classes,to avail themselves of american pipe tolling would advance the policy objectives that led the supreme court to permit tolling in the first place.the panel wrote that to the degree that the panel conclusion may be thought likely to lead to abusive filing of repetitive class actions,the current legal system including fed.civ.and principles of preclusion and comity is adequate to respond to such a concern.
fletcher,circuit judge 
plaintiffs bring a class action alleging that china agritech,china agritech and its managers and directors violated the securities exchange act of exchange act.plaintiffs were unnamed plaintiffs in two earlier class actions against many of the same defendants based on the same underlying events.class action certification was denied in both cases.under american pipe construction co utah,and crown,cork seal parker,the statute of limitations was tolled during the pendency of these two suits for plaintiffs individual claims.there is thus no time bar preventing plaintiffs from bringing the present suit as joined individual claims rather than as a class action.the question before us is whether plaintiffs are from pursuing their suit as a class action.
for the reasons that follow,we hold that plaintiffs are not from bringing a class action.
background 
china agritech is a holding company incorporated in delaware with its principal place of business in beijing,china.the company claims to operate through various subsidiaries that manufacture and sell organic compound fertilizers and related products to farmers in chinese provinces.china agritech began listing its shares on the nasdaq stock exchange in.in a filing with the securities and exchange commission sec,china agritech reported a net revenue of million,which was triple the million in revenue it reported for.
on february,lm research,a market research company,published a report entitled china agritech a scam lm report.the report,written by individuals who held a short position in china agritech stock,asserted that china agritech was not a currently functioning business that was manufacturing products,but instead was simply a vehicle for transferring shareholder wealth from outside investors into the pockets of the founders and inside management.alleging idle factories,minimal investments,and fictitious contracts,the report concluded that china agritech had grossly inflated its revenue,failed to account for tens of millions of investor dollars,and had virtually no product in the market.upon release of the lm report,china agritech shares declined from per share on february,to per share on february.
china agritech denied the allegations in an letter to shareholders.on february,bronte capital,a hedge fund that also held a short position in china agritech,responded to china agritech letter in an article sarcastically titled,china agritech china amazing productivity levels bc article.the bc article contended that photos released by china agritech in its letter did not show the most basic equipment required for operations of the magnitude that china agritech claimed.for example,the pictures showed kg fertilizer bags being moved manually by individual human laborers rather than with forklifts,calling into question how a factory reported to manufacture tons of granular fertilizer annually could possibly operate as depicted.china agritech stock value declined to per share the next day.
on march,china agritech announced the formation of a special committee of its board of directors to investigate the allegations of fraud.the next day,china agritech dismissed its independent auditor,ernst young hua ming,and publicly disclosed that had insisted,in december,that the board commence an investigation of accounting problems it had previously identified.also on march,nasdaq halted trading in china agritech stock and initiated delisting proceedings.on october,the sec issued an enforcement order revoking the registration of china agritech stock.
ii.procedural history 
a.the dean action 
on february,theodore dean,on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated,filed a class action against china agritech and several of its managers and directors.see dean china agritech,case cal.the dean action.dean alleged that china agritech had materially misstated its net revenue and income for the third quarter in on its sec form filing,and had materially misstated its net revenue and income for fiscal years and in its sec form filing.the complaint was filed eight days after release of the lm report.the case was assigned to judge klausner in the central district of california.
on the same day that the dean action was filed,dean counsel notified china agritech shareholders of the class action through two global media platforms,business wire and globenewswire,inviting shareholders to come forward and serve as lead plaintiff.he repeated the notification a week later.see a a i.on april,pursuant to a b of the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,a b iii i,six shareholders sought appointment as lead plaintiff and approval of lead counsel.on may,the district court denied without prejudice these motions as premature.
on june,dean filed an amended complaint with four additional named plaintiffs and two additional defendants.the amended dean action alleged claims for violations of section b of the exchange act and sec rule by china agritech and all individual defendants section a of the exchange act by the individual defendants section of the securities act of securities act by all defendants and section of the securities act by the individual defendants.on october,the district court granted china agritech motion to dismiss the dean plaintiffs securities act claims but denied its motion to dismiss the exchange act claims.
on january,the dean plaintiffs moved for class certification on behalf of all persons or entities that had acquired china agritech stock between november,and march.on may,the district court denied their motion.the court concluded that although the dean plaintiffs had satisfied all four requirements of rule a,they failed to establish the predominance requirement of rule b.reliance is a required element for section b securities fraud cases.the district court found that individual issues predominated because the dean plaintiffs had failed to establish a presumption of reliance.a theory requires a showing of market efficiency,which,in the view of the district court,plaintiffs had not made.the court therefore held that plaintiffs had to establish individualized reliance to support their claims.
the dean plaintiffs appealed the denial of certification under rule f.on august,we affirmed.see dean china agritech,case cir,dkt.the dean plaintiffs continued litigating their cases as individuals.they settled their individual claims on september.based on the settlement,their individual claims were dismissed with prejudice on september.
b.the smyth action 
on october,three weeks after the dean action settled,kevin smyth filed an almost identical complaint on behalf of the same class against china agritech in federal district court for the district of delaware.see smyth chang,case the smyth action.the smyth and dean action complaints differed only in that the smyth action alleged solely exchange act violations and did not name several of the defendants that had been named in the dean action.the smyth action was filed one year and eight months after the lm report was published.
on december,following notification of the smyth action on business wire,pursuant to the pslra,eight shareholders sought appointment as lead plaintiff and approval of their selection of lead counsel.the smyth action was subsequently transferred to the central district of california,where it was deemed related to the dean action and assigned to judge klausner case cal.on july,plaintiffs in the smyth action filed an amended complaint with several additional named plaintiffs.on august,the smyth plaintiffs moved for class certification.
on september,the district court denied the motion.the court found that the smyth plaintiffs personal claims failed the typicality requirement of rule a because their prior relationship with named plaintiffs in the dean action subjected them to a claim preclusion defense that was not available against unnamed class members.the court further held that the smyth plaintiffs and their counsel failed to meet the adequate representation requirement of rule a.the court noted that plaintiffs had failed to modify their lead plaintiff certifications that had been signed months earlier in connection with the dean action,and had served only one defendant ten months after filing smyth.
on january,the parties to the smyth action agreed to dismiss the action with prejudice as to the named plaintiffs.
c.the resh action 
on june,michael resh filed a class action against china agritech and several individual defendants the resh action.on september,resh filed an amended complaint with several additional named plaintiffs.the resh plaintiffs alleged violations of sections b and a of the exchange act based on the same facts and circumstances,and on behalf of the same class,as in the dean and smyth actions.the case was assigned,like the others,to judge klausner.
on september,the cagc investor group,comprised of investors in china agritech william schoenke,heroca holding,and ninella beheer filed a motion for appointment as lead plaintiff and for approval of its selection of counsel for the proposed class.on september,china agritech and one of the individual defendants,charles law,filed motions to dismiss the complaint on the theory that the resh plaintiffs class action was under the exchange act statute of limitations.on october,the district court denied without prejudice the cagc investor group motion,deferring consideration until consideration of class certification october order.
on december,the district court granted china agritech and defendant law motions to dismiss without leave to amend december order.plaintiffs had argued that their class action was timely because american pipe tolled the statute of limitations during the pendency of the dean and the smyth actions.with tolling,of the days that had elapsed since the release of the lm report were subtracted,meaning that only days counted towards the statute of limitations.the district court disagreed.it concluded that while the supreme court in american pipe and crown,cork seal held that the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class,and that a class member may therefore file a separate individual action prior to the expiration of his or her own limitations period,the supreme court had not yet determined whether american pipe allowed tolling for an entirely new class action based upon a substantially identical class.relying principally on robbin fluor,cir,and catholic social services,ins,cir.en banc,the district court concluded that the statute of limitations was tolled for the individual claims of the named plaintiffs in the resh action,but was not tolled for plaintiffs class action.in the view of the district court,a contrary ruling would allow tolling to extend indefinitely as class action plaintiffs repeatedly attempt to demonstrate suitability for class certification on the basis of different expert testimony other evidence.
on december,the resh plaintiffs sought reconsideration,arguing that the court had denied class certification in the dean and smyth actions due to issues related to the lead plaintiffs suitability as class representatives rather than the claims suitability for class treatment.on january,the district court dismissed the remaining defendants january order.on february,it denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration february order,explaining that plaintiffs class action claims were regardless of the grounds on which class certification was denied in the two earlier actions.
the resh plaintiffs appealed,challenging the district court october,december,january,and february orders.
iii.standard of review 
we review de novo a district court order dismissing a suit on statute of limitations grounds.sharkey,cir.
iv.jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction under.defendants argue that the orders are not appealable final orders because the district court indicated that plaintiffs individual claims could proceed.we disagree.the district court stated,plaintiffs are not prevented from filing a complaint asserting individual,rather than class action,claims if they so choose.however,this statement did not affect the finality of the court dismissal without leave to amend of the class action complaint that plaintiffs had filed.an invitation to file a complaint in a separate individual suit does not render the district court dismissal.
defendants also assert that under federal rule of appellate procedure frap a a ii,plaintiffs were required to wait days after the district court december and february orders before they appealed because the district court judgment had not been set forth in a separate document,as required under federal rule of civil procedure rule a.however,under frap a b,a failure to set forth a judgment or order on a separate document when required by rule a does not affect the validity of an appeal from that judgment or order.n either the supreme court nor this court views satisfaction of rule as a prerequisite to appeal.kirkland legion ins,cir.because the district court order was a full adjudication of the issues that clearly evidenced its intention that the order be final,appellate jurisdiction is proper.see distrib.agency nationwide mut.ins,cir.
discussion 
we must decide whether the class action brought by the resh plaintiffs is.it is undisputed that the earlier dean and smyth actions were timely.it is also undisputed that,under american pipe and crown,cork seal,the statute of limitations for the individual claims of class members in the dean and smyth actions was tolled during the pendency of both of those actions.that is,there is no time bar to individual claims brought by plaintiffs who were unnamed class members in the dean and smyth actions,whether brought as separate or joined claims.the question before us is whether plaintiffs class action,based on those same claims,is.
american pipe and crown,cork seal 
the supreme court has twice addressed tolling issues arising out of the dismissal of a class action when no class has been certified.in american pipe construction utah,the court held that unnamed members of an uncertified class could intervene as individual plaintiffs in the individual suit that remained even if the statutory limitations period had passed.id.at.according to the court,the commencement of the original class suit tolls the running of the statute of limitations for all purported members of the class who make timely motions to intervene after the court has found the suit inappropriate for class action status.id.at.the court characterized its tolling rule
