this appeal requires us to decide whether yield spread premiums,which are fees paid by mortgage lenders to mortgage brokers that are based on the difference between the interest rate at which the broker originates the loan and the par,or market rate offered by the lender,are lawful under the real estate settlement procedures act respa,et.west.respa prohibits the giving or receiving of fees for referral as part of a real estate settlement service but permits fees that are paid for facilities actually furnished or services actually performed in the making of a loan.respa,a,c a,c.
bettina scheutz obtained a federally related mortgage loan from banc one mortgage corporation through a mortgage broker,home mortgage financial corporation.she paid home mortgage direct fees and banc one paid it a yield spread premium.she brought a class action challenging the yield spread premium payment as contrary to a.
we do not write on a clean slate in deciding whether the yield spread premium was a referral,because the department of housing and urban development hud,which is charged with enforcing respa,has prescribed a test for determining the propriety of a yield spread premium payment.it asks whether services were actually performed for the total compensation paid to the mortgage broker,and whether that compensation is reasonably related to the services provided.the district court deferred to this test,correctly we believe,and declined to certify a class of borrowers for lack of a common question of fact.it then granted summary judgment in favor of banc one on scheutz claim that its payment of the yield spread premium was really for a referral of business by home mortgage.the court concluded that the broker performed services that contributed to the transaction,and that home mortgage total compensation of which the yield spread premium was a part was reasonably related to the services provided.we agree with these rulings.
as we have jurisdiction,we affirm.
when schuetz found a house that she wanted to buy in the sun lakes country club development in sun lakes,arizona,she hired home mortgage financial corporation,a mortgage broker,to arrange a loan.mortgage brokers are intermediaries who bring borrower and lender together.borrowers typically approach the mortgage settlement process with a variety of individual characteristics and needs,including their credit rating,income,sensitivity to interest rate variations,and preference for paying charges up front or spreading them out in the form of a higher interest rate.brokers furnish numerous services to consumers in schuetz case,home mortgage analyzed her income and debt,explained the loan process and loan products available to her,collected her financial information,obtained a credit report on her behalf,secured an appraisal,prepared her loan package,and submitted it to banc one.mortgage brokers are compensated in several ways for their services.compensation from the borrower to the broker is a direct fee,while money that the borrower pays the lender and the lender pays the broker is an indirect fee.because lending institutions such as banc one offer intermediaries options in structuring their compensation,brokers in effect determine their own compensation for any particular transaction by choosing the combination of loan characteristics and prices to offer a consumer.
a broker selects a loan product from among the various loans offered by the lending institutions with which it maintains a relationship.according to home mortgage,loans are selected based on the lender service,turnaround time,ability to make the required funds available,reputation in the community,level of professionalism,reputation with the banking department,competitive rates,underwriting flexibility,and the availability of products.
home mortgage obtained schuetz a loan in the principal amount of with a interest rate from banc one,which is a wholesale lender.this was above banc one par rate.par rate refers to the rate at which the lender will fund of a loan with no premiums or discounts to the broker.for each loan product,banc one estimates the secondary market value of a model loan and derives a par price taking into account its own costs and return requirements that it uses in developing rate sheets for brokers.if the interest rate on a particular loan exceeds the rate assumed by banc one par price model,banc one will pay the broker a yield spread premium equal to the value of the additional interest.
a yield spread premium,or ysp,is a lump sum paid by a lender to a broker at closing when the loan originated by the broker bears an interest rate.as hud has explained it 
payments to brokers by lenders,characterized as yield spread premiums,are based on the interest rate and points of the loan entered into as compared to the par rate offered by the lender to the mortgage broker for that particular loan,a loan of and no points where the par rate is will command a greater premium for the broker than a loan with a par rate of and no points.in determining the price of a loan,mortgage brokers rely on rate quotes issued by lenders,sometimes several times a day.when a lender agrees to purchase a loan from a broker,the broker receives the then applicable pricing for the loan based on the difference between the rate reflected in the rate quote and the rate of the loan entered into by the borrower 
lender payments to mortgage brokers may reduce the costs to consumers.this allows consumers to obtain loans without paying direct fees themselves.where a broker is not compensated by the consumer through a direct fee,or is partially compensated through a direct fee,the interest rate of the loan is increased to compensate the broker or the fee is added to principal.in any of the compensation methods described,all costs are ultimately paid by the consumer,whether through direct fees or through the interest rate.
statement of policy.at footnotes omitted.
in this case,schuetz paid her broker direct fees of,consisting of for loan origination,for loan discount,and for processing.banc one also paid home mortgage a yield spread premium of.this payment was identified on schuetz settlement statement as mortgage broker fee to home mortgage from banc one.
scheutz sued banc one on behalf of a class of borrowers whose loan settlements included a yield spread premium payment,claiming that the ysp violates respa because it is a kickback for referral of a federally related mortgage loan she sought class certification,which the district court denied.it concluded that the issue on which this litigation would turn is whether the yield spread premiums paid by banc one are compensation for facilities or services actually performed,and decided that this issue was too fact intensive to be resolved on a basis.we declined to take an interlocutory appeal from the order denying certification.
for summary judgment resulted in judgment for banc one.the district court held that hud statement of policy guided the outcome because congress authorized hud to promulgate rules and regulations to implement respa,and to interpret the statute.applying hud test for legality of yield spread premium payments,the court found it undisputed that compensable services were performed by home mortgage and that they were worth what the broker was paid.accordingly,the court concluded that no respa violation occurred.
schuetz appeals both orders.
in a nutshell,schuetz contends that the direct fees which she paid fully compensated home mortgage for the services it performed and that the yield spread premium paid by banc one,which was not tied in exchange particular services,is necessarily a fee for referral.in her view,hud and the district court got the liability test wrong,and the eleventh circuit got it right in culpepper irwin mortgage,cir.banc one counters that hud test is binding and that courts must defer to it.
the backdrop is cumbersome but important.
congress enacted respa in to protect home buyers from inflated prices in the home purchasing process.it sought to increase the supply of information available to mortgage consumers about the cost of home loans in advance of settlement,and to eliminate abusive practices such as kickbacks,referral fees,and unearned fees.to accomplish the first purpose,the act requires lenders to provide borrowers with a statement identifying all settlement charges on a standardized form,commonly known as a,west,and with an information booklet prepared by hud that counsels borrowers on how mortgage transactions work and how to recognize inflated charges.id.at.
sections a and c are the provisions primarily at issue in this case.section a prohibits fees for referrals.it provides no person shall give and no person shall accept any fee,kickback,or thing of value pursuant to any agreement or understanding,oral or otherwise,that business incident to or a part of a real estate settlement service involving a federally related mortgage loan shall be referred to any person.a.section c provides nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the payment to any person of a bona fide salary or compensation or other payment for goods or facilities actually furnished or for services actually performed id.c.
hud is the administrative agency charged with enforcing respa.it is authorized by statute to prescribe rules and regulations,and to make interpretations of respa.a.hud has issued regulations pursuant to this authority.see regulation x,et.section pertains to kickbacks and unearned fees that are prohibited by of the statute.this regulation proscribes referral fees,b and defines a referral as any oral or written action which has the effect of affirmatively influencing the selection by any person of a provider of a settlement service or business incident to or part of a settlement service when such person will pay for such settlement service or business incident thereto or pay a charge attributable in whole or in part to such settlement service or business.id.at f.the regulations also implement c of the act by providing that a payment to any person of a bona fide salary or compensation or other payment for goods or facilities actually furnished or for services actually performed is permissible.id.at g iv.
sections a and c of respa generated a considerable amount of litigation.in light of the legal uncertainty about lender payments to mortgage brokers for services performed,congress directed hud to address the issue within days of october,the date on which the department appropriations bill was enacted.see conference report on the departments of veterans affairs and housing and urban development,and independent agencies appropriations act,conf,reprinted in.
meanwhile,the eleventh circuit court of appeals rendered its first opinion in the culpepper litigation.culpepper inland mortgage culpepper i,cir.the culpeppers had obtained a federally insured home mortgage from inland mortgage corporation through their mortgage broker at an interest rate of.unbeknownst to them,this was over inland par rate and carried a yield spread premium of even though inland would have made the same loan at with a ysp of only.they challenged the yield spread premium on the footing that it was not tied to services but to the size and interest rate of their loan.the court agreed that the only service for which the ysp was compensation was the service of referring an above par loan to the lender,which respa does not permit 
hud issued a statement of policy march,after consulting industry groups,federal agencies,consumer groups and other interested parties.statement of policy.at.the heart of hud position is that lender payments to mortgage brokers are not illegal per se yield spread premium payments may be legal or illegal in individual cases or classes of transactions.id.accordingly,the policy statement prescribes the following test 
in determining whether a payment from a lender to a mortgage broker is permissible under section of respa,the first question is whether goods or facilities were actually furnished or services were actually performed for the compensation paid.the fact that goods or facilities have been actually furnished or that services have been actually performed by the mortgage broker does not by itself make the payment legal.the second question is whether the payments are reasonably related to the value of the goods or facilities that were actually furnished or services that were actually performed.
in applying this test,hud believes that total compensation should be scrutinized to assure that it is reasonably related to goods,facilities,or services furnished or performed to determine whether it is legal under respa.total compensation to a broker includes direct origination and other fees paid by the borrower,indirect fees,including those that are derived from the interest rate paid by the borrower,or a combination of some or all.the department considers that higher interest rates alone can not justify higher total fees to mortgage brokers.all fees will be scrutinized as part of total compensation to determine that total compensation is reasonably related to the goods or facilities actually furnished or services actually performed.hud believes that total compensation should be carefully considered in relation to price structures and practices in similar transactions and in similar markets.
after hud policy statement was issued,inland by then known as irwin appealed certification of a class of borrowers on whose loans it had paid a yield spread premium to the mortgage broker.culpepper irwin mortgage culpepper iii,cir.irwin argued that the policy statement overruled culpepper i interpretation of a.the court rejected that argument,as well as the lender contention that the legality of a ysp payment could only be determined loan transaction by loan transaction.it held that the test for liability is not whether the broker performed some services,but whether the ysp is payment for those services.otherwise,the policy statement requirement that payment be for compensation paid would not be met the result would be inconsistent with c because the preposition for connotes an exchange and the word fee implies a exchange to be within c and it would permit payments under the guise of c that a plainly prohibits.
hud then issued another statement of policy to eliminate any ambiguity concerning the department position with respect to those lender payments to mortgage brokers characterized as yield spread premiums as a result of questions raised by culpepper irwin mortgage real estate settlement procedures act statement of policy clarification of statement of policy regarding lender payments to mortgage brokers,and guidance concerning unearned fees under section b.october.the statement explicitly rejects culpepper interpretation,and reiterates the position taken in the yield spread premiums are not per se legal or illegal and that this turns on meeting the requirements of its test.
the statement indicates that under the first prong,it is necessary to look at each transaction individually,including examining all of the goods or facilities provided or services performed by the broker in the transaction,whether the goods,facilities or services are paid for by the borrower,the lender,or partly by both.id.at.it further states that a yield spread premium may not be presumed to be a referral fee based solely on the fact that the lender makes such a payment to a broker.id.the statement notes that yield spread premiums are by definition derived from the interest rate and that this,by itself,does not indicate whether a particular ysp is a payment for facilities actually furnished or services actually performed.id.hud also makes clear that the first part of its test does not contemplate identifying or allocating which facilities,goods or services are performed for the lender or for the borrower as all of them inure to the benefit of both.id.in addition,the statement advises that the list of services provided in the statement,while not exhaustive,is still accurate,and that compensation for them may be paid either by the borrower or the lender or partly by both.however,c ompensable services for the first part of the test do not include referrals or no,nominal,or duplicative work.id.
the statement essentially repeats the considerations that hud set out in the statement for resolving the second,or reasonableness,part of the test.in sum,the pivotal question is whether a mortgage broker total compensation is reasonable.total compensation includes fees paid by a borrower and any yield spread premium paid by a lender,not simply the yield spread premium alone.id.total compensation to the broker must be reasonably related to the total value of goods or facilities provided or services performed simply delivering a loan with a higher interest rate is not a compensable service.id.and payments must be commensurate with the amount normally charged for similar services in similar transactions in similar markets.id.
finally,by way of background,the district court in this case rejected culpepper interpretation and granted deference to hud policy statement.the clarification was not issued until after briefing had begun on appeal.however,we have heard from both parties on its impact and turn now to their arguments.
schuetz urges us not to defer for a number of reasons.as she sees it,hud liability test permits what the statute prohibits by necessarily including the illegal referral fee in the reasonableness of total compensation analysis.in addition,the hud test was adopted without notice and comment rulemaking,and a mere policy statement can not have the same force and effect.beyond this,in schuetz view,hud rewrote c by eliminating the words for and actually for goods or facilities actually furnished or for services actually performed in clarifying that total compensation should be reasonably related to the goods,facilities or services furnished or performed.she posits that this also makes the statement inconsistent with the regulations,the statement,and with opinion letters sent by hud general counsel in to congressman bruce vento and senator richard shelby which indicated that the facilities or services must have been performed in exchange for compensation paid to the broker.similarly,schuetz submits,hud clarification is internally inconsistent in its application of c language in that for purposes of a it adopts a total test but requires a quid pro quo showing for purposes of b prohibition on splitting fees.policy statement.at.finally,she maintains that hud lacked authority to correct the eleventh circuit interpretation of a federal statute that is,in any event,not ambiguous.
we are not persuaded.first,chevron deference is due even though hud policy statements are not the result of formal rulemaking or adjudication.t he fact that the agency previously reached its interpretation through means less formal than notice and comment rulemaking does not automatically deprive that interpretation of the judicial deference otherwise its due.barnhart walton,d united states mead,d t he want of that procedure does not decide the case,for we have sometimes found reasons for chevron deference even when no such administrative formality was required and none was afforded.here,respa authorizes hud to interpret the statute,a,and hud regulations indicate that a statement of policy published in the federal register constitutes a rule,regulation or interpretation for purposes of respa.a ii.both policy statements are published in the federal register.nothing suggests that the more formal process of notice and comment was for any reason other than congress directive to issue the statement of policy within days.indeed,both policy statements comport with congressional intent to provide a safe harbor for good faith compliance with hud rules,regulations,and interpretations.a,b.schuetz relies on christensen harris county,d,in which an informal opinion letter failed to pass muster,but hud policy statements are different because congress authorized the department to interpret respa,hud has responsibility for enforcing the statute,and it has expertise in the home mortgage lending industry.see barnhart,at,d.
we must first determine whether the language of c unambiguously forbids hud interpretation.barnhart,at,d.it does not.schuetz argument is premised on the assumption that payment for can only be interpreted as protecting payments offered in exchange for services rendered.this language,however,is equally capable of supporting hud interpretation,which would read c as protecting payments used as compensation for services performed.therefore,we turn to the question of whether the interpretation for other reasons,exceeds the bounds of the permissible.id.whether or not hud interpretation is preferable,we can not say that it is impermissible.the eighth circuit has recently so held,and we agree with its reasoning.glover standard federal bank,wl,cir.march,
the hud test focuses on whether compensable services of the sort identified in the statement are provided,and if they are,then on whether the total compensation without regard to whether it comes from the borrower,the lender,or both is reasonably related to the services provided.this is consistent with the general intent of congress in enacting respa,which is to foster home ownership.by allowing lenders to pay mortgage brokers yield spread premiums,prospective homeowners with a dearth of cash at the time of settlement can front less money and pay for some of their mortgage broker services over time.nor is hud test inconsistent with the prohibition on fees for referral can reasonably be construed as only prohibiting payments that are for nothing else than the referral of business.hud test prevents this,too,for the first prong requires actual performance of compensable services.by the same token,the second prong requires that the total compensation,including the ysp if it is a component,be in the ball park.if it is,then regardless of whether there is a ysp or the ysp is high or low,an illegal referral may be inferred.
neither is the statement inconsistent with hud prior communications.it carries forward the same principles articulated in the statement,and we do not read the statement as backing off the position that services must still actually have been performed for the compensation paid.likewise,we do not see any conflict between the regulations and the policy statement.schuetz contends that e,which describes how an agreement or understanding for referral of business can be proved,adopts a different test for proving liability,but we do not agree.that section pertains to one element of a but does not say anything about c or its intersection with a.similarly,no fatal inconsistency exists on account of two informal letters that hud general counsel sent to members of congress regardless of how their language may be construed,they are not binding nor may they be relied upon in any event.see a smiley citibank,d.
hud statement of policy is not internally inconsistent by virtue of how it treats the same language in c for purposes of a and b.the statement explains that b prohibits any fee in excess of the reasonable value of goods and services provided or the services actually performed.at.regardless,to the extent that there is any difference in treatment,a and b contain distinct prohibitions.section a relates to referrals and b to.whereas a yield spread premium involves compensation from lender and borrower for loan origination,the charges that b addresses involve a single payment split among settlement service providers.
finally,hud has not exceeded its area of expertise.congress asked for its policy on the legality of yield spread premium payments.the policy statement and its clarification in respond to that query,concern administration of real estate settlement that is clearly within hud province,and interpret a complex statute that hud enforces.
for these reasons,we agree with the district court that deference is due the hud policy statements.
having resolved that the test contained in hud statement of policy provides the appropriate standard of liability for yield spread premiums under respa,we apply that test to schuetz case.with respect to the first prong,there is substantial evidence that schuetz mortgage broker provided her a host of compensable goods,facilities,and services.there is no evidence to the contrary.under the second prong,the record demonstrates that home financial offered sch
