the act forbids federal courts from granting injunctions to stay proceedings in a state court,with three exceptions.one of the exceptions permits a federal court to enjoin state proceedings when necessary to protect or effectuate its judgments.the scope of this relitigation exception is the central issue in this case.
walter thomas cites the act as the reason why the district court erred in issuing an injunction barring him and his from prosecuting a lawsuit in the superior court for the district of columbia.we shall assume,without deciding,that the district of columbia is a state within meaning.a lawsuit thomas and others brought in the superior court complains about the performance of their attorneys in a class action filed in the united states district court for the district of columbia in.much of the history is recounted in thomas albright.the federal action began when thomas and another plaintiff filed a complaint in district court seeking certification as a class action and alleging that the department of state discriminated against black foreign service officers.see id.at.after six years of discovery,an amended complaint allowing additional individuals to intervene,the addition of still more class representatives and lengthy settlement negotiations,attorneys for parties signed a consent decree resolving the case and agreeing that the district court should certify the class and approve the settlement pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.see thomas,at.by this point,however,the relationship between class counsel and thomas and several other class representatives had frayed.
at a hearing on january,thomas complained at length that several of the named class action plaintiffs had neither been informed of,nor agreed with the impending settlement.one month earlier,in december,thomas had retained another represent his interests.on march,the district court held a preliminary fairness hearing.the new attorney representing thomas and allen latimer a in the superior court action argued that because her clients disagreed with parts of the proposed settlement,the court could and should modify it.an attorney representing odie fields,mary cynthia smoot,and alfred neal the remaining coplaintiffs in the superior court action argued against the consent decree and urged the district court to reject it.thomas personally asked the court not to give preliminary approval to the proposed settlement.despite thomas plea,the court tentatively approved the settlement and ordered notice to be given to the putative class members,of which wrote to the court supporting the settlement,while wrote in opposition to it.see thomas,at.on july and,the court held an additional fairness hearing.attorneys for thomas and other class members again urged the court to modify or to reject the settlement.
in its final judgment,the district court concluded that the settlement was fair and reasonable,but the court added a provision permitting nine class members to opt out of the settlement.see id.on appeal,we held that the district court had abused its discretion in allowing these class members to opt out.we also concluded that the overall class settlement was fair.see id.at.five of the class members then sued the class counsel for professional negligence in the superior court of the district of columbia.on a motion by the class counsel defendants,the district court enjoined these class members from pursuing their suit.see thomas albright,d.
thomas and his think the act barred the injunction and that the relitigation exception does not apply.the exception rests on the idea that federal courts should not be forced to rely on state court application of res judicata or estoppel principles to protect federal court judgments and decrees.see chick kam choo exxon,d toucey new york life ins.reed,dissenting.although the in the superior court action case were not parties to the concluded federal action,traditional preclusion principles may nonetheless bar thomas and his coplaintiffs from prosecuting that action against them.see parklane hosiery shore,d ethnic employees of the library of congress boorstin,restatement second of judgments.the doctrine of collateral estoppel,or as it is now commonly called issue preclusion,see restatement,supra,at,provides that once an issue is actually and necessarily determined by a court of competent jurisdiction,that determination is conclusive in subsequent suits based on a different cause of action involving a party to the prior litigation.montana united states,d see mclaughlin bradlee,otherson department of justice.the relitigation exception to the act therefore permits federal courts to enjoin state court adjudication of those claims or issues that actually have been decided by the federal court.chick kam choo exxon,at.
even if a federal court had not decided all the issues raised in the state court action,the relitigation exception could still apply.assume,for instance,that issues not decided in the federal action would be resolved in plaintiff favor in the state court.if the plaintiff still could not prevail because an essential element of his state cause of action had already been determined against him in the federal suit,the relitigation exception would permit an injunction against the state proceedings.see,next level communications dsc communications,cir enjoining entire state court action where state court would be required to decide issues already litigated in federal court see also united states district of columbia,finding that relitigation exception permits federal courts to enjoin state proceedings that raise a different cause of action,but still threaten judgment in federal proceeding.in this case,we must therefore compare the complaint in the superior court to the record in the class action in order to determine whether,in order for the plaintiff to succeed in superior court,that court will have to rule upon an issue or claim already decided by the federal district court or the court of appeals.see chick kam choo,at.
in their superior court complaint,thomas and his coplaintiffs alleged the following 
the class action attorneys breached a duty of undivided loyalty to thomas by selling out and betraying the plaintiffs when they entered into a secret agreement to settle the case without seeking thomas approval first.see complaint for professional negligence,thomas akin,gump,strauss,hauer feld.filed,see also id,making same allegations for thomas.
the class action attorneys failed to disclose the alleged conflict of interest created by acting as class counsel and failed to inform thomas of the negotiating position they would take with the state department.see id.see also id,making same allegations for thomas.
the class action attorneys failed to follow thomas express instructions regarding the certification of the class action as a rule b,which would have provided for him to of the class in order to receive his full measure of damages id.see also id,making same allegation for thomas.
thomas and his claimed that because of these alleged breaches of duty,they lost their federal cause of action and the potential damages they might have derived from it.see id.see also id,making same allegations for thomas.they also alleged that they suffered damages by having to retain separate counsel and spend additional time and money dealing with the federal lawsuit.see id.
as to the first two of these claims there can be no doubt that the district court injunction falls within the exception to the act.before approving the class action settlement,the district court performed its duty of determining whether the settlement is fair,adequate,and reasonable and is not the product of collusion between the parties.pigford glickman,internal quotations omitted.the court found that the settlement was clearly negotiated at arm length and presents no danger of collusion between the parties.see thomas christopher.the court further found that class counsel fairly and adequately protected the interests of the class.id.while the superior court complaint alleges that the class action attorneys sold out their clients,that they engaged in collusive secret n
