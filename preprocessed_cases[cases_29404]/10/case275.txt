on july,fred spagnola and his wife purchased a chubb masterpiece homeowner policy the policy provided dwelling coverage of,contents coverage of,and liability coverage of.
the masterpiece policy allows the insured to select one of three types of coverage extended replacement cost,verified replacement cost,or conditional replacement cost.spagnola purchased the extended replacement coverage,which,in the event of an insurable loss,pays the cost of reconstruction even if that cost exceeds the stated coverage of the policy the policy defines reconstruction cost as the amount required at the time of loss to repair or rebuild the house whichever is less,at the same location,with the same quality of materials and workmanship which existed before the loss.
the amount of coverage was listed in the policy coverage summary and during each annual policy period,chubb indicated that the coverage amount 
will be increased daily to reflect the current effect of inflation.at the time of a covered loss,your amount of house coverage will include any increase in the united states consumer price index from the beginning of the policy period.
the coverage amount could be changed 
with your consent,we may change the amount of coverage reflected in the coverage summary when appraisals are conducted and when the policy is renewed,to reflect current costs and values.
the term costs and values is not further defined in the policy.spagnola policy originally had a one year policy period.chubb,however,was obligated to renew the policy for three years and could decline to renew the policy only on grounds for which chubb could cancel it.the policy also contained a conditional renewal provision.under this provision,if chubb had grounds to cancel or refuse to renew the policy,it could instead make continued coverage conditional on a change in policy limits or on eliminating any coverage not required by law.
as far as renewing coverage,the policy stated that at the time of renewal,chubb may offer to renew the policy,at the premiums and under the policy provisions in effect at the date of renewal by mailing the insured a bill for the premium along with any changes in the policy provisions or amounts of coverage.if spagnola did not pay the new premium,the policy would automatically terminate at the end of the current policy period.failure to pay the required renewal premium when due shall mean that you have not accepted our offer.
over the next five years,chubb annually increased spagnola coverage and likewise his premiums.the coverage amount for house and contents was increased each year by approximately ten percent,well in excess of the consumer price index cpi.chubb sent the annual premium summary renewals with the bill for the next year coverage describing it as an annual premium savings.in,spagnola discovered that the increases in his premiums had risen faster than the cpi and he filed suit on behalf of a putative class,in state court,later removed to federal court,claiming that chubb breached the terms of the policy and violated new york insurance law by improperly increasing coverage and premiums without his consent and in excess of the cpi.in addition,spagnola brought an unjust enrichment claim as well as a deceptive business practices claim under new york general business law.chubb responded by filing a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b.
the district court granted chubb motion to dismiss all claims.first,the court held that the complaint failed to state a claim under new york insurance law because the coverage adjustments at issue were properly made pursuant to a mechanism established in the policy.the court concluded that the policy established that the premium increases were tied to current costs and values.the court concluded that the original policy notified spagnola that chubb had the right to increase coverage and premiums annually and that spagnola payment of the annual premium bill reflected spagnola consent to each such increase.the court also dismissed the breach of contract claim,both because the contract terms upon which spagnola relied did not exist,and because the breach of contract claim was barred by the voluntary payment doctrine.finally,the court dismissed the deceptive business practices claim under new york law,holding that there were not sufficient facts to support a finding that the policy was misleading in a material respect or that spagnola or any other member of the putative class was injured as a result.spagnola now appeals 
we review a rule b order of dismissal de novo.amron morgan stanley inv.advisors,cir.in reviewing such an order,we take all factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor to decide whether the plaintiff has pled a plausible claim for relief.see ashcroft iqbal,d citing bell atl.twombly,d.
spagnola first argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claim under new york insurance law section restricts when and how an insurer may condition renewal or changes of limits or elimination of coverage.with respect to a personal lines insurance policy,such as this one,e provides n o notice of nonrenewal or conditional renewal of a covered policy shall be issued to become effective during the required policy period unless it is based upon a ground for which the policy could have been cancelled.ins.law e.the statute defines required policy period in this instance as a period of three years from the date as of which a covered policy is first issued or is voluntarily renewed.id.at a.spagnola contends that,if chubb wanted to change the limits of the policy,it was obligated under d to issue a conditional notice that provided the specific reason or reasons for the changes.id.at d.since chubb did not follow the notice requirement of d,spagnola contends that any unilateral increases by chubb violated the statute.
spagnola argument is essentially twofold.first he argues that under the protections of he was entitled to three years of continuous coverage unless he failed to pay the premiums due under the policy.see ins.law a.he goes on to assert that chubb could only increase his premiums and coverage during the period by providing the required notice and statement of reasons required by d.spagnola concedes that under an insurer may increase coverage limits and premiums during the required policy period if the policy itself provides for an automatic increase or a mechanism to determine the increase,such as a predetermined figure or the cpi.spagnola argues,however,that bars the increases chubb imposed because the policy did not provide for an automatic increase or specify a mechanism by which the increase could be measured.spagnola alleges that the policy provision permitting a change in the amount of coverage when the policy renewed to reflect current costs and values is not a mechanism by which the increase could be measured because the insured can not look to the policy itself to determine the amount of an increase which could be subject to the whim of the insurer.
chubb and spagnola agree that permits an insurer to increase coverage limits and therefore premiums when the policy itself provides for such periodic increases.the two disagree on whether there is such a provision in this policy.chubb characterizes the policy as an inflation guard policy which permits periodic coverage increases upon renewal to reflect current costs and values.in his complaint,spagnola similarly characterizes the policy annual premiums for replacement cost policies theoretically are based on the home estimated replacement cost,not its market value.these premiums are subject to limited annual cost increases,sometimes referred to in the industry as inflation guard coverage.
it is well established that we defer to an agency construction of a statute when the interpretation of a statute or its application involves knowledge and understanding of underlying operational practices.state ass of life underwriters,state banking dep t,quoting kurcsics merchants mut.ins.several opinions from the new york department of insurance are instructive.
in a july,opinion,the department unequivocally concluded that the policy period requirement of does not have any effect upon the ability of the insurer to renew policies with a premium change,provided that the premium change conforms to its rate filing rate changes and ins.law,office of counsel,ins.dep t,informal opinion.chubb renewed the policy each year and the coverage increase at the time of renewal does not facially violate the required policy period of a,nor does it run counter to the purpose behind.see rosner metro.prop.liab.ins,cir purpose behind is to provide a period of renewability and to establish guaranteed continuity of coverage internal quotation marks omitted.
as to the notice requirement,the department considered a policy provision similar to the one here and concluded that no conditional renewal notice was required when a premium increase was due to the application of an inflation guard mechanism provided for in the policy.conditional renewal notices,office of counsel,ins.dep t,april,informal opinion.the department reasoned that no notice was required because the premium increase was attributable to the operation of the inflation guard required by and set forth in the policy itself.spagnola argues that this opinion actually supports his interpretation of on two grounds.first,he states this is not an inflation guard policy so the department opinion does not control.spagnola distances himself from his initial characterization of the policy,stating in his reply brief that the clauses at issue are not inflation guards as conventionally defined because they do not automatically adjust the coverage limit on the dwelling each time the policy is renewed to reflect current construction costs.second,he contends that the chubb policy is different in any event because its costs and values provision is not fixed or tied to a recognized index within the policy.spagnola points to the department clarification in that opinion had the increase in not been solely attributable to a policy provision or a request by the insured,a conditional renewal notice would be required under the statute although this language is consistent with the conclusion that a conditional notice is not required when the policy provides for an annual increase,it does not affirmatively answer the question of whether the costs and values provision is a sufficient mechanism for increasing annual premiums upon renewal so as to negate the conditional notice requirements.
two other department opinions help to resolve this issue.in the first,the department decided that a conditional renewal notice was not required under new york insurance law the commercial insurance counterpart to because the increase was tied to a provision in the policy which required the insured to maintain coverage equal to the appraised value of the property.conditional renewal of commercial lines insurance policies,office of counsel,ins.dep t,informal opinion.the department concluded that appraised value,a term we believe is substantially similar to the costs and values term of spagnola policy,is a sufficient mechanism to provide the insured notice that the coverage amount will change on a periodic basis.while this opinion considers the provision of a commercial lines insurance policy and not a personal lines policy,the department interpretation of a similar policy provision to the one in this case supports our conclusion that the conditional notice requirements do not apply to the renewals at issue here.
in contrast,another department opinion decided that an increase in the amount of deductible expenses for windstorm coverage did require conditional notice under d.conditional renewal under d,office of counsel,ins,informal opinion.the department based its conclusion on the fact that the deductible in the original policy was fixed and was not subject to any provision that would provide for an automatic increase of any kind.id.these opinions suggest that the determinative factor for the department in deciding whether conditional notice requirements are necessary is whether the policy contemplates a periodic change in the policy coverage or terms.
here,the policy provided that chubb could condition annual renewal on the payment of increased premiums based on current costs and values,and thus,the conditional notice requirements of are not triggered.that the increase can not be specifically measured from the policy itself is not determinative.as the district court wrote an extended replacement cost policy is designed to keep pace with inflation and prevent underinsurance,and therefore,does not and for the insured protection,can not specify the amount of the future coverage increases in the original policy.spagnola chubb,civ,wl,at,emphasis omitted.
we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of spagnola claim.
spagnola next argues that the district court erred in dismissing his breach of contract claim.he claims that chubb violated the insurance contract by not obtaining his consent to increase the amount of his coverage,and increasing his coverage by an amount that does not reflect current costs and values 
spagnola contends that chubb breached the insurance policy by failing to obtain his consent to the annual policy renewals.spagnola states that his payment of the increased premiums did not amount to consent because the payment was not knowing and voluntary.he complains that chubb never told him that it was increasing his coverage chubb never asked for his consent chubb did not provide an explanation for the increased coverage and chubb never told him the amount of the annual change in premiums and coverage.
we easily resolve this argument.first,the amount of coverage was shown in the coverage summary that spagnola received with each reissue of the policy.this summary notified spagnola that w ith your consent,we may change this amount when the policy is renewed,to reflect current costs and values.the policy provided that renewal each year would be at the premiums and under the policy provisions in effect on the date of renewal.it would be effectuated when chubb mailed a bill for the premium along with any changes in the policy provisions or amounts of coverage.the policy provided failure to pay the required renewal premium when due shall mean that you have not accepted our offer.thus,the offer was contained in each new policy reissue and coverage summary,and acceptance occurred if and when spagnola paid the renewal premium.each of these occasions resulted in a new contract between the parties,and spagnola payment was his consent.
spagnola directs us to a new jersey supreme court case from which held that a bsent notification that there have been changes in the restrictions,conditions or limitations of an insurance policy,the insured is justly entitled to assume that they remain the same and that his coverage has not in anywise been lessened.bauman royal indem.we need not address the precedential value of bauman,as there is nothing here to suggest that spagnola was entitled to assume that the coverage amounts remained the same year to year.as the bauman court pointed out,an insured is expected to have read the restrictions,conditions and limitations in his original policy.id.at.spagnola does not dispute that the original policy included language permitting chubb to adjust coverage amounts.in addition,bauman involved an exclusion of insurance coverage that was added for the first time in a renewal policy with nothing to draw the insured attention to such a change.see id.at.that is a different situation than a dispute centered around premium amounts that are always contained in a renewal notice.
we reject spagnola argument that the district court erred insofar as it dismissed the breach of contract claim based on lack of consent.
spagnola also claims that chubb breached the insurance contract by increasing his coverage amounts and premiums in a way that did not reflect current costs and values.the policy does not define the term current costs and values.according to spagnola,the policy could reasonably be interpreted to base costs and values on either actual reconstruction costs or the cpi.he alleges that chubb breached this term by increasing the coverage am
