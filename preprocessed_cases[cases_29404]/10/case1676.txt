discussion 
standard of review 
we review the ruling on spectrum motion for summary judgment de novo.lunardi life assurance th,d.a defendant is entitled to summary judgment if the record establishes as a matter of law that none of the plaintiff asserted causes of action can prevail.citation.molko holy spirit cal d.
as naranjo briefs on appeal focus exclusively on the propriety of summary judgment on his claims under the labor code,we limit our inquiry to these claims.wall street network,new york times th,d.naranjo first and second causes of action alleged that spectrum regularly denied its employees meal and rest periods,and failed to compensate them in accordance with labor code section,which obliges an employer to pay an employee one additional hour of pay at the employee regular rate of compensation for each work day that the meal or rest period is not provided.his third and fourth causes of action sought penalties for spectrum failure to pay the additional compensation upon the resignation or discharge of the plaintiffs,and failure to provide the plaintiffs with itemized records of their wages and deductions.
in seeking summary judgment,spectrum neither disputed nor conceded naranjo factual allegations,but contended that the court lacked jurisdiction over his claims.specifically,spectrum alleged that naranjo wage claims were preempted by federal law,and that any claim for unpaid wages must be pursued through the administrative process afforded by the sca.the trial court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over naranjo claims.the court determined that naranjo had no right to file a private action to recover unpaid wages,and that his sole remedy lay in the administrative process of the sca.accordingly,the key questions here are legal,and concern whether the sca preempts the remedies available to naranjo in state court regarding the denial of meal and rest breaks and denial of itemized records.
the sca requires government contractors to pay service employees minimum wages and benefits determined by the secretary of labor.ex rel.sutton double day office services cir.its purpose is to protect employees of government contractors.before the sca,the federal government had been subsidizing substandard levels of compensation by awarding contracts to those who were able to bid low by paying less.citation.saavedra donovan cir.
the sca requires each federal service contract in excess of to contain clauses specifying the minimum wage and fringe benefits to be paid the employees under the contract.a,a.the wages and benefits are determined by the secretary in accordance with prevailing rates for such employees in the locality,or when the employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement,in accordance with the rates for such employees provided for in the agreement.ibid.the sca specifies that no service contract may pay less than the minimum wage described in the fair labor standards act flsa et.here,there is no dispute that spectrum contract with ice incorporates a complex form clause specified in federal regulations that sets forth in detail spectrum obligations regarding the sca.
under the sca and its accompanying regulations,wages encompass basic rates of pay b and supplemental pay,such as shift differential a.fringe benefits include vacation and holiday benefits,as well as other benefits,such as insurance,pension s,which are not required as a matter of law,excluding social security,unemployment insurance,and workers compensation payments and similar statutory benefits.a.the sca does not provide for overtime pay,but imposes a limit on the extent to which fringe benefits may be included in an employee regular rate of pay for purposes of determining overtime compensation mandated under other federal laws.
pursuant to the sca and its regulations,the secretary issues denominated simply wage determinations for localities that encompass wages and fringe benefits for different categories of service employees.a.here,the wage determination applicable to spectrum contract was attached to the contract.the parties do not dispute that the secretary made the wage determination by reference to los angeles and orange counties.
regarding such determinations,the regulations implementing the sca state information considered.the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits set forth in determinations are based on all available pertinent information as to wage rates and fringe benefits being paid at the time the determination is made.such information is most frequently derived from area surveys made by the bureau of labor statistics,department of labor,or other labor department personnel.information may also be obtained from government contracting officers and from other available sources,including employees and their representatives and employers and their associations.the determinations may be based on the wage rates and fringe benefits contained in collective bargaining agreements where they have been determined to prevail in a locality for specified occupational class es of employees.a.in addition,the secretary may give due consideration to wage rates and fringe benefits which would be paid under federal pay systems.d.
the sca and its regulations establish a system of administrative procedures for enforcing the sca.the secretary is authorized to hold hearings and make decisions based upon findings of fact as are deemed to be necessary to enforce the provisions of the sca.employees who contend their employer has underpaid them in contravention of the sca or its regulations may complain to the secretary,who is authorized following an administrative adjudication to ensure that the employees are compensated in accordance with the contract.a.employees who contend that the wage and benefit determinations governing the contract are inadequate may also challenge them through administrative proceedings.if the challenge is successful,the contract may be amended to reflect the new determinations.
preemption 
the key issue is whether the sca preempts naranjo right to pursue additional compensation under the california labor code in state court.spectrum contends that the sca preempts naranjo entitlement to seek redress for any breaches of the pertinent labor code provisions in state court.he argues that naranjo remedies are found within the sca administrative process,which constitutes the exclusive forum for his claims.we disagree.as explained below,although the sca administrative process provides the sole remedies for claims arising under the sca,the sca does not preempt naranjo suit to recover the additional compensation he seeks under the california labor code.
several federal courts have held that no private right of action exists to enforce the sca.in misc.service workers,cir,msw,the ninth circuit held that an employee remedies for claims under the sca lie exclusively within its administrative process.the view that employees have no private right of action against their employer to enforce the sca has been adopted by at least two other circuits.danielsen aviation training center,danielsen dist.lodge,internat.ass of mach.twa cir,district lodge.
in danielsen,employees of contractors providing services to the united states navy initiated sca administrative proceedings,alleging that their employers contracts misclassified them under the governing wage determinations.danielsen,supra,at.before the conclusion of the sca proceedings,the employees commenced an action against their employers in federal district court,asserting rico claims et and a common law fraud claim for recovery of the unpaid compensation they sought in the sca proceedings.danielsen,supra,at.the district of columbia circuit,following the ninth circuit reasoning in msw,concluded that the sca provided the exclusive remedy to enforce its provisions,and that a private right of action,even couched in rico terms,will not lie for an alleged breach of the sca.danielsen,supra,at accord,district lodge,supra,at following ninth circuit determination in msw that congress did not intend to authorize private suits to enforce the sca.
nonetheless,the absence of a private right to enforce the sca does not,by itself,preclude suits by employees for unpaid compensation.within the realm of federal labor law,employees may assert claims in court predicated on wage laws that are consistent with the sca goals and operation.in masters maryland management company cir,an employee under a government service contract asserted an flsa claim for overtime pay in federal court.in concluding that the sca did not govern the determination of overtime pay,the fourth circuit observed that the sca and flsa,though overlapping,were not in conflict on the issue,and remarked that although a laborer is ordinarily entitled to be paid in accordance with the statutes requiring the greatest pay,parts of other statutes may affect the worker.masters maryland management company,supra,at.
in addition,at least one federal court has held that the sca does not preclude a suit under the false claims act fca et arising out of violations of the sca.in ex rel.sutton double day office services,supra,at pages,an employee of a government contractor initiated an fca action against his employer,alleging that the employer had falsely stated that it had paid its employees wages at the prevailing rate.the ninth circuit concluded that the sca did not bar the suit,reasoning that the fca attached liability to the employer false statements regarding its compliance with the sca,not to the itself,and that the employee sought damages as determined by the fca,rather than by the sca.ex rel.sutton double day office services,supra,at.
here,we address another issue not directly resolved by the absence of a private right to enforce the sca,whether the sca preempts naranjo suit under the california labor code.the supremacy clause of the united states constitution makes federal law paramount,and vests congress with the power to preempt state law,art.vi,cl.there are four species of federal preemption express,conflict,obstacle,and field.citations.first,express preemption arises when congress define s explicitly the extent to which its enactments state law citations.second,conflict preemption will be found when simultaneous compliance with both state and federal directives is impossible.citations.third,obstacle preemption arises when under the circumstances of a particular case,the challenged state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.citations.finally,field preemption,congress intent to all state law in a particular area,applies where the scheme of federal regulation is sufficiently comprehensive to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for supplementary state regulation.citations.viva internat.voice for animals adidas promotional retail operations,cal th,d.generally,c ourts are reluctant to infer preemption,and it is the burden of the party claiming that congress intended to preempt state law to prove it,quoting olszewski scripps health cal th,d.
several courts have held that the sca does not preempt suits for wages,fringe benefits,and other compensation predicated on state or local laws consistent with the sca and its goals.in of labor indus.lanier brugh,brugh,a state agency sued employers providing services under contract to the united states postal service usps,alleging that the employers had failed to comply with state law regarding overtime compensation.the contract between the employers and the usps contained a clause stating n othing in this provision relieves the suppleir sic of any other obligation under law or contract for the payment of a higher wage to any employee.brugh,supra,at.the appellate court concluded that the sca did not preempt the state agency claims,reasoning that congress,in enacting the sca,did not expressly preempt state overtime laws that the sca did not occupy the legislative field and that the contract expressly obliged the employers to comply with state laws according employees a higher wage.brugh,supra,at.
similarly,in butler fidelity technologies so d,butler,the plaintiff sought penalties from his employer under louisiana law for failure to pay his wages within three days of his discharge from employment.the appellate court rejected the employer contention that administrative relief through the procedures authorized by the sca constituted the plaintiff exclusive remedy,stating the purpose of the state statutes is to compel the employer to pay the earned wages of an employee promptly after his dismissal or resignation.in contrast,the sca purpose and objective is to ensure that federal service contract employees are treated equally with employees in that locality by requiring the contractor to pay the prevailing wage and benefits.the state statutes do not prevent or interfere with the attainment of these federal goals.in fact,they help to effectuate the sca.depriving louisiana employees of this remedy would be inconsistent with the objectives of the sca when the sca seeks to ensure that these same employees are guaranteed the same benefits as other employees in the same locality and state.butler,supra,so d at.
finally,in lebron diaz general sec.services rico d,the plaintiffs,who were employed as security guards in federal courthouses,initiated an action in the superior court of the commonwealth of puerto rico,seeking fringe benefits mandated by puerto rican law.after the action was removed to federal court,the district court found that it lacked jurisdiction over the action and remanded it to the superior court.id.at.in so concluding,the district court determined that the sca did not preempt the plaintiffs claims for fringe benefits under puerto rican law because under its regulations,the sca applied only to those fringe benefits not otherwise required by federal,state or local law.lebron diaz general sec.services,supra,d at.
the weight of authority thus recognizes that the sca neither expressly preempts naranjo suit in state court nor reflects a congressional intent to bar his suit through field preemption,that is,through a comprehensive scheme of remedies that leaves no room for such suits viva internat.voice for animals adidas promotional retail operations,supra,cal th at,d.the focus of our inquiry,therefore,is narrowed to whether the sca preempts naranjo action in state court because the litigation would conflict with the sca or hinder the achievement of its goals.we conclude that it would not.
we begin with naranjo claims under labor code section,which provides a no employer shall require any employee to work during any meal or rest period mandated by an applicable order of the industrial welfare commission.b if an employer fails to provide an employee a meal period or rest period in accordance with an applicable order of the industrial welfare commission,the employer shall pay the employee one additional hour of pay at the employee regular rate of compensation for each work day that the meal or rest period is not provided.as
