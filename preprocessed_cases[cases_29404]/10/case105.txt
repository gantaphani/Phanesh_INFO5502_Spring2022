this putative class action challenges the legality,under the fair credit reporting act fcra or the act,et,of an unsolicited letter to a consumer about the offering of credit for a home loan.defendant greenwood credit union sent the letter to plaintiff,anthony sullivan,and others based on a list of individuals meeting certain minimal credit requirements that greenwood had purchased from a credit reporting agency,a process called.this unsolicited letter to sullivan and others triggered the requirements of the fcra,which permits the use of credit information only for specific purposes,one of which is the extending of a firm offer of credit as defined by the act.if greenwood has willfully used credit information for an unpermitted purpose,greenwood would have to pay actual damages or a statutory penalty between and per person.this case is about plaintiff efforts to collect that statutory penalty for a class of consumers there is no claim sullivan was wrongfully denied credit.
this case does not involve a claim that the letter was a sham and merely a marketing device for a consumer purchase.there is also no claim that greenwood would have used the same criteria by which it selected sullivan to receive the letter to deny him credit.rather,the plaintiff argument is that the letter was based on such minimal criteria and the actual extension of credit was so contingent on other conditions that the letter could not be a firm offer of credit.
after allowing some discovery,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendant,finding that greenwood letter to the proposed plaintiff class constituted a firm offer of credit as that term is defined by the fcra.construction of the fcra term firm offer of credit is a matter of first impression for this circuit.we affirm.
in,greenwood purchased from transunion credit bureau a list of names and addresses of homeowners who met certain financial criteria,including having at least in revolving debt and a credit score of or greater the plaintiff met those criteria and was on this list.greenwood obtained only a consumer report containing contact information it did not receive any homeowner full credit report nor any homeowner particular credit score 
greenwood used this list to send unsolicited copies of a form letter to each of the homeowners,including sullivan.the body of the letter stated,among other things,that

the letter did not contain specific loan terms,such as an interest rate or the duration of the loan.
sullivan had never consented to the disclosure of any of his credit information to greenwood.upon receiving the letter,sullivan made no attempt to respond to the letter or contact greenwood.
instead,on august,sullivan filed a putative class action,on behalf of a class of the approximately two million consumers who received the letter,in federal district court in massachusetts,alleging that greenwood was in violation of the fcra.sullivan argues that because he never consented to the disclosure of his credit information to greenwood,greenwood could only legally have obtained information that he met the criteria if it was for the purpose of granting a firm offer of credit.he contends that the letter he received is not a firm offer of credit because it is lacking crucial terms for it to be an offer and is so vague and lacking in terms as not to constitute an offer capable of acceptance.he seeks statutory damages of per person in the class,punitive damages,and attorneys fees and expenses.see a.
the district court allowed the plaintiff limited discovery.the plaintiff moved for class certification and,after discovery concluded,the defendant moved for summary judgment.on august,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendant,holding that greenwood letter constituted a firm offer of credit under the fcra.it dismissed the class certification motion as moot.this appeal followed.
