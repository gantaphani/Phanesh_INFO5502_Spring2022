background 
facts and history 
google launched its street view feature in the united states in to complement its google maps service by providing users with panoramic,photographs.street view photographs are captured by cameras mounted on vehicles owned by google that drive on public roads and photograph their surroundings.between and,google also equipped its street view cars with wi fi antennas and software that collected data transmitted by wi fi networks in nearby homes and businesses.the equipment attached to google street view cars recorded basic information about these wi fi networks,including the network name ssid,the unique number assigned to the router transmitting the wireless signal mac address,the signal strength,and whether the network was encrypted.gathering this basic data about the wi fi networks used in homes and businesses enables companies such as google to provide enhanced services,such as those that allow mobile phone users to find nearby restaurants and attractions or receive driving directions.
but the antennas and software installed in google street view cars collected more than just the basic identifying information transmitted by wi fi networks.they also gathered and stored payload data that was sent and received over unencrypted wi fi connections at the moment that a street view car was driving by payload data includes everything transmitted by a device connected to a wi fi network,such as personal emails,usernames,passwords,videos,and documents.
google acknowledged in may that its street view vehicles had been collecting fragments of payload data from unencrypted wi fi networks.the company publicly apologized,grounded its vehicles,and rendered inaccessible the personal data that had been acquired.in total,google street view cars collected about gigabytes of data transmitted over wi fi networks in more than countries.
several putative lawsuits were filed shortly after google announcement,and,in august,the cases were transferred by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation to the northern district of california.in november,plaintiffs appellees collectively joffe filed a consolidated complaint,asserting claims against google under the federal wiretap act,california business and professional code and various state wiretap statutes.joffe seeks to represent a class comprised of all persons whose electronic communications were intercepted by google street view vehicles since may.
google moved to dismiss joffe consolidated complaint.the district court declined to grant google motion to dismiss joffe federal wiretap act claims in re google.view commc,d at.on google request,the court certified its ruling for interlocutory appeal under b because the district court resolved a novel question of statutory interpretation.we granted google petition,and we have jurisdiction under b.
district court decision 
google maintained before the district court that it should have dismissed joffe wiretap act claims because data transmitted over unencrypted wi fi networks falls under the statutory exemption that makes it lawful to intercept electronic communications that are readily accessible to the general public.g i.the question was whether payload data transmitted on an unencrypted wi fi network is readily accessible to the general public,such that the g i exemption applies to google conduct.
to answer this question,the district court first looked to the definitions supplied by the act.in re google.view commc,d at.the statute provides in relevant part that readily accessible to the general public means,with respect to a radio communication,that such communication is not a scrambled or encrypted.an unencrypted radio communication is,therefore,readily accessible to the general public.in short,intercepting an unencrypted radio communication does not give rise to liability under the wiretap act because of the combination of the g i exemption and the definition.
the district court then considered whether data transmitted over a wi fi network is a radio communication because the phrase is not defined by the act.in re google.view commc,d at.the court reasoned that radio communication encompasses only traditional radio services,and not other technologies that also transmit data using radio waves,such as cellular phones and wi fi networks id.at.since wi fi networks are not a radio communication,the definition of readily accessible to the general public provided by does not apply because the definition is expressly limited to electronic communications that are radio communications.
finally,the court addressed whether data transmitted over unencrypted wi fi networks is nevertheless an electronic communication that is readily accessible to the general public under g i.id.at.although the court determined that wi fi networks do not involve a radio communication under and are therefore not readily accessible to the general public by virtue of the definition of the phrase,it still had to resolve whether they are readily accessible to the general public as the phrase is ordinarily understood because the statute does not define the phrase as it applies to an electronic communication that is not a radio communication.the court determined that data transmitted over an unencrypted wi fi network is not readily accessible to the general public.id.at.as a result,the g i exemption does not apply to google conduct.the court accordingly declined to grant google motion to dismiss joffe wiretap act claims.id.at.
ii.overview of the wiretap act 
the wiretap act imposes liability on a person who intentionally intercepts any wire,oral,or electronic communication,a,subject to a number of exemptions.see a h.there are two exemptions that are relevant to our purposes.first,the wiretap act exempts intercepting an electronic communication made through an electronic communication system if the system is configured so that it is readily accessible to the general public.g i.electronic communication includes communication by radio,and readily accessible to the general public means,with respect to a radio communication that the communication is not scrambled or encrypted,a.second,the act exempts intercepting radio communication by any station for the use of the general public by certain governmental communication systems readily accessible to the general public,including police,fire,and civil defense agencies by a station operating on an authorized frequency for amateur,citizens band,or general mobile radio services or by a marine or aeronautical communications system.g ii i iv.
google only argues,as it did before the district court,that it is exempt from liability under the act because data transmitted over a wi fi network is an electronic communication readily accessible to the general public under g i.it concedes that it does not qualify for any of the exemptions for specific types of radio communication under g ii.joffe,however,argues that if data transmitted over a wi fi network is not exempt as a radio communication under g ii,it can not be exempt as a radio communication under the broader exemption for electronic communication in g i.this argument has some force,and we wish to address it before we consider google claims.
joffe contends that the definition of readily accessible to the general public in does not apply to the g i exemption.instead,joffe argues,the definition applies exclusively to g ii ii,which exempts specifically enumerated types of radio communication when they are readily accessible to the general public.we ultimately reject joffe alternative reading of the statute,although as we will explain we find g ii useful as a lexigraphical aid to understanding the phrase radio communication.
as noted,defines readily accessible to the general public solely with respect to a radio communication,and not with respect to other types of electronic communication.although g i does not use the words radio communication,the statute nevertheless directs us to apply the definition to the g i exemption.first,radio communication is a subset of electronic communication.see providing that,subject to certain exceptions,electronic communication means any transfer of signs,signals,writing,images,sounds,data,or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire,radio,electromagnetic,photoelectronic or photooptical system emphasis added.second,the statute directs us to apply to the entire chapter.the definitions in are prefaced with the phrase,as used in this chapter.we can not disregard this command by holding that the definition of readily accessible to the general public with respect to a radio communication applies to g ii,but not g i.
admittedly,following the plain language of the statute creates some tension with g ii ii,which provides an exemption for intercepting any radio communication which is transmitted by any governmental,law enforcement,civil defense,private land mobile,or public communications system,including police and fire,readily accessible to the general public.under our reading of the statute which is the same reading adopted by the district court,google,and joffe in his lead argument g i exempts all electronic communications including radio communications that are readily accessible to the general public as the phrase is defined in.this reading likely renders g ii ii superfluous.as discussed,that section exempts specific kinds of radio communications that are readily accessible to the general public,such as those transmitted by a law enforcement communications system.but this exemption is unnecessary when g i already exempts all radio communications that are readily accessible to the general public.
although our reading may render g ii ii superfluous or at least redundant,we understand that congress sometimes drafts provisions that appear duplicative of others simply in macbeth words,to make assurance double sure.that is,congress means to clarify what might be doubtful that the mentioned item is covered.shook fin.responsibility mgmt.assistance.this interpretation is especially plausible given that congress was concerned that radio hobbyists not face liability for intercepting readily accessible broadcasts,such as those covered by g ii ii,which can be picked up by a police scanner.see cong.rec.in order to address radio hobbyists concerns,we modified the original language of to clarify that intercepting traditional radio services is not unlawful.
in short,we agree with google that the definition of readily accessible to the general public in applies to the g i exemption when the communication in question is a radio communication.with that understanding,we now turn to whether data transmitted over a wi fi network is a radio communication exempt from the wiretap act as an electronic communication under g i.
iii.analysis 
in support of its position that it is exempt under g i,google offers two arguments.first,it contends that data transmitted over a wi fi network is an electronic radio communication and that the act exempts such communications by defining them as readily accessible to the general public,g i,so long as such communication is not scrambled or encrypted,a.second,google contends that even if data transmitted over an unencrypted wi fi network is not a radio communication,it is still an electronic communication readily accessible to the general public.g i.
we reject both claims we hold that the phrase radio communication in excludes payload data transmitted over a wi fi network.as a consequence,the definition of readily accessible to the general public with respect to a radio communication set forth in does not apply to the exemption for an electronic communication that is readily accessible to the general public under g i.we further hold that payload data transmitted over an unencrypted wi fi network is not readily accessible to the general public under the ordinary meaning of the phrase as it is used in g i.
data transmitted over a wi fi network is not a radio communication under the wiretap act.
we turn first to the question of whether data transmitted over a wi fi network is a radio communication as that term is used in.if data transmitted over a wi fi network is a radio communication,then any radio communication that is not scrambled or encrypted is considered readily accessible to the general public,and is exempt from liability under the wiretap act.g i.
the ordinary meaning of radio communication does not include data transmitted over a wi fi network 
the wiretap act does not define the phrase radio communication so we must give the term its ordinary meaning.see hamilton lanning,d when terms used in a statute are undefined,we give them their ordinary meaning.united states daas,cir if the statute uses a term which it does not define,the court gives that term its ordinary meaning.
according to google,radio communication refers to any information transmitted using radio waves,the radio frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.appellant br.at.the radio frequency portion of the spectrum is the part of the spectrum where electromagnetic waves have frequencies in the range of about kilohertz to gigahertz.id.at.
google technical definition does not conform with the common understanding held contemporaneous with the enacting congress.see united states iverson,cir when a statute does not define a term,we generally interpret that term by employing the ordinary,contemporary,and common meaning of the words that congress used emphasis added.the radio frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum covers not only wi fi transmissions,but also television broadcasts,bluetooth devices,cordless and cellular phones,garage door openers,avalanche beacons,and wildlife tracking collars.see fed.commc comm n,encyclopedia fm broadcast station classes and service countours,available at http last visited.one would not ordinarily consider,say,television a form of radio communication.not surprisingly,congress has not typically assumed that the term radio encompasses the term television.see,imposing liability for f raud by wire,radio,or television emphasis added imposing liability for inciting a riot by means of mail,telegraph,radio,or television emphasis added defining an instrumentality of interstate commerce as any written,wire,radio,television or other form of communication see also fcc citizens comm.for,d noting that radio and television stations are given different weight,under the regulations at issue,and describing regulations governing a radio or television broadcast station emphasis added.
the wiretap act itself does not assume that the phrase radio communication encompasses technologies like satellite television that are outside the scope of the phrase as it is ordinarily defined.for example,the statute damages provision sets out specified penalties when the violation of this chapter is the private viewing of a private satellite video communication that is not scrambled or encrypted or if the communication is a radio communication that is transmitted on frequencies specified by regulation.c emphasis added.congress described separately the act of viewing a private satellite video communication even though such communication is transmitted on a radio frequency and would fall within google proposed definition of radio communication.taken together,these disparate provisions offer evidence that congress does not use radio or radio communication to reference all of the myriad forms of communication that use the radio spectrum.rather,it uses radio to refer to traditional radio technologies,and then separately describes other modes of communication that are not ordinarily thought of as radio,but that nevertheless use the radio spectrum.
google proposed definition is in tension with how congress and virtually everyone else uses the phrase.in common parlance,watching a television show does not entail radio communication.nor does sending an email or viewing a bank statement while connected to a wi fi network.there is no indication that the wiretap act carries a buried implication that the phrase ought to be given a broader definition than the one that is commonly understood.see mohamad palestinian,d favoring a definition that matches how we use the word in everyday parlance and observing that congress remains free,as always,to give the word a broader or different meaning.but before we will assume it has done so,there must be some indication congress intended such a result.
importantly,congress provided definitions for many other similar terms in the wiretap act,but refrained from providing a technical definition of radio communication that would have altered the notion that it should carry its common,ordinary meaning.see,defining wire communication defining electronic communication defining electronic communication service defining electronic storage.as google writes in its brief,t he fact that the wiretap act provides specialized definitions for certain compound terms but not for radio communication is powerful evidence that the undefined term was not similarly intended to be defined in a specialized or narrow way but rather according to its ordinary meaning.appellant br.at.we agree and,accordingly,we reject google proposed definition of radio communication in favor of one that better reflects the phrase ordinary meaning.
a radio communication is a predominantly auditory broadcast,which excludes payload data transmitted over wi fi networks 
there are two telltale indicia of a radio communication.a radio communication is commonly understood to be predominantly auditory,and broadcast.therefore,television whether connected via an indoor antenna or a satellite dish is not radio,by virtue of its visual component.a land line phone does not broadcast,and,for that reason,is not radio.on the other hand,citizens band cb,and shortwave transmissions are predominantly auditory,are broadcast,and are,not coincidentally,typically referred to as radio in everyday parlance.thus,we conclude that radio communication should carry its ordinary meaning a predominantly auditory broadcast 
the payload data transmitted over unencrypted wi fi networks that was captured by google included emails,usernames,passwords,images,and documents that can not be classified as predominantly auditory.they therefore fall outside of the definition of a radio communication as the phrase is used in.
defining radio communication to include only predominantly auditory broadcasts is consistent with the rest of the wiretap act 
crucially,defining radio communication as a predominantly auditory broadcast yields a coherent and consistent wiretap act.google overly broad definition does not.see k mart cartier,d in ascertaining the plain meaning of the statute,the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue,as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.
throughout the wiretap act,congress used the phrase radio communication which is at issue here and the similar phrase communication by radio.even within the very provision that we are construing congress used both phrases.we must ascribe to each phrase its own meaning.see sec mccarthy,cir it is a canon of statutory interpretation that the use of different words or terms within a statute demonstrates that congress intended to convey a different meaning for those words.the phrase communication by radio is used more expansively it conjures an image of all communications using radio waves or a radio device.see,e describing radio communication that is a voice communication by radio transmitted on a frequency not exclusively allocated to broadcast auxiliary services.
when read in context,the phrase radio communication tends to refer more narrowly to broadcast radio technologies rather than to the radio waves by which the communication is made.radio communication is typically surrounded by words that evoke traditional radio technologies whenever it is used in the act.see gustafson alloyd,d a word is known by the company it keeps the doctrine of noscitur a sociis.this rule we rely upon to avoid ascribing to one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying words,thus giving unintended breadth to the acts of congress.for example,g ii,inter alia,exempts from liability the interception of any radio communication which is transmitted by a station operating on an authorized frequency within the bands allocated to the amateur,citizens band,or general mobile radio services.these are traditional audio broadcasts that fit squarely within the ordinary meaning of radio communication.the phrase radio communication is used five times in the wiretap act.see,g ii,g v,a i b,c.defining the term as a predominantly auditory broadcast would not distort the meaning of any of these provisions or otherwise lead to incoherence or inconsistency.
on the other hand,the wiretap act uses communication by radio to refer more broadly to any communication transmitted by radio wave.see defining electronic communication to include any communication transmitted in whole or in part by radio b ii prohibiting the use of a device to intercept any oral communication if the device transmits communications by radio b authorizing fcc employees,in carrying out their official duties,to intercept an oral communication transmitted by radio.congress decision to use both of these phrases implies that it intended to distinguish radio communication from communications by radio.see mccarthy,at.ideally,congress would have supplied definitions to make the distinction between these terms more apparent.nevertheless,by relying on their ordinary meaning and evaluating how they are used in context,we conclude that the former refers more narrowly to a predominantly auditory broadcast while only the latter encompasses other communications made using radio waves.
the way the phrase radio communication is used in g ii is particularly relevant in defining the term because that provision specifically exempts from liability the interception of certain kinds of radio communication.the provision is not directly at issue here because as google acknowledges google conduct is not encompassed by any of the g ii exemptions,hence its reliance on g i.but it is instructive to understand the types of communication exempted by g ii since the phrase radio communication is known by the company it keeps,gustafson,at.the exemptions include,inter alia,radio communications transmitted by any station for the use of the general public,g ii i,by a station operating on an authorized frequency within the bands allocated to the amateur,citizens band,or general mobile radio services,u.g ii iii,and by any marine or aeronautical communications system,g ii iv.other than the fact that they all use the radio spectrum,these radio communications have little in common with a home wi fi network.of course g i exempts radio communications that are readily accessible to the general public even if they are not specifically set out in g ii.but it would be odd for congress to take pains to identify particular kinds of radio communications that should be exempt in g ii only to exempt broad swaths of dissimilar communications,such as data transmitted over a wi fi network,under the auspices of g i.it is more sensible to read the general exemption in g i insofar as it applies to radio communication rather than other kinds of electronic communication in light of the specific exemptions in g ii.
relatedly,giving radio communication its ordinary meaning as a predominantly auditory broadcast also avoids producing absurd results that are inconsistent with the statutory scheme.see griffin oceanic contractors,d i nterpretations of a statute which would produce absurd results are to be avoided if alternative interpretations consistent with the legislative purpose are available.state bd.for charter schools dep t of,cir w rules of statutory construction caution us that statutory interpretations which would produce absurd results are to be avoided.when a natural reading of the statutes leads to a rational,result,an alteration of meaning is not only unnecessary,but also extrajudicial.under the expansive definition of radio communication proposed by google,the protections afforded by the wiretap act to many online communications would turn on whether the recipient of those communications decided to secure her wireless network.a radio communication is readily accessible to the general public and,therefore,exempt from wiretap act liability if it is not scrambled or encrypted.consider an email attachment containing sensitive personal information sent from a secure wi fi network to a doctor,lawyer,accountant,priest,or spouse.a company like google that intercepts the contents of that email from the encrypted home network has,quite understandably,violated the wiretap act.but the sender of the email is in no position to ensure that the recipient be it a doctor,lawyer,accountant,priest,or spouse has taken care to encrypt her own wi fi network.google,or anyone else,could park outside of the recipient home or office with a packet sniffer while she downloaded the attachment and intercept its contents because the sender radio communication is readily accessible to the general public solely by virtue of the fact that the recipient wi fi network is not encrypted.surely congress did not intend to condone such an intrusive and unwarranted invasion of privacy when it enacted the wiretap act to protect against the unauthorized interception of electronic communications,at see also konop hawaiian airlines,cir the legislative history of the wiretap act suggests that congress wanted to protect electronic communications that are configured to be private,such as email.in re pharmatrak.privacy,cir the paramount objective of the wiretap act is to protect effectively the privacy of communications.
the definition of readily accessible to the general public in is limited to radio communication,and does not encompass all electronic communication.congress decision to carve out radio communication for less protection than some other types of electronic communication makes sense if radio communication is given its ordinary meaning.traditional radio services can be easily and mistakenly intercepted by hobbyists.see cong.rec.in order to address radio hobbyists concerns,we modified the original language of to clarify that intercepting traditional radio services is not unlawful.but radio hobbyists do not mistakenly use packet sniffers to intercept payload data transmitted on wi fi networks.lending radio communication a broad definition that encompasses data transmitted on wi fi networks would obliterate congress compromise and create absurd applications of the exemption for intercepting unencrypted radio communications.for example,g ii ii exempts from liability,inter alia,the act of intercepting any radio communication which is transmitted by any governmental,law enforcement or public safety communications system,including police and fire,readily accessible to the general public.this provision reinforces the work performed by g i,which already exempts a radio communication that is readily accessible to the general public.congress decision to ensure that these communications were exempt makes sense if radio communication encompasses only predominantly auditory broadcasts since these transmissions can be picked up by widely available police scanners.but if radio communication includes data transmitted over wi fi networks,then g ii ii also underscores that liability should not attach to intercepting data from an unencrypted wi fi network operated by,say,a police department or government agency.it seems doubtful that congress wanted to emphasize that google or anyone else could park outside of a police station that carelessly failed to secure its wi fi network and intercept confidential data with impunity.
next,google strenuously argues that the rest of the wiretap act supports its position that radio communication in means any information transmitted using radio waves.google leans heavily on d and the accompanying legislative history,which together suggest that cellular telephone and paging systems are a form of radio communication.if cell phone and paging systems are a type of radio communication,google argues,it must be the case that congress intended that the phrase include wi fi networks and the rest of the radio spectrum because these technologies differ from paradigmatic radio communications like,cb,and shortwave transmissions.but cell phone communications were not dissimilar from cb,shortwave,or other forms of traditional radio broadcasts when d was added to the wiretap act in as part of the electronic communications privacy act,stat.when congress enacted d,cell phones were still called cellular radiotelephones.see,at.as with other audio broadcasts,cellular conversations were often inadvertently picked up by radio hobbyists scanning radio frequencies in order to receive public communications,at see also,at cellular telephone calls can be intercepted by either sophisticated scanners designed for that purpose,or by regular radio scanners modified to intercept cellular calls.the fact that technology has evolved and cellular communications are no longer as similar to cb broadcasts as they once were does not require us to read radio communication to include all communications made using radio waves.rather,the historical context surrounding congress protection of cellular conversations as a form of a radio communication is consistent with the commonsense definition of the term because,at the time of the enactment of the definition in,cellular conversations could have reasonably been construed as analogous to a form of radio assuming,arguendo,that the phrase radio communication covers cell phone transmissions as they existed in does not inevitably lead to the conclusion that it also encompasses transmissions that are plainly not predominantly auditory broadcasts,such as payload data transmitted over a wi fi network.
google also looks beyond the wiretap act in an effort to fit its expansive definition of radio communication into the statutory scheme.it points out that the communications act expressly defines the phrases radio communication and communication by radio broadly to include the transmission by radio of writing,signs,signals,pictures,and sounds of all kinds.but when congress wanted to borrow a definition from the communications act to apply to the wiretap act,it expressly said so.see giving the phrase communication common carrier the meaning that it has in section of the communications act.here,congress refrained from incorporating the definition of radio communication used in the communications act.and,as previously discussed,the wiretap act uses the phrases radio communication and communication by radio differently,indicating that congress did not intend to import the communications act definition,which treats them as synonyms.see.furthermore,the communication act definition of radio communication encompasses technologies like television by including the transmission by radio of pictures of all kinds,while the wiretap act sometimes distinguishes them.see,c providing specified penalties when the violation of this chapter is the private viewing of a private satellite video communication that is not scrambled or encrypted or if the communication is a radio communication that is transmitted on frequencies specified by regulation.separate references to communications would be redundant when paired with the phrase radio communication if we were to assume that the communication act definition applied to the wiretap act.importantly,the presumption that a definition set out in one part of the code is intended to govern another is hardly unyielding in the face of such contradictory evidence.see,general dynamics land,cline,d holding that the word age carries a different meaning in different sections of the area robinson shell oil,d holding that the term employees carries a different meaning in different sections of title vii.
google also leans heavily on a series of amendments to to argue that congress impliedly gave the phrase radio communication a
