this class action is about meal breaks at work.lead plaintiff darryl collins charged that walgreens violated employees rights to meal breaks.the trial court denied collins motion for class certification.we affirm.
walgreens is a drug store chain.in a coordinated action,collins moved for class certification on the theory that walgreens stated policy on meal breaks was proper,but that walgreens actual practice departed from its stated policy in an illegal and classwide way.
for a class certification motion,the burden on the moving party is to demonstrate the existence of an ascertainable and sufficiently numerous class,a community of interest,and substantial benefits from certification that render proceeding as a class superior to the alternatives.brinker restaurant superior court cal th,d.we generally afford trial courts great latitude in granting or denying class certification,and normally review a ruling on certification for an abuse of discretion.this deferential standard of review does not apply,however,if the trial court has evaluated class certification using improper criteria or an incorrect legal analysis.jaimez daiohs usa,th,d.
a class certification motion is not a license for a inquiry into the validity of the complaint allegations h owever,issues affecting the merits of a case may be enmeshed with class action requirements citations.analysis of a class certification propriety f requently will entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff underlying claim.that can not be helped.citation.evaluation of many of the questions entering into determination of class action questions is intimately involved with the merits of the claims.when evidence or legal issues germane to the certification question bear as well on aspects of the merits,a court may properly evaluate them.citations.the rule is that a court may consider how various claims and defenses relate and may affect the course of the litigation even though such considerations may overlap the case merits.citations.i f the considerations necessary to certification overlap the merits then the judge must make a preliminary inquiry into the merits.in particular,whether common or individual questions predominate will often depend upon resolution of issues closely tied to the merits.citations.w hether an element may be established collectively or only individually,plaintiff by plaintiff,can turn on the precise nature of the element and require resolution of disputed legal or factual issues affecting the merits.for example,whether reliance or a breach of duty can be demonstrated collectively or poses insuperable problems of individualized proof may be determinable only after closer inspection of the nature of the reliance required or duty owed and,in some instances,resolution of legal or factual disputes going directly to the merits.brinker restaurant superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
the trial court used the proper criteria and analysis to analyze collins motion.
california employers must give workers time off to eat meals at work.the law on meal breaks became clearer while this appeal was pending.in,this court stayed briefing of this appeal to await the decision in the brinker case.in,our supreme court rendered its decision in brinker restaurant superior court,supra,cal th,d.brinker illuminated the law.
before brinker,courts were divided over whether an employer must merely make meal breaks available,or whether the employer must actually ensure employees take the breaks.this difference between the make available standard and the ensure standard is inobvious at first,and it does not seem that important either.but the practical consequences turn out to be great.
under the make available standard,the employer merely must make meal breaks available.that is,the employer must relieve the employee of all job duties for the meal break,and then the employer may allow employees to decide for themselves whether to take the break.this make available standard thus allows an employee to choose to skip the break and,for instance,to leave work early instead.if the employer provides a break opportunity to the worker,the employer incurs no liability if the employee then decides to skip or delay the break.
walgreens employees sometimes did decide to skip or delay breaks.one employee explained,for instance,that i generally take my lunch breaks,but about once a week i will skip lunch because i want to be able to leave work early.another testified that,e ven though it has always been walgreens policy to provide a minute meal period,i preferred to skip mine and instead leave early.if i am not hungry,which is typically the case,i do not need a meal period,especially since it is unpaid time.there was other similar evidence about skipping or delaying breaks.
that is the make available standard.
under the alternative ensure standard,an employer must ensure employees take breaks.that is,an employer must make workers take meal breaks whether they want them or not.employers are liable for missed meal breaks even when workers choose to skip their breaks because the ensure rule makes breaks mandatory.
one important difference between the make available standard and the ensure standard has to do with ease of proof.the ensure standard can make it easier for plaintiffs to prove employer meal break violations,while the make available standard can make it harder.here is why.employers generally require employees to record hours worked by clocking in and clocking out,a process that typically generates centralized and computerized time records.it is simple to use computer records to determine if each employee checked out on time for a full minute meal break.meal break classes thus are relatively easy to certify under the ensure test each missed break automatically equals an employer violation.meal break classes are harder to certify under a make available test because the fact of a missed break does not dictate the conclusion of a violation and thus employer liability.rather,under the make available standard you additionally must ask why the worker missed the break before you can determine whether the employer is liable.if the worker was free to take the break and simply chose to skip or delay it,there is no violation and no employer liability.this make available test thus can make analysis of break violations more complex than under the ensure standard.
brinker adopted the make available standard and rejected the ensure standard.brinker restaurant superior court,supra,cal th at,d,we conclude an employer obligation is to relieve its employee of all duty,with the employee thereafter at liberty to use the meal period for whatever purpose he or she desires,but the employer need not ensure that no work is done.
justice werdegar concurring opinion in brinker proposed a presumption if an employer records show no meal period for a given shift over five hours,a rebuttable presumption arises that the employee was not relieved of duty and no meal period was provided.brinker restaurant superior court,supra,cal th at,d,conc.opn.of werdegar.justice liu joined justice werdegar rebuttable presumption proposal,but the majority of justices did not.see id.at,d conc.opn.of werdegar,in re marriage of dade d.concurring opinions are not binding precedent.
the trial court used the right analysis because it correctly predicted the brinker holding.the court said walgreens must make breaks available for its employees,but the employer need not ensure employees actually take the meal breaks.
collins suggests the trial court statement of the law differed from brinker in a material way,but this is inaccurate.m ake available were the words the trial court used.the brinker court said an employer must relieve the employee of all duty for the designated period,but need not ensure that the employee does no work.brinker restaurant superior court,supra,cal th at,d.these words express the same idea.collins advocated the ensure standard in the trial court.both the trial court and the brinker holding rejected the ensure standard.ibid.the trial court correctly predicted the holding of brinker.
collins also argues on the basis of the rebuttable presumption j
