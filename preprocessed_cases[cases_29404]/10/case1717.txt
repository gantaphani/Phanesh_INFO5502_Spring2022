plaintiffs brian koponen,gloria peterson and the edith hayes trust filed suit on behalf of themselves and a class of persons similarly situated against pacific gas electric company pg e,a public utility,seeking damages and other relief after pg e leased or licensed rights in easements burdening plaintiffs property to telecommunications companies for the purposes of installing and using fiber optic lines.pg e demurred,contending public utilities code section deprived the superior court of jurisdiction to adjudicate plaintiffs claims,plaintiffs claims can not survive the decision in salvaty falcon cable television d.salvaty and the case is not suitable for class adjudication.the trial court sustained pg e demurrer on the first of these grounds,ruling it had no jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims.having decided the matter on that point,the court did not rule on pg e other contentions,concluding they were mooted by its jurisdictional finding.the court then dismissed the complaint without leave to amend.we conclude section bars some but not all of plaintiffs claims.
background 
according to plaintiffs allegations,pg e,by condemnation or private agreement,obtained easements creating over plaintiffs properties for the purposes of furnishing and supplying electricity,light,heat and power to the public.plaintiffs allege that at some time after,pg e began installing fiber optic telecommunications lines and wireless telecommunications equipment in the corridors subject to the easements.pg e later began leasing or licensing fiber optic capacity and telecommunications services to third parties,including leading telecommunications and internet companies.plaintiffs claim by leasing or licensing its facilities to telecommunications providers,pg e exceeded the scope of the easements granted or conveyed to it and reduced the value of plaintiffs properties.they assert the installation and leasing of fiber optic lines has increased and will increase the burden on the servient estates by increasing maintenance activities along the easement corridors and by creating the possibility that the estates will be subject to amendments to the pole attachment act,et,which requires electric utility companies to grant telecommunications carriers nondiscriminatory access to poles and owned or controlled by the companies plaintiffs also complain the leases and licenses subject plaintiffs to increased risks of tort liability by allowing third parties to use the easement corridors.plaintiffs allege causes of action for unlawful business practices,unfair business practices,unjust enrichment,and intentional and negligent trespass.they seek compensatory and punitive damages injunctive,declaratory and equitable relief restitution,pre and postjudgment interest and attorney fees.

section does not bar plaintiffs suitlimitations imposed by section 
this case,like others before it,concerns the interplay between sections and.section recognizes the public utilities commission commission,or,sometimes,puc is an agency of constitutional origin with broad powers granted to it by the constitution cal,art.xii,and the legislature through the plenary power granted to the legislature by article xii,section.the legislature,by means of the public utilities act et,has authorized the commission to do all things,whether specifically designated in the act or in addition thereto,which are necessary and convenient in the exercise of such power and jurisdiction over public utilities.california constitution article xii,section further grants the legislature plenary power to establish the manner and scope of review of commission action in a court of record.the legislature has not conferred authority on the superior courts to review commission decisions.rather,review of most commission decisions may be obtained by filing a petition for a writ of review in the court of appeal or the supreme court for the purpose of having the lawfulness of the original order or decision or of the order or decision on rehearing inquired into and determined,subd.a section,subdivision a provides no court of this state,except the supreme court and the court of appeal,to the extent specified in this article,shall have jurisdiction to review,reverse,correct,or annul any order or decision of the commission or to suspend or delay the execution or operation thereof,or to enjoin,restrain,or interfere with the commission in the performance of its official duties,as provided by law and the rules of court.the legislature accordingly has made it clear that no other court has jurisdiction either to review or suspend the commission decisions or to enjoin or otherwise interfere with the commission performance of its duties.san diego gas electric superior court covalt cal th,d,covalt 
notwithstanding this limitation,chapter of the public utilities act,entitled violations,recognizes the superior courts have jurisdiction to redress violations of commission decisions committed by public agencies.et covalt,supra,cal th at,d.section creates a private remedy,providing,any public utility which does,causes to be done,or permits any act,matter,or thing prohibited or declared unlawful,or which omits to do any act,matter,or thing required to be done,either by the constitution,any law of this state,or any order or decision of the commission,shall be liable to the persons or corporations affected thereby for all loss,damages,or injury caused thereby or resulting therefrom.if the court finds that the act or omission was wilful,it may,in addition to the actual damages,award exemplary damages.an action to recover for such loss,damage,or injury may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction by any corporation or person.the supreme court,recognizing a potential conflict between sections and,has held section must be construed as limited to those situations in which an award of damages would not hinder or frustrate the commission declared supervisory and regulatory policies.waters pacific telephone cal d,waters.t he two sections must be construed in a manner which harmonizes their language and avoids unnecessary conflict.section reasonably may be interpreted as authorizing only those actions which would not interfere with or obstruct the commission in carrying out its own policies.id.at.
under the waters rule waters,supra,cal d,accordingly,an action for damages against a public utility pursuant to section is barred by section not only when an award of damages would directly contravene a specific order or decision of the commission,when it would reverse,correct,or annul that order or decision,but also when an award of damages would simply have the effect of undermining a general supervisory or regulatory policy of the commission,when it would hinder or frustrate or interfere with or obstruct that policy.covalt,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court established a test to determine whether an action is barred by section whether the commission had the authority to adopt a regulatory policy whether the commission had exercised that authority and whether the superior court action would hinder or interfere with the commission exercise of regulatory authority.id.at,d,and see hartwell superior court cal th,d,hartwell.
application of test 
as the present case illustrates,the test may be somewhat easier to state than to apply.pg e identifies a regulatory policy of promoting the joint use of utility property for general telecommunications purposes.pg e then cites five commission opinions explaining the commission reasons for granting applications by pg e to enter into agreements with providers of telecommunications services.the opinions recognize that allowing pg e to install,lease license fiber optics on its transmission lines will benefit the public by encouraging energy utilities to use their property productively and by reducing the need for construction of new telecommunications project sites.in addition,at least some of the agreements provide additional benefit to the public by allowing pg e to increase its capacities and obtain supporting facilities at minimal cost.installing fiber optic lines also would provide some additional stability to existing transmission lines.the commission also considered what pg e should do with the revenues generated by the licenses or leases,and concluded,for the most part,that the revenues should be credited to pg e ratepayers 
we do not doubt the commission has power to regulate pg e use of its facilities,including the power to regulate whether pg e may install fiber optic lines or license or lease its facilities to providers of telecommunications services.we also do not doubt the commission,subject to state or federal statutory requirements,has the power to determine how revenues from pg e leases or licenses must be allocated or distributed.there also is little question that the commission has exercised its regulatory power by authorizing pg e to enter into specific licensing or leasing agreements and also by determining how resulting revenues will be allocated.we therefore agree plaintiffs suit is barred to the extent it could hinder or interfere with the commission exercise of its authority to determine what use pg e can make of its facilities or how revenues generated from that use should be allocated.
plaintiffs,however,contend their claims have nothing to do with the commission authority to regulate pg e use of pg e property,including pg e property interest in the over plaintiffs land.rather,plaintiffs seek to establish pg e is invading plaintiffs property rights by attempting to sell to the telecommunications providers a use of the that pg e does not own.plaintiffs contend the commission has no regulatory authority or interest in private disputes over property rights between pg e and private landowners.we agree.
in covalt,the plaintiffs filed an action seeking damages and injunctive relief from an electric company alleging injury and property damage from electric currents through power lines on an easement on land adjacent to the plaintiffs residence.covalt,supra,cal th at,d.according to the complaint,the currents caused high and unreasonably dangerous levels of electromagnetic radiation emf for electromagnetic fields to be emitted onto the plaintiffs property.id.at,d.the supreme court found the commission had authority to determine whether the service or equipment of any public utility poses a danger to the health or safety of the public,and,if so,to prescribe corrective measures and order them into effect.id.at,d.it also has broad authority over the design and siting of electric powerlines.id.at,d.the commission,therefore,had the authority to adopt a policy on whether electric and magnetic fields arising from the powerlines are a public health risk and what action,if any,the utilities should take to minimize that risk.id.at,d.the commission had been investigating the potential public health effects of exposure to emf,had issued reports on its findings and had developed and implemented rules based on its findings.the supreme court therefore found,the commission has is still constitutional and statutory authority to adopt a general policy on whether electric and magnetic fields arising from the powerlines of regulated utilities are a public health risk and what steps,if any,the utilities should take to minimize that risk.id.at,d.
most of the plaintiffs theories against the electric company were barred for reasons unrelated to the reach of section.covalt,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court,however,considered whether section deprived the superior court of jurisdiction to adjudicate the plaintiffs claim of nuisance.the plaintiffs alleged their use and enjoyment of their property had been impaired by the fear that the emf would cause them physical harm.id.at,d.the court found that even if such a claim were viable,the trier of fact could award damages only by finding reasonable persons viewing the matter objectively would experience a substantial fear that the emf would cause physical harm and also that the invasion was so serious as to outweigh the social utility from the conduct.it held,such findings,however,would be inconsistent with the commission conclusion,reached after consulting with the department of health services,studying the reports of advisory groups and experts,and holding evidentiary hearings,that the available evidence does not support a reasonable belief that the emf to which the plaintiffs had been exposed present a substantial risk of physical harm,and that unless or until the evidence supports such a belief regulated utilities need take no action to reduce field levels from existing powerlines.ibid.
in covalt,supra,cal th,d,then,the plaintiffs by their court action sought a ruling directly contrary to a decision of the commission made in response to an issue actually and properly before it the regulation of emf to protect the public safety.similarly in waters,supra,cal d,a suit against a telephone utility seeking damages for failing to provide adequate service was barred because the commission had adopted a policy of limiting the liability of telephone utilities.the supreme court held,since an award of substantial damages to plaintiff would be contrary to the policy adopted by the commission and would interfere with the commission regulation of telephone utilities,we have concluded that section bars the instant action.id.at.here,in contrast,there is no evidence the commission has considered the extent of pg e property interests in its,or that it has adopted any policy limiting a utility liability for invading the property interests of private parties.
the court in covalt,supra,cal th,d,distinguished two appellate court cases.in cellular plus,superior court th,d cellular plus,consumers and corporate sales agents,including cellular plus,brought suit against two cellular telephone service companies,claiming price fixing under the cartwright act bus,et.cellular plus,at,d.the trial court sustained demurrers to those claims,apparently finding they were barred by section.id.at,d.the companies asserted the demurrer properly had been granted because the trial court proceedings would interfere with the commission overall primary jurisdiction over rates charged by public utilities.id.at,d.the appellate court disagreed.we can not conceive how a price fixing claim under the cartwright act could hinder or frustrate the puc supervisory or regulatory policies.the only apparent policy of the puc that could be affected is its regulation of rates charged by cellular telephone service providers.however,cellular plus does not dispute that the puc has jurisdiction over rates,nor does it seek any relief requiring the puc to change any rates it has approved.cellular plus is merely seeking treble damages and injunctive relief for alleged price fixing under the cartwright act.ibid and see covalt,supra,at,d.in addition,although not directly applicable to the companies arguments about section,the court of appeal recognized the puc does not have jurisdiction over antitrust violations.cellular plus,supra,at,d.
in stepak american.d.stepak,a minority shareholder in a telephone utility filed a class action against the utility alleging breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with a proposed merger with a second utility.the commission later approved the merger.id.at.in finding section did not bar the shareholder suit,the court of appeal reasoned,we are aware of no declared supervisory or regulatory polices citation ever formulated or relied on by the commission on the subject of safeguarding minority investor interests.applying the waters test of jurisdiction waters,supra,cal d,we can not conceive of how the superior court award of damages or other relief to wronged minority shareholders would hinder or frustrate citation declared commission policy.appellant class action suit is
