we must decide,inter alia,whether a rejected offer of judgment for the full amount of a putative class representative individual claim moots a class action complaint where the offer precedes the filing of a motion for class certification.we hold that it does not.
in april,gareth pitts filed a class action complaint in nevada state court against his employer,terrible herbst,terrible.the complaint alleged that terrible failed to pay pitts and other employees overtime and minimum wages and listed three causes of action a collective action under b for violations of the fair labor standards act flsa count a class action for violations of nevada labor laws count and a class action for breach of contract count.terrible removed the case to federal court in may.
in july,the district court entered a scheduling order that called for all discovery to be concluded by january.that same day,pitts served terrible with a request for production of documents,including a list of the names and addresses of all of its employees who work or have worked in its retail locations on an hourly basis and a ll other records that show the hours worked by,and the wages paid to these employees.after terrible refused to comply with his discovery request,pitts filed a motion to compel discovery.this motion,filed in october,argued that production of time records for all members of the putative class is highly relevant to whether class certification should be granted.
in december,a magistrate judge held a hearing on pitts motion to compel and indicated that he would rule on it after the end of the year.in january,without a ruling and facing an impending discovery deadline,pitts filed a motion to extend the discovery schedule,in which he again argued that a properly developed record can not be presented to the court on the class certification issue without all or some of the requested discovery.in february,the magistrate judge granted the motion and extended discovery until april.the motion to compel remained unresolved.
in the meantime,terrible made pitts an offer of judgement pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.under the terms of this offer,which was dated october,terrible agreed to allow judgment to be taken against it in the total amount of,plus costs and a reasonable attorney fee.although pitts claimed only in damages for himself,he refused terrible offer.
because terrible offer fully compensated pitts for his individual monetary claim,terrible filed a motion to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.specifically,terrible argued that its offer of judgment rendered the entire case moot.following the fifth circuit decision in sandoz cingular wireless llc,cir,the district court,in march,held that a rule offer of judgment does not moot a putative class action so long as the class representative can still file a timely motion for class certification.nevertheless,the district court then held that terrible offer mooted the action because pitts failed to timely seek class certification.the district court acknowledged that the magistrate judge had extended discovery until april and that he had not yet ruled on the motion to compel discovery.
but the court nevertheless concluded that pitts pushed beyond the limits of timeliness in waiting for certification and that pitts failure to move for class certification before the initial deadline for discovery demonstrates untimeliness on his part.the court then dismissed the entire action with prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,entered judgment in the defendant favor,and ordered terrible to pay to pitts and to pitts attorney.
in the same order that dismissed counts and of the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as we explain below,count had already been dismissed the district court also dismissed count on alternative grounds.specifically,the court concluded that a federal rule of civil procedure class action alleging violations of state labor laws is incompatible with a collective action under the flsa and held that when both actions are brought together,only the flsa action may proceed.in its ruling,the district court acknowledged that pitts sought to abandon his flsa claims and pursue only his rule class action,but refused to allow him to do so.the court explained that pitts failed to amend his complaint to reflect that he was waiving his flsa claims and accused pitts of forum shopping s o long as there is no flsa claim,the jurisdictional anchor to this removed action is lost.it is then in the discretion of the court under whether it is appropriate to retain the ancillary jurisdiction it properly has over plaintiff state law claims,despite the fact that the federal claims are no longer in the suit.
in prior orders,the district court also dismissed count of pitts complaint for two separate reasons.first,the district court concluded that count lacked definiteness because it failed to specify the hourly wage provided for by pitts alleged employment contract.however,because pitts agreed to amend his complaint to specify the contractual hourly rate,the district court granted pitts days to amend.but pitts never had a chance to do so because before the expiration of the days,the district court dismissed count again,this time with prejudice.specifically,the court construed the breach of contract claim as a claim for violation of nevada revised statutes and dismissed it because only the nevada labor commissioner may enforce this statute.
pitts has timely appealed all dispositive rulings of the district court.this appeal raises five issues whether a rejected rule offer of judgment made before the filing of a motion for class certification moots a putative class representative class action complaint whether pitts was untimely in seeking class certification whether flsa collective actions are incompatible with related rule state law class actions whether.abrogates nevada common law breach of contract action and whether pitts pled his breach of contract claim with sufficient specificity.we address each issue in turn 
we first address whether a rule offer of judgment for the full amount of a putative class representative individual monetary claim moots that representative class action complaint.we agree with the district court that the class action is not moot.
article iii of the constitution limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to cases or controversies.see const.art.iii,cl.the doctrine of mootness,which is embedded in article iii case or controversy requirement,requires that an actual,ongoing controversy exist at all stages of federal court proceedings.see burke barnes,d.whether the dispute between the parties was very much alive when suit was filed can not substitute for the actual case or controversy that an exercise of this c ourt jurisdiction requires.honig doe,d.a case becomes moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the litigation.powell mccormack,d.in other words,if events subsequent to the filing of the case resolve the parties dispute,we must dismiss the case as moot,see stratman leisnoi,cir dhx,allianz agf mat,cir,because w e do not have the constitutional authority to decide moot cases,foster carson,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
although the supreme court has described mootness as a constitutional impediment to the exercise of article iii jurisdiction,the court has applied the doctrine flexibly,particularly where the issues remain alive,even if the plaintiff personal stake in the outcome has become moot.matthew hall,the partially prudential doctrine of mootness,geo.the distinction between issues that have become moot and parties whose interest in the issue may have become moot is especially visible in the context of class actions.for example,in sosna iowa,d,the court considered whether an entire class action becomes moot when the class representative loses her personal stake in the outcome of the litigation after the district court certifies a class.there,the appellant filed a class action complaint challenging the constitutionality of iowa durational residency requirement for invoking the state divorce court jurisdiction.id.at.after the district court certified a class and ruled against the appellant on the merits,the appellant sought supreme court review.id.but while the case was pending before the court,the appellant had both obtained a divorce in another state and resided in iowa for more than one year.id.at.
the court explained that had the appellant sued only on her own behalf,both the fact that she now satisfies the residency requirement and the fact that she has obtained a divorce elsewhere would make this case moot and require dismissal.id.at.however,the court held that the case was not moot because by the time the appellant lost her personal stake in the outcome of the litigation,the district court had already certified a class.class certification significantly affect ed the mootness determination because w hen the district court certified the propriety of the class action,the class of unnamed persons described in the certification acquired a legal status separate from the interest asserted by appellant.id.accordingly,an article iii case or controversy existed at the time of the court review between a named defendant and a member of the class represented by the named plaintiff,even though the claim of the named plaintiff ha d become moot.id.at see also id.at although the controversy is no longer alive as to appellant sosna,it remains very much alive for the class of persons she has been certified to represent.
the court in sosna anticipated the possibility that a case might become moot with respect to the named plaintiffs before the district court could rule on class certification.in such a case,whether the certification can be said to relate back to the filing of the complaint may depend upon the circumstances of the particular case and especially the reality of the claim that otherwise the issue would evade review.id.at.
the court addressed the mootness of actions that might otherwise evade review in gerstein pugh,d.in gerstein,the named plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of certain state pretrial detention procedures.however,by the time the case reached the supreme court,the named plaintiffs had been convicted and,therefore,their pretrial detention had ended.id.at.nevertheless,the court held that t his case belongs to that narrow class of cases in which the termination of a class representative claim does not moot the claims of the unnamed members of the class.id.because the time of pretrial custody was short,it was most unlikely that any named plaintiff or potential class representative would be in pretrial custody long enough for a district judge to certify the class.id.accordingly,the named plaintiff substantive claim was one distinctly capable of repetition yet evading review and,therefore,not moot.id.
the court extended sosna in deposit guaranty national bank roper,d,and united states parole commission geraghty,d,where it held that a putative class representative may appeal the district court denial of class certification even after his individual claim becomes moot.in roper,the named plaintiffs filed a class action complaint in which they alleged that the defendant charged them usurious finance fees in violation of federal law.at.after the district court denied class certification,the defendant tendered to each named plaintiff the maximum amount that each could have recovered.id.at.although the named plaintiffs declined to accept the tender,the district court entered judgment in their favor,over their objection and in accordance with the defendant offer.id.at.after the fifth circuit reversed the denial of class certification,the supreme court granted certiorari to decide whether a tender to named plaintiffs in a class action of the amounts claimed in their individual capacities,followed by the entry of judgment in their favor on the basis of that tender,over their objection,moots the case and terminates their right to appeal the denial of class certification.id.at.
at the outset,the court noted it was important that,as here,a t no time did the named plaintiffs accept the tender in settlement of the case instead,judgment was entered in their favor by the court without their consent and the case was dismissed over their continued objections.id.at.the court then held that the case was not moot because the named plaintiffs retained an economic interest in class certification,id.at,including their desire to shift part of the costs of litigation to those who will share in its benefits if the class is certified and ultimately prevails,id.at.moreover,the court expressed concern at the ability of defendants to buy off proposed class representatives before a court can certify a class,thereby frustrat ing the objectives of class actions.id.at 
in geraghty,the court extended roper even to cases where the named plaintiff lacks any economic interest in the class certification decision.there,a federal prisoner brought a class action challenging the constitutionality of certain parole release guidelines and sought to certify a class of all federal prisoners who are or will become eligible for release on parole.at internal quotation marks omitted.after the district court denied class certification and ruled against the named plaintiff on the merits,the named plaintiff appealed.id.at.but while the appeal was pending,geraghty completed his sentence and was released from prison,an event that rendered his individual claim moot.id.at.the court noted that if the class had been certified,geraghty release would not have mooted the controversy.id.the question was whether geraghty release also mooted his appeal of the class certification ruling.the court held that it did not.
the court observed that a plaintiff who brings a class action presents two separate issues for judicial resolution.one is the claim on the merits the other is the claim that he is entitled to represent a class.id.at.discussing the latter claim,the court explained that the federal rules of civil procedure give the proposed class representative the right to have a class certified if the requirements of the rules are met.id.at.this procedural right to represent a class is more analogous to the private attorney general concept than to the type of interest traditionally thought to satisfy the personal stake requirement,but it nevertheless suffices to satisfy article iii concerns because the class certification question remains as a concrete,sharply presented issue even after the named plaintiff individual claim has expired and because vigorous advocacy of the plaintiff right to have a class certified can be assured through means other than the traditional requirement of a personal stake in the outcome.id.at.accordingly,the court held that an action brought on behalf of a class does not become moot upon expiration of the named plaintiff substantive claim,even though class certification has been denied,id.at,and if denial of class certification is reversed on appeal,the corrected ruling relates back to the date of the original denial,id.at.
finally,in county of riverside mclaughlin,d,the plaintiffs brought a class action to challenge the county policy of combining probable cause determinations with its arraignment procedures.the court noted that the plaintiffs persons incarcerated who at the time the complaint was filed had not received a probable cause determination no longer had live individual claims because they had either received a probable cause determination or been released.id.at.citing gerstein and sosna,the court repeated that the termination of a class representative claim does not moot the class claims.id.as the court explained,t hat the class was not certified until after the named plaintiffs claims had become moot does not deprive the court of jurisdiction.id.at.where the claims are inherently transitory the relation back doctrine is properly invoked to preserve the merits of the case for judicial resolution.id.citation omitted.
though sosna,gerstein,roper,geraghty,and mclaughlin do not address the precise issue before us whether a putative class action becomes moot when the named plaintiff receives an offer of settlement that fully satisfies his individual claim before he files a motion for class certification they provide several principles that guide our decision.
first,if the district court has certified a class,mooting the putative class representative claim will not moot the class action.that is so because upon certification the class acquire s a legal status separate from the interest asserted by the class representative,sosna,at,so that an article iii controversy now exists between a named defendant and a member of the certified class,id.at.at this point,a defendant may moot a class action through an offer of settlement only if he satisfies the demands of the class an offer to one can not moot the action because it is not an offer to all.
second,if the district court has denied class certification,mooting the putative class representative claim will not necessarily moot the class action.the putative class representative retains an interest in obtaining a final decision on class certification that allows him to litigate the denial of class certification on appeal.see geraghty,at roper,at.this interest may be either an individual economic interest in shift ing part of the costs of litigation to those who will share in its benefits if the class is certified and ultimately prevails,roper,at,or a interest in having a class certified if the requirements of rule are met,geraghty,at,but it nevertheless satisfies article iii concerns.if the appeal results in reversal of the class certification denial,and a class subsequently is properly certified,the merits of the class claim then may be adjudicated pursuant to the holding in sosna.id.at.
third,even if the district court has not yet addressed the class certification issue,mooting the putative class representative claims will not necessarily moot the class action.s ome claims are so inherently transitory that the trial court will not have even enough time to rule on a motion for class certification before the proposed representative individual interest expires.mclaughlin,at internal quotation marks omitted.an inherently transitory claim will certainly repeat as to the class,either because t he individual could nonetheless suffer repeated harm or because it is certain that other persons similarly situated will have the same complaint.gerstein,at.in such cases,the named plaintiff claim is capable of repetition,yet evading review,and the relation back doctrine is properly invoked to preserve the merits of the case for judicial resolution,mclaughlin,at see also geraghty,at sosna,at.application of the relation back doctrine in this context thus avoids the spectre of plaintiffs filing lawsuit after lawsuit,only to see their claims mooted before they can be resolved.
applying these principles to our case,we conclude that terrible unaccepted offer of judgment did not moot pitts case because his claim is transitory in nature and may otherwise evade review.accordingly,if the district court were to certify a class,certification would relate back to the filing of the complaint.we recognize that the canonical case such as gerstein or mclaughlin involves an inherently transitory claim and,correspondingly,a constantly changing putative class.wade kirkland,cir.but we see no reason to restrict application of the doctrine only to cases involving inherently transitory claims.where,as here,a defendant seeks to buy off the small individual claims of the named plaintiffs,the analogous claims of the class though not inherently transitory become no less transitory than inherently transitory claims.thus,although pitts claims are not inherently transitory as a result of being time sensitive,they are acutely susceptible to mootness in light of the defendant tactic of picking off lead plaintiffs with a rule offer to avoid a class action.weiss regal collections,cir internal citation omitted.the end result is the same a claim transitory by its very nature and one transitory by virtue of the defendant litigation strategy share the reality that both claims would evade review.
invoking the relation back doctrine in this context furthers the purposes of rule.where the class claims are so economically insignificant that no single plaintiff can afford to maintain the lawsuit on his own,rule affords the plaintiffs a realistic day in court by allowing them to pool their claims.phillips petroleum shutts,d see also roper,at where it is not economically feasible to obtain relief within the traditional framework of a multiplicity of small individual suits for damages,aggrieved persons may be without any effective redress unless they may employ the device.a rule allowing a class action to become moot simply because the defendant has sought to buy off the individual private claims of the named plaintiffs before the named plaintiffs have a chance to file a motion for class certification would thus contravene rule core concern the aggregation of similar,small,but otherwise doomed claims.roper,at see also weiss,at a llowing the defendants here to pick off a representative plaintiff with an offer of judgment less than two months after the complaint is filed may undercut the viability of the class action procedure,and frustrate the objectives of this procedural mechanism for aggregating small claims.it would effectively ensure that claims that are too economically insignificant to be brought on their own would never have their day in court.see zeidman ray mcdermott,cir i n those cases in which it is financially feasible to pay off successive named plaintiffs,the defendants would have the option to preclude a viable class action from ever reaching the certification stage.stewart cheek zeehandelar,llp,t reating settlement offers as mooting the named plaintiffs claims would have the disastrous effect of enabling defendants to essentially of rule.citation omitted.and even if it does not discourage potential claimants,it may waste judicial resources by stimulating successive suits brought by others claiming aggrievement.weiss,at quoting roper,at.
accordingly,we hold that an unaccepted rule offer of the full amount of the named plaintiff individual claim and made before the named plaintiff files a motion for class not moot a class action 
if the named plaintiff can still file a timely motion for class certification,the named plaintiff may continue to represent the class until the district court decides the class certification issue.then,if the district court certifies the class,certification relates back to the filing of the complaint.once the class has been certified,the case may continue despite full satisfaction of the named plaintiff individual claim because an offer of judgment to the named plaintiff fails to satisfy the demands of the class.see sosna,at.conversely,if the district court denies class certification,under roper and geraghty,the plaintiff may still pursue a limited appeal of the class certification issue.only once the denial of class certification is final does the defendant offer if still available moot the merits of the case because the plaintiff has been offered all that he can possibly recover through litigation.see sandoz,at.we agree with the district court that terrible offer of judgment to pitts did not moot his class action.
we next address whether the district court abused its discretion in finding that pitts could no longer file a timely motion for class certification.a district court abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law,when it rests its decision on clearly erroneous findings of fact,or when we are left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment.united states hinkson,cir citation omitted.here,the district court held that pitts was untimely in seeking class certification because he failed to file his motion to certify prior to the initial discovery deadline.with respect,we think the district court committed a clear error of judgment.
we acknowledge that pitts did not file a motion for class certification by january,the initial discovery deadline.but at the time of the district court ruling,pitts had already asked for and received an extension of this deadline until apr
