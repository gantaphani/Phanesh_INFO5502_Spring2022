opinion on remand 
introduction 
this appeal involves certification of a class action under the consumers legal remedies act clra,et and the unfair competition law ucl bus,et.the action is based on defendant alleged failure to disclose that the color composition of its roof tiles would erode away,leaving bare concrete,well before the end of the tiles represented lifetime.
in a prior published opinion,we reversed the trial court order denying certification of the proposed clra and ucl classes.mcadams monier,d,as mod.june.the state supreme court granted review and deferred the matter in light of another case on its docket,review granted and opn.ordered nonpub.the pending case,in re tobacco ii cases cal th,d,tobacco ii,concerned two questions of standing arising from the amendment to the ucl by proposition.the state high court has now directed us to vacate our decision and reconsider it in light of tobacco ii.mcadams,supra,judg.vacated and cause remanded d.
in doing so,we reiterate our position involving the clra,as tobacco ii concerned only the ucl.we agree with case law that an inference of common reliance may be applied to a clra class that alleges a material misrepresentation consisting of a failure to disclose a particular fact.massachusetts mutual life ins.superior court th,d massachusetts mutual.
as for the ucl,we remand for the trial court to determine if the representative plaintiff meets the proposition standing requirements,as interpreted in tobacco ii.otherwise,we find the ucl action suitable for class certification.
consequently,we reverse the trial court order denying certification of the proposed clra and ucl classes.we do so,however,with one proviso as to defining these classes,which we will explain in this opinion the members of these classes,prior to purchasing or obtaining their monier roof tile product,had to have been exposed to a statement along the lines that the roof tile would last years,or would have a permanent color,or would be.see tobacco ii,supra,cal th at,d.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff tim mcadams,on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated plaintiff,filed a class action lawsuit against defendant monier,monier for violating the clra and the ucl 
plaintiff alleges that monier,a manufacturer and marketer of roof tiles,has made representations to class members over a period of years along three lines that its tiles are free from manufacturing defects and will remain structurally sound for a period of years are warranted for years and will last a lifetime and do not wear out what we will term the representation have a permanent color glaze that requires no resurfacing have a virtually impenetrable color glaze have color that will last as long as the tile,with red tiles remaining red and brown tiles remaining brown with some softening of color to a uniform finish will always look good and have permanent color and never lose their basic aesthetic appeal what we term the permanent color representation and need no care at all and require no maintenance what we term the representation.
plaintiff alleges that monier,against the backdrop of these representations,knowingly failed to disclose that its tiles are inherently defective such that their material composition causes the exterior surface of the tiles including the glaze and color exterior to deteriorate,degrade,and disperse from the t iles well in advance of their warranted useful life.in short,plaintiff alleges that monier knew but failed to disclose a particular fact that the color composition of its tiles would erode away well before the end of the tiles represented life,leaving plain noncolored concrete.
plaintiff moved to certify two classes 
a clra class,comprising i all individuals in the state of california who own homes for personal,family or household use with roof tiles sold by monier company,monier roof tile,or monier between january,and august,the tiles and ii all californian individuals who paid to replace or repair such tiles excepting trial judge and family,and defendants and an ownership class,comprising i all other individuals or entities in the state of california who own structures with roof tiles sold by monier company,monier roof tile,or monier between january,and august,the tiles and ii all californian individuals and entities who paid to replace or repair such tiles excepting trial judge and family,and defendants.
the trial court denied plaintiff class certification motion.the court reasoned that each class member individually would have to prove the particular misrepresentation on which he or she relied and the resulting damage,and that plaintiff mcadams,who bought his monier roof tiles from an independent distributor,was not typical of those who bought from monier directly,or from a home builder,or from a prior homeowner.
plaintiff appealed the order denying class certification,which is an appealable order.linder thrifty oil cal th,d.
discussion 
standard of review 
an appellate court will not disturb a trial court ruling on class certification which is supported by substantial evidence unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous legal assumptions were made citation.richmond dart industries,cal d,richmond accord,caro procter gamble th,d caro.
i.the clra class 
the clra et,enacted in,established a nonexclusive statutory remedy for unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer citation.citation.the purposes of the act are to protect consumers against unfair and deceptive business practices and to provide efficient and economical procedures to secure such protection.wang massey chevrolet th,d wang.the clra shall be liberally construed.
any consumer who suffers any damage as a result of the use or employment by any person of a method,act or practice declared to be unlawful by the clra,pursuant to section may bring an action against that person to recover actual damages,injunctive relief,restitution of property,punitive damages,and any other relief the court deems proper,subd.a.wang,supra,th at,d.
under the clra,c onsumer means an individual who seeks or acquires,by purchase or lease,any goods or services for personal,family,or household purposes and p erson means an individual,partnership,corporation,limited liability company,association,or other group,however organized,subds.c,d.
a class action under the clra is governed by section,which specifies as to class certification as follows 
b the court shall permit the suit to be maintained on behalf of all members of the represented class if all of the following conditions exist 
it is impracticable to bring all members of the class before the court.
the questions of law or fact common to the class are substantially similar and predominate over the questions affecting the individual members.
the claims or defenses of the representative plaintiffs are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.
the representative plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class,subd.b.
here,plaintiff alleges in his complaint that,against the backdrop of monier representations of,permanent color,and roof tiles,monier knowingly failed to disclose that its t iles are inherently defective such that their material composition causes the exterior surface of the product including the glaze and color exterior to deteriorate,degrade,and to lose coating and color well in advance of their warranted useful life.italics added.in the complaint,plaintiff explained that the permanent glaze on monier color t iles breaks down and o nce the color coating becomes friable,it detaches from the tile leaving the bare concrete exposed the color loss is a loss of mass of the concrete product t he permanent glaze and color is not permanent at all and claimants have been told that their remedy is to get their roof tiles painted or sealed.
as a result of this alleged failure to disclose,plaintiff alleges that monier violated section,subdivision a of the clra by r epresenting that its color roof tiles have characteristics which they do not have and violated section,subdivision a by r epresenting that such tiles are of a particular standard,quality,or grade when they are of another,subd.a.
the trial court denied plaintiff motion to certify the clra class on two grounds.first,the court found that class members would have to prove individually the existence of liability,reliance,and damages,thereby failing to meet the common issues requirement of section,subdivision b.and,second,the court found that representative plaintiff mcadams clra claim was not typical,thereby failing to meet the typicality requirement of section,subdivision b.the trial court centered these findings on its view that class members received different representations regarding the roof tiles in four different types of purchase transactions buying from monier,or from an independent distributor,or from a home builder,or from a prior homeowner,and therefore individual questions,particularly of liability and reliance,predominated.we disagree.
we conclude the trial court misperceived the nature of plaintiff clra class action.the class action is based on a single,specific,alleged material misrepresentation monier knew but failed to disclose that its color roof tiles would erode to bare concrete long before the life span of the tiles was up.as we shall explain,in this context,class treatment is appropriate.
on the issues of liability and reliance,the decision in massachusetts mutual guides our analysis of the suitability of plaintiff clra action for class treatment.
in massachusetts mutual,the court upheld class certification of people who,over the course of years,purchased a particular type of life insurance policy the premium payment plan from mass mutual.mass mutual represented that,with an policy,a discretionary dividend paid on accrued premiums would,over time,become large enough to pay the annual premium.massachusetts mutual,supra,th at,d.the plaintiff class in massachusetts mutual alleged,however,that mass mutual failed to disclose that it had no intention of maintaining its discretionary dividend rate.ibid.
quoting section,subdivision a,the court of appeal in massachusetts mutual noted that relief under the clra is limited to a ny consumer who suffers any damage as a result of the use or employment by any person of a method,act,or practice unlawful under the act.massachusetts mutual,supra,th at,d,italics added by massachusetts mutual.the court added that this limitation on relief requires that plaintiffs in a clra action show not only that a defendant conduct was deceptive but that the deception caused them harm.see also caro,supra,th at,d.
the court in massachusetts mutual concluded,however,that this causation requirement under the clra did not render the case before it unsuitable for class treatment.drawing from two state supreme court decisions,vasquez superior court cal d,vasquez and occidental land,superior court cal d,occidental,massachusetts mutual concluded that this causation requirement can be satisfied if the record permits an inference of common reliance to the class.massachusetts mutual,supra,th at,d.
vasquez involved a class action based on fraud.the plaintiffs in vasquez alleged that defendants,using a memorized script,materially misrepresented the quality and value of freezers and frozen food that plaintiffs had purchased.vasquez quoted a treatise that w here representations have been made in regard to a material matter and action has been taken,in the absence of evidence showing the contrary,it will be presumed that the representations were relied on vasquez,supra,cal d at,quoting williston on contracts ed.and vasquez stated that if material misrepresentations were made to the class members,at least an inference of reliance would arise as to the entire class.vasquez,supra,at,accord,massachusetts mutual,supra,th at,d.in short,as massachusetts mutual noted,plaintiffs may satisfy their burden of showing causation as to each class member by showing materiality as to all.massachusetts mutual,at,d,quoting blackie barrack cir,fn.
occidental also involved a class action based on fraud,and employed vasquez inference of common reliance.occidental,supra,cal d at.in occidental,the defendant developer of a planned development provided a written report to home purchasers showing their cost for maintaining common areas and facilities,but failed to include in the report substantial costs the developer had been subsidizing.id.at.the occidental court held that class treatment of claims growing out of this failure to disclose the subsidy was appropriate.as in vasquez,an inference of reliance could be established on a common basis if a material false representation was made to persons whose acts thereafter were consistent with reliance upon the representation.occidental,supra,cal d at,see massachusetts mutual,supra,th at,d.
based on vasquez and occidental,massachusetts mutual concluded like the circumstances discussed in vasquez and occidental,here the record permits an inference of common reliance.plaintiffs contend mass mutual failed to disclose its own concerns about the high discretionary dividend rate it was paying and that those concerns would have been material to any reasonable person contemplating the purchase of an premium payment plan.if plaintiffs are successful in proving these facts,the purchases common to each class member would in turn be sufficient to give rise to the inference of common reliance on representations which were materially deficient.massachusetts mutual,supra,th at,d see also wilens td waterhouse group,th,d wilens.
the record here permits an inference of common reliance among the clra class.plaintiff alleges that monier made a single,material misrepresentation to class members that consisted of a failure to disclose a particular fact regarding its roof tiles.plaintiff has tendered evidence that monier knew but failed to disclose to class members that the color composition of its roof tiles would erode to bare concrete well before the end of the tiles represented life and that this failure to disclose would have been material to any reasonable person who purchased tiles in light of the representation,or the permanent color representation,or the representation.if plaintiff is successful in proving these facts,the purchases common to each class is,purchases pursuant to this alleged failure to disclose in light of the life,permanent color,or be sufficient to permit an inference of common reliance among the class on the material misrepresentation comprising the alleged failure to disclose.this is also why the clra class definition is subject to the proviso specified at the end of this opinion introduction.see ante.
the trial court rejected this analysis.citing a decision from this court,outboard marine superior court d.outboard marine,the trial court reasoned that if monier made no representation to an owner,why would that owner think the color lasts for years concealment of a fact is merely the flip side of every affirmative misrepresentation,and p laintiff s claims are actually based upon affirmative representations that allegedly misled them.
in outboard marine,however,we held that the clra,pursuant to its list of proscribed practices in section,includes the concealment or suppression of material facts.our statement there that every affirmative misrepresentation of fact works a concealment of the true fact outboard marine,supra,d at.simply rejected a view that two distinct causes of action under section could be stated,one based on the affirmative misrepresentation and the other on its corresponding concealment id.at.after this quoted statement in outboard marine,we added that,in the clra context,f raud or deceit may consist of the suppression of a fact by one who is bound to disclose it or who gives information of other facts which are likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact.id.at,italics added.
here,plaintiff clra class action is based on an alleged failure to disclose a material fact that is misleading in light of other facts affirmative representations that monier did disclose.plaintiff alleges that monier disclosed certain facts regarding its roof permanent color and were likely to mislead consumers in light of monier failure to disclose the allegedly known fact that the color composition of its roof tiles would erode to bare concrete well before the represented life of the tiles.
the decision in bardin daimlerchrysler th,d bardin illustrates how outboard marine applies to an alleged misrepresentation under the clra that comprises a failure to disclose.in bardin,the court concluded that the plaintiffs there could not state a clra cause of action,in the failure to disclose context,based on an allegation that the defendant auto manufacturer used tubular steel in its exhaust manifolds instead of more durable and more expensive cast iron.bardin,supra,th at,d.after quoting the outboard marine language set forth above,bardin concluded plaintiffs claim for violation of the clra fails because their complaint neither alleged facts showing defendant auto manufacturer was bound to disclose its use of tubular steel exhaust manifolds,nor alleged facts showing auto manufacturer ever gave any information of other facts which could have the likely effect of misleading the public for want of communication of the fact it used tubular steel exhaust manifolds.the complaint did not allege a single affirmative representation by manufacturer regarding the exhaust manifolds.id.at,d.in short,the complaint in bardin did not allege that the manufacturer had made any representations regarding the composition of the exhaust manifolds.see also daugherty american honda motor,th,d daugherty although a claim may be stated under the clra in terms constituting fraudulent omissions,to be actionable the omission must be contrary to a representation actually made by the defendant,or an omission of a fact the defendant was obliged to disclose id.at,d.
here,plaintiff has alleged affirmative representations by monier regarding its roof lifetime permanent color and were likely to mislead consumers by failing to disclose the known fact that the color composition of monier roof tiles erodes to bare concrete well before their life span.
for these reasons,we conclude that,as to the elements of liability and reliance causation,plaintiff clra cause of action,based on the alleged failure to disclose just noted,is suitable for class treatment.
this analysis also dispenses with the trial court concern that plaintiff mcadams claim is typical of only one of the four kinds of roof tile purchasers in the proposed who bought from an independent distributor and relied on monier literature the other three kinds of purchasers involving purchases from monier,from home builders,or from individuals selling their homes.as we have seen,the alleged material misrepresentation in this case,properly viewed,does not encompass an array of varying transactions and misrepresentations,but a single failure to disclose a particular known fact.in this milieu,plaintiff mcadams presents a typical claim based on that single,specific failure to disclose we also pause here to note that a cause of action under the clra may be established independent of any contractual relationship between the parties.see,subd.a wang,supra,th at,d any consumer who suffers any damage as a result of the use or employment by any person of a method,act or practice declared to be unlawful by section may bring an action against that person see also chamberlan ford motor d,plaintiffs who purchased used cars have standing to bring clra claims,despite the fact that they never entered into a transaction directly with defendant auto manufacturer who manufactured,sold,and distributed automobiles containing an allegedly defective engine part.
that leaves the issue of individual damages.a class action can be maintained even if each class member must at some point individually show his or her eligibility for recovery or the amount of his or her damages,so long as each class member would not be required to litigate substantial and numerous factually unique questions to determine his or her individual right to recover.acree general motors acceptance th,d.here,the claims of all class members stem from the same source monier failure to disclose that the color composition of its roof tiles may erode to bare concrete prematurely.see chamberlan ford motor.to obtain damages,each class member will have to show the representation made to him or her that accompanied this failure to disclose,lifetime,permanent color,or the like,and will have to show the amount of his or her damages.but these two showings do not invoke substantial and numerous factually unique questions to determine the individual right to recover damages,and therefore are not a proper basis on which to deny class certification.acree,supra,at,d accord,wilens,supra,th at,d.
aside from the clra class requirement of common issues,subd.b involving here the issues of liability,reliance,and damages and the requirement of a typical claim on the part of the class representative,subd.b,there has been no suggestion that plaintiff failed to meet the remaining clra class requirements,as specified in section,subdivision b,impracticable to bring all class members before court representative plaintiff will adequately protect class interests,subd.b,respectively.we have concluded,as to the requirements of common issues and typical claim,that the trial court used improper criteria and made erroneous legal assumptions in denying certification of the clra class.richmond,supra,cal d at.accordingly,we reverse the order denying certification of the proposed clra class 
ii.the ucl class 
the purpose of the ucl bus,et is to protect both consumers and competitors by promoting fair competition in commercial markets for goods and services.citation.citation.it defines unfair competition to mean and include any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising and any act prohibited by the false advertising law et.citation.
the scope of the ucl is quite broad.citations.because the statute,defining unfair competition is framed in the disjunctive,a business practice need only meet one of the three criteria unlawful,unfair or fraudulent to be considered unfair competition.citation.
a cause of action for unfair competition under the ucl may be established independent of any contractual relationship between the parties.mckell washington mutual,th,d,quoting and citing kasky nike,cal th,d.
the ucl is limited to injunctive,restitutionary and related relief.in pertinent part,section defines the relief available the court may make such orders or judgments as may be necessary to prevent the use of any practice which constitutes unfair competition,or as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property,real or personal,which may have been acquired by means of such unfair competition.
a ucl action may be brought by public prosecutors or by private persons.proposition,an initiative measure approved at the november general election,restricted the standing of private persons to bring ucl actions.prior to proposition,the ucl authorized any private person to sue on behalf of the general public by granting standing to any person acting for the interests of itself,its members or the general public.former.this broad grant of standing proved too tempting to some unethical private lawyers who brought frivolous ucl lawsuits against small businesses even though the lawyers had no client or evidence that anyone had been damaged or misled.voter information guide,argument in favor of.
proposition was designed to counter this abuse of the ucl.the proposition,among other things,amended section and added a provision to section of the ucl.now,under section,standing for a private person under the ucl is limited to a person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.and under section,a private person may pursue representative claims or relief on behalf of others only if the claimant meets the standing requirements of section and complies with section of the code of civil procedure which specifies the requirements to maintain a class action.
