opinion of the court 
in a labor dispute over unpaid wages,plaintiffs gained certification of an class under the fair labor standards act and then sought certification of a.b class under the pennsylvania wage payment collection law.the district court granted the rule certification.at issue is whether the district court should have exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the class under.
plaintiffs are hourly employees at defendant tyson foods two plants in new holland,pennsylvania lancaster county.plant one employees work on the production line slaughtering birds and producing meat for direct sale or further processing.those at plant two process the chicken meat,producing prepared,packed chicken products,like chicken nuggets,chicken tenders,chicken patties,and buffalo wings.
animal flesh,blood,and fecal matter are present throughout both plants.to protect against disease and safety hazards,tyson employees are required to perform donning,doffing,and sanitizing activities.this entails putting on protective hairnets,earplugs,safety goggles,cotton smocks,gloves,and plastic the start of their shift,and rinsing their clothing and washing their hands at the end of their shift.employees receive two unpaid meal periods per shift,and must don,doff,and sanitize at the beginning and end of these breaks 
tyson ordinarily does not pay its employees for time spent donning and doffing the plaintiff employees are not organized nor do they work under a written contract.there is no collective bargaining.
in august,plaintiffs filed suit against tyson under both federal law the fair labor standards act,and state law the pennsylvania wage payment collection law,on behalf of themselves and similarly situated at tyson chicken processing complex.
on october,plaintiffs sought collective treatment of their flsa action under the federal statute provisions.b n o employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.plaintiffs did not seek class certification on the wpcl action at that time.
on january,the district court granted plaintiffs request to issue notice to prospective class members under the flsa action.the court notice stated,in part,the court has not yet determined that the claims under the pennsylvania wpcl can be pursued as a class action,and thus your right to participate in that claim will depend on a later decision by the court.
on march,tyson mailed out the notice to prospective flsa class members.on june,tyson filed a motion to close the class period.at that time,current and former percent of the allegedly eligible elected to join the flsa action by filing written consent forms.plaintiffs contested the motion to close,claiming that a substantial number of prospective plaintiffs never received notice and that tyson improperly discouraged its current and former employees from participating in the action.the record showed that putative flsa class members never received notice of the action because tyson mailed the notice to the wrong address 
on july,the district court closed the class period and denied plaintiffs motion to reissue notice.the class consisted of current and former employees.the district court later dismissed,on summary judgment,the claims of of those employees as barred by the statute of limitations.all parties acknowledge that the current size of the flsa class is persons.
on december,the district court closed discovery.nearly two months later,on february,plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the supplemental wpcl action under.plaintiffs motion for class treatment under the supplemental action was filed months after their motion to certify the federal flsa action.the district court heard arguments on whether plaintiffs could bring a wpcl action because they had not pleaded a contract claim,the predicate for a wpcl action.on may,plaintiffs argued for the first time that the wpcl action was grounded in an implied contract between tyson and its hourly employees 
on july,despite tyson objections that the wpcl certification motion was late and that the implied contract argument was new,the district court granted plaintiffs motion to certify the state wpcl action under.b the class,an class,consisted of approximately persons,including approximately employees hired after notice was sent to the flsa class.
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs flsa action under and exercised supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs action under.tyson disputes the district court exercise of supplemental jurisdiction.tyson petitioned for leave to appeal the certification order under.f,which was granted.we have jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeal under e and.f.
in,congress enacted the fair labor standards act to govern the maintenance of standard hour and wage practices.the flsa requires employers to pay their employees at least a specified minimum hourly wage for work performed,and to pay one and times the employee regular rate of pay for hours worked in excess of forty hours per week.employers who violate these provisions are liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages,or their unpaid overtime compensation,as the case may be,and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.b.
the legislation propelled thousands of lawsuits.the term portal to portal represents an employee work day from starting time to quitting time.jewell ridge coal united mine workers.jackson,dissenting connors beth energy mines,cir work day was eight hours from including thirty minutes for lunch.between july,and january,employees around the country filed such actions under the flsa.cong.rec.
the dramatic increase in these suits was a result of the supreme court decision in anderson mount clemens pottery,which expanded the scope of compensable working time for flsa purposes.see cong.rec.w hat is the cause of this widespread litigation the immediate incident which apparently brought this vast flood of litigation upon our nation was the decision of the supreme court in anderson.responding to this increase in litigation,congress sought to define and limit the jurisdiction of the courts through the act,ch,b,stat.cong.rec.t he attention of the senate is called to a dramatic influx of litigation,involving vast alleged liability,which has suddenly entered the federal courts of the nation.noting the immensity of the litigation problem,id.at,congress attempted to strike a balance to maintain employees rights but curb the number of lawsuits.under the act,an flsa action for overtime pay could be maintained by one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated.b.but the statute contained an express provision no employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.id.
because the act amendment changed participation in an flsa class from to,flsa plaintiffs could not certify a class under,even though federal subject matter jurisdiction obtained,lusardi lechner,cir courts have generally recognized that rule class actions may not be used under flsa b.james moore et,moore federal practice ed.rule is inapplicable to class proceedings under the flsa.the principal difference between flsa class actions and.class actions is that prospective plaintiffs under the flsa must consent to join the class.
as noted,plaintiffs here obtained federal court jurisdiction when they filed a flsa action,alleging that tyson was liable to pay its employees for time spent donning and doffing.the district court ordered notice to prospective class members and later certified a class of persons who consented in writing to become party plaintiffs the certification of this class is not problematic.but tyson contends plaintiffs obtained federal jurisdiction,then used their supplemental wpcl action and.provisions as an end run around the act clear congressional mandate in favor of collective actions 
at issue is whether the district court properly exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the wpcl action.
in,congress broadened district courts ability to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims.the statute explicitly provided for supplemental jurisdiction for claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.id supplemental jurisdiction was not available where expressly provided otherwise by federal statute or under one of the statute enumerated exceptions.id.
section combined older notions of pendent jurisdiction and ancillary jurisdiction.under the statute,which codified many of the principles enunciated in united mine workers gibbs,d,a district court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction where claims share a common nucleus of operative fact with the claims that supported the district court original jurisdiction.see also a krell prudential ins.of am.in re prudential ins.am.sales practice litig.agent actions,cir section does not permit courts to take jurisdiction over tangentially related claims.the issue is whether there is a common nucleus of operative fact and whether the claims are part of the same case or controversy under article iii.supplemental jurisdiction promotes judicial economy,convenience and fairness to litigants.gibbs,at.
under section,a district court has authority to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims arising from the same case or controversy as the federal claim.here,the district court determined the flsa and wpcl actions arose from the same controversy and shared a common nucleus of operative fact.this ruling was not an abuse of discretion.where the same acts violate parallel federal and state laws,the common nucleus of operative facts is obvious.lyon whisman,cir.the flsa and wpcl are parallel federal and state laws and the independent actions both address whether tyson employees should be paid for donning and doffing time,sufficiently demonstrating a common nucleus of operative fact.
still,section provides specific exceptions to supplemental jurisdiction.there is no supplemental jurisdiction where a federal statute expressly provides otherwise,either through direct preclusion or preemption of claims a there are also explicit circumstances under which a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.c.at issue is whether this case involves one of those circumstances.
a district court has the responsibility to manage complex litigation.that responsibility requires a court to determine whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over pendent claims and parties.in enacting section,congress intended to enhance a district court ability to gain jurisdiction over pendent claims and parties while providing those courts with the discretion to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction in several express circumstances.it has consistently been recognized that pendent jurisdiction is a doctrine of discretion,not of plaintiff right.gibbs,at.
because the flsa does not expressly address supplemental jurisdiction,we consider the explicit statutory circumstances enunciated in section c under which a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.in codifying much of gibbs,congress granted district court judges discretion to determine whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.c see also new rock asset partners preferred entity advancements,cir discretion in district court judges helps promote the economical resolution of cases.district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction where 
the claim raises a novel or complex issue of state law,
the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction,
the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction,or 
in exceptional circumstances,there are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction.
the dispositive provision here appears to focus on whether the action substantially predominates over the flsa action.where the state issues substantially predominate,whether in terms of proof,of the scope of the issues raised,or of the comprehensiveness of the remedy sought,the state claims may be dismissed without prejudice and left for resolution to state tribunals.gibbs,at.generally,a district court will find substantial predomination where a state claim constitutes the real body of a case,to which the federal claim is only an appendage only where permitting litigation of all claims in the district court can accurately be described as allowing a federal tail to wag what is in substance a state dog.borough of mifflin lancaster,cir citation omitted quoting gibbs,at.
our inquiry here centers on the terms of proof and the scope of the issues raised in the flsa and wpcl actions as we have held,the wpcl does not create a right to compensation r ather,it provides a statutory remedy when the employer breaches a contractual obligation to pay earned wages.the contract between the parties governs in determining whether specific wages are earned.antol esposto,cir quoting weldon kraft,cir.because tyson employees do not work under an employment contract or a collective bargaining agreement,plaintiffs will have to establish the formation of an implied oral contract between tyson and its employees.even then,whether an implied contract may give rise to a claim under the wpcl has never been addressed by the pennsylvania state courts and will require additional testimony and proof to substantiate beyond that required for the flsa action given the importance of the legal scheme in pennsylvania,the scope of the state issues may substantially predominate over the more straightforward federal scheme.
another countervailing interest in relegating the wpcl claims here to state court is congress express preference for actions for the federal cause of action.congress interest in these matters is manifest.for policy reasons articulated in the legislative history,congress chose to limit the scope of representative actions for overtime pay and minimum wage violations.
but the interest in joining these actions is strong as well.as noted,the actions share a common nucleus of operative fact and they arise from the same case or controversy.moreover,joinder would permit the district court to efficiently manage the overall litigation.were supplemental jurisdiction not to obtain,and assuming the statute of limitations has not run,plaintiffs could file the wpcl action in state court and request an class on behalf of themselves and other employes similarly situated.a b 
as we analyze the different levels of proof required and the relevant federal and state interests,the disparity in numbers here gives us pause.in terms of the number of plaintiffs,the sheer difference in numbers between the two prospective classes,as opposed to,may constitute substantial predomination by the state wpcl action under section.
generally,the distinction between and classes is crucial.under most circumstances,the class will be greater in number,perhaps even exponentially greater.classes have numbered in the millions.see in re prudential,at.the aggregation of claims,particularly as class actions,profoundly affects the substantive rights of the parties to the litigation.notably,aggregation affects the dynamics for discovery,trial,negotiation and settlement,and can bring hydraulic pressure to bear on defendants.the more aggregation,the greater the effect on the litigation.
but the size of a prospective class is important for another reason.within the universe of possible claimants,it determines how many prospective plaintiffs remain outside the class structure who are able to bring their own individual suits.a large class with few claimants with viable claims remaining outside is more likely to result in a resolution bringing global peace.conversely,a smaller class in relation to the universe of possible claimants,usually the result of an structure,will leave open the possibility of more suits,assuming these are actions that can be maintained individually.
we do not tout the relative merits of either approach.for our purposes,it is sufficient to note that mandating an class or an class is a crucial polic
