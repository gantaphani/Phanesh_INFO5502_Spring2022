defendants appellants,commissioners of the new york state office of temporary and disability assistance and of the new york state department of health,appeal from an order entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york richard howell,judge granting declaratory and injunctive relief against them and in favor of plaintiffsappellees,who are applicants for,or recipients of,medicaid home health services who are not solely challenging any decision regarding medicaid eligibility.
plaintiffs allege that they have a statutory right,enforceable under,to an opportunity for medicaid fair hearings.plaintiffs further allege that this right,as construed by an applicable federal regulation,entitles them to final administrative action within days of their fair hearing requests,and that defendants violated this right.
the district court agreed.it declared that final administrative action includes the holding of medicaid fair hearings,the issuance of fair hearing decisions,and the implementation of any relief ordered in those decisions.and it permanently enjoined defendants to ensure that final administrative action so defined is implemented within days of plaintiffs fair hearing requests.
we affirm in part the order of the district court,because we conclude that plaintiffs have a right to a medicaid hearing and decision ordinarily within days of their fair hearing requests,and that such right is enforceable under.but we also conclude that the district court permanent injunction is overbroad because final administrative action refers not to the implementation of relief ordered in fair hearing decisions,but to the holding of fair hearings and to the issuance of fair hearing decisions.accordingly,we vacate in part the order of the district court,and we remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
overview of medicaid and the fair hearing.medicaid.
medicaid is a cooperative program through which the federal government provides financial assistance to states so that they may furnish medical care to needy individuals.wilder.hosp.ass n,the federal and state governments share the cost of medicaid,but each state government administers its own medicaid plan.see.dep t of soc.servs.leavitt,cir.state medicaid plans must,however,comply with applicable federal law and regulations.see.
any state that participates in medicaid must designate a single state agency state agency to administer or to supervise the administration of the state medicaid plan.see a.although the state agency may delegate to local entities the performance of certain responsibilities,see.e,the state agency must h ave methods to keep itself currently informed of the adherence of local entities to the state plan provisions and the agency procedures for determining eligibility,and t ake corrective action to ensure their adherence.
b.the fair hearing system.
applicable federal law and regulations.
states that participate in medicaid must grant an opportunity for a fair hearing before the state agency to any individual whose claim for medical assistance under the plan is denied or is not acted upon with reasonable promptness.a.
section of title of the code of federal regulations entitled hearing decisions provides that the state agency must take final administrative action o rdinarily,within days of the date a fair hearing is requested.see f ii regulation.the phrase final administrative action is not defined in the regulation or in the medicaid act.
new york fair hearing system.
in new york,the state agency responsible for administering medicaid is the new york state department of health doh.see soc.serv.law a.
in accordance with federal law,the doh has established a medicaid fair hearing system,which purportedly allows individuals an opportunity to be heard with respect to claims for medical assistance that are denied or are not acted upon with reasonable promptness.a see soc.serv.law.the doh has elected to delegate to the new york state office of temporary and disability assistance otda the duty to conduct medicaid fair hearings.but the doh itself remains responsible for making final administrative determinations and issuing final decisions,see soc.serv.law h,and for ensuring the fair hearing system compliance with federal law and regulations,see.
ii.the instant matter.
a.the complaint.
plaintiffs in this class action are residents of new york city who applied for or received home health services and who requested or will request fair hearings to challenge the denial,reduction,or termination of such services.
for purposes of this appeal,plaintiffs allege that doh and otda collectively,defendants failed to take ensure final administrative action within days from the date plaintiffs request fair hearings challenging the denial,discontinuance reduction of medicaid home health services day claim.am.compl.according to plaintiffs,this conduct violated their statutory right to an opportunity for medicaid fair hearings,see a a right which,as construed by the regulation,allegedly entitles plaintiffs to final administrative action o rdinarily,within days from the dates they requested fair hearings,see f ii.see id.
plaintiffs claim they may enforce the foregoing statutory right as construed by the regulation through an action under.
proceedings in the district court.
following discovery,plaintiffs moved for class certification and for partial summary judgment on the day claim.defendants for summary judgment,arguing primarily that there is no cause of action for the alleged deficiencies in medicaid fair hearing procedures.shakhnes ex rel.shakhnes eggleston,d.
by memorandum opinion order filed september,order,the district court certified plaintiffs proposed class,granted partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs on the day claim,and denied defendants for summary judgment.see shakhnes,d at.
first,the district court held that the fair hearing requirement in a is enforceable through a cause of action under.see id.at.
second,the district court concluded that the regulation day requirement defines the content of the statutory right to a fair hearing.that is,the district court held that the ordinarily,within days requirement defines the temporal element of a cause of action for enforcement of a.id.at quoting f.
in short,the district court concluded that plaintiffs have a cause of action to enforce their statutory right to an opportunity for a fair hearing,as defined by the regulation requirement that final administrative action be taken within the specified time frame.based on the record evidence,the district court concluded that defendants violated that right.
the district court subsequently issued an order granting declaratory and injunctive relief in favor of plaintiffs.see order,shakhnes ex rel.shakhnes eggleston,civ,ecf order.
in pertinent part,the district court declared that 
final administrative action occurs when defendants,separately or collectively,have scheduled a fair hearing,held the fair hearing,issued a decision after fair hearing dafh,and taken all actions necessary to implement the relief ordered in the dafh.for cases in which care is ordered by the dafh,final administrative action occurs on the date on which an aide goes to the appellant home to provide the ordered home health care services.
the district court also directed defendants to ensure that final administrative action as defined above is provided within days of a request for a fair hearing.id.at.
subsequent proceedings.
defendants now appeal.
first,they argue that the district court erred by concluding that the regulation merely flesh es out the meaning of the statutory right to an opportunity for a fair hearing.def.mem.at.defendants contend that because the regulation day requirement is an additional obligation not contained or reasonably implicit in the medicaid act,the regulation can not be enforced through.id.
second,defendants argue that the district court injunction is overbroad.specifically,they argue that the district court construction of the phrase final administrative action to include the actual provision of services is wrong as a matter of law,id.at and that the injunction applies the day requirement to certain hearings that are outside the express terms of the regulation,id.at.
discussion 
standards of review.
we review de novo a district court legal conclusions made in the context of an order granting summary judgment.see vera saks,cir per curiam.
we review the scope of a district court injunction for abuse of discretion,which can be found if the district court incorrectly applied the law.catanzano wing,cir citation and quotations omitted.
ii.the right to an opportunity for a fair hearing.
the district court correctly concluded in its order that plaintiffs statutory right to an opportunity for medicaid fair hearings as construed by the regulation is enforceable through 
applicable framework.
section creates a cause of action against any person who,acting under color of state law,abridges rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the united states.violations of rights thus give rise to actions mere violations of laws do not.see gonzaga doe.the question,then,is whether an alleged right is enforceable under.
source of the alleged right.
we think it important to underscore the source of the alleged right here at issue.
defendants correctly observe that many of our sister courts have held that regulations may not independently create individual rights enforceable under but this observation is beside the point,because the district court did not hold that the regulation here at issue independently creates a right enforceable under.
instead,the district court held that plaintiffs have a statutory right under a to an opportunity for medicaid fair hearings that is enforceable through a cause of action under.defendants do not argue that this particular holding was in error.
determining the scope of the alleged right.
defendants do,however,argue that the district court misconstrued the scope of plaintiffs statutory right to an opportunity for medicaid fair hearings.that is,defendants argue that the regulation requiring final administrative action ordinarily within days of a fair hearing request can not properly be deemed to merely flesh out the meaning of the statutory right to an opportunity for medicaid fair hearings.def.mem.at quotations omitted.as a result say defendants plaintiffs can not enforce the statute in conjunction with the regulation.
applicable standard.
it is that,a s an agency interpretation of a statute,a regulation may be relevant in determining the scope of the right conferred by congress.save our valley sound transit,cir.the following rubric guides our inquiry in that regard 
s o long as the statute itself confers a specific right upon the plaintiff,and a valid regulation merely further defines or fleshes out the content of that right,then the statute in conjunction with the regulation may create a federal right as further defined by the regulation 
on the other hand,if the regulation defines the content of a statutory provision that creates no federal right,or if the regulation goes beyond explicating the specific content of the statutory provision and imposes distinct obligations in order to further the broad objectives underlying the statutory provision,the regulation is too far removed from congressional intent to constitute a federal right enforceable under.
harris james,cir quotations omitted emphasis and formatting added see also bd.of,cir parenthetically quoting harris.
applications of the standard.
a review of the case law in this area proves instructive.
we begin with wright city of roanoke redevelopment and housing authority,a decision on which the eleventh circuit relied in formulating the rubric we apply here,see harris,at.
the plaintiffs in wright brought a claim alleging that a public housing authority overbilled them for utilities.according to the plaintiffs,the housing authority conduct violated i a federal statute,which imposed a rent ceiling based on plaintiffs incomes,and ii the statute implementing regulations,which required the housing authority to include a reasonable utility allowance in plaintiffs rents.see wright,at.in response,the housing authority argued that neither the statute nor the regulations gave the plaintiffs a right enforceable through.see id.at.
the court rejected this argument.according to the court,the applicable statute could not be clearer tenants could be charged as rent no more and no less than percent of their income.id.at.in addition,the applicable regulations expressly required that a reasonable amount for utilities be included in rent that the housing authority was allowed to charge.id.the court then observed that the relevant federal agency had adhered to the regulations interpretation of the statute,and noted that the agency view is entitled to deference.see id.the court rejected the argument that the regulations definition of rent as including a reasonable charge for utilities is not authorized by the statute.id.at.
the court subsequently described its holding in wright as follows 
a statute providing that tenants in housing could only be charged of their income in rent,in conjunction with regulations providing that reasonable utilities costs were included in the rental figure,created a right under to not be charged more than a reasonable amount for utilities.
suter artist.
we emphasize that the regulation at issue in wright merely defined the specific right that congress already had conferred through the statute.see camden citizens in action dep t of envtl,cir.in other words,the wright court located the alleged right in the statutory provision and then relied upon the implementing regulations to define and interpret that right.see also harris,at same.
our decision in new york city board of education,cir provides another example of a regulation deemed to define the scope of an extant,statutory right,such that the right so defined is enforceable under.
the plaintiffs in alleged that the new york city department of education doe violated their rights under the individuals with disabilities education act idea.id.at.
pursuant to the idea,states must provide disabled students with free appropriate public education designed to serve the students needs.id.free appropriate public education is defined in part as special education and related services that are provided in conformity with the individualized education program iep required under the idea.id.at quotations omitted.the idea does not specify a time frame for implementing an iep after it has been developed.id.but the applicable federal regulation requires that the iep be implemented as soon as possible following its development.id.at quotations omitted emphasis added.the plaintiffs in d.alleged that the doe violated the idea by failing to implement their ieps immediately,or at least within days,after their ieps were developed.id.at.
citing to wright,we concluded i that the idea creates the right to a free appropriate public education enforceable through,and ii that the federal regulation merely defines the scope of that right with respect to the requisite time frame for implementing an iep.id.at.we emphasized,however,that the federal regulation requires only that ieps be implemented as soon as possible,and not immediately or within days,as the plaintiffs had asserted.see id.
the eleventh circuit decision in harris provides an example of a regulation that goes beyond explicating the specific content of a statutory provision,such that the underlying statutory right at least as defined by the regulation could not be enforced under.see harris,at.
in harris,the court considered whether medicaid recipients have a federal right to transportation to and from medicaid providers,which right may be enforced in an action under.id.at.the court answered that question in the negative.
as a preliminary matter,the harris court noted that the plaintiffs seek to enforce a transportation requirement that appears explicitly not in the medicaid act,but in a federal regulation.id.at.but the court rejected any suggestion that an enforceable right could be created i by a regulation alone,or ii by a regulation valid interpretation of a statute that creates some enforceable right.id.at.instead,the court held that the plaintiffs purported right would be enforceable under only if the statute itself confers a specific right upon them,and the valid regulation merely further defines or fleshes out the content of that right.id.at.under such circumstances,the statute in conjunction with the regulation would create a federal right as further defined by the regulation.id.quotations omitted.
the court then examined certain of the statutory provisions which allegedly conferred specific rights on the plaintiffs.see id.at.one required state medicaid plans to provide medical assistance with reasonable promptness.id.at.another required the plans to provide comparable assistance to different categories of needy individuals.see id.the court assumed that these provisions create some federal right.see id.at.and the court further assumed that the transportation regulation is a valid interpretation of each of these provisions.see id.at.but the court nevertheless concluded that the plaintiffs enjoyed no federal right to transportation.id.the court reasoned as follows 
t he transportation regulation would be valid not because it reasonably defines the content of rights created by the statutory provisions,as did the regulation in wright,but only because the regulation furthers the broad objectives underlying each statutory provision.
in other words,we do not think that transportation to and from providers is reasonably understood to be part of the content of a statutory right to prompt provision of assistance or comparable assistance instead,if the regulation is a valid interpretation of these statutory provisions,it would be because transportation may be a reasonable means of ensuring the prompt provision of assistance or comparable assistance.such links to congressional intent may be sufficient to support the validity of a regulation however,we think they are too tenuous to support a conclusion that congress has unambiguously conferred upon medicaid recipients a federal right to transportation enforceable under.
id.at first emphasis and formatting added.
the district court correctly held that a as construed by the regulation creates a right,enforceable under,to receive a fair hearing and a fair hearing decision o rdinarily,within days of a fair hearing request.
fair hearings.
we conclude that the regulation day requirement merely further defines or fleshes out the content of the right to an opportunity for medicaid fair hearings,such that plaintiffs have a right enforceable under to final administrative action o rdinarily,within days of their request,see f.
as discussed,the regulation here at issue says defendants must take final administrative action o rdinarily,within days of the date a fair hearing is requested.see id.f ii.defendants strenuously argue that final administrative action refers to the issuance of decisions after fair hearings defendants argument makes sense the regulation is,after all,entitled hearing decisions.see id.if the regulation calls for the issuance of a decision after a fair hearing o rdinarily,within days of the date the fair hearing was requested,the regulation necessarily also calls for the hearing itself to be held within that time frame.
but does this aspect of the regulation merely further define or flesh out the content of the statutory right to an opportunity for medicaid fair hearings we conclude it does.and we think our decision in leaves no room to conclude otherwise.
the statute at issue in the idea did not specify a time frame for implementing the statutory right to a free appropriate public education.the regulation at issue in,however,required that ieps be implemented as soon as possible following their development.we concluded that this regulation merely defines the scope of the statutory right to a free appropriate public education with respect to the requisite time frame for implementing that right.see,at.
similarly,the medicaid act does not specify a time frame within which defendants must provide plaintiffs with medicaid fair hearings the relevant statutory provision says only that defendants must grant an opportunity for such hearings to individuals whose claims for medical assistance have not been decided with reasonable promptness.see a.just as the regulation in merely define d the time frame for implementing the right to a free appropriate public education,the day requirement in the regulation here at issue merely defines the time frame with respect to plaintiffs right to an opportunity for medicaid fair hearings or,as the district court reasoned,the right to an opportunity for a fair hearing includes the right to a fair hearing within some period of time,and the regulation day requirement simply defines what that period of time is.
we find no merit in defendants contention that is inapposite to the instant matter.
defendants argue that,unlike the regulation at issue in,the regulation at issue here imposes specific temporal guidelines and thus affords plaintiffs greater relief than they could obtain under the medicaid act itself.specifically,defendants contend that,in,we construed the regulation as soon as possible language as by design,a flexible requirement,and stressed that the regulation did not impose a rigid,outside time frame for implementation,but rather permitted specific inquiry into the causes of the delay in the particular case.def.mem.at quotations omitted.by contrast defendants argue the regulation at issue in the instant matter imposes a rigid,outside time frame for final administrative action,and does not permit specific inquiry into the causes of the delay on a basis.id.at quotations omitted.
contrary to defendants reading of,we did not hold in that case that a regulation may be deemed to further define or flesh out the content of a statutory right only if the regulation imposes flexible requirements.rather,our discussion in of the flexible nature of the language in the regulation there at issue came in response to an argument made by the plaintiffs according to the plaintiffs,the regulation in required that their statutory right to a free appropriate public education be implemented either immediately,or within days.see,at.we rejected that argument based on our review of certain rulemaking commentary.we observed that the secretary of education had explicitly declined to adopt a rigid,outside time frame for implementation.see id.at.this observation does not,however,signify that a regulation rigid temporal guideline may never further define or flesh out the content of an underlying statutory right.
finally,we note that the statute and regulation at issue here stand in contrast to those that were at issue in harris.the regulation in harris required that the plaintiffs be given transportation to and from medicaid providers.harris,at.such a requirement could not reasonably be understood to be part of the content of,for example,a statutory right to receive medical assistance with reasonable promptness the regulation thus did not merely define the content of that underlying right.see id.at.by contrast,the day requirement in the regulation at issue here may reasonably be understood to be part of the content of the right to an opportunity for medicaid fair hearings the regulation merely defines the scope of that right with respect to the time frame in which the right must be provided.see,at.
fair hearing decisions.
we further conclude that the right to an opportunity for medicaid fair hearings includes a right to a decision following such hearings.that being so,we have little difficulty concluding that the regulation day requirement merely further defines or fleshes out the content of that right.see harris,at.
the medicaid act does not define the contours of a fair hearing for purposes of a.but the applicable federal regulation says that the medicaid hearing system must meet the due process standards set forth in goldberg.kelly.see d.
the due process standards set forth in goldberg entitle plaintiffs to decisions following their medicaid fair hearings.for one,goldberg says that the decisionmaker conclusion must rest solely on the legal rules and evidence adduced at the hearing,and that the decision maker should state the reasons for his determination and indicate the evidence he relied on.goldberg,at emphasis added.in addition,the goldberg court emphasized that an impartial decision maker is essential.id.we see little reason why this would be so unless the right to a fair hearing includes the right to a decision 
in light of the foregoing,we conclude that the statutory right to an opportunity for a fair hearing includes the right to a decision.implicit in the right to a decision is that the decision must be issued within some period of time.the regulation which,defendants concede,encompasses the issuance of fair hearing decisions says what that period of time is.accordingly,we hold that the regulation merely defines or fleshes out plaintiffs fair hearing right,which is enforceable under.see,at.
iii.scope of the injunction.
although the district court correctly held that the statutory right to an opportunity for medicaid fair hearings as construed by the regulation is enforceable under,the district court exceeded the bounds of its allowable discretion by granting an impermissibly broad injunction 
an injunction is overbroad when it restrains defendants from engaging in legal conduct.see city of mickalis pawn shop,llc,cir.
the injunction here at issue is thus overbroad because it compels defendants to implement the relief ordered in a fair hearing decision within the regulation day time frame,despite the fact that the regulation imposes on defendants no such obligation.
defendants also contend that the injunction is overbroad because it applies the regulation day requirement to persons who are not enrollees in medicaid managed care organizations.we disagree.
final administrative action does not include the implementation of relief.
in its order,the district court enjoined defendants to provide final administrative action within days of a request for a medicaid fair hearing.according to the district court,f inal a dministrative a ction occurs when d efendants have taken all actions necessary to implement the relief ordered in decisions after fair hearings.order at emphasis added.
we do not agree with the district court construction of final administrative action.that phrase is not defined in the medicaid act or in the applicable regulations.but the structure,text,and drafting history of the applicable regulations,together with a review of administrative law principles and other statutory and regulatory provisions,convince us that final administrative action does not include the implementation of relief ordered in fair hearing decisions.accordingly,although we have previously acknowledged that the statutory right to medicaid fair hearings under a must include within it the right to effective redress,catanzano,at,that right at least in conjunction with the regulation here at issue does not require defendants to implement the relief ordered in fair hearing decisions within the regulation day time frame.the district court injunction is thus overbroad.mickalis pawn shop,at.
structure,text,and drafting history.
the structure and text of the applicable regulations lead us to conclude that final administrative action refers to the holding of fair hearings and to the issuance of fair hearing decisions,rather than to the implementation of relief ordered in those decisions.
as a preliminary matter,the regulation appears under a subpart entitled fair hearings for applicants and recipients.the regulation itself is entitled hearing decisions.see emphasis added.it sets forth the required elements of fair hearing decisions and it states that such decisions must be based exclusively on evidence introduced at the hearing,id.a.subsection f of the subsection at issue here appears between two subsections which relate exclusively to the issuance of decisions after fair hearings section e details the requisite elements of a decision following a de novo hearing section g states that the public must have access to all hearing decisions.
the subject matter of is thus generally confined to the composition and issuance of decisions after fair hearings.and nothing in the regulation text suggests that final administrative action encompasses the implementation of relief authorized in such decisions.this makes sense,because a separate regulation,entitled corrective action,covers the implementation of certain types of relief.see stating that defendants must provide retroactive benefits and provide for the admission to medical facilities if hearing decisions so require.indeed,we have observed that the results of fair hearings will be binding on the state based on the corrective action regulation,rather than on the hearing decision regulation that is at issue here.see catanzano,at.
the drafting history of the regulation further demonstrates that the day time frame applies to the issuance of decisions rather than to the implementation of relief.
we begin with,the predecessor to.section was entitled fair hearings.see fair hearings.may.subsection of provided that p rompt,definitive and final administrative action will be taken within days from the date of the request for a fair hearing,except where the claimant requests a delay in the hearing.id.at.the time frame for p rompt,definitive,and final administrative action was later extended to days.see methods for determination of eligibility.the relevant agency explained the need for the change as follows in view of the difficult position facing states with substantially increased hearing caseloads,the day period is considered insufficient for the orderly processing of cases.id.at emphasis added.the agency concluded that n inety days for processing hearings was a more realistic time frame.id.emphasis added.and the agency described the change as an e xtension from to days for hearing decisions.id.emphasis omitted.
later agency commentary similarly referred to the day requirement in as a deadline for the issuance of hearing decisions.see,medicaid program medicaid managed care new provisions,june,referencing the day clock for a fair hearing decision emphasis added id.t he state is required to resolve the state fair hearing within days.emphasis added id.at referencing the overall day timeframe for a final fair hearing decision emphasis added id.at referencing the day timeframe for resolution of the state fair hearing emphasis added.
the agency commentary with respect to f and is particularly revealing.these provisions once required that final administrative action be taken within hours for certain cases necessitating expedited review.see f.the agency described this requirement as follows states must conduct a state fair hearing and issue a final decision on these cases no later than hours from receipt of the appeal.medicaid program medicaid managed care,emphasis added.
the provisions were later amended,such that final administrative action for expedited cases was required within working days of certain triggering events.see f.in explaining this amendment,the agency noted that commenters recommended that the state medicaid agency be permitted working days to hear expedited appeals that they receive,rather than hours.at emphasis added.the agency agree d,and noted that the amended regulation now requires the state to conduct a fair hearing and make its decision within working days.id.emphasis added.
if taking final administrative action within working days means that the state is required to implement relief in that time frame,the agency made no mention of it.
the state medicaid manual.
the state medicaid manual manual,to which we owe deference further indicates that final administrative action refers not to the implementation of relief,but to the issuance of fair hearing decisions.
for one,the manual says that a conclusive decision in the name of the state agency shall be made by the hearing authority.manual a emphasis added.although the hearing authority may remand the matter to a local hearing officer where the materials submitted are insufficient to serve as a basis for a decision,the manual clarifies that such a remand is not a substitute for definitive and final administrative action.id.emphasi
