respondent brought a collective action under the fair labor standards act of flsa on behalf of herself and other employees similarly situated.b.after she ignored petitioners offer of judgment under federal rule of civil procedure,the district court,finding that no other individuals had joined her suit and that the rule offer fully satisfied her claim,concluded that respondent suit was moot and dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction.the third circuit reversed.it held that respondent individual claim was moot but that her collective action was not,explaining that allowing defendants to pick off named plaintiffs before certification with calculated rule offers would frustrate the goals of collective actions.the case was remanded to the district court to allow respondent to seek conditional certification,which,if successful,would relate back to the date of her complaint.
held because respondent had no personal interest in representing putative,unnamed claimants,nor any other continuing interest that would preserve her suit from mootness,her suit was appropriately dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
a while the courts of appeals disagree whether an unaccepted rule offer that fully satisfies a plaintiff individual claim is sufficient to render that claim moot,respondent conceded the issue below and did not properly raise it here.thus,this court assumes,without deciding,that petitioners offer mooted her individual claim.
b mootness principles control the outcome of this case.after respondent individual claim became moot,the suit became moot because she had no personal interest in representing others in the action.to avoid that outcome,respondent relies on cases that arose in the context of rule class actions,but they are inapposite,both because rule actions are fundamentally different from flsa collective actions and because the cases are inapplicable to the facts here.
neither sosna iowa,nor united states parole comm geraghty,support respondent position.geraghty extended the principles of sosna which held that a class action is not rendered moot when the named plaintiff individual claim becomes moot after the class has been duly certified to denials of class certification motions and it provided that,where an action would have acquired independent legal status but for the district court erroneous denial of class certification,a corrected ruling on appeal relates back to the time of the erroneous denial,at,and.however,geraghty holding was explicitly limited to cases in which the named plaintiff claim remains live at the time the district court denies class certification.see,at.here,respondent had not yet moved for conditional certification when her claim became moot,nor had the district court anticipatorily ruled on any such request.she thus has no certification decision to which her claim could have related back.more fundamentally,essential to sosna and geraghty was the fact that a putative class acquires an independent legal status once it is certified under rule.by contrast,under the flsa,conditional certification does not produce a class with an independent legal status,or join additional parties to the action.
a line of cases holding that an inherently transitory claim is not necessarily moot upon the termination of the named plaintiff claim,see,county of riverside mclaughlin,is similarly inapplicable.respondent argues that a defendant use of rule offers to pick off a named plaintiff before the process is complete renders the action inherently transitory.but this rationale was developed to address circumstances in which the challenged conduct was effectively unreviewable because no plaintiff possessed a personal stake in the suit long enough for litigation to run its course,and it has invariably focused on the fleeting nature of the challenged conduct giving rise to the claim,not on the defendant litigation strategy.unlike a claim for injunctive relief,a damages claim can not evade review,nor can an offer of full settlement insulate such a claim from review.putative plaintiffs may be foreclosed from vindicating their rights in respondent suit,but they remain free to do so in their own suits.
finally,deposit guaranty nat.bank roper,does not support respondent claim that the purposes served by the flsa provisions would be frustrated by defendants use of rule to pick off named plaintiffs before the process has run its course.in roper,where the named plaintiffs individual claims became moot after the district court denied their rule class certification motion and entered judgment in their favor based on defendant offer of judgment,this court found that the named plaintiffs could appeal the denial of certification because they possessed an ongoing,personal economic stake in the substantive controversy,namely,to shift a portion of attorney fees and expenses to successful class litigants.here,respondent conceded that petitioners offer provided complete relief,and she asserted no continuing economic interest in shifting attorney fees and costs.moreover,roper was tethered to the unique significance of rule class certification decisions.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
the fair labor standards act of flsa,et,provides that an employee may bring an action to recover damages for specified violations of the act on behalf of himself and other similarly situated employees.we granted certiorari to resolve whether such a case is justiciable when the lone plaintiff individual claim becomes moot.we hold that it is not justiciable.
the flsa establishes federal,and overtime guarantees that can not be modified by contract.section b of the flsa,stat,as amended,b,gives employees the right to bring a private cause of action on their own behalf and on behalf of other employees similarly situated for specified violations of the flsa.a suit brought on behalf of other employees is known as a collective action.see roche sperling.
in,respondent,who was formerly employed by petitioners as a registered nurse at pennypack center in philadelphia,pennsylvania,filed a complaint on behalf of herself and all other persons similarly situated.app.respondent alleged that petitioners violated the flsa by automatically deducting minutes of time worked per shift for meal breaks for certain employees,even when the employees performed compensable work during those breaks.respondent,who remained the sole plaintiff throughout these proceedings,sought statutory damages for the alleged violations.
when petitioners answered the complaint,they simultaneously served upon respondent an offer of judgment under federal rule of civil procedure.the offer included for alleged unpaid wages,in addition to such reasonable attorneys fees,costs,and expenses as the court may determine.at.petitioners stipulated that if respondent did not accept the offer within days after service,the offer would be deemed withdrawn.
after respondent failed to respond in the allotted time period,petitioners filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.petitioners argued that because they offered respondent complete relief on her individual damages claim,she no longer possessed a personal stake in the outcome of the suit,rendering the action moot.respondent objected,arguing that petitioners were inappropriately attempting to pick off the named plaintiff before the process could unfold,at.
the district court found that it was undisputed that no other individuals had joined respondent suit and that the rule offer of judgment fully satisfied her individual claim.it concluded that petitioners rule offer of judgment mooted respondent suit,which it dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
the court of appeals reversed.the court agreed that no other potential plaintiff had opted into the suit,that petitioners offer fully satisfied respondent individual claim,and that,under its precedents,whether or not such an offer is accepted,it generally moots a plaintiff claim,at.but the court nevertheless held that respondent collective action was not moot.it explained that calculated attempts by some defendants to pick off named plaintiffs with strategic rule offers before certification could short circuit the process,and,thereby,frustrate the goals of collective actions,at.the court determined that the case must be remanded in order to allow respondent to seek conditional certification in the district court.if respondent were successful,the district court was to relate the certification motion back to the date on which respondent filed her complaint ibid.
article iii,of the constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to cases and controversies,which restricts the authority of federal courts to resolving the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies,valley forge christian college americans united for separation of church and state,quoting liverpool,new york philadelphia commissioners of emigration.in order to invoke jurisdiction,a plaintiff must demonstrate that he possesses a legally cognizable interest,or personal stake,in the outcome of the action.see camreta greene,slip,at quoting summers earth island institute.this requirement ensures that the federal judiciary confines itself to its constitutionally limited role of adjudicating actual and concrete disputes,the resolutions of which have direct consequences on the parties involved.
a corollary to this requirement is that an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review,not merely at the time the complaint is filed.arizonans for official english arizona,quoting preiser newkirk.if an intervening circumstance deprives the plaintiff of a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit,at any point during litigation,the action can no longer proceed and must be dismissed as moot.lewis continental bank,internal quotation marks omitted.
in the proceedings below,both courts concluded that petitioners rule offer afforded respondent complete relief on and thus mooted her flsa claim.see,at,wl,ed,may.respondent now contends that these rulings were erroneous,because petitioners rule offer lapsed without entry of judgment.brief for respondent.the united states,as amicus curiae,similarly urges the court to hold that petitioners unaccepted offer did not moot her flsa claim and to affirm the court of appeals on this basis.brief for united states.
while the courts of appeals disagree whether an offer that fully satisfies a plaintiff claim is sufficient to render the claim moot we do not reach this question,or resolve the split,because the issue is not properly before us.the third circuit clearly held in this case that respondent individual claim was moot,at.acceptance of respondent argument to the contrary now would alter the court of appeals judgment,which is impermissible in the absence of a from respondent.see northwest airlines,county of kent,trans world airlines,thurston.moreover,even if the rule did not apply,respondent waiver of the issue would still prevent us from reaching it.in the district court,respondent conceded that a n offer of complete relief will generally moot the plaintiff claim,as at that point the plaintiff retains no personal interest in the outcome of the litigation.app.wl,at.respondent made a similar concession in her brief to the court of appeals,see app,and failed to raise the argument in her brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari.we,therefore,assume,without deciding,that petitioners rule offer mooted respondent individual claim.see baldwin reese.
we turn,then,to the question whether respondent action remained justiciable based on the allegations in her complaint.a straightforward application of mootness principles compels our answer.in the absence of any claimant opting in,respondent suit became moot when her individual claim became moot,because she lacked any personal interest in representing others in this action.while the flsa authorizes an aggrieved employee to bring an action on behalf of himself and other employees similarly situated,b,the mere presence of allegations in the complaint can not save the suit from mootness once the individual claim is satisfied in order to avoid this outcome,respondent relies almost entirely upon cases that arose in the context of federal rule of civil procedure class actions,particularly united states parole comm geraghty,deposit guaranty nat.bank roper,and sosna iowa.but these cases are inapposite,both because rule actions are fundamentally different from collective actions under the flsa,see roche,at scalia,dissenting,and because these cases are,by their own terms,inapplicable to these facts.it follows that this action was appropriately dismissed as moot.
respondent contends that she has a sufficient personal stake in this case based on a statutorily created collective action interest in representing other similarly situated employees under b.brief for respondent.in support of her argument,respondent cites our decision in geraghty,which in turn has its roots in sosna.neither case supports her position.
in sosna,the court held that a class action is not rendered moot when the named plaintiff individual claim becomes moot after the class has been duly certified,at.the court reasoned that when a district court certifies a class,the class of unnamed persons described in the certification acquire s a legal status separate from the interest asserted by the named plaintiff,with the result that a live controversy may continue to exist,even after the claim of the named plaintiff becomes moot,at.geraghty narrowly extended this principle to denials of class certification motions.the court held that where an action would have acquired the independent legal status described in sosna but for the district court erroneous denial of class certification,a corrected ruling on appeal relates back to the time of the erroneous denial of the certification motion,at,and.
geraghty is inapposite,because the court explicitly limited its holding to cases in which the named plaintiff claim remains live at the time the district court denies class certification.see,at.here,respondent had not yet moved for conditional certification when her claim became moot,nor had the district court ruled on any such request.her claim instead became moot prior to these events,foreclosing any recourse to geraghty.there is simply no certification decision to which respondent claim could have related back.
more fundamentally,essential to our decisions in sosna and geraghty was the fact that a putative class acquires an independent legal status once it is certified under rule.under the flsa,by contrast,conditional certification does not produce a class with an independent legal status,or join additional parties to the action.the sole consequence of conditional certification is the sending of written notice to employees,see roche,supra,at,who in turn become parties to a collective action only by filing written consent with the court,b.so even if respondent were to secure a conditional certification ruling on remand,nothing in that ruling would preserve her suit from mootness.
respondent also advances an argument based on a separate,but related,line of cases in which the court held that an inherently transitory claim is not necessarily moot upon the termination of the named plaintiff claim.like our decision in geraghty,this line of cases began with sosna and is similarly inapplicable here.
after concluding that the expiration of a named claim following certification does not moot the class action,sosna suggested that,where a named plaintiff individual claim becomes moot before the district court has an opportunity to rule on the certification motion,and the issue would otherwise evade review,the certification might relate back to the filing of the complaint,at.the court has since held that the doctrine may apply in rule cases where it is certain that other persons similarly situated will continue to be subject to the challenged conduct and the claims raised are so inherently transitory that the trial court will not have even enough time to rule on a motion for class certification before the proposed representative individual interest expires.county of riverside mclaughlin,quoting geraghty,supra,at,in turn citing gerstein pugh.invoking this doctrine,respondent argues that defendants can strategically use rule offers to pick off named plaintiffs before the process is complete,rendering collective actions transitory in effect.brief for respondent.
our cases invoking the inherently transitory rationale do not apply.the inherently transitory rationale was developed to address circumstances in which the challenged conduct was effectively unreviewable,because no plaintiff possessed a personal stake in the suit long enough for litigation to run its course.a plaintiff might seek,for instance,to bring a class action challenging the constitutionality of temporary pretrial detentions.in doing so,the named plaintiff would face the considerable challenge of preserving his individual claim from mootness,since pretrial custody likely would end prior to the resolution of his claim.see gerstein,supra.to address this problem,the court explained that in cases where the transitory nature of the conduct giving rise to the suit would effectively insulate defendants conduct from review,certification could potentially relate back to the filing of the complaint,at,mclaughlin,supra,at.but this doctrine has invariably focused on the fleeting nature of the challenged conduct giving rise to the claim,not on the defendant litigation strategy.see,swisher brady,spencer kemna.
in this case,respondent complaint requested statutory damages.unlike claims for injunctive relief challenging ongoing conduct,a claim for damages can not evade review it remains live until it is settled,judicially resolved,or barred by a statute of limitations.nor can a defendant attempt to obtain settlement insulate such a claim from review,for a full settlement offer addresses plaintiff alleged harm by making the plaintiff whole.while settlement may have the collateral effect of foreclosing unjoined claimants from having their rights vindicated in respondent suit,such putative plaintiffs remain free to vindicate their rights in their own suits.they are no less able to have their claims settled or adjudicated following respondent suit than if her suit had never been filed at all.
finally,respondent argues that the purposes served by the flsa provisions for example,efficient resolution of common claims and lower individual costs associated with litigation would be frustrated by defendants use of rule to pick off named plaintiffs before the process has run its course.both respondent and the court of appeals purported to find support for this position in our decision in roper,at.
in roper,the named plaintiffs individual claims became moot after the district court denied their motion for class certification under rule and subsequently entered judgment in their favor,based on the defendant bank offer of judgment for the maximum recoverable amount of damages,in addition to interest and court costs,at.the court held that even though the district court had entered judgment in the named plaintiffs favor,they could nevertheless appeal the denial of their motion to certify the class.the court found that,under the particular circumstances of that case,the named plaintiffs possessed an ongoing,personal economic stake in the substantive controversy namely,to shift a portion of attorney fees and expenses to successful class litigants,at,and.only then,in dicta,did the court underscore the importance of a district court class certification decision and observe that allowing defendants to pic k off party plaintiffs before an affirmative ruling was achieved would frustrate the objectives of class actions.at.
roper holding turned on a specific factual finding that the plaintiffs possessed a continuing personal economic stake in the litigation,even after the defendants offer of judgment,at.as already explained,here,respondent conceded that petitioners offer provided complete relief on her individual claims,brief in opposition i,and she failed to assert any continuing economic interest in shifting attorney fees and costs to others.moreover,roper dictum was tethered to the unique significance of certification decisions in proceedings,at.whatever significance conditional certification may have in b proceedings,it is not tantamount to class certification under rule.
the court of appeals concluded that respondent individual claim became moot following petitioners rule offer of judgment.we have assumed,without deciding,that this is correct.
reaching the question on which we granted certiorari,we conclude that respondent has no personal interest in representing putative,unnamed claimants,nor any other continuing interest that would preserve her suit from mootness.respondent suit was,therefore,appropriately dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
the judgment of the court of appeals for the third circuit is reversed.
it is so ordered.

justice kagan,with whom justice ginsburg,justice breyer,and justice sotomayor join,dissenting.
the court today resolves an imaginary question,based on a mistake the courts below made about this case and others like it.the issue here,the majority tells us,is whether a collective action brought under the fair labor standards act of flsa,et,is justiciable when the lone plaintiff individual claim becomes moot.ante,at.embedded within that question is a crucial premise that the individual claim has become moot,as the lower courts held and the majority assumes without deciding.but what if that premise is bogus what if the plaintiff individual claim here never became moot and what if,in addition,no similar claim for damages will ever become moot in that event,the majority decision founded as it is on an unfounded assumption would have no meaning or application.the decision would turn out to be the most of,explaining only what the majority thinks should happen to a proposed collective flsa action when something that in fact never happens to an individual flsa claim is errantly thought to have done so.that is the case here,for reasons i describe.feel free to relegate the majority decision to the furthest reaches of your mind the situation it addresses should never again arise.
consider the facts of this case,keeping an eye out for anything that would render any part of it moot.respondent laura symczyk brought suit under a provision of the flsa,b,on behalf of herself and others similarly situated.app.her complaint alleged that her former employer,petitioner genesis healthcare corporation genesis,violated the flsa by treating minutes of every shift as an unpaid meal break,even when an employee worked during that time.genesis answered the complaint and simultaneously made an offer of judgment under federal rule of civil procedure.that settlement proposal covered only symczyk individual claim,to the tune of in lost wages.the offer,according to its terms,would be deemed withdrawn if symczyk did not accept it within days.app.that deadline came and went without any reply.the case then proceeded in the normal fashion,with the district court setting a schedule for discovery.pause here for a moment to ask whether you seen anything yet that would moot symczyk individual claim.no neither have 
nevertheless,genesis moved to dismiss symczyk suit on the ground that it was moot.the supposed logic went like this we,genesis offered symczyk complete relief on her individual damages claim she effectively reject ed the o ffer by failing to respond because she did so,she no longer has a personal stake or legally cognizable interest in the outcome of this action accordingly,the court should dismiss her claims.at.relying on circuit precedent,the district court agreed it dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction without awarding symczyk any damages or other relief based solely on the unaccepted offer genesis had made.see app.to pet.for cert.citing weiss regal collections.and finally,the court of appeals for the third circuit concurred that genesis offer mooted symczyk individual claim though also holding that she could still proceed with a collective action.see.
that view is wrong,wrong,and wrong again.we made clear earlier this term that a s long as the parties have a concrete interest,however small,in the outcome of the litigation,the case is not moot.chafin chafin,slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.a case becomes moot only when it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.by those measures,an unaccepted offer of judgment can not moot a case.when a plaintiff rejects such an offer however good the terms her interest in the lawsuit remains just what it was before.and so too does the court ability to grant her relief.an unaccepted settlement offer like any unaccepted contract offer is a legal nullity,with no operative effect.as every law student learns,the recipient rejection of an offer leaves the matter as if no offer had ever been made.minneapolis louis columbus rolling mill.nothing in rule alters that basic principle to the contrary,that rule specifies that a n unaccepted offer is considered withdrawn.fed.rule civ.proc.b.so assuming the case was live before because the plaintiff had a stake and the court could grant relief the litigation carries on,unmooted.
for this reason,symczyk individual claim was alive and well when the district court dismissed her suit.recall genesis made a settlement offer under rule symczyk decided not to accept it after days,it expired and the suit went forward.symczyk individual stake in the lawsuit thus remained what it had always been,and ditto the court capacity to grant her relief.after the offer lapsed,just as before,symczyk possessed an unsatisfied claim,which the court could redress by awarding her damages.as long as that remained true,symczyk claim was not moot,and the district court could not send her away.so a friendly suggestion to the third circuit rethink your theory.and a note to all other courts of appeals do try this at home.
to this point,what i have said conflicts with nothing in the court opinion.the majority does not attempt to argue,à la the third circuit,that the unaccepted settlement offer mooted symczyk individual damages claim.instead,the majority hangs its hat on a finding of waiver.see ante,at.the majority notes correctly that symczyk accepted the third circuit rule in her briefs below,and also failed to challenge it in her brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari she contested it first in her merits brief before this court.that enables the majority to assume,without deciding,the mootness of symczyk individual claim and reach the question relating to her proposed collective action.ante,at 
but as this court noted in a similar case,assum ing what the facts will show to be ridiculous about a predicate question just because a party did not think to challenge settled circuit precedent runs a risk that ought to be avoided.lebron national railroad passenger corporation.the question symczyk now raises did an unaccepted settlement offer moot my individual flsa claim is logically prior to and thus inextricably intertwined with the question the majority rushes to resolve if an unaccepted settlement offer mooted symczyk individual flsa claim,could a court proceed to consider her proposed collective action indeed,the former is so much part and parcel of the latter that the question genesis presented for our on which we granted certiorari actually looks more like symczyk than like the majority.genesis asked whether a case becomes moot when the lone plaintiff receives an offer from the defendants to satisfy all of the plaintiff claims.pet.for cert.symczyk,of course,would respond no,because merely receiving an offer does not moot any claim.the majority refusal to consider that obviously correct answer impedes intelligent resolution of the question presented.ohio robinette,internal quotation marks omitted.by taking a fallacy as its premise,the majority ensures it will reach the wrong decision.
still,you might think,the majority approach has at least this benefit in a future flsa case,when an individual claim for damages in fact becomes moot,a court will know what to do with the collective allegations.but no,even that much can not be said for the majority opinion.that is because the individual claims in such cases will never become moot,and a court will therefore never need to reach the issue the majority resolves.the majority decision is fit for nothing aside from getting this case wrong,it serves only to address a problem.
to see why,consider how a collective flsa action seeking damages unfolds.a plaintiff just like symczyk,but let us now call her smith,to highlight her typicality sues under b on behalf of both herself and others.to determine whether smith can serve as a representative party,the court considers whether the workplace policy her suit challenges has similarly affected other employees.if it has,the court supervises their discovery and notification,and then oversee s the joinder of any who want smith to represent them.hoffman sperling.during that period,as the majority observes,the class has no independent legal status.ante,at.at the same time,smith own claim is in perfect health.because it is a damages claim for past conduct,the employer can not extinguish it by adopting new employment practices.indeed,the claim would survive even smith own demise,belonging then to her estate.smith individual claim,in short,is not going away on its own it can easily wait out the time involved in assembling a collective action.accord,ante,at a claim for damages can not evade review it remains live until it is settled or judicially resolved 
now introduce a settlement offer into the picture assume that before the court finally decides whether to permit a collective action,the defendant proposes to pay smith the value of her individual claim in exchange for her abandonment of the entire litigation.if smith agrees,of course,all is over like any plaintiff,she can assent to a settlement ending her suit.but assuming smith does not agree,because she wishes to proceed on behalf of other employees,could the offer ever succeed in mooting her case i have already shown that it can not do so in the circumstances here,where the defendant makes an offer,the plaintiff declines it,and nothing else occurs on those facts,smith claim is as it ever was,and the lawsuit continues onward.but suppose the defendant additionally requests that the court enter judgment in smith favor though over her objection for the amount offered to satisfy her individual claim.could a court approve that motion and then declare the case over on the ground that smith has no further stake in it that course would be less preposterous than what the court did here at least smith,unlike symczyk,would get some money.but it would be impermissible as well.
for starters,rule precludes a court from imposing judgment for a plaintiff like smith based on an unaccepted settlement offer made pursuant to its terms.the text of the rule contemplates that a court will enter judgment only when a plaintiff accepts an offer.see rule a if the plaintiff serves written notice accepting the offer,either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance,plus proof of service.the clerk must then enter judgment and the rule prohibits a court from considering an unaccepted offer for any purpose other than allocating litigation costs including for the purpose of entering judgment for either party.see rule b evidence of an unaccepted offer is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs that injunction accords with rule exclusive purpose to promote voluntary cessation of litigation by imposing costs on p
