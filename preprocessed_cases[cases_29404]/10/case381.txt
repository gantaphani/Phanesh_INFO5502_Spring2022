this case concerns the applicable burdens of proof for establishing jurisdiction in a removal action under the class action fairness act of cafa,d.defendant in this action,travelers property casualty of america travelers,removed the case to the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.plaintiff francine judon judon timely sought remand.the district court found cafa numerosity and requirements to be in dispute and placed the burden of proof on travelers to establish jurisdiction under cafa by a preponderance of the evidence.concluding that travelers failed to meet its burden,the district court issued an order remanding the case to state court.travelers appealed.
as judon complaint unambiguously pleaded that the numerosity requirement was satisfied,the district court should have placed the burden of proof on judon to show,to a legal certainty,that the numerosity requirement was not satisfied.but the district court correctly applied the preponderance of the evidence standard to the requirement.accordingly,we will affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
on december,judon was injured while riding in a passenger vehicle capable of transporting fewer than passengers owned by keystone quality transport company and insured by travelers.after the accident,judon sought medical benefits under the travelers insurance policy of.travelers paid judon,up to the medical benefits limit in the policy,but declined to pay judon for her claims over the policy limit.
on january,judon filed a complaint in the court of common pleas of philadelphia county.the primary basis of judon complaint was that pennsylvania law required that the travelers policy held by keystone offer up to in medical benefits.judon complaint alleged two counts that travelers refusal to pay medical benefits beyond constituted breach of contract and that travelers denial of judon and other putative class members claims was done in bad faith and in violation of.judon also asserted a claim on behalf of the following class members 
individuals injured in motor vehicle accidents who were occupants of common or contract carriers for motor vehicles capable of transporting fewer than passengers insured under policies of insurance by the defendant,travelers,and for whom first party medical expense benefits were not made available in an amount up to but only in an amount up to.
judon further alleged that there are hundreds of members of the class who were wrongfully and illegally denied payment of benefits by travelers.
judon sought a court order requiring travelers to make payment of medical expense benefits in an amount up to to judon and class members in connection with injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents that were covered by travelers policies of insurance.further,judon requested that the court award,to judon and class members,benefits,interest,fees,costs,treble damages,and punitive damages for acting in bad faith pursuant to.
on february,travelers timely filed a notice of removal under cafa.travelers argued that the proposed class met the three requirements for cafa removal under d.travelers asserted,and judon did not contest,that the parties were minimally diverse.travelers also contended that judon reference to hundreds of members must mean at least,such that the proposed class consisted of at least putative class members pursuant to d.travelers also argued that the amount in controversy exceeded pursuant to d.in order to reach that figure,travelers asserted that the value of each putative class member damages could amount to consisting of in allegedly required medical benefits minus the in medical benefits actually paid.the minimum total number of class members,multiplied by the total amount each class member could be entitled to,would yield in potential compensatory damages.trebling this amount as demanded by judon,travelers contended,yields an amount in controversy exceeding.
on march,travelers filed a motion to dismiss judon complaint arguing,inter alia,that travelers denial of judon medical expenses was proper under applicable pennsylvania law.in the alternative,travelers argued that it had an objectively reasonable basis for refusing to make payment of judon medical expenses and,as a result,punitive damages were not warranted.
on march,judon timely filed a motion to remand,contending that as the removing party,travelers bore the burden of establishing jurisdiction under cafa.according to judon,travelers did not meet that burden because it failed to show to a legal certainty both that i the amount in controversy exceeded the statutory minimum of and ii there were more than class members.in order to do so,judon argued,travelers must submit proof regarding the actual number of class members and the actual amount of those putative class members damages.judon also argued that the potential for punitive or treble damages could not count towards the requirement both because such potential damages would need to be actually translated into monetary sums for each putative class member and because travelers had challenged the availability of punitive damages in its motion to dismiss.
the district court granted judon motion to remand on june.the district court reasoned that because judon vigorously contest ed the facts travelers relied on to establish jurisdiction,the preponderance of the evidence standard was appropriate for resolving the dispute.because the district court reasoned that travelers was required to put forward proof to a reasonable probability that jurisdiction existed under d,and because travelers provided no such extrinsic evidence,the district court remanded the case to the court of common pleas of philadelphia county.travelers timely petitioned for review of the remand order pursuant to c.on october,we granted travelers petition 
the district court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to d.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to c.a party asserting federal jurisdiction in a removal case bears the burden of showing that the case is properly before the federal court.frederico home depot,cir see also morgan gay,cir.our review of issues of subject matter jurisdiction is de novo.kaufman allstate ins,cir.
at the core of this jurisdictional challenge is the nature of the burden of proof and evidentiary standards applicable in a case removed under cafa.cafa confers on district courts original jurisdiction of any civil action in which three requirements are met an amount in controversy that exceeds,as aggregated across all individual claims minimally diverse parties and that the class consist of at least or more members numerosity requirement.d,b,standard fire ins.knowles.
in order to determine whether the cafa jurisdictional requirements are satisfied,a court evaluates allegations in the complaint and a defendant notice of removal.frederico,at morgan,at the proper test in a cafa removal action depends on the nature of the jurisdictional facts alleged and whether they are in dispute.
we begin by demarcating the various jurisdictional tests applicable in a cafa removal action.in samuel bassett kia motors america,we closely analyzed the burden of proof for establishing the requirement under the general removal statute,cir.this decision reconciled two supreme court cases that established distinct burdens of proof to be applied depending on the nature of a party jurisdictional challenge.id.at reconciling paul mercury indem.red cab,with mcnutt motors acceptance of.
in mcnutt general motors acceptance of indiana,a challenge to the amount in controversy had been raised in the pleadings specifically the answer,but no evidence or findings in the trial court addressed that issue.samuel bassett,f d at mcnutt,at.the supreme court held that the party alleging jurisdiction must justify his allegations by a preponderance of the evidence.mcnutt,at.accordingly,if the jurisdictional facts are challenged in any appropriate manner,the party alleging jurisdiction must support them by competent proof.id.because the jurisdictional amount was in dispute and there were no adequate findings as to that issue of fact,the supreme court held that the district court lacked jurisdiction and the case should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.id.at.
by contrast,in paul mercury indemnity red cab,after the defendant removed the case to federal court,the plaintiff amended the complaint to allege damages less than the amount necessary to create jurisdiction.at.thereafter,the district court conducted a bench trial and made factual findings,stated its conclusions,and entered judgment for the plaintiff.id.the defendants appealed.id.the seventh circuit refused to decide the merits on the ground that,as the record showed,respondent claim did not equal the amount necessary to give the district court jurisdiction.id.
the supreme court held that the relevant test to establish jurisdiction was whether from the face of the pleadings,it is apparent,to a legal certainty,that the plaintiff can not recover the amount claimed or if,from the proofs,the court is satisfied to a like certainty that the plaintiff never was entitled to recover that amount.id.at.this rule from red cab does not require the removing defendant to prove to a legal certainty the plaintiff can recover the amount in controversy a substantially different standard.frederico,at quoting valley state farm fire and cas,d.instead,under the legal certainty test,the challenger to subject matter jurisdiction must prove,to a legal certainty,that the amount in controversy could not exceed the statutory threshold.id.at.
after distinguishing these cases,the samuel bassett panel analyzed an amount in controversy that was not based on specific damages alleged in the complaint but,instead,on an ad damnum that stated damages in terms of categories.at.the panel applied the legal certainty test because the categories of damages,a legal question,only needed to be translated into monetary sums id.at.the court found,however,insufficient facts to support a conclusion that the amount in controversy was satisfied specifically the actual damages plaintiff could recover under pennsylvania law.id.at.because of this,the court remanded the case for fact finding on the amount in controversy.id.at.in determining which test to apply,we explained that the critical distinction between red cab and mcnutt is whether the district court has made factual findings or instead,whether the district court is faced with disputes over factual matters.id.at.
travelers erroneously contends that such a dispute is created only where the challenging party puts forth admissible evidence at the removal stage of an action,a jurisdictional fact in question may be disputed or contested in the pleadings.mcnutt,at.for example,the contested jurisdictional facts in mcnutt were established by the allegation in the bill of complaint as to the jurisdictional amount being traversed by the answer.id.at.because the district court made no adequate finding upon that issue of fact,and the record contain ed no evidence to support the allegation of the bill,the supreme court concluded that the burden rested on the party seeking removal to prove that the jurisdictional amount in controversy was satisfied.id.the supreme court took the same approach in wilson republic iron steel 
if a removal is effected,the plaintiff may,by a motion to remand,plea,or answer,take issue with the statements in the petition for removal.if he does,the issue so arising must be heard and determined by the district court,and at the hearing the petitioning defendant must take and carry the burden of proof,he being the actor in the removal proceeding.
emphasis added citations omitted.in distilling these cases,we make clear that a jurisdictional challenge,which creates a dispute of fact,can be raised in the pleadings such as the answer or on a motion for remand.kaufman,at explaining that there was no fact in dispute regarding cafa jurisdiction where the plaintiffs did not dispute that the amount in controversy exceed ed.
frederico home depot provides an example of undisputed facts in a cafa removal action.in that case,the defendant relied on the facts alleged in the plaintiff complaint to establish the amount in controversy frederico,at.the plaintiff response to the defendant allegations in its notice of removal neither agree d with the facts alleged in the removal notice nor contest ed them.id.at.because the defendant argument for jurisdiction was based on allegations made initially by the plaintiff,we determined that the relevant facts were not expressly in dispute between the parties.id.we further concluded that the case did not present a situation where the court should still insist that the jurisdictional facts be established or the case be dismissed and demand that the party alleging jurisdiction justify his allegations by a preponderance of the evidence.id.quoting mcnutt,at.
therefore,we applied red cab legal certainty test to the facts alleged by the plaintiff in her complaint and incorporated by the defendant in its notice of removal.id.we found that the plaintiff compensatory and punitive damages totaled,and that the applicable attorney fees,using the federal judicial center median percentage recovery,could amount to,bringing the plaintiff total damages to.id.at.the plaintiff had alleged that there were tens of hundreds of thousands of class members.using these two figures,we divided by that produced a requisite class size of,which was well within the plaintiff allegations regarding the number of class members.id.this analysis left us satisfied that the red cab legal certainty test was met.id.
thus where there are contested facts related to jurisdiction the preponderance of the evidence standard from mcnutt applies,unless a district court has previously evaluated evidence and made factual findings.samuel bassett,at.once findings of fact have been made,the court may determine whether red cab legal certainty test for jurisdiction has been met.id.at see also frederico,at and,in turn,red cab legal certainty test also applies where the jurisdictional facts are not contested or the amount in controversy is determined in whole or in part by applicable law.id.at.in applying red cab,the preponderance of the evidence standard has no utility and we ask whether it is clear to a legal certainty that the plaintiff can not recover the amount claimed.id.
thus,our jurisprudence establishes at least two distinct tests potentially relevant here with regard to removal jurisdiction in a cafa case,whose application is dependent on the nature of the challenge and the pertinent facts of the case in summary 
the bassett framework applies where a challenge to the amount in controversy had been raised in the pleadings or the notice of removal,but no evidence or findings in the trial court addressed that issue.samuel bassett,at mcnutt,at.we require the party alleging jurisdiction to justify his allegations by a preponderance of the evidence.mcnutt,at.
the red bassett framework applies where the jurisdictional facts are not contested and the amount in controversy is determined in whole or in part by applicable law.samuel bassett,at.here we ask whether it is clear to a legal certainty that the plaintiff can not recover the amount claimed.id.at.
cafa jurisdiction is limited to cases where the proposed class has more than members.d b.the district court applied the samuel bassett preponderance of the evidence test to travelers cafa numerosity allegations in its notice of removal.the district court applied the wrong test because it improperly held that judon vigorously contest ed all jurisdictional aspects of removal,when,in fact,judon never claimed that the proposed class action involved less than members.
travelers relied on judon complaint in asserting that there were at least members of the proposed class.specifically,judon alleged in paragraph of her complaint it is believed,and therefore averred,that there are hundreds of members of the class where the defendant,travelers,wrongfully and illegally denied payment of first party medical benefits.judon sole challenge to travelers assertion that there were at least putative class members was that travelers supplied no basis for this number other than the allegation in the complaint.judon reasoned that s ince defendant has exclusive possession of the information necessary to determine the number of class members,defendant omission of any proof on this speaks volumes.there are two noteworthy aspects of judon challenge judon did not disavow her earlier allegation that there were hundreds of members and judon did not amend her complaint to allege fewer class members 
because judon explicitly asserted in her complaint that there are hundreds of members,travelers was entitled to rely on this fact as an admission in favor of jurisdiction.parilla,at addressing facts in a complaint that were judicial admissions see also glick white motor,cir explaining judicial admissions are also binding in a case on appeal.and in alleging the number in its notice of removal,travelers simply relied on the smallest number of potential class members consistent with judon allegations.a plaintiff is the master of her own complaint,morgan,at,and here judon pleaded information supporting the numerosity jurisdictional requirement.
judon supposed challenge obscured the question of whether there was a dispute of fact by improperly asserting that travelers bore the burden of proof as to numerosity.but judon motion to remand did not even put travelers cafa numerosity allegation which was really judon own allegation in dispute.in frederico,we reasoned that because the defendant argument for jurisdiction was based on allegations made initially by the plaintiff herself,and was not challenged by the plaintiff,red cab legal certainty test applied to the facts alleged by the plaintiff in her complaint and incorporated by the defendant into its notice of removal.at.in this case,our decision in frederico guides us to apply the legal certainty test as to the number of putative class members at issue.id.at.
accordingly,the district court erred in failing to place the burden on judon to prove to a legal certainty that there could not be class members.see id.at.as judon did not even dispute the at least members representation,much less attempt to put forth any evidence to the contrary,the district court should have found the numerosity requirement satisfied.
cafa mandates that the claims of the individual class members shall be aggregated in order to determine if the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of,exclusive of interest and costs.d,d.the district court reasoned that judon also vigorously contested this jurisdictional element and placed the burden on travelers to establish the requirement by a preponderance of the evidence.because travelers notice of removal and accompanying memorandum are based on an inconclusive assumption that judon challenged in her motion to remand,the district court properly applied the preponderance of the evidence standard.
as a starting point,judon did put the requirement in dispute.judon complaint was indeterminate regarding the amount in controversy.the individual damages claimed by judon amounted to.the proposed class included individuals entitled to first party medical expense benefits and that were not made available in an amount up to but only in an amount up to.the complaint did not explicitly allege the total class damages,or the damages suffered by individual class members.thus,judon allegations threw no light upon the subject of the total amount in controversy.see mcnutt,at.
travelers erroneously contends that the jurisdictional amount is not in dispute because its statement of the amount in controversy in its notice of removal is based on facts pled by judon in the complaint.in so arguing,travelers stretches the phrase up to to mean that each putative class member has a claim for minus the policy limit.in her motion to remand,judon contended that travelers provided no information about the actual stated limits of the policies covering the class members,which could be more than,nor any information about the actual claims of the class members,which may or may not reach the statutory limit of.for example,judon highlighted that her damages were only as of the date of filing.judon motion to remand effectively put at issue and challenged travelers assumption regarding putative class members individual damages.
because a challenge to the amount in controversy was raised in judon motion to remand,but no evidence or findings in the trial court addressed this issue,we require travelers,as the party alleging jurisdiction,to justify its allegations by a preponderance of the evidence.see samuel bassett,at mcnutt,at although travelers could properly rely on an estimate of class members,this fact alone can not support travelers calculation of the amount in controversy.the multiplicand missing from this equation is some realistic estimate of the amount of damages per class member.see id.at.an estimate of the amount recoverable should be objective and not based on fanciful,or simply wishful amounts,because otherwise the policy to limit diversity jurisdiction will be frustrated.id.this estimate should also not be based on the low end of an claim,but rather on a reasonable reading of the value of the rights being litigated.werwinski ford motor,cir quoting angus shiley,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
travelers estimate of the putative class members compensatory damages relies on travelers maximum exposure per plaintiff in the amount of.judon argues that a putative class member claim could be much smaller in fact,judon individual claim against travelers is only.in a class action,the class representative claim s must be typical of the claims of the class.civ.pennsylvania class action typicality requirement.a federal class action typicality requirement.it is,therefore,not unreasonable to assume that judon,as the proposed class representative,has damages that are typical of the class.see frederico,at accepting the defendant contentions in its notice of removal that the plaintiff damages reflected the average actual damages of each member of the putative class.even if we were to assume that judon individual compensatory damages are on the as compared to other putative class members,we are left with no evidence of what a reasonable claim against travelers might be.
rather than present evidence or rely on an admitted fact from judon complaint,travelers admits that it is drawing inferences from the limited papers the parties have submitted.in its brief and at oral argument,travelers attempted to bolster its assumption regarding damages by providing another calculation that would be sufficient to satisfy the requirement.rather than assume maximum recovery of per class member as it did in the notice of removal and subsequent briefing,travelers argued that even if each class member recovered as little as roughly of the potential maximum,cafa jurisdictional threshold would be met.travelers did not provide a principled reason to choose as the appropriate delta for damages,as opposed to or even.the only explanation for travelers two proposed damages calculations that we can divine is that both and satisfy the requisite requirement.
yet an assumption must be grounded on some reasonable inference that can be drawn from fact.travelers chose wishfully the amount of per putative class member,providing the putative class with total compensatory damages of class members multiplied by combined with punitive and treble damages.these assumptions plainly make reaching the threshold much easier.missing from travelers conjecture is any proof to a reasonable probability evidencing the damages suffered by individual class members.see frederico,at.
as a result,travelers conjecture is nothing more than an optimistic estimate of its potential liability at least for jurisdictional purposes by way of example,in frederico,we relied on the named plaintiff actual injuries as the average actual damages of each member of the putative class to determine whether the cafa requirement was satisfied.at.here,judon individual damages undermine a blind reliance on travelers maximum risk of damages under pennsylvania law.accordingly,there are insufficient facts to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the district court had jurisdiction over the case.
