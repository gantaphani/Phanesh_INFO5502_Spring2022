appellant gerald hester,a former pilot for vision airlines,sued vision on behalf of a class of other pilots and flight crew employees to recover hazard pay,which hester and the class alleged vision had accepted on their behalf and never paid to them.after nearly two years of discovery disputes between vision and the class,the district court sanctioned vision by striking its answer,entered default judgment against vision,and held a jury trial to determine damages.
vision appeals,arguing that the district court abused its discretion by striking vision answer,that the claims in the complaint are legally insufficient to support the default judgment,and that the district court abused its discretion by certifying the class.we reject vision arguments and affirm those orders.the class,arguing that the district court erred in dismissing,on the morning of trial,the class claim for punitive damages.we agree and reverse the order dismissing the class claim for punitive damages.
facts and procedural history 
during the military occupation of iraq and afghanistan,the united states established an air bridge to deliver supplies through war zones to posts in baghdad,iraq,and kabul,afghanistan.the united states contracted with private airlines to deliver supplies to those posts,and it pro vided hazard pay for the pilots and crew members of those airlines.
in,the united states contracted with capital aviation to provide flights to baghdad and kabul.the contract provided one set of funds for the flight services by capital aviation and another set of funds for the hazard pay for the pilots and crew members.
pursuant to the contract,every pilot,first officer,and international relief officer was to receive in hazard pay per flight.every other crew member on the flights,including attendants and mechanics,was to receive in hazard pay per round trip.
the contract contained a provision to ensure that the hazard pay actually made it to the pilots and crew members who were risking their lives by transporting supplies through war zones.the provision required capital aviation to pass the hazard pay through to any subcontractors,who were also required to pass the hazard pay through to their employees without taking a cut for themselves.
capital aviation subcontracted with vision airlines to provide the flights to and from baghdad and kabul.for the average flight,capital aviation received from the united states in hazard pay on behalf of the pilots and crew members.capital aviation then paid that full amount to vision.
in the summer of,at the beginning of vision performance under the contract,vision did pay some of the hazard pay to its pilots,but by august of that year,vision stopped paying hazard pay to any of its employees,and it kept the money for its own benefit.in addition to ceasing its intermittent distribution of hazard pay,vision also fired all pilots and crew members who knew about or had previously received hazard pay,and it replaced them with employees who were unaware that they were entitled to it.
in january,hester filed a class action complaint in district court on behalf of vison pilots and crew members on the relevant flights.the court certified the class.the class theories included unjust enrichment,money had and received,and conversion.the complaint alleged that,since september,vision had received and retained more than million in hazard pay on behalf of its pilots and flight crews,and the class sought damages in that amount.
in april,the class sent vision interrogatories and requests for production,requesting all communications and documents that relate to hazard pay.vision responded by affirming that defendant has no documents or communications relating to hazard pay.
in july,the class filed a motion to compel vision to produce the requested documents and to respond to the interrogatories.in october,the court held a hearing on the motion to compel.at the hearing,vision told the court that it had not produced the requested documents because there is no hazard pay.in response,the class counsel showed the court some of vision invoices,which the class had obtained by subpoenaing third parties in virginia.at least one invoice contained line entries such as hazardous duty bonus,hazardous duty flight deck bonus,hazardous duty bonus,flight crew,and hazardous duty bonus,cabin crew.vision claimed that that invoice was merely an internal document that vision had used to calculate the total bid,and because vision never actually paid a hazardous duty pay differential to any of its flight crews,there was no hazard pay.vision also told the court that,in the contract between vision and its upstream contractors,there is no amount that is separated or allocated for hazard pay.
at the end of the hearing,the court denied the class motion to compel because the court determined that the parties had failed to meet and confer sufficiently to figure out what each side needed to produce.the court granted a day discovery extension.
vision eventually turned over some documents to the class,but before doing so,vision used a black marker to obscure large portions of those documents,redacting what appeared to be text,numbers,and invoice entries.vision did not provide a privilege log or claim that the redacted information was privileged.because of the redacted documents,the class expert witness was not able to complete his report by the deadline,so the class filed a motion to extend that deadline.
the class filed a second motion to compel,and in september,the court granted that motion and ordered vision to produce the requested documents by september.on september,the court held a pretrial conference,at which it learned that vision still had not produced the documents as ordered.the court again ordered vision to produce the documents.on october,the day after the trial was initially scheduled to begin,vision still had not complied with the order to produce the documents,so hester filed a motion for sanctions.
on october,the court scheduled a hearing and ordered vision to show cause why the court should not strike vision answer and enter a default judgment.the court written order to show cause stated that t he court believes that vision conduct has interfered with the court ability to hear this case,delayed litigation,disrupted the court timely management of its docket,wasted judicial resources,and threatened the integrity of the court orders and the orderly administration of justice.the written order also warned vision that f ailure to comply with the local rules of practice,the federal rules of civil procedure,and the court orders may result in sanctions,up to and including sanctions.
on october,vision responded to the motion for sanctions by providing a few of the requested documents.on october and october,vision filed supplemental responses,both of which contained a few more responsive documents.
on october,the court held a hearing on the show cause order.at that hearing,harold gewerter,vision counsel,affirmed that he had turned over everything that vision had provided him 
no,everything that we have has been provided,your honor.t here been no intentional delays whatsoever on my part and none on behalf of my client,it just the system and the nature of the program and getting the proper approvals.t hey have everything that my client has or has access to,your honor.and i have made sure that within hours of me receiving anything,i sent it out.t hey have every document.there nothing else out there.there no surprises that are going to be produced at trial.i assure this court,there has been no intentional delay whatsoever.everything that been done is fast as it can be done t here are no other documents.i asked that question ad nauseam to my client and other people.we have produced all of the records that we have.my client unfortunately does keep a perfect set of records,it been a problem and but every record that we did have or do have has been turned over and they now have them.
at the hearing,the court also discussed vision failure to produce a privilege log for the redacted material and the possibility of sanctioning vision for forcing the class to litigate with a third party in virginia to obtain documents that vision should have produced.the court warned vision on the record that,based on vision intentional discovery violations,the court has the authority to strike vision answer and to enter a default judgment.
at one point in the hearing,the class identified,as an example of vision insufficient production,a document that vision had produced only in heavily redacted form.that document was marked as page,although vision had not produced pages through or any pages beyond page.because vision still had not produced an unredacted version of page,the following exchange ensued gewerter represents vision,and buckner represents the class 
the court okay.i want to stay with this document.do you have access to this document unredacted 
gewerter i have access but the one i have is actually a little bit larger but it the same thing,just so you know that.
the court do you know what do you know what the nature of the items that are redacted are 
gewerter yes.i found those out,yes.your honor,i have do i have a copy of the unredacted version i have a i do have that now,yes,and i thought it was attached to the i was out of town last week.
the court i understand you were out of town.
gewerter and i thought this was attached to even though it not part of the contract,it,it really a reasonableness test,i do now have it.this was done i on the cell phone back in washington talking to my secretary trying to coordinate on this as were coming into my office.
the court you do have an unredacted copy of this 
gewerter yes,the only thing is 
the court can you give an unredacted copy to the plaintiff 
gewerter i will then,your honor.
the court today.
gewerter except the one they going to get,so they do think it any different,the print itself is a little bit larger and it looks like it was but it the exact same document,somehow it got printed differently,but it the same document.
the court all right.
buckner judge,actually we like the whole document,not just obviously it page of something.i mean,we like the whole thing.
gewerter that the end of the contract.what happens is when they all done with the contract they then physically affix this to the contract to go upstream to mcneil i should say and that how this this document is post 
the court are there pages then in the contract and then this is the page 
gewerter i do have it because,you know,the contract printed off different ways and there is one version with pages.there some version with different amounts of pages.unfortunately it depends on whose computer you get this off of,so there nothing else out there,your honor.i have asked from the horse mouth,is there anything else out there and i was told from six other people sitting in a room with nine people,there nothing else out there,last friday morning.
the court so,if i understand what it is that you told the court is,is that except for this document page which is now redacted that you have an unredacted copy and that you can provide,as to all the other documents that buckner has talked about that it is your understanding from vision that the documents either do not exist or what does exist have been disclosed 
gewerter that correct.
the court then ordered vision to produce a unredacted version of page to the class by the end of that day,october.vision did not produce page.instead,vision produced a different document,labeled section,which had never before been produced,although it was responsive to discovery requests.also,vision did not produce the larger document of which section was apparently a part.
on november,the court ordered vision answer stricken,default judgment entered,and a jury trial to be held to determine damages.the court explained vision discovery violations in a written order.
that same day,vision finally turned over an unredacted version of page.vision counsel stated that he had just received page minutes ago from a secure location.vision did not produce pages through or any other pages of the larger document.
a few days later,the court held the jury trial on damages.before the jury was selected,the court ordered that the jury will not be permitted to entertain punitive damages because the complaint does not establish sufficient evidence,nor clear and convincing evidence as required by the nevada revised statutes,of conduct justifying punitive damages.after two days of trial,the jury returned a damages verdict of,which,after including interest and costs,became a judgment totaling.
ii.discussion 
we first address the district court order striking vision answer.a court order imposing sanctions is reviewed for abuse of discretion.dreith nu image,cir jorgensen cassiday,cir.if a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery,the court may impose sanctions,including striking pleadings in whole or in part.b a iii see also,dreith,at.where the sanction results in default,the sanctioned party violations must be due to the willfulness,bad faith,or fault of the party.jorgensen,at internal quotation marks omitted.a court finding that conduct is willful or in bad faith is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.id.
in this case,the district court found that vision has intentionally delayed production of documents,misrepresented its current and past production to both the court and the class,and otherwise engaged in bad faith conduct.the court findings that vision violated the court discovery order and that vision did so willfully and in bad faith are both supported by evidence in the record and the court own credibility determinations.vision does not argue that it did not violate the discovery order or that its actions were not willful and in bad faith.
vision sole argument is that the district court abused its discretion because it failed to consider less drastic sanctions,which is one of the factors that a district court must consider before striking a pleading.see,dreith,at.because the district court thoroughly discussed less drastic sanctions in its written order,vision argument is meritless.
although a default judgment sanction is a harsh penalty imposed only in extreme circumstances,we will overturn it only if we have a definite and firm conviction that it was clearly outside the acceptable range of sanctions.id.citation omitted quoting malone postal.
a court must consider the following five factors before striking a pleading or declaring default the public interest in expeditious resolution of litigation the court need to manage its docket the risk of prejudice to the other party the public policy favoring the disposition of cases on their merits and the availability of less drastic sanctions.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
in this case,the district court considered each of those factors and made the following determinations 
t he public interest in the expeditious resolution of cases is best served by striking vision answer and entering a default against it.
t he court interest in managing its docket is best served by striking vision answer because vision intentional,bad faith conduct in the discovery process has led to multiple hearings and motions before this court which have nothing to do with the merits of this case,but have been necessary due to vision misconduct.these extra motions and hearings have interfered with the court ability to efficiently manage its docket in a manner fair to all parties with pending cases.
vision conduct has prejudiced the class and limited the class ability to try this case 
while public policy favors that cases be heard on their merits,vision has done everything it can to prevent such resolution.through its conduct,vision has attempted to ensure that an accurate and fair trial on the merits of this case will never happen.
the court devoted special attention to the availability of less drastic sanctions.it carefully weighed the impact and severity of this sanction and considered whether alternative sanctions would be sufficient,but it determined that no alternative sanction would be sufficient and vision conduct warrants striking its answer.the court explained why neither a discovery extension nor an adverse inference instruction would be sufficient under the circu
