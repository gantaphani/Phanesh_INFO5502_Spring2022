fred duran filed a putative class action complaint against obesity research institute,llc ori and stores,collectively,defendants.duran alleges defendants falsely claimed that ori products,lipozene and metaboup,have weight loss benefits.the court approved a settlement providing that class members submitting a claim without proof of purchase would receive,and those submitting receipt s would receive one refund of double the unit price paid.the settlement also provided that ori would cease making certain assertions in product advertising.defendants also agreed to not oppose a motion seeking in attorney fees to class counsel.
in a class estimated to consist of between and consumers,claims were submitted,in the total amount of.assuming there were class members,less than of percent percent submitted claims.thus,the proposed settlement buys a nationwide release for the price of about six cents per class member.and for achieving this result,class counsel receive in attorney fees about percent of the total amount paid.
objectors,class members demarie fernandez,alfonso mendoza,and brian horowitz collectively,objectors appeal,contending the settlement is the product of collusion.objectors assert the class did not receive sufficient notice of settlement,and the settlement is unreasonable and inadequate.they also contend the attorney fee award is excessive.
as we explain,the downloadable online claim form,a part of the class notice of settlement,misrepresents three material terms of the settlement the amount of payment to class members is misstated the claim form refers to hydroxycut products,which are not involved in this case and a civil code section release was included in the claim form,although at the preliminary approval hearing the court stated it would not approve such a release.
after we called these errors in the claim form to counsels attention no one raised this issue in the trial court and requested supplemental briefing,class counsel and defendants candidly conceded,t he class members were not clearly informed of what the terms of the settlement were,and what benefits they would receive and what claims they would release if they submitted a claim.nevertheless,class counsel and defendants contend the trial court determination that the settlement is fair and reasonable should be affirmed,and the case should be remanded only to decide the details and logistics of giving corrected class notice.
remand can not be limited to giving a corrected class notice.the judgment must be reversed because the class notice failed in its fundamental purpose to apprise class members of the terms of the proposed settlement.the erroneous notice injected a fatal flaw into the entire settlement process and undermines the court analysis of the settlement fairness.see petrone veritas software in re veritas software.sec.lit.cir,veritas.
although reversal on this ground makes it unnecessary to consider other issues objectors raise,in the interests of judicial economy,we also discuss two issues that will likely arise on remand the manner of giving class notice of settlement,and whether the trial court properly considered the injunctive relief portion of the settlement as the most important part in determining its reasonableness.
factual and procedural background 
duran putative class action complaint 
in may duran filed a putative class action complaint against ori and for alleged violations of the consumers legal remedies act clra civ.code,et,unfair competition law bus.code,et,false advertising law bus.code,et and other state law claims.duran filed the action on behalf of himself and a ll persons,nationwide who purchased ori diet products for personal use after august,until the date notice is disseminated.

motion for class certification 
in july duran filed a motion for class certification,set for hearing in december.in seeking class certification,class counsel stated,lipozene and metaboup are not,in fact,clinically proven to be miracle pills and defendants have simply swindled consumers out of millions of dollars based on a uniform set of misrepresentations that make up a marketing story.
c.the first motion for preliminary approval 
in november before the class certification motion was heard duran and ori jointly moved for preliminary approval of settlement.the settlement included certification of a settlement class defined as all persons in the united states who purchased ori products during the class period for personal or household use 
the settlement provided that class members submitting a valid claim without proof of purchase would receive,and those submitting proof of purchase would receive double the unit price paid between and,limited to one such refund.the settlement agreement provides that claims will be paid from a fund.

additionally,defendants agreed to not oppose a request by class counsel for up to in attorney fees and costs.class counsel would seek a incentive award for duran as class representative.
the court declined to rule on the motion for preliminary approval,instead raising several concerns regarding the proposed settlement.the court concerns included is publication on the internet and in one newspaper sufficient counsel has not submitted a copy of the claim form t he court will not approve a civil code section waiver.
d.the second motion for preliminary approval 
after revising the settlement agreement in an attempt to address the court concerns,duran and ori filed a second motion for preliminary approval.class counsel stated the settlement was the result of settlement negotiations during a mediation conducted by a retired superior court judge,herbert hoffman.judge hoffman submitted a declaration stating he supervised the mediation between the parties in this case and that a fter many hours of negotiations,the parties were able to reach a resolution that he believe s is reasonable 
the monetary recovery for class members and structure of the settlement remained the same as the parties presented in the first motion for preliminary approval class members submitting a valid claim form with no proof of purchase would receive.those submitting a valid claim form with proof s of purchase would receive one refund of double the unit price paid.
claims forms could be obtained by calling a number established for that purpose,by requesting one by mail,or by downloading the form from a web site established by the settlement administrator.completed claim forms could be submitted online or by mail.the parties provided the court with an exemplar claim form,which correctly reflected the settlement payouts.
the parties proposed to give class notice of the settlement in three ways publication in usa today notice to class members with known electronic mail addresses and a settlement web site.
as revised,the settlement agreement did not require claimants to waive rights under civil code section.
class notice of settlement 
the court granted this second motion for preliminary approval.in august notice of settlement was published in a monday edition of usa today.the published notice directed readers to a web site,for additional information on submitting a claim.the settlement web site contained downloadable versions of the notice of settlement,settlement agreement,and claim form.
ori sent notice to class members who purchased the products online directly from ori.the notice stated,lipozene has recently reached a nationwide settlement,and invited the recipient to click a link to the settlement web site for more information.

at the end of the period,claim forms were submitted,claiming a total of.the claims administrator received only two requests for exclusion from the settlement.
objections to settlement 
objectors are plaintiffs in a competing putative class action against ori,which was filed on may,three days after duran filed the instant case.the district court stayed that action to avoid duplicat ing the san diego superior court effort in duran and possibly issu ing a conflicting decision.fernandez obesity research institute,llc.lexis.
objectors filed a formal objection to class action settlement.they asserted the settlement was the result of collusion between class counsel and ori and a reverse auction as evidence of the alleged collusion,objectors prepared a chart comparing allegations in duran complaint with a presuit clra letter objectors lawyers sent to ori in march.because class counsel could have obtained the objectors clra letter only from ori,objectors assert the plagiarism in the duran complaint is a smoking gun of collusion between purported adversaries.objectors also noted that class counsel had previously litigated a case against ori,which settled for in attorney fees and zero monetary relief to the class 
objectors argued the court should not approve the settlement because direct notice should have been given to online purchasers of ori products from.com and other retailers,the publication notice was inadequate because it had an estimated reach of only percent of class members,the settlement is substantively unfair and unreasonable,the parties failed to provide evidence establishing the settlement is reasonable,duran lacks standing to settle claims involving metaboup because he did not purchase that product,and the attorney fees are excessive.
motion for final approval 
in january class counsel and ori attorneys filed a joint motion for final approval.the motion was supported,in part,by a declaration from dan reeves,vice president of innotrac corporation,the claims administrator.reeves declaration authenticated and attached a t rue and correct cop y of the downloadable claim form on the settlement web site.this is the claim form,discussed ante,that misstates several terms of the settlement.however,neither the parties nor objectors raised this issue in the trial court.
objectors opposed the motion for final approval,making the same arguments as asserted in their objections to the proposed settlement.
at the hearing,the court expressed concern about the notice,as indicated by the low response rate.stating,i am not particularly happy with it,the court nevertheless approved the settlement.on march,the court entered a final approval order stating,this court hereby approves the settlement set forth in this judgment on april,the court entered a separate order awarding class counsel in attorney fees and awarding duran,as class representative,as an incentive fee.objectors timely appealed.
discussion 
i.the judgment must be reversed because the online claim form misstated material settlement terms 
the principal purpose of notice to the class is the protection of the integrity of the class action process cho seagate technology holdings,th.the notice must fairly apprise the class members of the terms of the proposed compromise and of the options open to the dissenting class members.id.at.a class action settlement notice should present information neutrally,simply,and understandably.the notice should allow class members to evaluate a proposed settlement.notice should describe the formula or plan for computing individual settlement class member recoveries.see cellphone fee termination cases th,the aggregate amount available to all claimants was specified and the formula for determining one recovery was given.nothing more specific is needed.
the notice given here was substantially dependent upon information conveyed to class members through the settlement web site.for example,notice,sent to class members,did not itself contain the settlement terms,but instead instructed recipients to click on a link to the settlement web site to obtain the long form notice and settlement agreement.the notice published in usa today explained the method of calculating settlement payments and generally described the injunctive relief,but also referred readers to the settlement web site f or additional information on submitting a claim the settlement web site states that submitting a valid claim form is the only way to get a cash payment and contains a link to a downloadable claim form.thus,the downloadable claim form is an integrated part of the settlement notice given to class members and submitting a valid claim form was essential to receiving settlement money.
the parties and objectors now agree that the downloadable claim form is inconsistent with material settlement terms approved by the court.first and foremost,there is a discrepancy in the settlement amount.the downloadable claim form states class members submitting receipts would receive a full refund of all products purchased during the class period.however,under the settlement agreement,class members submitting receipts would receive one refund of double the purchase price.
this discrepancy could overvalue or undervalue a claim,depending on the number of purchases and price paid by the claimant.for example,a class member who made six purchases at each would be entitled to as provided in the downloadable claim form,but only under the settlement agreement.conversely,a class member who made one purchase for would receive under the payout formula in the claim form,but under the settlement agreement.
second,the downloadable claim form states class members would also receive a full monetary payment for each hydroxycut product you purchased and for which you have an original proof of purchase,up to no limit.this is also inconsistent with the settlement agreement.the settlement class consists of persons who purchased lipozene,metaboup,and metaboup plus during the class period for personal or household use,with some limited exceptions.duran lawsuit does not involve the distinct product,hydroxycut.
third,the downloadable claim form contains a waiver of rights under civil code section.this apparently is a remnant from an early november draft of the settlement agreement,which at that time included such a waiver.however,at the december hearing on the first motion for preliminary approval,the court stated it would not approve a civil code section waiver.subsequently,the parties revised the settlement agreement to delete that waiver.apparently,the downloadable claim form was not revised accordingly.
although neither objectors nor the parties raised this issue in the trial court,prior to oral argument we notified objectors and the parties that the downloadable claim form appeared to be inconsistent with the settlement and final approval order,and we asked them to submit additional briefing on the point.we have received and considered their letter briefs.
class counsel and defendants contend that because objectors did not challenge the contents of the claim form in the trial court or in their appellate briefs,the discrepancies between the claim form and the settlement terms are waived or forfeited,and should not be addressed in this appeal.
class counsel and defendants are correct that,in general,an appellate court will not review an issue that was not raised by some proper method in the trial court.see brandwein butler th.however,i t is important to remember that the purpose of this general rule is to give the trial court and parties an opportunity to correct an error that could be corrected by some means short of an opposite outcome in the trial court.woodward park homeowners,city of fresno th.
as an exception to the general rule,the appellate court has discretion to consider issues raised for the first time on appeal where the relevant facts are undisputed and could not have been altered by the presentation of additional evidence.tsemetzin coast federal savings loan th,fn.it makes no difference that the issue was first raised on appeal by the court rather than the parties,as long as the parties have been given a reasonable opportunity to address it which they have,in their supplemental briefs.ibid.
the issue involving the inconsistencies between the online claim form and the settlement terms agreed to by the parties and approved by the court may be considered on appeal because it involves applying law to undisputed facts.the operative facts the terms of the settlement and the content of the online claim form are undisputed and are fixed.there is nothing the parties could have done in the trial court to alter or vary these facts.
this is also an error the trial court could not have cured,even if the issue had been raised at the final approval hearing.the claims process was over.if objectors had raised this issue below,the trial court could have responded only by requiring class notice of settlement to be redone correctly,and by deferring any ruling on the settlement fairness until after notice was given again and the claims process was completed.veritas,supra,at the adequacy of the notice is antecedent to the merits of the settlement.
moreover,appellate courts are most likely to consider an issue involving undisputed facts for the first time on appeal where the issue involves important questions of public policy or public concern.eisenberg el,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group.in the context of a class action settlement,the trial court has a fiduciary responsibility as guardians of the rights of the absentee class members when deciding whether to approve a settlement agreement.luckey superior court th.this reflects concerns that the absent class members,whose rights may not have been considered by the negotiating parties,be adequately protected against fraud and collusion.wershba apple computer,th,wershba.the court responsibility to protect absent class members further warrants our consideration of this issue.
turning to the merits,class counsel and defendants concede the notice was defective and defendants need to provide the class members with notice of the actual settlement terms and a proper claim form and the class members need to be provided with another opportunity to submit a claim however,class counsel and defendants argue the court ruling that the settlement is reasonable,fair and adequate should not be reversed.they argue,t he fact that the claim form that was published on the web site does not reflect the terms of the settlement is not relevant to the issue of whether those terms were fair and reasonable in the first place.
we disagree because the adequacy of class notice of settlement is intertwined with the court assessment of the reasonableness of the settlement.in assessing whether a settlement is fair,reasonable,and adequate,the court should consider,among other things,the amount offered in settlement and the reaction of the class members to the proposed settlement.dunk ford motor th.
given the defective notice previously given and the nature of this settlement,it is impossible to know now what the amount offered in settlement will be after proper notice is given.it is also impossible to determine the reaction of the class members to the proposed settlement,whether class members will participate in the settlement,object,or opt out before proper notice is even given.
accordingly,the material inconsistencies between the downloadable claim form and the approved settlement undermines the court analysis of the fairness of the settlement and requires the judgment to be reversed.veritas,supra,at vacating judgment approving class settlement where notice to the class was misleading.
for the benefit of the parties on remand,we now address other issues likely to arise on remand.
ii.direct notice,publication notice,and injunctive relief 
notice issues 
to satisfy due process,notice to class members must be the best practicable,reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.consumer cause,gooch natural food markets,th,fn.in determining how to disseminate class notice of settlement whether by direct mail,publication,or something else the standard is whether the notice has a reasonable chance of reaching a substantial percentage of the class members.wershba,supra,th at.the trial court has virtually complete discretion in determining how that can most practicably be accomplished.owners for fair franchising southland th.however,when notice is a person due,process which is a mere gesture is not due process.the means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.mullane cent.hanover bank trust.
ori sent notice by to of its customers who purchased lipozene products from ori web site.however,by ori own estimate,there are somewhere between another to class members the parties chose to notify these class members by publishing notice of the settlement in usa today and by establishing a settlement web site.
objectors presented evidence showing that online purchasers of lipozene from.com must provide a mailing address.objectors contend direct notice should have been sent to such class members.objectors also contend the parties should have subpoenaed records from other retailers,such as amazon,cvs,and walgreens,to obtain addresses of class members who purchased ori products from those stores.
however,contends it can not obtain consumer addresses for those who purchased from its online store because the entity operating.com.com usa,llc is not the entity duran sued,which is stores.
moreover,ori attorney filed a declaration stating he reached out to several retailers to obtain customer contact information,but was told that obtaining such information is illegal,unavailable or improper.
on remand,class counsel and defendants will have to provide a better foundation to support a ruling that direct notice need not be given.regarding class members who purchased online from,there is no evidence that anyone associated with stores,a defendant in this case,even tried to obtain class members mailing or addresses from.com usa,llc.the
