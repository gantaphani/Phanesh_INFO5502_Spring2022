larry monroe appeals the district court dismissal of his action,alleging the court erred in denying his motion for class action certification,dismissing his fourth amendment claim for failure to plead facts sufficient to show a seizure,and finding no equal protection violation because a racial classification had not occurred.we affirm.
in the spring of,charlottesville police began investigating a serial rapist who was consistently described by victims as a black male.at least three composite images were formed based on descriptions given by victims over the course of the investigation.in addition to the descriptions,however,officers also had samples of the assailant dna.in an effort to apprehend the attacker,officers approached individuals in the community who matched the general description and who did not have a dna sample on file with police,and asked those individuals if they would submit a dna specimen.those approached varied somewhat in height,build,and skin tone,but all were.the individuals came to the attention of officers through various means,but in total,black males were stopped over several years,including monroe,who was approached at his home by officer mooney.other individuals were stopped on the street by officers and asked to submit a dna sample 
monroe sued the city of charlottesville and individual officers,including officer mooney collectively,the city,under alleging violations of the fourth and fourteenth amendments.specifically,monroe alleged an equal protection violation on the grounds that he was stopped because he was black,and because officers do not perform such dragnet stops of individuals when the victim describes an assailant as white.in addition,monroe alleged he was subject to an unreasonable seizure when officer mooney came to monroe home and when monroe gave bodily fluids for dna analysis.monroe sought to pursue his equal protection claim as a class action.
the district court,on the city rule b motion dismissed that portion of monroe equal protection claim that alleged a violation on the grounds that monroe was approached because he was black.citing brown city of oneonta,cir,the district court held that the government does not expressly classify a person based on race,and the equal protection clause is not implicated,when officers limit their investigation to only those persons matching a victim description of an assailant.monroe could proceed,however,on the claim that the city does not investigate crimes the same way when the assailant is described as white.the district court also dismissed monroe claim that he was unreasonably seized when officer mooney came to monroe home because monroe failed to state facts sufficient to show the consensual encounter escalated to a seizure.monroe was granted leave to amend his complaint,however,and his claim that his bodily fluids were unreasonably seized was allowed to proceed.
monroe amended complaint alleged the same claims as the first complaint,but with more factual allegations.specifically,regarding monroe fourth amendment claim,he asserted a seizure on account of officer mooney coming to monroe home in uniform,asking for a dna sample,and failing to tell monroe he could decline the request.in addition,because the encounter was at monroe home,and based on t he state of relations between law enforcement and members of minority communities,he alleged that it was objectively reasonable to feel he was not free to terminate the interaction.
the city again moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim.and,the district judge again dismissed that part of monroe equal protection claim alleging a violation because officers only approached him because he was black,but allowed the remaining portion to proceed.also,the district judge again dismissed monroe claim that he was unreasonably seized,stating that the newly alleged facts did not cure the original deficiencies.monroe remaining unreasonable seizure giving officer mooney bodily fluids for dna permitted to proceed.the district court then set the date for a class certification hearing and established july,as the deadline for the parties to file memoranda on that issue.
along with its motion in opposition to class certification,the city submitted an affidavit from officer sclafani reciting a conversation he had with monroe where monroe made several statements undermining his fitness to serve as a class representative,including monroe attorneys would not return his calls,the attorneys originally approached him about filing suit,he only learned the suit was filed in his name after reading about it in the paper,the lawsuit made him look bad,and he was not interested in pursuing money damages against officer mooney.monroe did not file a response by the deadline and the class certification hearing was held on july.at the hearing,the central issue was monroe adequacy to represent the class.monroe,however,did not attend the hearing and did not submit an affidavit in response to officer sclafani.rather,monroe attorney testified that she always returns calls and that monroe originally approached her about filing suit.in addition,monroe attorney submitted monroe deposition testimony as evidence of his adequacy to serve as a class representative.at the end of the hearing,the district judge asked,any other evidence to come in monroe attorney responded,no further evidence,your honor.yet,on july,monroe filed an affidavit refuting officer sclafani affidavit,and the city opposed the submission as untimely.
in its order,the district judge declined to consider monroe untimely affidavit,and denied monroe motion for class certification because monroe failed to show that he would adequately represent the class.the court relied in large part upon officer sclafani affidavit.the district court also relied on the fact that in monroe deposition,monroe could not recognize the complaint and had little to no knowledge about the lawsuit.monroe was allowed to proceed on his individual claims of an equal protection violation based on the city alleged failure to institute similar investigation methods when the assailant is described as white,and the unreasonable seizure of his bodily fluids.rather than proceed,however,monroe filed a voluntary motion to dismiss his remaining claims without prejudice.to secure the city consent to monroe motion and establish appellate jurisdiction,the parties agreed that monroe would be precluded from filing suit on those claims in the the dismissal one with prejudice.the district court then dismissed monroe remaining claims.
monroe now appeals the denial of class certification,the dismissal of his fourth amendment claim,and the dismissal of his equal protection claim.
class certification 
the district court denial of class certification is reviewed for an abuse of discretion,and such decisions are generally accorded great deference.simmons poe,cir.rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure establishes four class certification requirements a class so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable questions of law or fact common to the class a representative party whose claims and defenses are typical of the class claims and defenses and a representative party that will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.id.a plaintiff bears the burden of proving these requirements.thorn life ins,cir.
the district court denied monroe class certification on the grounds outlined in rule a that monroe would not fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.monroe alleges two errors.first,monroe alleges the district court erred in denying admission of his affidavit as untimely when no timing for the admission of evidence was discussed and the affidavit countered officer sclafani affidavit.second,monroe claims that even if his affidavit is not considered,rule a was satisfied because he was not simply lending his name to a suit controlled entirely by the class attorney as the district court seemed to find.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to consider monroe untimely affidavit.when deciding a motion for class certification,a district court does not accept the plaintiff allegations in the complaint as true rather,an evidentiary hearing is typically held on the certification issue.gariety grant thornton,llp,cir see also james moore et,moore federal practice ed.further,this court defers to the right of a district court to set and enforce filing deadlines.in this case,the district court set july,as the deadline for submitting memoranda on the issue of class certification,and monroe concluded the july,class certification hearing by stating that he had no further evidence to submit on the issue.thus,the district court acted within its sound discretion by striking monroe untimely affidavit submitted on july,
turning to the court application of rule a,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying class certification on the evidence presented.to satisfy rule a,a class representative must,among other factors,be of a character to vigorously pursue the case.charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice procedure ed collecting cases.findings that a representative lacks sufficient interest,credibility,or either knowledge or an understanding of the a knowledge or understanding of all the intricacies of the litigation is not grounds for denying class certification.id.the analysis is intended to ensure that the parties are not simply lending their names to a suit controlled entirely by the class attorney.id.
with these principles in mind,the district court made findings showing that monroe had little interest in or knowledge and understanding of the case,and appeared to be merely lending his name to the suit.the city offered evidence showing monroe was unaware of the suit and only learned the suit was filed in his name after reading about the lawsuit in the newspaper said the class attorneys would not return his calls and believed the lawsuit made him look bad.the only rebuttal evidence monroe offered was his attorney testimony that she always returns calls and that monroe approached her about the suit.further,at monroe deposition,he could not recognize the complaint and said he knew nothing about when the lawsuit was filed.curiously,all inquiries made into when monroe first considered or authorized filing suit,and whether he was aware of the suit prior to it actually being filed,were objected to on the basis of privilege.because monroe bears the burden of showing that rule a is satisfied,and monroe offered virtually no evidence refuting glaring questions as to his adequacy as a class representative,and because the district court is accorded great deference in deciding class certification issues,there was no abuse of discretion.
fourth amendment claim 
the district court dismissed monroe fourth amendment claim under rule b.monroe alleges the district court required him to plead facts sufficient to prove his claim,instead of merely requiring enough facts from which the trial court could infer a basis for monroe claim when viewed in conjunction with potentially discoverable facts,as rule b requires.an order granting dismissal under rule b is reviewed de novo taking the factual allegations in the complaint as true.bass dupont de nemours,cir.however,the court need not accept the legal conclusions drawn from the facts,and need not accept as true unwarranted inferences,unreasonable conclusions,or arguments.jordan alternative res,cir.
on a rule b motion,a complaint must be dismissed if it does not allege enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.giarratano johnson,cir quoting bell atl.twombly,d.in twombly,the supreme court upheld a rule b dismissal because the complaint did not allege sufficient facts showing a claim was plausible rather than merely conceivable.at.thus,i n reviewing a motion to dismiss an action pursuant to rule b a court must determine whether it is plausible that the factual allegations in the complaint are enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.andrew clark,cir quoting twombly,at.
to establish a fourth amendment claim,monroe must show he was unreasonably seized by a government actor.see henry purnell,cir.the district court dismissed monroe claim because he failed to sufficiently plead facts showing he was seized.monroe complaint,which must be taken as true,alleges the following to establish seizure 
he was visited in his home and coerced into giving a dna sample 
the encounter was not consensual because monroe had both an objectively and subjectively reasonable belief that he was not free to decline the officer request or otherwise terminate the encounter 
the officer was in uniform and did not tell monroe he could terminate the encounter 
the encounter was at monroe home and he was concerned neighbors would view him as a snitch 
monroe,based on his and others interactions with police,believed he had to comply with the officers,and the fact that he was approached at his home meant he was not free to terminate the interaction and 
monroe belief that he could not terminate the encounter was objectively reasonable based on t he state of relations between law enforcement and members of minority communities.
a seizure does not occur,and the fourth amendment is not implicated,when an officer merely approaches an individual and asks a few questions.florida bostick,d.to elevate such an encounter to a seizure,a reasonable person must feel he is not free to disregard the officer and terminate the encounter.id.this objective determination is made by taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding the encounter.id.at.thus,to survive a rule b motion,it must be plausible on its face that the facts alleged in monroe complaint state a claim to relief,establish a seizure.
the district court properly concluded that monroe subjective beliefs were irrelevant in assessing whether a reasonable person would have felt free to terminate the encounter.monroe attempts to circumvent the objective standard by stating that if his beliefs are shared by a sufficient proportion of the population then his belief is objectively reasonable.it is important to note what rule monroe is asking this court to adopt.to agree that monroe subjective belief that he was not free to terminate the encounter was objectively reasonable because relations between police and minorities are poor would result in a rule that all encounters between police and minorities are seizures.such a rule should be rejected.a similar argument was rejected in united states analla,cir.in analla,the defendant argued it was objectively reasonable for him to believe he could not terminate a consensual encounter based on his experience with police.id.at.this claim was rejected because the analysis is an objective one.id.thus,while monroe subjective beliefs may be facts,they are irrelevant facts that neither plausibly give rise to a right to relief nor suggest there are discoverable facts that may plausibly give rise to a right to relief.
the remaining facts in the complaint regarding the alleged seizure do not satisfy the twombly test either.first,officer mooney failure to tell monroe that he could terminate the encounter has been rejected as a means of establishing a seizure,and does not imply there are discoverable facts that establish otherwise.id.citing ins delgado,d.second,the allegations that monroe was coerced,that his belief was objectively reasonable,and that the encounter was not consensual are legal conclusions,not facts,and are insufficient.bass,at.the remaining two officer mooney was in uniform and he approached monroe at his describe many consensual encounters,are insufficient to survive a rule b motion,and do not imply there are other discoverable facts that raise a right to relief above the speculative level.twombly,at.thus,the district court did not err in dismissing monroe fourth amendment claim.
equal protection claim 
the district court dismissed monroe equal protection claim stating,that when a victim of a crime provides investigators with a description of her assailant,that description includes the assailant race and gender,and investigators then act on that description,there is no express racial classification.thus,citing brown city of oneonta the district court held the equal pr
