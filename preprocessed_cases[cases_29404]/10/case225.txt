plaintiffs appeal from an award of summary judgment to defendants in an antitrust class action alleging a conspiracy to fix prices in violation of section of the sherman act.defendants stora enso north america corporation sena and stora enso oyj seo and former defendants upm kymmene corporation and upm kymmene,together,upm are manufacturers and sellers of publication paper,a type of paper used in preparing printed material of various types.plaintiffs a certified class consisting of direct purchasers of defendants paper products contend that,in the relevant period,they paid higher prices for publication paper than they would have in the absence of the alleged agreement.
plaintiffs theory of conspiracy is relatively simple.in august and november,and again in february,sena and upm as well as several other publication paper manufacturers raised their list prices for certain types of publication paper.the price hikes mirrored each other in amount and occurred in close succession.plaintiffs maintain that sena and upm instituted these three price increases pursuant to an agreement,rather than independently.plaintiffs also contend that,in the same time frame,sena and upm coordinated the closure of paper mills in order to reduce the supply of publication paper,and that seo played a material role in the overall scheme.the district court for the district of connecticut stefan underhill,concluded that defendants were entitled to summary judgment on all counts because,in its view,and in light of the standards articulated by the supreme court in matsushita electric industrial zenith radio,plaintiffs failed to offer sufficient evidence to dispel the possibility that sena and upm acted independently.in re publication paper antitrust,md,wl,at.
we hold that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to sena because a jury could reasonably find that sena and upm entered into an agreement to raise the price of publication paper,and that,as implemented,this agreement damaged plaintiffs.sena was thus not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.as to seo,however,we conclude that the district court properly awarded it summary judgment because plaintiffs failed to offer sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that seo had any direct involvement in decisions regarding sena marketing,sale,or pricing of publication paper in the united states.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment in part,affirm it in part,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
unless otherwise noted,the following facts are not disputed by the parties.
a.the parties 
seo is a pulp and paper manufacturer headquartered in helsinki,finland.in august,seo acquired consolidated papers,an american paper manufacturer located in wisconsin.thereafter,consolidated papers renamed sena operated as a subsidiary of seo.from august until may,kai korhonen was president of sena.under korhonen leadership,sena sales and marketing team would recommend to him whether sena should initiate a price increase or follow a price increase previously announced by a competitor.as president,korhonen had the final say over sena pricing strategy and decisions.trial tr.at 
upm is also a pulp and paper manufacturer headquartered in helsinki.in january,markku tynkkynen became president of upm magazine paper division.in this role,tynkkynen had responsibility for,and final authority over,upm pricing of publication paper in the united states.dep.of markku tynkkynen,at.
b.the publication paper industry 
commercial paper is a type of publication paper that is used for printing and advertising.manufactured in several different grades,some of which are numbered through,its quality ranges from fine the most expensive type to supercalendered the least expensive.fine paper categorized in the industry as including grades,and is typically used for publications.magazine paper comprised of grades and is generally used in ordinary magazines and store catalogues.supercalendered paper which is not assigned grade often used to print the advertising inserts found in newspapers.
the present action involves publication paper,which,for purposes of this litigation,is defined as grades,and of coated commercial paper the publication paper that plaintiffs purchased thus includes the coated products of some fine,and all magazine,paper.publication paper is commonly considered a commodity product,a product that is uniform rather than differentiated across sellers.the publication paper market in north america is an oligopoly.
in and,when the agreement is alleged to have been made and implemented,international paper ip,sena,and upm ranked first,second,and third,respectively,in volume of production of publication paper in north america.each had a market share of between and their combined market shares totaled approximately during the same period,publication paper was selling at historically low prices,and the industry suffered from excess capacity and low demand despite these unfavorable conditions,in august,ip and meadwestvaco mead,another publication paper manufacturer,both announced price increases in november,mead announced a price increase and in february,ip announced a price increase.both in the timing of the announcements and the amount of the increases,sena and upm price increases in august and november and in february closely followed those of their competitors.
c.the alleged conspiracy 
the conspiracy alleged in this action centers around certain private meetings and phone calls between korhonen and tynkkynen that undisputedly occurred soon before each of these three price increase announcements.
the two men originally met in finland in the late,when both were working as production engineers for ahlström company.during the approximately five years that they worked together,they were also neighbors,and became close friends.tynkkynen left ahlström company in korhonen,however,remained at the firm,which was later acquired by a predecessor company to seo.over the twenty years following tynkkynen departure,despite their earlier close friendship,korhonen and tynkkynen saw each other only on occasion,their interactions typically limited to social settings and meetings of the finnish paper engineers association,of which they were both members.
the august price increase 
in august,soon after he became president of upm magazine paper division and twenty years after they last worked as colleagues,tynkkynen invited korhonen,who by then had become president of sena,to lunch.as he later testified at sena criminal trial,tynkkynen wanted korhonen to provide him with insight into operating in the north american market,a market with which tynkkynen was unfamiliar.tynkkynen also sought to determine whether sena had sufficient market power to lead a price increase in the united states.
in response to tynkkynen invitation,tynkkynen and korhonen met for approximately minutes on august in a private executive lunchroom at upm headquarters in helsinki.during the meeting,korhonen expressed his opinion that,contrary to tynkkynen view,sena was not a market leader for coated grade or supercalendered paper.tynkkynen and korhonen estimated that together sena and upm likely would have a combined market share for coated grade paper.tynkkynen advised korhonen,upm has been a follower and will be a follower meaning that upm would follow price increases announced by any major competitor and would also try to implement those increases consistently with its customers trial tr.at.no one else was present during the meeting,and korhonen did not disclose to anyone at sena that he met with tynkkynen or mention the substance of their discussion.
the following day,on august,ip and mead announced a per hundredweight cwt.price increase for publication paper grades through effective october.four days later,on august,sena issued an identical announcement as to price,paper grades,and effective date.on august,upm announced its per cwt.price increase for publication paper grades and,on the same schedule.according to plaintiffs,upm sold little or no grade publication paper in the united states at that time.
the november price increase 
on november,again at tynkkynen invitation,korhonen and tynkkynen met at the chicago airport and had lunch together in a private dining room at the hilton hotel.during their meeting,korhonen and tynkkynen discussed the poor economic conditions in the industry prices were eroding because of an excess supply.notwithstanding the august price increase,which had become effective approximately five weeks earlier,they agreed that the industry was in need of a price increase.tynkkynen again advised korhonen that upm would follow if a competitor announced a price increase.apart from his personal assistant,who arranged his itinerary,korhonen did not disclose to anyone at sena that he met with tynkkynen.
the following week,on november,mead announced a per cwt.price increase for publication paper grades through effective january.on november,after upm had decided to follow mead price increase but before any public announcement was made,tynkkynen called korhonen and left a voicemail stating,mead is out,we are following.id.at.korhonen did not return the call.the following day,on november,both sena and ip announced a per cwt.price increase for publication paper grades through,also effective january.two days later,on november,upm issued a written announcement declaring a per cwt.price increase for publication paper grades through,also effective as of the turn of the year.
the february price increase 
on february,executives at ip decided at an internal meeting to increase the price of their grade publication paper,subject to final approval by senior ip officials.three days later,on february,korhonen called tynkkynen.each man asserts that he does not remember exactly what was discussed during the call,which lasted approximately five minutes 
on february,ip publicly announced a per cwt.price increase for grade publication paper effective april.the following morning,on february,korhonen called tynkkynen and left a message requesting that tynkkynen return his call.that afternoon,tynkkynen called korhonen,and the two men spoke for four minutes.during the call,korhonen told tynkkynen,ip out and sena will match and follow.id.at.tynkkynen understood match and follow to mean that sena would follow ip price increase and also would implement the price increase seriously at the customer end in other words,that sena would hold a hard line in negotiating with customers.id.tynkkynen informed korhonen that upm had notified some of its customers of its intention to match ip price increase.approximately one after the men phone call,sena and faxed a brief letter to its customers announcing a per cwt.price increase for grade paper,coated grade paper,and supercalendered products.that same afternoon,upm mailed a bulletin to its customers in which it,too,announced a per cwt.price increase for grade publication paper.both price increases were to take effect april.
after korhonen and tynkkynen conversation on february,tynkkynen advised kevin lyden,president of upm north american subsidiary,that he thought sena was going to be tough on the price increase it had announced.dep.of peter littley,at.lyden understood tynkkynen statement to mean that sena would stand firm on its price increase when negotiating contracts with its customers.according to lyden,tynkkynen assessment of how aggressively sena would implement the price increase was based,in part,on his february phone call with korhonen.
d.the department of justice investigation and sena criminal trial 
in,the united states department of justice doj launched a criminal antitrust investigation into the publication paper industry.in july,after learning that government investigators sought to interview him in relation to the investigation,tynkkynen called korhonen from a public telephone booth.tynkkynen concedes that he used a public telephone in order to ensure that he ha d a clean line,a phone line that was not being followed or taped by law enforcement authorities.dep.of markku tynkkynen,at.during their conversation,tynkkynen proposed that he and korhonen develop a joint story concerning what they had discussed during their private phone calls and meetings.trial tr.at.korhonen concurred that developing a joint story was a good idea.id.they decided that if interviewed,they would tell law enforcement officials that in their conversations in and they discussed railroad fees,timber swaps,and the finnish paper engineers association.pricing was not among those topics that they agreed to identify as having been discussed.later,in an august phone call,tynkkynen told korhonen that he intended to tell the government everything that he remembered about their meetings,rather than the joint story they had discussed in july.id.at.
in february,the doj granted conditional full immunity to upm in return for the company cooperation in the investigation.in december,a grand jury issued a indictment against sena charging that from august through june,sena and others entered into a conspiracy to fix the price at which the companies sold publication paper to customers in the united states,in violation of section of the sherman act.the case against sena was tried to a jury in the district court for the district of connecticut christopher droney,in july.united states stora enso am,cr.
during the criminal trial,tynkkynen testified,inter alia,that during their phone conversation on february,he and korhonen reached an agreement that upm and sena would match ip february price increase for coated grade paper and that both firms would seriously implement that price increase with their customers.trial tr.at.for his part,korhonen testified that at the time of the november,meeting,he understood tynkkynen to be trying to initiate something to get the prices improved.id.at.korhonen further testified that after the november meeting,some phone calls occurred between him and tynkkynen during which intentions were exchanged about publication paper price increases,and that,during their february,phone conversation in particular,korhonen told tynkkynen what sena was going to do,and,likewise,tynkkynen told korhonen what upm was going to do.id.at.after both parties presented their evidence,sena unsuccessfully moved for acquittal.on july,in a general verdict,the jury acquitted sena of criminal antitrust violations.
procedural history 
after the doj investigation became public,individual plaintiffs brought nine separate actions against various manufacturers of publication paper in federal district courts across the country,alleging price fixing in the market for publication paper.in november,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation mdl consolidated and transferred these actions to the district court for the district of connecticut,thereby creating mdl,in re publication paper antitrust litigation.additional suits were filed over the course of the following year.they,too,were consolidated with mdl.
in their fifth and final amended complaint,filed in march,plaintiffs brought claims under section of the sherman act,and sections and of the clayton act,and,seeking treble damages and alleging that from october,to may,sena,seo,and upm conspired to fix the prices of coated paper grades,and.in april,the district court approved plaintiffs settlement with upm,leaving only sena and seo as defendants in the mdl proceedings.in may,the district court certified the plaintiff class as a ll persons who directly purchased publication paper for delivery in the united states from sena or seo at any time during the period from october,to and including september,the class period.order granting class certification.dkt.after the close of discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted defendants motion.publication paper,wl,at.
in its decision,the district court rejected plaintiffs argument that tynkkynen testimony that he and korhonen reached an agreement on pricing in february constituted sufficient direct evidence of price fixing to withstand defendants motion for summary judgment.id.at.as to plaintiffs other evidence,the court acknowledged that sena and upm three price increases constituted parallel conduct that the publication paper industry was conducive to collusion and that the communications between tynkkynen and korhonen supported the existence of a conspiracy.nevertheless,the court determined that plaintiffs evidence did not sufficiently exclude the possibility that sena acted independently in raising the prices charged for publication paper and that,in any event,even if tynkkynen and korhonen agreed that upm and sena would follow rivals future price increases,plaintiffs had not demonstrated that such an agreement had some effect on future price increases announced by sena.id.at.the district court also concluded that plaintiffs failed to show that defendants conspired to reduce the supply of publication paper by closing certain of their paper mills,and ruled that plaintiffs offered virtually no evidence demonstrating that seo played a role in the alleged scheme.id.at.
this appeal followed.
on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the district court made several factual and legal errors that require us to reverse the judgment entered for defendants.in particular,they maintain that the district court improperly discounted direct evidence of a agreement improperly failed to draw reasonable inferences in their favor and erred in concluding as a matter of law that the alleged agreement between korhonen and tynkkynen had no effect on sena pricing decisions our task is to determine whether,on the evidence presented,a jury could reasonably conclude that defendants reached an agreement for the purpose and with the effect of raising the price of publication paper.united states socony vacuum oil,accord major league baseball,salvino,cir.this requires evidence sufficient to permit a preponderance finding that higher prices came about as a result of the agreement,rather than through independent action of the defendants.apex oil dimauro,cir.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.mbia fed.ins,cir.we will affirm only if,after construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor,there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
our court has observed that b y avoiding wasteful trials and preventing lengthy litigation that may have a chilling effect on market forces,summary judgment serves a vital function in the area of antitrust law.tops,quality,cir.nevertheless,summary judgment is not a substitute for trial.apex,at.thus,when the evidence admits of competing permissible inferences with regard to whether a plaintiff is entitled to relief,the question of what weight should be assigned to those inferences remains within the province of the at a trial.id.at.
price fixing claims 
section of the sherman act provides that e very contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce is illegal.notwithstanding its broad language,this provision prohibits only unreasonable restraints of trade.bus.elecs.sharp elecs.per se liability attaches,however,to plainly anticompetitive agreements.texaco dagher.an agreement between competitors to fix prices,known as a horizontal agreement,categorically constitutes an unreasonable restraint,and,accordingly,is unlawful per se.id.
to prevail on a claim of horizontal price fixing,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendants entered into a conspiracy formed for the purpose and with the effect of raising price s.socony vacuum,at.in other words,the evidence must show that the defendants conspired to raise prices,and this conspiracy caused injury to the plaintiff in the form of artificially inflated prices.see apex,at in re flat glass antitrust,cir.
parallel pricing among competitors,also known as conscious parallelism,is often proffered as evidence of a agreement.conscious parallelism describes the process,not in itself unlawful,by which firms in a concentrated market might in effect share monopoly power,setting their prices at a,supracompetitive level by recognizing their shared economic interests and their interdependence with respect to price and output decisions.brooke grp.brown williamson tobacco.
conscious parallelism alone,however,does not establish an antitrust violation.such behavior is consistent with both unlawful conspiracy and lawful independent conduct.see apex,at.accordingly,when the defendants parallel pricing forms the basis for a claim,a plaintiff must show additional circumstances often referred to as plus factors which,when viewed in conjunction with the parallel conduct,would permit a to infer a conspiracy.id.such plus factors may include,for example a common motive to conspire evidence that the parallel acts were against the apparent economic of the individual alleged conspirators or evidence of a high level of interfirm communications.id.at.
section of the sherman act does not itself provide a private right of action.that right is established by section of the clayton act,which authorizes private suits by any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws,and affords prevailing plaintiffs a claim to three times their actual damages.
evidence of an agreement 
the scope of matsushita 
in concluding that summary judgment was appropriate in this case,the district court cited extensively to the supreme court decision in matsushita.acknowledging that the evidence as a whole arguably could support an inference of illegal collusive behavior,the district court nonetheless determined that plaintiffs failed to offer sufficient evidence to dispel the possibility that sena acted independently.publication paper,wl,at.the parties dispute the extent to which the tends to exclude formulation articulated in matsushita,at to survive a motion for summary judgment a plaintiff seeking damages for a violation of must present evidence that tends to exclude the possibility that the alleged conspirators acted independently,applies under the circumstances presented here.we take this opportunity to clarify the application of the standards established in that case.
in matsushita,the plaintiffs alleged that japanese television manufacturers had engaged in a longstanding and conspiracy to fix prices in the united states below the level that their costs and market conditions made reasonable.according to the plaintiffs theory,the defendants predatory prices would eventually force competitors to leave the market,at which point the defendants would raise prices to monopoly levels.the court observed that,as a general matter,predatory pricing schemes are rarely tried,and even more rarely successful.id.at.indeed,the conspiracy alleged in matsushita had spanned years without achieving the putatively desired monopoly.because it found both that the plaintiffs theory of conspiracy was implausible and that the defendants conduct could as readily be explained as legitimate competitive behavior,the court required the plaintiffs to come forward with more persuasive evidence to support their claim than would otherwise be necessary to withstand summary judgment.id.at.
matsushita,then,stands for the proposition that substantive antitrust law limits the range of permissible inferences that may be drawn from ambiguous evidence.id.at accord in re high fructose corn syrup antitrust,cir posner.it further holds that the range of inferences that may be draw from such evidence depends on the plausibility of the plaintiff theory.see matsushita,at monsanto spray rite serv,apex,at.thus,where a plaintiff theory of recovery is implausible,it takes strong direct or circumstantial evidence to satisfy matsushita tends to exclude standard.apex,at.by contrast,broader inferences are permitted,and the tends to exclude standard is more easily satisfied,when the conspiracy is economically sensible for the alleged conspirators to undertake and the challenged activities could not reasonably be perceived as procompetitive.flat glass,at eastman kodak image technical,matsushita demands only that the nonmoving party inferences be reasonable in order to reach the jury,a requirement that was not invented,but merely articulated,in that decision.
at several points in its opinion,intermingled with its use of the tends to exclude standard,the district court stated that plaintiffs were required to exclude or dispel the possibility that defendants acted independently.publication paper,wl,at.requiring a plaintiff to exclude or dispel the possibility of independent action places too heavy a burden on the plaintiff.rather,if a plaintiff relies on ambiguous evidence to prove its claim,the existence of a conspiracy must be a reasonable inference that the jury could draw from that evidence it need not be the sole inference.as professors areeda and hovenkamp have advised 
it is important not to be misled by matsushita statement that the plaintiff evidence,if it is to prevail,must tend to exclude the possibility that the alleged conspirators acted independently.the court surely did not mean that the plaintiff must disprove all nonconspiratorial explanations for the defendants conduct.not only did the court use the word tend,but the context made clear that the court was simply requiring sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable fact finder to infer that the conspiratorial explanation is more likely than not.
phillip areeda and herbert hovenkamp,fundamentals of antitrust law,b,at ed footnotes omitted.
of course,the standards established in matsushita do not apply at all when a plaintiff has produced unambiguous evidence of an agreement to fix prices.as such,an admission by the defendants that they agreed to fix their prices is all the proof a plaintiff needs.corn syrup,at.thus,at least three of our sister circuits have held that summary judgment is generally not appropriate where a plaintiff has produced direct,as opposed to circumstantial,evidence of an agreement to fix prices.see williamson oil,philip morris usa,cir petruzzi iga supermarkets,darling delaware,cir in re coordinated pretrial proceedings in petroleum prods.antitrust,cir see also r.ventures,shane,cir quoting,in dicta,ninth circuit decision drawing distinction between direct and circumstantial antitrust evidence.some courts have reached this conclusion by reasoning that direct evidence requires no inferences to establish the proposition or conclusion being asserted.in re baby food antitrust,cir.
neither party in this case questions this evidentiary distinction.nevertheless,we do not think it necessary to draw bright lines to decide this case.see corn syrup,at.all evidence,including direct evidence,can sometimes require a factfinder to draw inferences to reach a particular conclusion,though p erhaps on average circumstantial evidence requires a longer chain of inferences.sylvester sos children vills,cir posner.here,the totality of the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs and with proper regard for the matsushita standards,could support a reasonable inference of illegal collusive behavior.
plaintiffs evidence of an agreement to fix prices 
in this case,the district court concluded that n othing in the record concerning the february price increase suggests that tynkkynen or korhonen had an agreement to follow the ip increase.publication paper,wl,at.we disagree.as previously discussed,tynkkynen testified during sena criminal trial that he and korhonen reached an agreement that upm and sena would follow ip february price increase and that they would implement that price increase on the customer end seriously,to the fullest extent possible.whether or not this testimony a acknowledgment that he understood his numerous communications with korhonen to reflect a agreement admits any ambiguity as to korhonen parallel understanding of the same communications,the testimony is surely strong evidence of a collusive scheme between upm and sena.that would be sufficient to satisfy matsushita tends to exclude standard even if plaintiffs theory were implausible,which it is not.see apex,at 
the district court considered tynkkynen testimony to be of limited value,in part,because,as the court explained and is not disputed,english is not the native language of tynkkynen and korhonen.publication paper,wl,at.any notion that tynkkynen did not understand the meaning of agreement in english or the import of his testimony,however,is belied by the record.tynkkynen repeatedly explained in court that he and korhonen had a common understanding,and that the substance of that understanding was that both companies are matching ip coated price increase and will seriously implement the price increase.so it was a common understanding,and,thus,an agreement.trial tr.at.moreover,defendants conceded at oral argument before this court that translation and language were not an issue.oral arg.tr.at.although an understanding might in some contexts be intended to signal an expectation rather than agreement,the substance of tynkkynen testimony and the context of the events he describes fully support the conclusion that when he said understanding as when he said agreement he meant agreement.
plaintiffs have provided additional evidence to support a reasonable finding that sena and upm engaged in price fixing.the district court found,and defendants do not contest,that the publication paper industry is conducive to collusion publication paper is a commodity product with few substitutes the market is controlled by a limited number of sellers principally,ip,sena,and upm and high capital investment costs limit the entry of new market players.see corn syrup,at describing characteristics that make a market susceptible to collusion.furthermore,during the class period,the publication paper industry suffered from excess capacity and historically low prices,conditions that make price competition more than usually risky and collusion more than usually attractive.id.at.finally,there is ample evidence of conspiratorial behavior.most notably,it is undisputed that in private phone calls and meetings for which no social or personal purpose has been persuasively identified tynkkynen shared upm pricing strategies with korhonen and both men disclosed to each other their companies intentions to increase prices before those decisions had been publicly announced.tynkkynen and korhonen also developed a joint story to conceal from the government the true nature of their communications behavior from which a jury could infer that both men were aware that their communications and related actions regarding publication paper pricing violated the law.
we recognize that despite the strength of plaintiffs evidence of an agreement,the totality of the evidence admits of alternative interpretations namely,that sena as a corporation acted independently of upm in deciding to increase its prices and that the price increases each company announced were the product of certain characteristics of the industry and not any agreement between korhonen and tynkkynen.but it is the province of the jury to determine how much weight to accord tynkkynen testimony and the other relevant evidence.we believe that,on the basis of tynkkynen testimony alone,a jury could reasonably find that sena and upm made an agreement to fix the prices at which their companies sold publication paper in the latter part of and early.plaintiffs other evidence provides additional support for the theory that,as early as august,korhonen and tynkkynen reached an agreement to follow price increases announced by their competitors.in sum,unlike in matsushita,the record in this case presents strong,if not irrefutable,evidence of a conspiracy in a context where the conspiracy goals were aligned with the conspirators economic interests.
applicable law 
having determined that a jury could reasonably find that sena and upm unlawfully agreed to raise prices,we now consider whether there was enough evidence for a jury to find that such an agreement actually caused the price increases that occurred this court has had little occasion to explore at length the issue of causation in the antitrust context although certain principles have emerged from the supreme court opinions and our precedents.the supreme court has noted,for instance,that i t is enough that the illegality is shown to be a material cause of the antitrust injury a plaintiff need not exhaust all possible alternative sources of injury in fulfilling its burden of proving compensable injury.zenith radio hazeltine research.relying on zenith radio,our court has also observed that an antitrust defendant unlawful conduct need not be the sole cause of the plaintiffs alleged injuries to prove a causal connection between the defendant unlawful conduct and the plaintiff injury,the plaintiff need only demonstrate that the defendant conduct was a substantial or materially contributing factor in producing that injury.litton,v.at t,cir see also football league football league,cir.we have held further that to prevail on an antitrust claim,a plaintiff must establish that the injuries alleged would not have occurred but for the defendant antitrust violation,argus eastman kodak,cir,adding necessity to the materiality requirement of our antitrust causation analysis.
applying these basic concepts here,we consider whether there is sufficient evidence from which a jury could find that korhonen and tynkkynen agreement,if proven,was both a material and cause of the price increases.our analysis is enriched and refined by study of causation principles as developed in the tort law context.see generally associated contractors of,cal.council of carpenters,applying common law principles of causation derived from tort and contract law to determine whether the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged an antitrust injury under section of the clayton act.
there is a causal link between an act or activity and an injury when we conclude on the basis of the available evidence that the recurrence of that act or activity will increase the chances that the injury will also occur.guido calabresi,concerning cause and the law of torts an essay for harry kalven,chi.in other words,if an act is deemed wrongful because it is believed significantly to increase the risk of a particular injury,we are entitled in the tort context at least to presume that such an injury,if it occurred,was caused by the act.see,liriano hobart,cir when a defendant negligent act is deemed wrongful precisely because it has a strong propensity to cause the type of injury that ensued,that very causal tendency is evidence enough to establish a prima facie case of.see also bcs,heartwood,llc,cir once a plaintiff presents evidence that he suffered the sort of injury that would be the expected consequence of the defendant wrongful conduct,he has done enough to withstand summary judgment on the ground of absence of causation.under this framework,the burden then shifts to the defendant to bring in evidence tending to rebut the strong inference,arising from the injury,that the act was in fact a cause of the plaintiff injury.liriano,at.
the strength of the evidence 
as applied here,we consider the causal link between an agreement to raise prices and a subsequent price increase.agreements are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal precisely because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue,pac.ry.united states,because such agreements are so likely to result in artificially higher prices being charged to consumers without accomplishing any legitimate business purpose.therefore,the demonstrable existence of an agreement between korhonen and tynkkynen to follow price increases announced by competitors,if proven,constitutes strong evidence that the alleged agreement caused at least some element of the subsequent price increases,amount or effective date,or,at a minimum,the inability of plaintiffs to negotiate below the list price.furthermore,the causal link is presumed to be particularly strong when,as alleged here,the agreement is between executives at rival companies,each of whom has final pricing authority.compare flat glass,at evidence of upper level executives hav ing secret conversations about price has more probative weight than price discussion s among low level sales people,with baby food,at evidence of sporadic exchanges of shop talk among field sales representatives who lack pricing authority is insufficient to survive summary judgment.
defendants contend,and the district court concluded,that even if korhonen and tynkkynen entered into an illegal agreement,the record provides an inadequate basis on which a jury could find that the agreement caused plaintiffs injuries.they so reason from the record reflection that employees in sena sales and marketing department initiated,recommended,and implemented pricing decisions during the class period.defendants maintain that these employees not korhonen independently decided that sena should follow price increases announced by competitors because doing so made economic sense and was consistent with sena pricing philosophy to be a market follower rather than a market leader.defendants further assert that korhonen never altered or vetoed these employees pricing recommendations.accordingly,they urge that the district court properly concluded as a matter of law that even if korhonen and tynkkynen reached a agreement,it had no effect on sena pricing decisions.
although defendants argument has some force,and might well persuade a jury,we are not convinced that it so conclusively rebuts plaintiffs strong evidence that the alleged agreement was both a material and cause of the price increases as to permit an award of summary judgment for defendants.even if other sena employees had responsibility for pricing strategy and implementation,it is undisputed that korhonen,as president of sena,had the final say on all pricing decisions.defendants emphasize that korhonen never told other sena employees about his communications with tynkkynen.but there was no reason for him to do so,and indeed there were strong reasons for him to remain silent on this score.korhonen decisions on pricing were final and,as korhonen himself has admitted,he knew,at a minimum,that his communications with tynkkynen violated sena internal antitrust policy,which prohibited sett ing prices or verify ing the activities of sena competitors by calling competitors,defs.resp.to pls.local rule a statement.moreover,one component of the alleged pricing agreement was holding firm with customers as to price an arrangement that korhonen was in a position to enforce strictly or variably.
in addition,there is scant evidence in the record to support defendants assertion that sena has historically been a market follower rather than a market leader,and that any agreement was therefore of no effect.defendants cite only korhonen qualified statement,made in a declaration filed in the course of this litigation,that sena usually did not initiate a price increase on its own,but rather would respond to and normally match price increases initiated by other paper manufacturers.decl.of kai korhonen in supp.of defs.seo and sena mot.for summ.emphasis added.we are aware of no specific information regarding sena pricing decisions outside of the class period in the record on summary judgment.even during the class period,sena did not uniformly follow the pricing decisions announced by other publication paper manufacturers for example,sena did not match mead price increase on all products in november and led price increases in february for coated grade paper and supercalendered paper products that were not covered by ip price announcement.in any event,the mere fact that following price increases announced by competitors may have been consistent with sena overall pricing strategy does not immunize sena from liability if it had an illegal agreement with upm to adhere to that strategy.defendants conceded as much at oral argument before this court.oral arg.tr.at.
finally,the alleged agreement between korhonen and tynkkynen would have been valuable to sena because it significantly reduced sena risk by coordinating with upm in advance,sena could follow competitors price increases secure in the knowledge that upm,one of its biggest competitors,would not undercut sena.without an advance agreement,sena ran the risk that upm would hold its prices steady,thereby spiriting away sena customers and eating into sena market share.for these reasons,a jury could reasonably conclude that
