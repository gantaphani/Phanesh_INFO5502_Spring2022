in this putative class action lawsuit,sue the secretary of health and human services secretary on behalf of medicare beneficiaries who were placed into observation status by their hospitals rather than being admitted as inpatients.because inpatients are covered by medicare part a,while patients in observation status are covered by medicare part b,placement into observation status allegedly caused these beneficiaries to pay thousands of dollars more for their medical care than they would have had they formally been admitted as inpatients to their hospitals.
the united states district court for the district of connecticut michael shea,judge granted the secretary motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety.plaintiffs now appeal the dismissal of two of their nine claims,which together assert that the secretary violated the medicare act and the federal due process clause by failing to provide expedited notice of the decisions to place them into observation status,or an expedited opportunity to challenge these decisions.
for the reasons that follow,the district court judgment is affirmed in part and vacated in part.specifically,we affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs medicare act claims for substantially the reasons stated in the district court opinion we vacate,however,the dismissal of plaintiffs due process claims.the district court erred in concluding that plaintiffs lacked a property interest in being treated as inpatients,because,in so concluding,the district court accepted as true the secretary assertion that a hospital decision to formally admit a patient is a complex medical judgment left to the doctor discretion.that conclusion,however,constituted an impermissible finding of fact,which in any event is inconsistent with the complaint allegations that the decision to admit is,in practice,guided by fixed and objective criteria set forth in commercial screening guides issued by the centers for medicare medicaid services cms.treating the complaint allegations as true,as we must at this stage,have arguably asserted a property interest protected by the federal due process clause.
background 
statutory framework 
medicare is the federal government program for the elderly.it contains four distinct programs,of which two are relevant here.
the first,medicare part a,is titled hospital insurance benefits for aged and disabled.it provides basic protection against the costs of hospital,related,home health services,and hospice care for,among others,eligible people over years of age.most relevant to this case,part a creates an entitlement to coverage for inpatient hospital services and extended care services.the term inpatient is undefined in the statute,but the secretary,through cms an office within the department of health and human services that administers medicare has defined an inpatient as a person who has been admitted to a hospital for bed occupancy for purposes of receiving inpatient hospital services.in estate of landers,we treated the cms definition as persuasive under skidmore swift and held that a medicare beneficiary is not an inpatient within the meaning of i unless he or she has been formally admitted to a hospital.
the second program,medicare part b,is titled supplementary medical insurance benefits for aged and disabled.it is a voluntary program offering supplemental insurance coverage for those persons already enrolled in the medicare part a program.part b covers visits to doctors and certain other outpatient treatment.because patients who are placed into observation status are treated as outpatients by cms,their care is covered by medicare part therefore,a medicare beneficiary coverage under part a or part b turns on whether hospital services were provided on an inpatient or outpatient basis.and as noted above,this distinction turns entirely on whether the patient was formally admitted to the hospital.it is possible for a patient to spend several days and nights in a hospital without ever being formally admitted such a patient,for medicare purposes,would be treated as an outpatient and his or her care would be covered by part 
the amount that a medicare beneficiary pays out of pocket varies significantly based on whether the services provided were covered under part a or part for instance,if a beneficiary receives hospital services as an inpatient under part a,there is a deductible for the first days in the hospital by contrast,if a beneficiary receives hospital services as an outpatient under part b,he or she will owe a for each service received moreover,medicare will only cover the cost of care at a skilled nursing facility snf if such treatment is provided after transfer from a hospital in which the individual was an inpatient for not less than consecutive days before his discharge.therefore,patients who are placed into observation status and never formally admitted to the hospital will not qualify for snf care,even if they are hospitalized for three or more consecutive days 
facts and procedural history 
on november,plaintiffs filed this putative class action complaint,which asserts,inter alia,that the secretary use of observation status deprived them of the part a coverage to which they were entitled.each named plaintiff alleges that they were charged hundreds of dollars in under medicare part b,as well as thousands of dollars more for their snf care,despite the fact that they received hospital services substantially similar to those provided to inpatients for three or more consecutive days.for example,plaintiff sarah mulcahy alleges that,in june when she was years old,she was taken to the emergency room after suffering severe pain,urinary incontinence,and nausea resulting from a fall she was hospitalized in observation status for five days,during which time she received intravenous medications,chest and rib,and a ct scan of her head.she later received a medicare summary notice msn stating that she owed approximately in part b payments moreover,because the hospital never formally admitted her,she bore the entire cost of her subsequent snf care from june to october,a total of approximately.
plaintiffs also allege that the secretary is,at a minimum,indirectly responsible for these harms.first,plaintiffs assert that the frequency with which medicare beneficiaries are placed on observation status,as well as the average time spent on observation status,have both increased dramatically in recent years plaintiffs attribute these increases,in part,to the financial incentives created by a medicare billing rule namely that,i f a beneficiary is admitted but that admission is later found to be improper,the hospital must refund the part a payment to medicare but can not rebill under part this rule allegedly gives hospitals an incentive to place patients on observation status because that placement at least ensures that the hospital will receive some payment for the stay in the hospital.moreover,according to plaintiffs,hospitals have become increasingly concerned with reviews,because recovery audit contractors have been carefully reviewing admissions,especially admissions.
based on these and other factual allegations,the complaint pleads nine causes of action against the secretary,including violations of the medicare act the administrative procedure act the freedom of information act and the due process clause the principal relief sought is a permanent injunction that would prohibit the secretary from allowing medicare beneficiaries to be placed on observation status and thus to deprive them of medicare part a coverage to which they are entitled direct the secretary to provide written notification,or to ensure that written notification is provided,to any medicare beneficiary who is placed on observation status of the nature of the action,of the consequences for medicare coverage,and of the right to administrative and judicial review of that action and direct the secretary to establish a procedure for administrative review of a decision to place a medicare beneficiary on observation status,including the right to expedited review.
on january,the secretary moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety,and on september,the district court granted the motion.on october,the district court entered final judgment for the secretary.
plaintiffs timely appealed the district court dismissal of claims six and seven of the complaint claim six asserts that the secretary failure to provide written notification to medicare beneficiaries,or to require that they receive written notification,of their placement on observation status,of the consequences of that placement for their medicare coverage,and of their right to challenge that placement,violates the medicare statute,and g,and the due process clause of the fifth amendment.claim seven asserts that the secretary policy of not providing medicare beneficiaries with the right to administrative review,including expedited review,of their placement on observation status violates the medicare statute,and g,and the due process clause of the fifth amendment.
therefore,considered together,the two claims appealed by plaintiffs allege that the secretary failure to provide an expedited system of notice and administrative review regarding the placement of medicare beneficiaries into observation status violated the medicare act and the due process clause.the sole question on appeal is whether the district court erred in dismissing these two claims.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,accepting as true all factual allegations in the complaint,and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor to survive a rule b motion to dismiss,the complaint must plead enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.
medicare act claims 
as to the district court dismissal of plaintiffs medicare act claims,we affirm substantially for the reasons articulated in the district court thorough opinion.first,plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the adequacy of the notices they received.second,nothing in the statute entitles plaintiffs to the process changes they seek,expedited notice of their placement into observation status,and an expedited hearing to challenge this placement.
as the district court explained,the medicare act only requires that beneficiaries receive written notice of the receipt of a claim for benefits,which must state whether the beneficiary is entitled to medicare coverage,and whether such coverage will be provided under part a or part this written notice is called a medicare summary notice msn,and it summarizes the patient medicare activity for the most recent period.if an msn states that benefits have been denied,then it must state the reasons for the denial the procedures for obtaining additional information concerning the denial and notification of the right to seek a redetermination or to otherwise appeal the determination the msn also informs beneficiaries of their right to challenge the determination that they received observation services covered under part b.it is undisputed that the secretary has complied with these and other requirements.
plaintiffs sole argument on the merits is that b f entitles a beneficiary who is placed on observation status to expedited notice or administrative review.this provision,however,only applies when a hospital seeks to terminate services or to discharge the individual from the provider of services.it is clear from both the statute and our precedent that a beneficiary who is in observation status has not yet been formally admitted to the hospital.he or she has therefore not experienced a termination of services or a discharge accordingly,b f does not entitle beneficiaries who are immediately or initially placed into observation status to any form of expedited process or administrative review 
because plaintiffs have failed to allege a plausible statutory violation,we affirm the district court dismissal of claims six and seven,to the extent that these claims assert violations of the medicare act.
due process claims 
claims six and seven also allege that the secretary violated plaintiffs rights under the federal due process clause by failing to provide,or to require hospitals to provide,written notification informing beneficiaries that they were placed on observation status and failing to provide medicare beneficiaries with the right to expedited administrative review of their placement on observation status.the district court dismissed these claims on the sole ground that plaintiffs did not possess a property interest in being admitted to their hospitals as inpatients.because this determination relied upon a factual finding that could not be made on a motion to dismiss,we vacate the district court dismissal of plaintiffs due process claims and remand for limited discovery.
legal standards 
the due process clause imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals of liberty or property interests within the meaning of the fifth amendment to state a due process claim,a plaintiff must show that state action deprived him or her of liberty or property without due process of law here,the district court solely focused on whether plaintiffs were deprived of a protected interest in property or liberty 
we have long held that procedural due process protections attach where state or federal law confers an entitlement to benefits.a mere unilateral expectation of receiving a benefit,however,is not enough a property interest arises only where one has a legitimate claim of entitlement to the benefit.in determining whether a given benefits regime creates a legitimate claim of entitlement to such benefits,we ask whether the statutes and regulations governing the distribution of benefits meaningfully channel official discretion by mandating a defined administrative outcome.if official discretion is so limited,then the beneficiaries of the governmental program may possess a property interest protected by the due process clause.
for example,in kapps,applicants for new york home energy assistance program heap claimed that the administrators of heap violated their procedural due process rights when they denied their applications for heap benefits without a hearing.we found that new york law set fixed and objective eligibility criteria for the receipt of heap benefits such as income,household size,and enrollment in other welfare programs and that anyone who met these eligibility criteria was entitled to receive heap benefits.because these criteria were precisely the type of substantive predicates that are the hallmarks of protected property rights,we held that plaintiffs possessed a valid property interest in the receipt of regular heap benefits.
here,the district court held that plaintiffs lacked a property interest in being admitted to a hospital as inpatients,because that decision whether to admit a patient is a complex medical judgment left to the doctor discretion.in so concluding,the district court relied primarily on the medicare policy manual,which states that 
the physician or other practitioner responsible for a patient care at the hospital is also responsible for deciding whether the patient should be admitted as an inpatient.physicians should use a hour period as a benchmark,they should order admission for patients who are expected to need hospital care for hours or more,and treat other patients on an outpatient basis.however,the decision to admit a patient is a complex medical judgment which can be made only after the physician has considered a number of factors,including the patient medical history and current medical needs,the types of facilities available to inpatients and to outpatients,the hospital and admissions policies,and the relative appropriateness of treatment in each setting 
the district court therefore accepted as true the secretary assertion that a hospital decision whether to admit a medicare beneficiary as an inpatient was left to the discretion and medical judgment of the treating physician.
however,plaintiffs complaint contains plausible allegations that,increasingly,admission decisions are not left to the discretion or judgment of treating physicians.specifically,the complaint alleges that the decision to admit a patient to a hospital is in practice made through rote
