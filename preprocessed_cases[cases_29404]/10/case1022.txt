tax injunction act comity doctrine 
the panel reversed the district court judgment in a class action brought by three starbucks baristas challenging starbucks practice of withholding state and federal taxes from barsitas paychecks based on the cash tips they receive,and remanded with instructions to remand to state court because all of the claims were jurisdictionally barred or foreclosed by the comity doctrine.
the panel held that under the tax injunction act and the act,the district court lacked subject jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claims for declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to starbucks withholding of state and federal taxes.the panel also held that the doctrine barred the district court from awarding statutory damages on the component of plaintiffs claims,from which the component could not be severed.
watford,circuit judge 
this is a class action brought against starbucks by three baristas who used to work at the company coffee shops in oregon.they challenge the legality of starbucks practice of withholding state and federal taxes from baristas paychecks based on the cash tips they receive.we must decide whether the district court may hear this case given the constraints imposed by the tax injunction act,the act,and the comity doctrine.
a familiar sight at any neighborhood starbucks is the tip jar near the cash register inviting customers to leave tips for the baristas.according to the plaintiffs and what follows is drawn entirely from their complaint,the baristas pool the tips left by customers and divide them up at the end of each week.as a general practice,the baristas do not report to starbucks how much they receive in tips.instead,for tax withholding purposes,the company simply imputes cents per hour in estimated tip income to each barista and withholds state and federal taxes from the baristas paychecks based on that amount.
the plaintiffs allege that neither state nor federal tax law allows starbucks to withhold taxes in this fashion.they contend that federal law permits employers to withhold federal taxes based on estimated tip income only in certain circumstances not met here,and that oregon law does not treat the baristas tips as wages subject to withholding of state taxes at all.
the plaintiffs filed a class action against starbucks in oregon state court on behalf of all current and former baristas employed at the company coffee shops in oregon.their complaint asserts five causes of action,each predicated on the alleged violation of an oregon statute.see or.stat.each claim alleges that starbucks violated state laws by deducting taxes from the baristas paychecks in a manner not authorized by state or federal law,thereby failing to pay the baristas their full wages when due.
the plaintiffs do not seek actual damages they have been able to recover any taxes wrongfully withheld by filing their annual tax returns and obtaining refunds for any that occurred.they instead seek statutory damages,which differ depending on the statute invoked.as to some of the claims,oregon law allows an employee who was not paid her full wages when due to recover up to days of wages as a penalty.or.stat.the plaintiffs seek days of wages per barista for each of those claims.as to the remaining claim,oregon law authorizes an employee to recover a statutory penalty for any wrongful deduction from wages.the plaintiffs seek a penalty of per paycheck for each barista,on their view that the wrongful deduction provision applies to each paycheck and allows for only one violation based on the total amount wrongfully deducted.
the complaint also requests declaratory and injunctive relief barring starbucks from continuing to withhold state and federal taxes based on the imputed cents per hour in tip income.because nothing ultimately turns on it,we need not decide whether the three named plaintiffs,who are no longer employed by starbucks,have article iii standing to seek prospective relief.
starbucks removed the case to federal court,and the plaintiffs now concede that the class action fairness act provides a basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction.see d.shortly after removing the case,starbucks moved to dismiss the complaint with prejudice on the ground that all of the plaintiffs claims are either preempted by federal tax law or barred under oregon law.the plaintiffs opposed starbucks motion and filed their own motion requesting that the case be remanded to state court.the district court denied the plaintiffs motion,granted starbucks motion,and entered judgment dismissing the case with prejudice.
before we can address the merits of the district court ruling,we must decide whether the district court had the authority to hear this case.that requires us to unpack the plaintiffs claims,both in terms of the relief they seek and the theories of liability they assert.the plaintiffs seek two distinct forms of relief declaratory and injunctive relief on the one hand,and statutory damages on the other.and their claims under oregon statutes are predicated on alleged violations of both state and federal tax law they contend that oregon law does not authorize starbucks to withhold the state taxes at issue,and that federal law does not authorize starbucks to withhold the federal taxes at issue.
we explain first why the district court lacks the authority to grant declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to either the component or the component of the plaintiffs claims.we then explain why the district court is also foreclosed from awarding statutory damages,which requires that the entire case be remanded to state court.
we begin with the plaintiffs request for declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to starbucks withholding of state taxes.congress has sharply curtailed the authority of federal courts to issue declaratory or injunctive relief that impedes the administration of state tax laws.the tax injunction act provides the district courts shall not enjoin,suspend or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of any tax under state law where a plain,speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state.no one disputes that a plain,speedy,and efficient remedy is available to the plaintiffs in oregon courts,and it is well settled that the tax injunction act bars the entry of declaratory judgments to the same extent that it bars the issuance of injunctions.see california grace brethren church.thus,the only question is whether the declaratory and injunctive relief the plaintiffs seek would enjoin,suspend or restrain that is,stop the collection of state taxes within the meaning of the act.direct marketing association brohl.
we think the plaintiffs requested relief would do just that.the plaintiffs want the district court to declare that starbucks withholding of state taxes on the basis of imputed tip income is illegal under oregon law and to enjoin starbucks from continuing to engage in that practice.the supreme court has held that an employer withholding of tax payments from wages constitutes a method of tax collection,and that an order enjoining employer withholding therefore stops collection of the tax.united states american friends service committee,per curiam.american friends involved the act,a,which bars actions seeking to restrain the collection of federal taxes,but the court construes the two acts in tandem.see direct marketing,at.the third circuit has squarely held that the tax injunction act bars actions,like this one,seeking to enjoin an employer withholding of state taxes from wages.sipe amerada hess,cir.and the fourth circuit has held that withholding state taxes from lottery winnings is part of a state collection of taxes and therefore may not be enjoined under the act.international lotto fund virginia state lottery department,cir.we agree with the third and fourth circuits and hold that the tax injunction act bars the district court from enjoining starbucks withholding of state taxes from the baristas paychecks 
our holding is consistent with the supreme court decision in hibbs winn,which explained that the tax injunction act serves objectives and accordingly applies only if the requested relief would reduce the fl
