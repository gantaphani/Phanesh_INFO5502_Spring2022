class certification 
the panel affirmed the district court class certification in putative class actions brought against conagra foods in eleven states by consumers who purchased cooking oil products labeled natural during the relevant period.
plaintiffs argued that the natural label was false or misleading because wesson oils are made from bioengineered ingredients that plaintiffs contend are not natural.conagra manufactures,markets,distributes,and sells wesson products.defendant urged reversal of the district court class certification because the district court did not require robert briseno and the other named class representatives to proffer an administratively feasible way to identify members of the certified classes.
the panel held that the language of federal rule of civil procedure neither provides nor implies that demonstrating an administratively feasible way to identify class members is a prerequisite to class certification.the panel therefore joined the sixth,seventh,and eighth circuits in declining to adopt an administrative feasibility requirement.
friedland,circuit judge 
this appeal requires us to decide whether,to obtain class certification under federal rule of civil procedure,class representatives must demonstrate that there is an administratively feasible means of identifying absent class members.conagra foods,conagra urges us to reverse class certification because the district court did not require robert briseno and the other named class representatives collectively,plaintiffs to proffer a reliable way to identify members of the certified classes here consumers in eleven states who purchased cooking oils labeled natural during the relevant period 
we have never interpreted rule to require such a showing,and,like the sixth,seventh,and eighth circuits,we decline to do so now.see sandusky wellness,llc,medtox,cir.rikos procter gamble,cir.mullins direct digital,llc,cir,cert.denied.a separate administrative feasibility prerequisite to class certification is not compatible with the language of rule.further,rule enumerated criteria already address the policy concerns that have motivated some courts to adopt a separate administrative feasibility requirement,and do so without undermining the balance of interests struck by the supreme court,congress,and the other contributors to the rule.we therefore affirm.
plaintiffs are consumers who purchased cooking oil products labeled natural.the natural label appeared on every bottle of oil throughout the putative class periods and continues to appear on those products.plaintiffs argue that the natural label is false or misleading because wesson oils are made from bioengineered ingredients genetically modified organisms,or gmos that plaintiffs contend are not natural.conagra manufactures,markets,distributes,and sells wesson products.
plaintiffs filed putative class actions asserting claims against conagra in eleven states,and those cases were consolidated in this action.plaintiffs moved to certify eleven classes defined as follows 
all persons who reside in the states of california,colorado,florida,illinois,indiana,nebraska,new york,ohio,oregon,south dakota,or texas who have purchased wesson oils within the applicable statute of limitations periods established by the laws of their state of residence the class period through the final disposition of this and any and all related actions.
as relevant here,conagra opposed class certification on the ground that there would be no administratively feasible way to identify members of the proposed classes because consumers would not be able to reliably identify themselves as class members.as a result,conagra argued that the class was not eligible for certification 
the district court acknowledged that the third circuit and some district courts have refused certification in similar circumstances,but it declined to join in their reasoning.instead,the district court held that,at the certification stage,it was sufficient that the class was defined by an objective criterion whether class members purchased wesson oil during the class period.
the district court ultimately granted plaintiffs motion in part and certified eleven statewide classes to pursue certain claims for damages under federal rule of civil procedure b.conagra timely sought and obtained permission to appeal pursuant to rule f.
federal rule of civil procedure governs the maintenance of class actions in federal court.parties seeking class certification must satisfy each of the four requirements of rule a numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy and at least one of the requirements of rule b.ellis costco wholesale,cir.
conagra argues that,in addition to satisfying these enumerated criteria,class proponents must also demonstrate that there is an administratively feasible way to determine who is in the class conagra claims that plaintiffs did not propose any way to identify class members and can not prove that an administratively feasible method exists because consumers do not generally save grocery receipts and are unlikely to remember details about individual purchases of a product like cooking oil.we have not previously interpreted rule to require such a demonstration,and,for the reasons that follow,we do not do so now.
we employ the traditional tools of statutory construction to interpret the federal rules of civil procedure.republic of ecuador mackay,cir.quoting united states petri,cir.in construing what rule requires,our first step is thus determin ing whether the language at issue has a plain meaning.id.quoting mcdonald sun oil,cir.see also beech aircraft rainey,noting that interpretation of the federal rules begin s with the language of the rule itself.when interpreting the rule,words and phrases must not be read in isolation,but with an eye toward the purpose and context of the statute.petri,at quoting dolan postal.an interpretation that gives effect to every clause is generally preferable to one that does not.mackay,at.
beginning then with the plain language,rule a is titled prerequisites and provides 
one or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all members only if 
the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable 
there are questions of law or fact common to the class 
the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class and 
the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.
fed.civ.a.this provision identifies the prerequisites to maintaining a class action in federal court.it does not mention administrative feasibility.
traditional canons of statutory construction suggest that this omission was meaningful.because the drafters specifically enumerated p rerequisites,we may conclude that rule a constitutes an exhaustive list.see silvers sony pictures entm t,cir.explaining that,under the doctrine of expressio unius est exclusio alterius,the enumeration of certain criteria to the exclusion of others should be interpreted as an intentional omission.we also take guidance from language used in other provisions of the rule.in contrast to rule a,rule b provides,the matters pertinent to these findings include,followed by four listed considerations.fed.civ.b emphasis added.if the rules advisory committee had intended to create a list in rule a,it would have used similar language.see russello united states,w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.alteration in original quoting united states wong kim bo,cir.per curiam.moreover,rule b requires a court certifying a class under that section to consider the likely difficulties in managing a class action.fed.civ.b d.imposing a separate administrative feasibility requirement would render that manageability criterion largely superfluous,a result that contravenes the familiar precept that a rule should be interpreted to give effect to every clause.mackay,at.
supreme court precedent also counsels in favor of hewing closely to the text of rule.in amchem products,windsor,the court considered whether a class could be certified without satisfying the requirements of rule.in holding that it could not the court underscored that the federal rules of civil procedure result from an extensive deliberative process involving a rules advisory committee,public commenters,the judicial conference,the supreme court,and congress.id.at.the court warned that t he text of a rule thus proposed and reviewed limits judicial inventiveness and admonished that c ourts are not free to amend a rule outside the process congress ordered.id.the lesson of amchem products is plain federal courts lack authority to substitute for rule certification criteria a standard never adopted.id.at.
in sum,the language of rule does not impose a freestanding administrative feasibility prerequisite to class certification.mindful of the supreme court guidance,we decline to interpose an additional hurdle into the class certification process delineated in the enacted rule.see sandusky wellness,llc,medtox,cir.declining to recognize a separate,preliminary requirement and,instead,adher ing to a rigorous analysis of the rule requirements.
we recognize that the third circuit does require putative class representatives to demonstrate administrative feasibility as a prerequisite to class certification see byrd aaron,cir.carrera bayer,cir.the third circuit justifies its administrative feasibility requirement not through the text of rule but rather as a necessary tool to ensure that the class will actually function as a class.byrd,at.the third circuit suggests that its administrative feasibility prerequisite achieves this goal by mitigating administrative burdens safeguarding the interests of absent and bona fide class members and protecting the due process rights of defendants.see carrera,at.the seventh circuit soundly rejected those justifications in mullins direct digital,llc,cir,and the sixth circuit followed suit,see rikos procter gamble,cir.citing mullins in declining to follow carrera.we likewise conclude that rule enumerated criteria already address the interests that motivated the third circuit and,therefore,that an independent administrative feasibility requirement is unnecessary.
one rationale the third circuit has given for imposing an administrative feasibility requirement is the need to mitigate the administrative burdens of trying a rule b class action.courts adjudicating such actions must provide notice that a class has been certified and an opportunity for absent class members to withdraw from the class.see stores,dukes,accord fed.civ.c b.the third circuit largely justifies its administrative feasibility prerequisite as necessary to ensure that compliance with this procedural requirement does not compromise the efficiencies rule b was designed to achieve see shelton bledsoe,cir.carrera,at.
but rule b already contains a specific,enumerated mechanism to achieve that goal the manageability criterion of the superiority requirement.rule b requires that a class action be superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy,and it specifically mandates that courts consider the likely difficulties in managing a class action.fed.civ.b d.
moreover,as the seventh circuit has observed,requiring class proponents to satisfy an administrative feasibility prerequisite conflicts with the presumption that courts should not refuse to certify a class merely on the basis of manageability concerns.mullins,at see also in re visa antitrust,cir.sotomayor,holding that refusal to certify a class on the sole ground that it would be unmanageable is disfavored and should be the exception rather than the rule quoting in re cent.states bakery prods.antitrust,overruled on other grounds by in re ipo sec,cir,and superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in attenborough constr.laborers local.this presumption makes ample sense given the variety of procedural tools courts can use to manage the administrative burdens of class litigation.for example,rule c enables district courts to divide classes into subclasses or certify a class as to only particular issues.fed.civ.c,see also in re visa,at listing management tools available to district courts.
adopting a freestanding administrative feasibility requirement instead of assessing manageability as one component of the superiority inquiry would also have practical consequences inconsistent with the policies embodied in rule.rule b calls for a comparative assessment of the costs and benefits of class adjudication,including the availability of other methods for resolving the controversy.by contrast,as the seventh circuit has emphasized,a standalone administrative feasibility requirement would invite courts to consider the administrative burdens of class litigation in a vacuum.see mullins,at.that difference in approach would often be outcome determinative for cases like this one,in which administrative feasibility would be difficult to demonstrate but in which there may be no realistic alternative to class treatment.see id.at.class actions involving inexpensive consumer goods in particular would likely fail at the outset if administrative feasibility were a freestanding prerequisite to certification.
the authors of rule opted not to make the potential administrative burdens of a class action dispositive and instead directed courts to balance the benefits of class adjudication against its costs.we lack authority to substitute our judgment for theirs.see amchem,at t he rule as now composed sets the requirements courts are bound to enforce.
the third circuit has also justified its administrative feasibility requirement as necessary to protect absent class members and to shield bona fide claimants from fraudulent claims.
with respect to absent class members,the third circuit has expressed concern about whether courts would be able to ensure individual notice without a method for reliably identifying class members.see byrd,at carrera,at.we believe that concern is unfounded,because neither rule nor the due process clause requires actual notice to each individual class member.
rule requires only the best notice that is practicable under the circumstances,including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.fed.civ.c b emphasis added.in other words,t he rule does not insist on actual notice to all class members in all cases and recognizes it might be impossible to identify some class members for purposes of actual notice.mullins,at.and courts have long employed cy pres remedies when some or even all potential claimants can not be identified.see six mexican workers.citrus growers,cir.in a majority of class actions at least some unclaimed damages or unlocated class members remain.the existence of a large unclaimed damage fund,while relevant to the manageability determination,does not necessarily make a class action unmanageable.citation omitted.the notion that an inability to identify all class members precludes class certification can not be reconciled with our court longstanding cy pres jurisprudence.see id.
likewise,the due process clause does not require actual,individual notice in all cases.see silber mabon,cir.see also mullins,at explaining that when individual notice by mail is not possible,courts may use alternative means such as notice through third parties,paid advertising,posting in places frequented by class members,all without offending due process.courts have routinely held that notice by publication in a periodical,on a website,or even at an appropriate physical location is sufficient to satisfy due process.see,hughes kore of,cir.holding that sticker notices on two allegedly offending atms,as well as publication in the state principal newspaper and on a website,provided adequate notice to class members in an action challenging atm fees juris inamed,cir.holding that notice to unidentified class members by periodical and website satisfied due process.
moreover,the concern presumes that some harm will inure to absent class members who do not receive actual notice.in theory,inadequate notice might deny an absent class member the opportunity to opt out and pursue individual litigation.but in reality that risk is virtually nonexistent in the very cases in which satisfying an administrative feasibility requirement would prove most difficult consumer class actions.such cases typically involve products and,as a result,recoveries too small to incentivize individual litigation.at the same time,an administrative feasibility requirement like that imposed by the third circuit would likely bar such actions because consumers generally do not keep receipts or other records of purchases.practically speaking,a separate administrative feasibility requirement would protect a purely theoretical interest of absent class members at the expense of any possible recovery for all class members in precisely those cases that depend most on the class mechanism.justifying an administrative feasibility requirement as a means of ensuring perfect recovery at the expense of any recovery would undermine the very purpose of rule b vindication of the rights of groups of people who individually would be without effective strength to bring their opponents into court at all.amchem,at quoting benjamin kaplan,a prefatory note,indus.com.
the third circuit has also expressed concern that without an administrative feasibility requirement,individuals will submit illegitimate claims and thereby dilute the recovery of legitimate claimants.see carrera,at.
the fraud concern may be valid in theory,but in practice,the risk of dilution based on fraudulent or mistaken claims seems low,perhaps to the point of being negligible.mullins,at.this is especially true in class actions involving consumer goods.why would a consumer risk perjury charges and spend the time and effort to submit a false claim for a de minimis monetary recovery and even if consumers might do so,courts can rely,as they have for decades,on claim administrators,various auditing processes,sampling for fraud detection,notices to explain the claims process,and other techniques tailored by the parties and the court to avoid or minimize fraudulent claims.id.
as to the dilution concern specifically,consistently low participation rates in consumer class actions make it very unlikely that claimants would diminish the recovery of participating,bona fide class members see id.it is not unusual for only or of the class members to bother filing claims.christopher leslie,the significance of silence collective action problems and class action settlements.moreover,if certification is denied to prevent dilution,deserving class members will receive nothing,for they would not have brought suit individually in the first place.mullins,at.as the seventh circuit put it,w hen it comes to protecting the interests of absent class members,courts should not let the perfect become the enemy of the good.id.at.
finally,the third circuit has characterized its administrative feasibility requirement as necessary to protect the due process rights of defendants to raise individual challenges and defenses to claims.carrera,at.the gravamen of this due process concern seems to be that defendants must have an opportunity to dispute whether class members really bought the product or used the service at issue see id.stating that a defendant has a due process right to challenge the proof used to demonstrate class membership marcus bmw of,llc,cir.forcing defendants to accept as true absent persons declarations that they are members of the class,without further indicia of reliability,would have serious due process implications.
as an initial matter,defendants plainly can mount such challenges as to the named class representatives.class representatives must establish standing by,for example,showing that they bought the product or used the service at issue.see mazza am.honda motor,cir.holding that class representatives who allegedly paid more for or purchased a product due to a defendant deceptive conduct have suffered an injury in fact that establishes article iii standing bates united parcel,cir.stating that t he plaintiff class bears the burden of showing that at least one named plaintiff meets the article iii standing requirements.at the class certification stage,the class representatives bear the burden of demonstrating compliance with rule.see stores,at a party seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with the rule.and if the case proceeds past the certification stage,the plaintiff class must carry the burden of proving every element of its claims to prevail on the merits.see id.at observing that,in a securities fraud class action,plaintiffs seeking b certification must prove that their shares were traded on an efficient market,an issue that they will surely have to prove again at trial in order to make out their case on the merits citation omitted id.at t he rules enabling act forbids interpreting rule to abridge,enlarge or modify any substantive right.quoting b shady grove orthopedic,allstate ins,a class action.leaves the parties legal rights and duties intact and the rules of decision unchanged.defendants can oppose the class representatives showings at every stage.indeed,in litigating class certification,conagra took discovery of the class representatives,challenged whether they bought wesson oil products,attacked their credibility,and disputed whether they relied on the label at issue.as the case proceeds,conagra will have further opportunities to contest every aspect of plaintiffs case.
defendants will have similar opportunities to individually challenge the claims of absent class members if and when they file claims for damages.at the claims administration stage,parties have long relied on claim administrators,various auditing processes,sampling for fraud detection,notices to explain the claims process,and other techniques tailored by the parties and the court to validate claims.mullins,at.rule specifically contemplates the need for such individualized claim determinations after a finding of liability.see fed.civ.advisory committee note to amendment explaining that certification may be proper despite the need,if liability is found,for separate determinations of the damages suffered by individuals within the class see also levya medline indus,cir.reaffirming,after comcast behrend,that the need for individualized damages determinations after liability has been adjudicated does not preclude class certification.conagra does not explain why such procedures are insufficient to safeguard its due process rights 
given these existing opportunities to challenge plaintiffs case,it is not clear why requiring an administratively feasible way to identify all class members at the certification stage is necessary to protect conagra due process rights.as the seventh circuit put it,t he due process question is not whether the identity of class members can be ascertained with perfect accuracy at the certification stage but whether the defendant will receive a fair opportunity to present its defenses when putative class members actually come forward.mullins,at.conagra may prefer to terminate this litigation in one fell swoop at class certification rather than later challenging each individual class member claim to recovery,but there is no due process right to a procedure for challenging every individual claim to class membership.id.at.
if the concern is that claimants in cases like this will eventually offer only a affidavit as proof of class membership,it is again unclear why that issue must be resolved at the class certification stage to protect a defendant due process rights.if a wesson oil consumer were to pursue an individual lawsuit instead of a class action,an affidavit describing her purchases would create a genuine issue if conagra disputed the affidavit,and would prevent summary judgment against the consumer.see mullins,at accord fed.civ.c a.given that a consumer affidavit could force a liability determination at trial without offending the due process clause,we see no reason to refuse class certification simply because that same consumer will present her affidavit in a claims administration process after a liabilit
