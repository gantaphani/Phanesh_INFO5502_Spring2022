for the second time in this case,we are asked to resolve questions regarding conflicts of interest and the adequacy of counsel in class actions.appellants and appellees are two teams of named plaintiffs and their respective lawyers who disagree over the proper direction for a consumer class action settlement.in radcliffe experian information solutions,cir radcliffe i,we held that appellees created a conflict of interest by conditioning incentive awards for the class representatives on their approval of the proposed settlement agreement.on remand,appellants moved the district court to disqualify appellees counsel from representing the class based on that conflict.they contended that under california law,attorneys with simultaneous conflicts of interest in a case must be automatically disqualified.the district court rejected this argument and denied the motion.
we agree with the district court that california does not apply a rule of automatic disqualification for conflicts of simultaneous representation in the class action context,and conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that appellees counsel will adequately represent the class.we affirm.
we previously described the underlying facts in our earlier opinion in this case.radcliffe i,at.the case is a consolidation of multiple class actions initiated in and alleging that the defendants in the case,experian information systems,transunion llc,and equifax information services llc defendants,violated the fair credit reporting act frca and corresponding california state law by misreporting debts discharged in bankruptcy on consumer credit reports.id.at.appellants are a group of plaintiffs who became lead plaintiffs in one case known as the white lawsuit maria falcon,chester carter,arnold lovell,clifton seale,iii,and robert radcliffe white plaintiffs.they are represented by charles juntikka,daniel wolf,and the law firm of boies,schiller,and flexner.white counsel.appellees are a group of plaintiffs from a different case,the hernandez lawsuit jose hernandez,kathryn pike,robert randall,and bertram robison hernandez plaintiffs.they are represented by the firms of lieff,cabraser,heimann,bernstein lieff cabraser caddell chapman and francis mailman hernandez counsel after the cases were consolidated,the district court appointed hernandez counsel as lead counsel.
following mediation,the parties reached a settlement agreement for injunctive relief,which was approved in august and was not disputed by any party.radcliffe i,at.in february of,the parties then reached a monetary settlement for a total amount of million.id.the settlement included incentive awards for each named plaintiff not to exceed,which were awardable to any named plaintiff serving as class representatives who was in support of the settlement.id.the agreement was preliminarily approved in may.id.
the district court held a series of fairness hearings on the monetary settlement.white plaintiffs and white counsel objected to it,in part due to the discrepancy between the settlement and the potential recoverable damages.see id.at.they also argued that conditioning the incentive awards on named plaintiffs agreement with the settlement created a conflict of interest between the class representatives and the absent class.id.at.
in radcliffe i,we agreed with white plaintiffs that the conditional incentive award created a conflict of interest.we noted that incentive awards for serving as class representatives are often appropriate,but cautioned that they should be scrutinized carefully,because if such members of the class are provided with special incentives in the settlement agreement,they may be more concerned with maximizing those incentives than with judging the adequacy of the settlement as it applies to the class members at large.radcliffe i,at quoting staton boeing,cir.we then held that,in this case,conditioning the incentive awards for the named plaintiffs on their support of the settlement changed the motivations for the class representatives.id.at.instead of being solely concerned about the adequacy of the settlement for the absent class members,the class representatives now had a incentive to support the settlement regardless of its fairness and a promise of no reward if they opposed the settlement.id.moreover,a s soon as the awards provision divorced the interests of the class representatives from those of the absent class members,class counsel was simultaneously representing clients with conflicting interests.id.at.
accordingly,we reversed the settlement as well as awards of attorneys fees and costs.id.at.on remand,we instructed the district court to determine when the conflict arose and if the conflict continues under any future settlement agreement.should the district court approve such an agreement,it may then exercise its discretion in deciding whether,and to what extent,class counsel are entitled to fees under the doctrine.id.
on remand,white counsel filed a motion to disqualify hernandez counsel and to serve as interim class counsel on june.they argued that disqualification was mandatory under california law because any counsel simultaneous conflict of interest in its representation of multiple clients must result in automatic disqualification.hernandez counsel opposed the motion and filed a to be as interim class counsel.on may,the district court denied white counsel motion and granted hernandez counsel motion.this appeal by white counsel followed.
in its may order,the district court opined that its order denying the motion to disqualify hernandez counsel involved controlling questions of law about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and an immediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate termination of this litigation,pursuant to b.we then granted permission to appeal the district court order on july,and therefore have jurisdiction over the case.
this court reviews motions for disqualification of an attorney for abuse of discretion.paul iacono structural eng r,humphrey,cir.since the district court has primary responsibility for controlling the conduct of attorneys practicing before it,an order disqualifying counsel will not be disturbed if the record reveals any sound basis for the court action,and reversal is warranted only if the district court either misperceives the relevant rule of law or abuses its discretion.id.citation omitted.
in this appeal,as they did in the district court,white counsel contend that under california law,any conflict of interest in the representation of a class mandates automatic disqualification.generally,california requires per se disqualification when an attorney has been shown to possess a simultaneous conflict of interest in her representation of multiple clients,regardless of that attorney motives or the actual impact of the conflict.the central question is whether this remains true in class actions.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that california law does not require automatic disqualification in class action cases,and affirm.
the main question to be resolved in this appeal results from three other points.first,california law governs questions of conflicts of interest and disqualification.as we noted in radcliffe i,the ninth circuit refers to the local rules of each district when deciding which standards govern an ethical violation,and the central district of california local rules instruct courts to look to california law and california rules of professional conduct.radcliffe i,at.
second,the parties agree on the existence of a rule in california case law that a concurrent or simultaneous conflict of interest under california rule of professional conduct c generally leads to automatic disqualification.in flatt superior court,cal th,d,the california supreme court distinguished between two different types of conflicts of interest that may arise.where the potential conflict is one that arises from the successive representation of clients with potentially adverse interests,the courts have recognized that the chief fiduciary value jeopardized is that of client confidentiality.flatt,cal th at,d.thus,where a former client seeks to have a previous attorney disqualified from serving as counsel to a successive client in litigation adverse to the interests of the first client,the governing test requires that the client demonstrate a substantial relationship between the subjects of the antecedent and current representations.id.
both the interest implicated and the governing test are different,however,where an attorney potentially conflicting representations are simultaneous.id.at,d.such situations,with perhaps the classic case involving an attorney interests in conflict with those of the client,do not primarily implicate the duty of confidentiality but rather the attorney duty and the client legitimate expectation of loyalty.id.at,d.and because the substantial relationship test is founded on the need to protect against the improper use of client secrets,that test does not set a sufficiently high standard.id.citation omitted.
instead,flatt held that the appropriate response to a simultaneous conflict of interest is generally automatic disqualification i n all but a few instances,the rule of disqualification in simultaneous representation is a per se or automatic one.the california supreme court has continued to adhere to this formulation.see people ex rel.dep t of corps.speedee oil change,cal th,d,i f an attorney or more likely a law firm simultaneously represents clients who have conflicting interests,a more stringent per se rule of disqualification applies.citing to flatt,cal th at,d,in re charlisse,cal th,d,w ith few exceptions,disqualification in a case of simultaneous representation follows automatically,regardless of whether the simultaneous representations have anything in common or present any risk that confidences obtained in one matter would be used in the other.quoting speedee,cal th at,d.
third and finally,the parties in this case agree as they must,based on our holding in radcliffe i that the conditional incentive award created a simultaneous conflict of interest for hernandez counsel between the named plaintiffs they represent and the rest of the class.thus,the operative question,as noted above,is whether the automatic disqualification rule described in flatt and its progeny required the district court to grant white counsel motion to disqualify hernandez counsel.
hernandez counsel argued below that the automatic disqualification rule should not apply in class action cases.the district court agreed,concluding that there are compelling reasons to interpret california disqualification rule flexibly in light of california case law,for two reasons.first and foremost,this conflict was brief and caused by a specific provision in a settlement.t he class representatives did not have inherently opposing interests from absent class plaintiffs,but rather the conflict was manufactured by the faulty settlement terms.second,the district court held that even if california case law on conflicts in class actions does not wholly abandon the automatic disqualification rule,the analysis shows a willingness to use the disqualification rule flexibly.
white counsel now offer several arguments as to why the district court decision was an abuse of discretion.their primary contention is that the district court erred in holding that the automatic disqualification rule does not apply to class actions.
because we apply state law in determining matters of disqualification,we must follow the reasoned view of the state supreme court when it has spoken on the issue.in re cty.of los angeles,cir citation omitted.if the state supreme court has not spoken on the issue,we look to intermediate appellate courts for guidance,although we are not bound by them if we believe that the state supreme court would decide otherwise.in re kf diaries,affiliates,cir.
though california regularly applies flatt automatic disqualification rule to lawsuits involving individual clients,neither the parties nor the district court have found any case in the california supreme court,or in any of the california courts of appeal,that apply the rule to class actions.we,too,have been unable to find any such case.
on the other hand,there is also no case that explicitly rejects the application of the automatic disqualification rule to class actions.as the district court notes,however,two intermediate appellate courts have directly adjudicated questions of counsel disqualification in a class action due to a simultaneous conflict of interest without mentioning the automatic disqualification rule.
in cal pak delivery,united states parcel service,th,d,the appellate court affirmed the disqualification of a class counsel who had contacted the defendant and offered to dismiss the claim in exchange for a payment of eight to ten million dollars directly to counsel.rather than apply an automatic disqualification rule,the trial court had used the balancing of interests test that california courts generally otherwise use for disqualification motions.id.at,d.similarly,the appellate court affirmed by focusing exclusively on whether the trial court erred in its application of the balancing of interests test.id.
in apple computer,superior court,th,d,the appellate court reversed the denial of a motion to disqualify counsel for attempting to both represent the class and serve as its named representative.that case,much like this one,involved the concern that class counsel might seek to obtain a settlement that would benefit themselves but not the rest of the class.id.at,d.on the strength of that concern,the appellate court concluded that counsel had placed themselves in a position of divided loyalties,and that doing so was grounds for disqualification.id.emphasis omitted.as in cal pak,the apple computer court made no mention of the automatic disqualification rule 
lacking any case authority that is directly on point,white counsel fall back on the hortatory language of automatic disqualification cases such as flatt and speedee.in essence,appellants position is that because those decisions describe the automatic disqualification rule in per se terms,and make no mention of excluding class actions,the rule must therefore apply to class actions.
this position is not implausible,but neither is it persuasive.for one thing,cal pak and apple computer suggest that california courts have not assumed that the automatic disqualification rule applies in class action cases.white counsel argue that these two cases involve conflicts of interest created by ethical breaches committed by the attorneys rather than simultaneous representation of clients,and that this explains why the automatic disqualification rule was never discussed.but the california supreme court in flatt defined the classic case of a simultaneous conflict of interest as involving an attorney interests in conflict with those of the client,flatt,cal th at,d,a description that could certainly be applied to the situations in both of these cases.in the absence of california supreme court precedent on the issue,we look to the intermediate state courts for guidance,and cal pak and apple computer both indicate that automatic disqualification is not required in class actions.
moreover,the policy justifications that the california supreme court advanced for the automatic disqualification rule are not fully transferrable to class action cases.indeed,the language of their opinions makes clear that they envisioned simultaneous conflicts of interest as they generally occurred in individual litigant suits rather than in class actions.in flatt,the california supreme court explained the reasoning behind the automatic disqualification rule as follows 
the reason for such a rule is evident,even or perhaps especially to the nonattorney.a client who learns that his or her lawyer is also representing a litigation adversary,even with respect to a matter wholly unrelated to the one for which counsel was retained,can not long be expected to sustain the level of confidence and trust in counsel that is one of the foundations of the professional relationship.
flatt,cal th at,d,emphasis in original.similarly,the court in speedee stated that t he most egregious conflict of interest is representation of clients whos
