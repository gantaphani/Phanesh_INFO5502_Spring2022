putative class plaintiffs alexander menkes and stephen wolfe appeal the district court dismissal of their complaint for failure to state a claim.this appeal requires us to determine whether certain supplemental insurance coverage is governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.we conclude that in the circumstances presented here,it is,and that it can not be unbundled from the plaintiffs broader erisa benefits plan.we then must decide whether erisa preempts the various state law claims that the plaintiffs asserted.concluding that it does,we will affirm the district court dismissal.
we take the following facts from the plaintiffs complaint,documents to which it referred and upon which it relied,and the plaintiffs proposed amended complaint,which we must accept as true for the purposes of a motion to dismiss.fowler upmc shadyside,cir.the plaintiffs were employed by defense contractor defendant to work on a military base in kirkuk,iraq in.as employees,the plaintiffs were automatically enrolled in qinetiq basic long term disability,basic life,and accidental death and dismemberment insurance policies the basic policies.it is undisputed that qinetiq offered this insurance coverage pursuant to erisa.these policies were established pursuant to a single group contract with the prudential insurance company of north america,and qinetiq paid the premiums for each of these policies on behalf of its employees.
both plaintiffs also purchased supplemental insurance coverage to augment their basic benefits.both purchased what the plaintiffs term supplemental long term disability buy up ltd coverage,and menkes purchased supplemental accidental death dismemberment supplemental ad d coverage collectively,the supplemental coverage the plaintiffs paid additional premiums out of their own funds for this supplemental coverage in return for enhanced benefits should they sustain a covered injury.
the supplemental coverage operated pursuant to the exact same benefit terms,rules,exclusions,and claim procedures as the basic policies.these terms,rules,exclusions,and claim procedures for the basic policies and supplemental coverage were outlined in a single insurance booklet certificate booklet and a single summary plan description spd for each type of insurance.that is,the terms,rules,exclusions,and claim procedures for qinetiq long term disability policy,for example,were contained in a single booklet and spd there were not separate booklets and spds for the basic policy and supplemental coverage.each spd explicitly stated that the insurance coverage was being provided under your employer erisa plan s.appendix app.each booklet stated that the plaintiffs coverage was governed by a single group contract between qinetiq and prudential,and that qinetiq was the plan sponsor and administrator.app.had qinetiq chosen not to provide or to terminate the basic policies,its employees would not have been able to purchase or continue the supplemental coverage.an employee seeking benefits under a given policy would file a single claim,not separate claims for basic policy benefits and supplemental coverage benefits.
as is relevant to this appeal,each booklet informed the plaintiffs of the policies respective war exclusion policies.the long term disability booklet provided that y our plan does not cover a disability due to war,declared or undeclared,or any act of war.app.the accidental death and dismemberment booklet provided that loss is not covered if it results from w ar,or any act of war.war means declared or undeclared war and includes resistance to armed aggression.app.these war exclusion clauses applied to both the basic policies and the supplemental coverage because,again,each type of coverage was governed by a single set of documents with a single set of rules and exclusions.
the plaintiffs were not otherwise uninsured for injuries they incurred on account of war or acts of war.as part of its government contract,qinetiq also obtained insurance for its employees as required by the defense base act dba.dba insurance provides coverage for injuries sustained by contract employees while serving at military bases abroad.qinetiq obtained this coverage not from prudential,but from the insurance company of the state of pennsylvania icsp.
menkes filed a claim under his long term disability policy for three injuries he received while in iraq a back injury,a positive tuberculosis tb test,and stress disorder ptsd.prudential denied his claim for all three injuries.it used the war exclusion provision to deny benefits only for his ptsd injury.it declined to compensate him for his back injury because it determined that his injury did not sufficiently impair his ability to pursue his regular occupation.it declined to compensate him for his claimed tb because he subsequently had a negative tb test and showed no signs of being affected by any tb symptoms.menkes filed only a single claim for benefits owed to him under his long term disability policy he does not allege that he filed one claim for benefits under the basic policy and another for benefits under the supplemental coverage.menkes filed another claim for benefits under his dba policy for these same injuries.although icsp and qinetiq disputed the extent of his injuries,the parties ultimately agreed to settle that claim.
wolfe does not allege that he suffered any injury or ever filed any claim for benefits under either one of the prudential policies or the dba policy.
the plaintiffs filed this action in the district of new jersey on may.in their original complaint,they alleged six counts,including violation of the new jersey consumer fraud act cfa,stat.ann,et violation of the truth in consumer contract,warranty,and notice act tccwna,stat.ann,et breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing intentional or negligent misrepresentation omission punitive damages and alternatively,violation of the consumer fraud laws of various states.they contended that prudential fraudulently induced them to buy the supplemental coverage knowing that any claim they filed would likely be subject to the war exclusion clauses because their place of employment was in a war zone in iraq,rendering the supplemental coverage effectively worthless they additionally alleged that prudential deliberately concealed a policy or practice of using the war exclusion clauses to deny benefits for any and all injuries suffered while stationed abroad.the remedies the plaintiffs sought were limited to return of the premiums they paid and punitive damages 
the district court dismissed the suit in its entirety.it held that the supplemental coverage was governed by erisa and could not be unbundled from the basic policies.viewing the basic policies and supplemental coverage as closely related component parts of a single plan,it held that all of the plaintiffs state law claims were expressly preempted by erisa broad preemption clause,a,which provides that erisa shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.a.in the alternative,it held that the plaintiffs claims were preempted by a of erisa because the causes of action that the plaintiffs asserted conflicted with erisa exclusive civil enforcement scheme.it also held that the dba preempted menkes state law claims.
the district court also denied the plaintiffs motion for leave to amend their complaint as futile.the plaintiffs submitted a proposed amended complaint in which they deleted any reference to the new jersey tccwna,deleted all references to the term life insurance policies,and added a state law breach of fiduciary duty claim.the court addressed these proposed revisions in its opinion and held that the proposed amended complaint was substantially similar to the original.the plaintiffs timely appealed.
the district court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to the class action fairness act,d.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.

the plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in concluding that their state law claims were preempted by erisa a,a,which broadly preempts state laws that relate to an erisa plan.the plaintiffs argue that their claims are not preempted because the supplemental coverage is not a plan that was established or maintained by qinetiq,and the supplemental coverage is excluded from the scope of erisa by virtue of a regulatory safe harbor.we conclude that the first contention is without merit and that the supplemental coverage,as part of qinetiq broader benefits plan,is governed by erisa.
erisa applies to any employee benefit plan if it is established or maintained by any employer engaged in commerce.a.erisa defines an employee welfare benefit plan as any plan,fund,or program which was heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization,or by both,to the extent that such plan,fund,or program was established or is maintained for the purpose of providing certain benefits for its participants or their beneficiaries,through the purchase of insurance or otherwise.an erisa plan is established if from the surrounding circumstances a reasonable person can ascertain the intended benefits,a class of beneficiaries,the source of financing,and procedures for receiving benefits.shaver siemens,cir quoting donovan dillingham,cir en banc.the crucial factor in determining whether a plan has been established is whether the employer has expressed an intention to provide benefits on a regular and basis.gruber hubbard bert karle weber,cir.
one of the touchstones of a plan that is governed by erisa is the establishment and maintenance of a separate and ongoing administrative scheme,which the plan administrator must set up in order to determine eligibility for benefits.shaver,at citing angst mack trucks,cir.this feature derives from the supreme court decision in fort halifax packing coyne,in which the court held that erisa preemption was designed to afford employers the advantages of a uniform set of administrative procedures governed by a single set of regulations,in situations where there exists an ongoing administrative program to meet the employer obligation.an administrative scheme may arise where the employer,to determine the employee eligibility for and level of benefits,must analyze each employee particular circumstances in light of the policy criteria.shaver,at quoting kulinski medtronic bio medicus,cir.
given the circumstances outlined in the plaintiffs complaint,qinetiq established and maintained the supplemental coverage within the meaning of erisa.it is undisputed that the supplemental coverage was governed by the same booklets and spds as the basic policies.these documents quite clearly outlined the intended benefits see app,describing the amount and frequency of benefit payments,the class of beneficiaries see app,describing who is eligible to become insured,the source of financing see app,informing employees that qinetiq paid all of the premiums for the basic long term disability and basic accidental death and dismemberment policies,but that employees must contribute to receive other coverage,and the procedures for receiving benefits see app,detailing each policy claim procedures.
the portion of the spds that details claim procedures indicates that there existed a comprehensive administrative scheme for determining eligibility for benefits after an employee filed a claim.the spds each promised that prudential would notify a claimant regarding a determination of eligibility for benefits within days of filing a claim.the criteria for eligibility were exhaustively set out in the booklets.if a claim were denied,prudential promised to inform the employee in writing of the specific reason for the denial,whether the denial could be cured,and the procedures for appealing the denial.this administrative scheme clearly evidences qinetiq intention to provide benefits on a regular and basis.gruber,at.qinetiq therefore established and maintained the basic policies and supplemental coverage,which operated as a single plan,within the meaning of erisa.
although the basic policies indisputably were governed by erisa,the plaintiffs argue that the supplemental coverage ought to be unbundled and analyzed separately.they contend that if the supplemental coverage is viewed separately,then the supplemental coverage is not a welfare benefit plan that is governed by erisa because of a regulatory safe harbor that excludes certain programs.see j.the plaintiffs,however,point to no authority that would suggest that closely related components of an overarching welfare benefit plan ought to be unbundled,and in the circumstances presented here,there are several compelling reasons not to do so.
all of the characteristics of the basic policies and supplemental coverage indicate that they are not two separate sources of coverage,but two parts of one broader benefits plan.all of the basic policies and supplemental coverage were governed by a single group contract between qinetiq and prudential.all of the information regarding benefit terms,rules,exclusions,and claim procedures for the basic policies and supplemental coverage were the same and contained in the same documents qinetiq did not issue separate booklets and spds for the supplemental coverage.if an employee wanted to know,for example,the procedure for filing a claim,he would look in only one place,and then file only one claim.purchasing the supplemental coverage merely bestowed a higher level of benefits pursuant to the same terms.
viewing the basic policies and supplemental coverage as two parts of a broader whole is consistent with erisa policy goals.one of the statute principal aims is to avoid subjecting regulated entities to conflicting sources of substantive law.state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins.such uniform regulation is impossible if plans are subject to different legal obligations in different states.egelhoff egelhoff ex rel.breiner.making different parts of a single,integrated plan subject to differing legal regimes could actually deter employers from offering such additional coverage in the first place.conkright frommert.
accordingly,we hold that the supplemental coverage can not be unbundled from the basic plans.in so holding,we join every court of appeals to have considered whether to unbundle closely related components of an employer broader erisa benefits plan and declined to do so.for example,in gross sun life assurance of canada,cir,the plaintiff employer paid all of its employees premiums for life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance,but employees paid all of their own premiums for optional long term disability coverage.id.at.after the plaintiff insurance company denied her coverage under the long term disability policy,she brought numerous state law claims against the carrier responsible for the long term disability policy.the district court held that her claims with respect to the long term disability policy were preempted and the court of appeals for the first circuit affirmed.the court of appeals viewed the long term disability policy as part of a comprehensive employee benefit plan that the employer offered its employees.id.at quotation marks omitted.the court noted that the employer offered all three policies pursuant to the same group contract with its insurer,and the benefits,rules,exclusions,and claim procedures were covered by the same plan documents.id.at.it held that because a plan under erisa may embrace one or more policies,there was no justification for isolating the dis
