at issue is the enforceability under massachusetts law unconscionability doctrine of class action waivers of fair labor standards act claims contained in a resolution program.
two managers brought a class action suit against their former employer,dynamics research corporation drc,for violations of the fair labor standards act flsa,et,and the massachusetts minimum fair wage law.laws ch,et.
the company moved to compel arbitration under its newly adopted dispute resolution program program which contains language waiving class actions.the district court ordered arbitration and struck the class waiver provisions,finding them unconscionable and invalid as contrary to the policies animating the flsa.skirchak dynamics research,d.the company has appealed the decision striking the class action waiver.the plaintiffs have agreed to arbitration but oppose waiver of their ability to pursue a class action in arbitration.
based on the particular facts of this case,we uphold the striking of the class action waiver on grounds of unconscionability under state law and thus under the federal arbitration act faa.our ruling is narrow.we do not reach the argument that waivers of class actions themselves violate either the flsa or public policy.the question of whether plaintiffs otherwise meet the requirements for a class action are for the arbitrator to decide.
procedural history 
plaintiffs joseph skirchak and barry aldrich were employed by drc,a government contractor of technology services.skirchak worked in the human resources department as the director of compensation and retirement programs until his resignation in october aldrich was the vice president of contracts until his resignation in november.
following a complaint by skirchak,the department of labor conducted an investigation into alleged violations of the flsa in the fall of.as a result,drc agreed to pay back approximately to its employees and change its policies.the plaintiffs then filed a class action complaint in the district of massachusetts in june alleging violations of the flsa and the massachusetts minimum fair wage law and seeking treble damages.the complaint alleged that drc willfully failed to pay plaintiffs,and all other similarly situated employees categorized as exempt,at of their regular pay rate for time worked in excess of forty hours per week in violation of federal and state law.specifically,plaintiffs alleged that up until october,drc payroll department made deductions from each employee balance of paid leave and this violated the flsa salary basis test,resulting in underpayments that violated the flsa and the massachusetts minimum fair wage law.the plaintiffs suit claimed damages beyond any relief obtained as a result of the department of labor investigation.
drc never filed an answer,but instead moved to dismiss the complaint and compel arbitration in accordance with its dispute resolution program,which,drc contended,constituted an agreement between the parties to arbitrate all disputes.the program,in certain clauses,required the plaintiffs to proceed in arbitration individually,as opposed to in a class action.the plaintiffs opposed the defendant motion.
the district court,on april,issued an order compelling arbitration,but striking the part of the program which barred class actions.skirchak,d at.the court found the class action waiver unconscionable under massachusetts state law,finding procedural defects in the way it was adopted,that it was so as to be oppressive,and that the waiver was contrary to the purpose of the flsa.id.at.both parties appealed the defendant appealed the striking of the class action waiver,and the plaintiffs initially appealed the order compelling arbitration.the plaintiffs now agree to arbitration and argue only that the class action waiver is unenforceable.
b.the dispute resolution program 
we describe the essential facts surrounding the program and its adoption.roughly a year before the plaintiffs left the company,on tuesday,november,at am,two days before the thanksgiving holiday,drc sent a to all of its employees asking them to read three attached documents describing the company new dispute resolution program.the third attachment is not in the record and apparently is not in dispute.nothing in the mentioned that the attachments constituted modifications to the employees terms of employment or employment contract,nor that the documents restricted the employees rights to a judicial forum,nor that they waived class actions.further,no response to the was required,nor were employees asked to acknowledge reading the documents.
the initial attachment,which appeared first after the body of the,contained a memorandum introducing the program.that memorandum explained that the program took effect on the following monday,december,and applied to all disputes between the company and its employees.the memorandum stated that the program expands upon and enhance s drc previous problem resolution process by requiring mediation and arbitration,described as two additional and more formal processes for resolving disputes between an employee and the company.the enhanced program would create improved,reasoned,predictable,and reliable processes that would provide the same resolution as can be obtained through the court system but with less cost and complications for all parties.lastly,the memorandum reiterated that t he program does not limit or change any substantive legal rights of our employees,but it does require that you seek resolution of such rights and complaints by following the procedures of the program.emphasis added.this language is in some tension with later waiver language contained in the other attached documents.an employee who stopped after reading the descriptive memorandum would not know of the class action waiver.
a second attachment contained the actual text of the program in four parts a,description of the program,two appendices describing the program rules,and a third appendix containing relevant forms.the scope of the program,by its terms,is broad and encompasses claims under federal and state employment statutes and matters of interpretation of the program rules.the program applies to all disputes,defined as any dispute for controversy including all legal and equitable claims,demands,and controversies,of whatever nature or kind,whether in contract,tort,under statute or regulation,or at law or in equity,between persons and entities bound by the program including,but not limited to,any matters with respect to this program the program also covers claims premised on allegations of discrimination based on race,sex,religion,national origin,or disability sexual harassment workers compensation retaliation and defamation the program also instructs the arbitrator to construe the scope of the program liberally the arbitrator shall interpret and apply these rules to the greatest extent possible insofar as they relate to the arbitrator powers and duties.there is also a severability clause.should a section or a provision of the program be invalidated,the program provides the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision herein shall not affect the application of any other provision or any jurisdiction in which such a provision may be lawful.
the program description,plus its three appendices,constitutes a document.an employee who read only the,the descriptive memorandum and the program description would not know of the class action waiver.
the two class action waiver clauses are contained in the appendices to the program.the first is in appendix a,entitled dynamics research corporation dispute resolution program rules.rule is entitled authority and states the arbitrator shall have no authority to consider class claims or join different claimants or grant relief other than on an individual basis to the individual employee involved.the right of any party to pursue a class action for any dispute subject to the program shall be waived to the fullest extent permitted by law.emphasis added.the language is some twenty pages into the pages of the program and the appendices.
later,in appendix b,entitled dynamics research corporation dispute resolution program arbitration rules,there is a second waiver clause in rule scope of the arbitrator authority on page which provides that the arbitrator shall have no jurisdiction to grant class relief emphasis added.this clause does not contain the limiting language to the fullest extent permitted by law contained in appendix a.in order to find either of the provisions,the employee would have needed to read the initial,the memorandum and the program attachment,and to proceed to the pages in question.
a reader who read all of the attachments would likely still be confused because of tension between the wording of several clauses and documents.for example,one set of provisions provide for the preservation of all of the employees rights and remedies.the last page of the program description notes that an arbitrator has the same authority as a judge or jury in making awards or granting relief to an individual employee.a judge,in an appropriate case,may issue relief,while the second class waiver clause said an arbitrator had no such authority.to give another example,the first paragraph of appendix a,in a section entitled purpose and construction,states in part the program is not intended either to abridge or enlarge substantive rights available under applicable law.in the same rule reiterating the class waiver on page,the program also provides the arbitrator shall not have the authority to either abridge or enlarge substantive rights available under existing law.the program rules elsewhere state that o ther than as expressly provided herein,the substantive legal rights,remedies,and defenses of all parties are preserved.
further,the reader would have to search to find that he or she had consented to the terms of the new program by returning to work on the following monday.while nothing is mentioned in the,the descriptive memorandum,or the document describing the program,the final page of appendix a provides that e mployment on or continued employment after december,constitutes consent by both the employee and the company to be bound by this program 
by contrast,before the mass to all company employees on november,drc had sent a similar to its general managers,including the two plaintiffs.that contained an attached memorandum which informed the managers that the program would be mandatory and.this language was omitted from both the november and the attached memorandum sent to all employees.
the company later announcements to its employees also failed to disclose the class action waiver.the company monthly newsletters in january,february,and november of the next year discussed the program.only the february article was explicit that lawsuits under the program would be subject to a motion to remove the dispute from court.none of the newsletters described the class action waiver provision.
there is evidence that the method by which the program was announced and adopted varied from the company usual practices.unlike the dispute resolution program at issue in this case,which was only featured in the newsletter after it became effective,a new compensation program was announced in the january newsletter before its effective date of february.that newsletter also discussed plans to schedule employee compensation program orientation sessions to explain the new compensation program.
while drc routinely communicated with employees about new policies using and,at times,articles in the newsletter,the company also sent personalized letters to the homes of employees,ran training programs,and made announcements at employee meetings when it implemented new retirement programs.as to its code of conduct,the company also required employees to sign an annual acknowledgment that they had received and read the distributed materials.
there was no evidence from drc that it had ever adopted and implemented any significant personnel policy,much less a significant one involving waiver of rights,by an to employees shortly before a holiday,and to which the employees were deemed to have agreed by returning to work after the holiday.
appellate jurisdiction 
plaintiffs brief argues that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over drc appeal.plaintiffs have most likely waived the argument by later asking this court to decide the class action waiver question.in any event,this court has jurisdiction to review the district court order under the faa,which grants appellate jurisdiction for a final decision with respect to an arbitration that is subject to the faa.a.plaintiffs had argued that the district court ruling compelling arbitration was not final because the american arbitration association rules provide parties with the opportunity to seek court intervention at points before the conclusion of the arbitration.however,the district court has ordered the parties to proceed to arbitration,and dismissed all the claims before it,so that decision is final within the meaning of a,and therefore appealable.green tree fin.randolph,d see also municipality of san juan corporación para el fomento económico de la ciudad capital,cir.the potential for future court intervention does not change the construction of final as set forth in green tree fin,at.
b.who should decide the question 
both parties agree that this case should proceed in arbitration.their disagreement is whether plaintiffs are barred from pursuing a class action in arbitration.the parties have requested this court to decide the issue and not refer it to the arbitrator.
under the language of the program,the question here ordinarily would be one for the arbitrator in the first instance for two different reasons.first,the arbitrator must construe all of the language to determine whether there was a waiver,in light of the tensions in the language as described.second,an arbitrator could carry out the unconscionability analysis.
first,the supreme court decision in green tree financial bazzle,d,made clear that when claims are submitted to arbitration,the question of whether class arbitration is forbidden is not a question of arbitrability but initially a question of contract interpretation and should be decided in the first instance by an arbitrator.id.at.plurality opinion see also id.at stevens,concurring in the judgment and dissenting in part noting that the question a rguably should have been made in the first instance by the arbitrator.t he question is not whether the parties wanted a judge or an arbitrator to decide whether they agreed to arbitrate a matter.rather the relevant question here is what kind of arbitration proceeding the parties agreed to.id.at.plurality opinion internal citations omitted see also pacificare health,book,d holding that an arbitrator must decide whether statutory treble damages count as punitive within the meaning of an arbitration agreement.
this court adhered to that view in anderson comcast,cir,which held that an arbitrator must decide whether a class action waiver extended to cover the suit in question under the language in the agreement.the relevant arbitration agreement there provided for waiver of class actions unless your state laws provide otherwise.id.at.it was up to an arbitrator to determine whether a class action right provided by massachusetts law fell into the exception provided by that arbitration agreement.id.
second,there is a separate but related question of whether,assuming the contractual language is interpreted to provide for a class action waiver,that waiver is unconscionable.under buckeye check cashing,cardegna,d,it is likely that this question of the unconscionability of the class action waiver provision,viewed as severable from the arbitration provision,is an issue for the arbitrator.we need not resolve the issue.
nonetheless,here the parties have affirmatively stated their intention that the court decide the unconscionability and statutory invalidity questions.we understand them to agree that the clauses should be assumed to be read to waive class claims,and the question of whether the program,so read,may be enforced under the faa is for the court.
the parties agree there is no jurisdictional objection to our deciding the question.an agreement to arbitrate does not divest a court of its jurisdiction.see dimercurio sphere drake,plc,cir noting the modern view that arbitration agreements do not divest courts of jurisdiction,though they prevent courts from resolving the merits of arbitrable disputes.
we have jurisdiction and,in the interests of efficiency,we reach the merits question,as requested.
we review the district court decision de novo,as it presents solely questions of law.anderson,at see also marks marks gmbh.kg presstek,cir.the facts on which we rely are undisputed there are some disputes as to facts which are not material.we may affirm the district court order on any independent ground made manifest by the record.intergen grina,cir.
c.the merits enforceability of the waiver clause 
this case,then,does not involve an attempt to avoid arbitration at all,but only avoidance of a class waiver.the case does not call for invocation of much of the supreme court case law originally designed to counter judicial hostility to arbitration.see,mitsubishi motors soler,d t he federal arbitration act was designed to overcome an anachronistic judicial hostility to agreements to arbitrate moses cone mem l hosp.mercury const,d the federal arbitration act reflects a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.nor does the issue here invoke more recent case law designed to prevent judicial incursions into the power of arbitrators to decide matters which the parties intended the arbitrators to decide.see green tree,at.
both the law of arbitration and the law of contracts set forth conditions under which a clause in such a contract may not be enforced,such as unconscionability.see written arbitration agreements shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract see also doctor,casarotto,d noting that g enerally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening kristian comcast,cir.
the issues in the case not only draw on the law of contracts,but also are akin to issues under the law of waiver of rights granted under federal employment statutes.that law focuses largely on whether the waiver was knowing and voluntary.see,cabán hernández philip morris usa,cir finding that an employee severance agreement constituted a knowing and voluntary waiver of title vii rights squibb caribbean,cir finding that an employee severance agreement constituted a knowing and voluntary waiver of ada rights smart gillette.disability plan,cir finding that an employee severance agreement constituted a knowing and voluntary waiver of her erisa rights.congress has,through the older workers benefit protection act,legislatively required that waivers of adea rights be knowing and voluntary.f.no such express statutory protection applies to waivers under the flsa.so we consider the issues of knowledge and voluntariness insofar as they are pertinent under the state law doctrine of unconscionability.
unconscionability and related doctrines do not turn on whether,in a strict sense,a party has a constitutional,statutory,or common law right.the flsa does provide that actions for flsa violations may be brought as class actions.b.this congressional allowance for class actions recognizes that class actions may be the more effective mechanism for redressing small claims,see deposit guar.bank roper,d noting that the may motivate plaintiffs to bring cases that for economic reasons might not be brought otherwise,and permit citizens to function as private attorneys general the supreme court has noted that the flsa itself is meant to offset the superior bargaining power of employers both for particular employees at issue and broader classifications,and to offset the resulting general downward pressure on wages in competing businesses.see tony susan alamo found.sec y of labor,d.
for our purposes,it is not important to answer whether the flsa gives plaintiffs a right to a class action in the same way one has a right to file suit under the flsa.it is sufficient that the class action provisions give the plaintiffs an interest of some value to them in their employment 
state law,under the provisions of the faa,provides our reference point.see barbara lindemann paul grossman,employment discrimination law ed.the enforceability of arbitration agreements depends on the governing state contract law and the facts of the individual cases,including the prominence and clarity of the arbitration agreement,whether the employee acknowledged the arbitration requirement,whether the employee had a meaningful choice,and whether the employee was.footnotes omitted.
plaintiffs argue the application of normal state law unconscionability analysis should be heightened somewhat because the flsa is a federal statute protecting employee rights.under title vii and the ada,we have applied an independent federal scrutiny of the adequacy of the notice of waiver of judicial rights because in the language of these statutes congress referred to appropriate waivers rosenberg merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir title vii campbell dynamics gov t,cir ada.no appropriateness requirement exists in the flsa,and we reject the argument.
rather,under the faa,we approach this issue under normal state law unconscionability standards here,we apply those of massachusetts.in miller cotter,the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc laid out its present standard for unconscionability as a defense to enforcing all or part of an arbitration agreement.miller involved an agreement to arbitrate but not a class action waiver signed along with a contract for admission of a patient to a nursing home.the court found that the agreement was not unconscionable,and set forth a standard of determination,looking at the setting,purpose,and effect of the agreement.
the determination that a contract or term is or is not unconscionable is made in the light of its setting,purpose and effect.restatement second of contracts,comment a.because there is no clear,definition of unconscionable,nor could there be,unconscionability must be determined on a case by case basis see commonwealth gustafsson,giving particular attention to whether,at the time of the execution of the agreement,the contract provision could result in unfair surprise and was oppressive to the allegedly disadvantaged party emphasis added.zapatha dairy mart.
id.at.in giving further content to the agreement setting,the sjc examined several factors,including the plaintiff education and business sophistication,the circumstances under which the plaintiff entered into the agreement,and any pressure that was exerted by the defendant on the plaintiff.id.the court noted that the arbitration agreement was separate from and independent of the admissions agreement,and explicitly not a condition of admission.id.at.the defendant did not exert any undue pressure on him to sign it,id.at,and the agreement was adequately explained in an extended admissions meeting with the plaintiff.id.at.the sjc also found nothing objectionable about the agreement purpose and effect.id.at.
for a variety of reasons,we conclude that the waiver clause,under these circumstances,is unenforceable under state law.we do not need to reach the question of whether the waiver purpose and effect is independently objectionable.under state law,whether an enforceable contract exists,as in the case of whether an employment handbook is a contract,depends upon a host of considerations,including its content and the circumstances of its distribution.campbell,at citing new eng.further,under state law,when waiver of statutory rights is at issue,massachusetts generally requires that the waiver be both knowing and voluntary.see,barton brassring,wl,at,rowe town of north reading,wl,at.in our view,this statutorily created interest in class actions,even assuming it is waivable,was sufficiently strong that massachusetts law would,on these facts,find the waiver would result in oppression and unfair surprise to the disadvantaged party.the waiver was not due to mere allocation of risk because of drc superior bargaining power waters,at.
it is the combination of a series of events which leads us to a conclusion of unconscionability no single event alone bears the weight of this conclusion and no broader implications should be taken from this opinion.
the timing,the language,and the format of the presentation of the program obscured,whether intentionally or not,the waiver of class rights.the waiver lacked both prominence and clarity.massachusetts courts,under another fairness doctrine,have declined to enforce clauses due to short timing here,the short notice over a holiday weekend.see,cherick,polar,upholding finding that termination of a contract with only four days notice was a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing williams b k med,upholding a finding that refusal to allow an employee time to consider a severance offer as a violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
there was nothing objectionable about the use of itself.but the content,the obscurity,and the timing of the and the failure to require a response raise unconscionability concerns.the employees received the tuesday before thanksgiving did not state it represented a modification to their employment contract at all.to the contrary,the attached memorandum clearly noted that the program d id not limit or change any substantive legal rights of drc employees.it also described the program as an enhanced program with the intent to create improved,reasoned,predictable,and reliable processes,without mention of any potential disadvantages.the memorandum also failed to give notice.
we do not decide whether it was the intent of the company to hide the waiver.the effect was to hide the waiver.massachusetts law considers the risk of misrepresentation in assessing unconscionability.see waters,at m isrepresentation is recognized as a factor rendering a contract unconscionable.campbell,at noting that an describing arbitration as a kinder,gentler alternative to litigation without suggesting that it extinguish ed an employee access to a judicial forum did not provid e fair warning that showing up for work the next day would result in a waiver of important rights.
massachusetts law considers,as part of unconscionability analysis,whether the provision is obscurely worded or buried in fine print of a contract.zapatha,at.the lack of fair notice here continued into the format of the presentation,as the class action waiver was hidden in two paragraphs in a appendix to a document.campbell,at recognizing it as a fundamental flaw when an announcement contained nothing to imply,nor did it state directly that the policy contained an arbitration agreement that was meant to effect a waiver of an employee right to access a judicial forum.
massachusetts law also considers whether there was an opportunity to consult or to signify acceptance of a contractual term where waiver of statutorily defined rights are involved.see miller,at,noting that the arbitration agreement required a separate signature,but was not a requirement for admission to the nursing home zapatha,at noting that the plaintiff had been given the opportunity to consult an attorney before accepting.here,drc did not require any sort of affirmative response or acknowledgment by the employee.campbell,at noting that the no response required format disguised the import of the communication,while r equiring an affirmative response would have signaled that the policy was contractual in nature this is just another factor in the mix.
drc attempts to avoid the consequences of the choices it made which effectively hid the waiver provision with the argument that,by now,enough notice has been provided for the class waiver that the waiver is enforceable.drc phrases the argument in terms of the fact that plaintiffs continued to work after the effective date of the announcement and certainly learned of the waiver.we reject the argument.nothing would be left of much of state law unconscionability analysis if that argument were accepted.the campbell analysis is directly to the contrary it analyzed the procedures by which the arbitration agreement was communicated before it became effective,even when an employee worked at the company for twenty months after the agreement was adopted.at.
one additional factor in the mix is the comparison of how this program was handled with how the company handled other personnel issues.plaintiffs point to two other programs which involved training sessions,mailings to employees homes,and announcements at meetings.drc counters that these two other programs were the deviations from the standard procedure,and that the communication of this program was the norm.for our purposes,it suffices that it was at least common practice,if not uniform practice,for drc to employ methods of communicating policy changes that extended further than notifications before and newsletter articles after the fact.see campbell,at while was a familiar format for many forms of communication,the record does not suggest that was a traditional means either for conveying contractually binding terms or for effectuating waivers of employees legal rights.
we do not need to decide if class actions under the flsa may ever be waived by agreement drc strongly argues this point.the cases on which drc relies find class waivers to be insufficient grounds to invalidate an arbitration agreement in total.they are not so instructive on the issues we do reach,which turn on the facts of this case and not an attempt to invalidate the arbitration agreement.see caley gulfstream aerospace,cir carter countrywide credit,cir adkins labor ready,cir horenstein mortgage,cir unpublished per curiam order.we note there is also case law reaching the opposite result.see shroyer new cingular wireless,cir using a finding that class action waiver was unconscionable under california law to invalidate an arbitration agreement powertel,bexley,so d,using a finding that class action waiver was unconscionable under florida law to invalidate an arbitration agreement.
by like token,plaintiffs rely heavily on kristian,which invalidated a prohibition against antitrust class action claims in an arbitration agreement.the kristian holding rests on reasoning that the class action waiver constituted a weakening of antitrust law enforcement mechanisms in a manner inconsistent with congressional intent.again,kristian is pertinent to the questions we do not reach.
we also do not reach the question of whether such waivers of flsa class actions are per se against public policy under either the flsa or the massachusetts fair wage law see,beacon hill civic ass ristorante toscano,contract in which neighborhood association promised not to oppose beer and wine license in exchange for promise of restaurant not to seek general alcohol license violates public policy superintendent of the walter fernald state,redress is available for employees who are terminated for asserting a legally guaranteed right,filing workers compensation claim,for doing what the law requires,serving on a jury,or for refusing to do that which the law forbids,committing perjury.
we recognize that there is a policy debate about whether class action waivers essentially act as exculpatory clauses,allowing for violations of laws where individual cases involve low dollar amounts and so will not adequately address or prevent illegality see myriam gilles,opting out of liability the forthcoming,demise of the modern class action,arguing that sound public policy requires collective litigation be available for plaintiffs who would not have the incentive or resources to remedy harms or deter wrongdoing in proceedings david schwartz,enforcing small print to protect big business employee and consumer rights claims in an age of compelled arbitration,contending that displacing adjudication through arbitration clauses systematically reduces the legal liability of corporate defendants.
the sjc has not addressed the issue and we have no need to predict what it would do.
at oral argument we asked the parties whether each would prefer to be in arbitration even if the class action waiver clause was stricken.the company said it would prefer to be in arbitration the plaintiffs agreed.we have no reason to choose
