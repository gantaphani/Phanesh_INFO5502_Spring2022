frederick hawk,represented by his attorneys lynde selden ii and richard rosenthal,attempted to intervene in this class action.the district court denied hawk motion to intervene under federal rules of civil procedure a and b rule a and b.
the district court also found that selden and rosenthal did not investigate appropriately hawk claims and that they filed pleadings on hawk behalf to interfere with and delay the administration of justice.consequently,on its own initiative,the court entered an order directing selden and rosenthal to show cause as to why they should not be sanctioned under federal rule of civil procedure rule and later imposed in sanctions on the attorneys.
for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the district court denial of the motion to intervene.we vacate the decision to impose rule sanctions,and we remand that decision to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
backgrounda.facts 
on february,thomas vollmer filed this class action lawsuit against publishers clearing house pch and its competitor american family publishers afp in illinois state court pch is a new york limited partnership that sells magazine subscriptions and other merchandise through direct mail advertising,and it often personalizes its solicitation materials to include specific information about the recipient.since,pch has also operated the publishers clearing house sweepstakes the sweepstakes,which offers prospective customers the ability to win cash and prizes as a method of drawing attention to its mailings.no purchase of pch merchandise is necessary to enter or improve one chances of winning the sweepstakes.
vollmer suit,one of a number against pch at the time,alleged violations of illinois state consumer protection law.his complaint charged that pch fraudulently induced customers to purchase magazines and other items.the complaint claimed that pch did so by falsely suggesting in its advertising that customers could increase their chances of winning the sweepstakes by making purchases,and vollmer sought to certify a class of illinois residents who had been deceived by pch mailings into making unwanted purchases.the complaint was later amended on june,to include the additional named plaintiffs and to add campus subscriptions,csi as an additional defendant it was also amended to allege violations of federal racketeering laws,which led to the removal of the case to the district court,pursuant to its federal question jurisdiction.
after negotiations between class counsel and pch,the parties entered into a stipulation of settlement,filed with the district court on june.one week later,the district court conditionally certified a class for settlement purposes that included all persons in the united states who received a pch solicitation between february,and june.this certification also included a subclass of class members who purchased pch merchandise during the class period additionally,the district court granted preliminary approval of the settlement.the settlement included remedial undertakings by pch aimed at addressing the allegations raised in vollmer complaint and also provided monetary relief in the form of refunds for subclass members who filed a claim during the claims period.initially,the settlement contained a cap on these refunds of million,less costs,other refunds and attorneys fees that could have reduced the total amount to as low as million.one month after hawk had attempted to intervene in this action,when it became clear that claims would exceed this million figure,pch agreed to pay all approved claims in full.the amount of those claims would eventually reach approximately million to million.
hawk,a farm equipment salesman from san diego,california,was a past customer of pch and had received a notice of the settlement in early august of.hawk testified that soon after,he contacted selden regarding the notice.he knew selden because hawk wife was an administrator in selden office.selden,later joined by rosenthal,contacted class counsel requesting information and access to documents regarding the settlement,ostensibly to determine whether it would be in hawk best interest to opt out of the settlement class.these requests were denied by class counsel.
as a result,on september,hawk filed a petition to intervene for limited purposes of viewing document depository,which noted that b efore intervenor accepts the proffered settlement he wants to view the document depository defendant has made available to class counsel.at.hawk claimed that intervention of right under rule a was appropriate because class counsel had not considered the impact of the settlement upon hawk in comparison to the relief hawk could achieve under california consumer protection laws.additionally,he claimed that permissive intervention was appropriate under rule b for basically the same reason.
both class counsel and the defendants opposed this motion.among its arguments in this regard,class counsel asserted that selden and rosenthal were professional objectors or claim jumpers who filed such claims often in the past,usually without merit.to bolster this theory,they cited a number of cases and a newspaper article describing the attorneys involvement in contesting class action settlements,some of which cast selden and rosenthal in an unflattering light.see at.class counsel and the defendants also disputed hawk assertion that greater monetary relief could be gained under california law,and argued that,because he had not decided whether to request exclusion from the settlement,hawk could not properly seek intervention under federal rule of civil procedure c c.
district court proceedings 
the district court,noting that difficulties can arise with intervention in major class action litigation,required hawk and two other proposed intervenors to appear before the court to explain their objections to the settlement.on october,the day he was scheduled to appear,hawk filed intervenor motion to intervene,which requested the ability to intervene into this preliminarily approved class action,appoint purported intervenor counsel as counsel and such other relief as the court deems proper.at.in a memorandum in support of that motion,hawk maintained that his interests were inadequately represented by class counsel because the temporal proximity of the filing of class counsel second amended complaint and the agreement to the settlement suggested collusion between class counsel and defendants,no meaningful discovery had been undertaken by class counsel and the monetary and injunctive relief in the settlement was inadequate.
later that morning,the district court held a hearing regarding the motions to intervene.the court was alerted by selden that,in addition to his motion to intervene for the limited purpose of discovery,hawk had also filed a more general motion to intervene that morning.the following exchange ensued 
the court all right.so are you withdrawing your petition to intervene for a limited purpose 
selden no,your honor.we supplementing it.
the court well,do you want in for all purposes or for a limited purpose 
selden all purposes.
the court all right.when you say you supplementing it,what do you wish for me to do with this paper,the one for a limited purpose 
selden i would wish that that would be granted and then the motion to intervene would come on and you would grant that.that would be my wish.
tr at.at this point,the court seemed inclined to believe that hawk now meant to intervene to represent others in the action,not primarily to conduct discovery regarding the settlement.it noted that w hat they do once they get here,if i let them intervene,is a whole different matter as to whether i going to let them conduct discovery.id.at.
hawk then testified.he claimed that he believed that the monetary relief for refunds in the settlement,at that point capped at a maximum of million,was insufficient.he also asserted that he sought legal counsel in this case on his own initiative.however,hawk also demonstrated great unfamiliarity with the nature of his complaint.he lacked any knowledge of the injunctive relief agreed to in the settlement,the mechanics of the refund process described in the notice,the settlement million cap on attorneys fees and the amount that he had personally spent on pch merchandise.moreover,hawk did not recall ever reading the motion to intervene filed on his behalf prior to that morning and could not articulate his basis for asking to intervene on behalf of other individuals in the lawsuit.he also was not familiar with rosenthal and was unaware that rosenthal was representing him in the case.lastly,hawk confirmed that he was unsure as to whether he would opt out of the class and did not know what information he would need to ultimately make such a decision.
the district court thereafter denied hawk motions to intervene in this case.it determined that hawk had not shown that intervention of right was appropriate under rule a because he could not demonstrate that his interests were inadequately represented by class counsel.additionally,the court ruled that permissive intervention under rule b was not justified because it would unduly delay and prejudice the rights of the class.the district court also made it clear that,after hearing hawk,it now believed that he was not here because he ha d serious questions about the injunctive relief that the court has authored,but that the intervention was for purposes of conducting discovery.tr at.the district court also determined that hawk lack of a passing understanding about the nature of the lawsuit,id.at,showed that he was put forward by selden and rosenthal to cause delay and increase the cost of the litigation.as a result,on its own initiative,the court ordered the attorneys to show cause as to why they had not violated rule b and should not be sanctioned.
subsequently,on january,the district court held a final fairness hearing regarding the settlement,at which selden and rosenthal appeared on behalf of hawk.before the hearing,the district court noted that it was never this court intention to deny anyone the opportunity to intervene and preserve their appellate rights.tr at.instead,it maintained that it had denied hawk motions to intervene because it became clear to the court that these proposed intervenors wanted to intervene for a limited purpose and conduct discovery to see if they did wish to intervene for all purposes and because it did not find hawk to be a proper class representative or his attorneys to be proper class counsel.id.at.when asked if they wished to make any argument against the settlement,selden and rosenthal declared that they would rest on their pleadings.the district court queried at the end of the hearing if hawk still wished to intervene,but selden responded that because the hearing was over,such a motion would serve no purpose.the district court subsequently approved the settlement on february.
on february,the district court held a hearing on selden and rosenthal objection to the imposition of rule sanctions.there the court said that hawk lack of knowledge regarding the settlement and his personal relationship with selden led it to believe that the attorneys recruited hawk to intervene so that they could extract a fee from the proceedings.it believed that hawk discovery request was a ploy to see how much is here and what we can get out of it.tr at.moreover,in referring to selden and rosenthal,the court claimed that they are not real class action lawyers but instead that they follow people around the country,and then they stick their nose in a case and they extract money.id.at.
additionally,the district court asserted that it had made it the court business to find out all i can about the attorneys legal practice and that i have been able to find anyone anywhere that say these are recognized class counsel.id.at.ultimately,the court levied sanctions in the amount of.to arrive at that figure,it used the attorneys fees that class counsel and the defendants counsel generated in response to the motions to intervene as a marker,but not a dispositive one.id.at.it directed that the fees were to be paid directly to the greater east louis community fund,a local charitable organization.
hawk appealed the denial of his motion to intervene and the judgment certifying the class and approving the settlement.selden and rosenthal appealed the imposition of rule sanctions.all three appeals were consolidated into the present case.
discussiona.motion to.
hawk sought to intervene as of right under rule a,which required him to make a timely application,have an interest relating to the subject matter of the action,be at risk that that interest will be impaired by the action disposition and demonstrate a lack of adequate representation of the interest by the existing parties.see nissei sangyo america,united states,cir.hawk is required to prove each of these four elements the lack of one element requires that the motion to intervene be denied.see keith daley,cir.the district court denied this motion on the ground that hawk had not shown that his interests were inadequately represented by class counsel.with the exception of the first factor,which relates to the timeliness of the intervention and is reviewed for abuse of discretion,we review de novo the denial of an intervention of right.see nissei sangyo,at.however,it is clear that the district court based much of its determination regarding this issue on its assessment of hawk testimony,a finding to which we owe deference.see rush martin petersen,cir regarding factual finding,deference given to district judge who had the opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand,to assess their credibility and weigh their testimony.the district court determined that hawk had failed to articulate reasons as to why he was not represented adequately by class counsel.
ample evidence exists to support the district court conclusion that hawk could not demonstrate why he was represented inadequately in this action.although both of his motions to intervene argue that the settlement terms were unfair,hawk showed a lack of familiarity with the content of those terms.he did not know when he was required to decide to opt out of the settlement,was unclear on the amount of attorneys fees sought by class counsel and pch counsel and he showed general unfamiliarity with the motions to intervene filed on his behalf.he thought,incorrectly,that to receive a refund under the settlement he must return the actual magazines that he had purchased from pch also worrisome was hawk ignorance of the terms of the injunctive relief contained in the settlement.when asked whether he had any concept of what pch is willing to do to change the message to customers,hawk replied no.tr at.lastly,when asked whether he had any basis,other than what selden had told him,to believe that class counsel was inadequately representing him in the suit,hawk again responded no.id.at.
moreover,although hawk indicated that he wanted to intervene to represent other members of the class,he could not articulate why he wished to do so.when asked by pch counsel what his basis for intervention was,the following exchange occurred 
q pch counsel what your basis for asking to represent other individuals in this lawsuit 
a hawk i do know.
q you do have a basis do you 
a i do know.
id.at.the district court was thus presented with a proposed intervenor in the lawsuit who could not explain his basis for wishing to intervene on behalf of other class members its determination that hawk could not meet rule a requirements was therefore well supported by the facts.
the district court also denied hawk request for permissive intervention under rule b.relevant factors to consider in ruling on a motion for permissive intervention include whether the request is timely and whether it would unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.see southmark cagan,cir.we shall reverse a denial of permissive intervention only if the district court abused its discretion.see keith,at.
for similar reasons to those supporting the denial of hawk intervention under rule a,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying permissive intervention in this matter.in light of its examination of hawk,the court ruling that his entry as a party would unduly delay and prejudice the adjudication of the lawsuit was eminently reasonable.
because hawk motion to intervene was properly denied,under the law of this circuit,he can not appeal the fairness of the settlement.see felzen andreas,cir,aff.by an equally divided court,california pub.employees ret.felzen,d.we have noted that,because only those who intervene in a class action may appeal such a settlement,it is vital that district courts freely allow the intervention of unnamed class members who object to proposed settlements and want an option to appeal an adverse decision.crawford equifax payment,cir.however,in this case,the district court was on solid ground in concluding that hawk real purpose in intervening was to conduct discovery,not to preserve his appellate rights regarding the fairness of the settlement.numerous times after the court denied hawk motions to intervene,it clarified that it did so because it believed hawk intention was solely to gain access to documents.the court repeatedly emphasized that it did not intend to deny class members the right to intervene to protect their appellate rights.when reminded of this point at the fairness hearing and asked if he still wished to intervene,selden replied that he was at a loss as to what such intervention would accomplish.tr at.
given the chance,repeatedly,hawk attorneys never moved to intervene to protect hawk appellate rights as a result,the district court was entitled to believe that hawk motions to intervene were for the primary purpose of obtaining discovery of the settlement negotiations.
discovery of settlement negotiations in a case such as this one is difficult to obtain because of the potential for undermining the settlement process.see mars steel continental.bank trust of chicago,cir.it is only proper where the party seeking it lays a foundation by adducing from other sources evidence indicating that the settlement may be collusive.id.hawk claimed that collusion existed between class counsel and pch counsel,due primarily to the close time frame between the amendment of vollmer complaint to allege federal claims and the agreement to the settlement and the lack of meaningful adversarial discovery undertaken before settlement.at.the timing of a settlement in relation to the start of litigation is an important indicator in determining whether collusion occurred.see mars steel,at noting timing as an important factor and finding no suggestion of collusion when settlement reached less than a year after suit filed by party to settlement white national football league,collusion not suggested when settlement occurred after five and years of frequently acrimonious litigation.the initial suit in this case against pch and afp was filed well over a year before the settlement,and class counsel investigation of the claims surrounding this suit began in although settlement negotiations were ongoing during much of the period after the lawsuit was brought,class counsel efforts demonstrate a zealous representation of the class interests,sufficient to prevent any inference of collusion with pch.
in sum,therefore,the district court was correct in characterizing hawk motions to intervene as attempts to gain discovery,not motions seeking to maintain his right to appeal.it was also correct in denying those motions.moreover,the court repeatedly gave hawk the chance to protect his right to appeal,an approach counseled by our decision in crawford,at,but hawk failed to do so.as a result,hawk can not now appeal the merits of the settlement.nevertheless,we note that hawk did have the opportunity to present his objections at the fairness hearing and also presented them to this court in his appellate briefs.we believe that his substantive objections,even if they were properly before us,would not merit a disruption of the settlement in this case.
rule sanctions 
rule provides that if an attorney presents a motion to a court for any improper purpose,such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation,monetary sanctions may be imposed.see.b c.the district court found that selden and rosenthal encouraged hawk to intervene for such purposes,solely to enable themselves to receive a fee as part of this litigation.as a result,the court imposed monetary sanctions on its own initiative under rule c b,requiring selden and rosenthal to pay to a local charity.we review all aspects of the district court decision to impose rule sanctions for abuse of discretion.see cooter gell hartmarx,d independent lift truck builders union nacco materials handling group,cir.
the record certainly contains some evidence to support the district court determination to impose sanctions on selden and rosenthal.hawk marked unfamiliarity with basic components of the settlement supports the court finding that he was put forward by his attorneys solely to enable them to collect fees in this action.on its own,hawk testimony and the circumstances surrounding it would provide sufficient justification for the imposition of rule sanctions.
the district court,however,also took into account the nature of selden and rosenthal legal practice in deciding to impose sanctions and in determining the amount of the fine.in doing so,it appeared to consider not only information provided by class counsel regarding selden and rosenthal past actions but also information about the attorneys that the court gathered in ex parte conversations.this latter source was suggested when the district court maintained that it had made it the court business to find out all i can about selden and rosenthal legal practice and that i have been able to find anyone anywhere that say these are recognized class counsel.tr at.
rule was designed to ensure due process and to give the potentially offending party a full and fair opportunity to respond and show cause before sanctions are imposed.divane krull,cir see also,advisory committee notes amendments noting that when court acts on own initiative under rule c b,a show cause order must be granted to provide the person with notice and an opportunity to respond johnson waddell reed,cir.in reviewing this sanction,we must be able to look to information in the record that justifies the imposition of sanctions articulated by the district court.see pacific dunlop holdings,barosh,cir.additionally,although not all ex parte contacts by the district court are prohibited,if they render it impossible for the district court to fairly consider a plaintiff arguments,or are not made a matter of record in the case and do not provide an opportunity for a plaintiff to respond to them,those contacts threaten that plaintiff due process rights.see simer rios,cir see also blumenfeld stuppi,n cir.
the district court was permitted to consider selden and rosenthal past conduct in fashioning rule sanctions,as the decision to impose such sanctions and their form may be influenced by consideration of a party past misconduct.see,advisory committee notes amendments noting that in deciding whether to impose a sanction or what sanctions would be appropriate,factors to consider include whether conduct was part of a pattern of activity or whether the person has engaged in similar conduct in other litigation pope federal exp,cir lockheed martin energy,slavin,see also cheek doe,cir per curiam considering past improper conduct as relevant factor in rule fee determination.however,rule and our case law also mandate that this evidence must be stated with some specificity in the record,and the offending party must be given a full and fair opportunity to respond to the charges.here,there is evidence suggesting that the district court,in considering information regarding selden and rosenthal reputation or past conduct,utilized sources not disclosed to the attorneys or presented in the record.use of such information to fashion a rule sanction would be inappropriate 
adding to our concern in this regard,the sanction is extremely large,as compared to other rule sua sponte sanctions that this court has reviewed.see,powers duckworth,wl,at cir upholding sua sponte sanction burda ecker,cir reducing sua sponte sanction
