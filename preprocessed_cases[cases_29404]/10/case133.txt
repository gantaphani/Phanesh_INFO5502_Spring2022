plaintiffs,drivers in the greater new york city area,brought this action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,asserting claims against defendants,owners of base licenses and affiliated entities,pursuant to the fair labor standards act flsa,et,and the new york state labor law nyll,lab.law et,for,inter alia,unpaid overtime.the district court furman,judge,after conditionally certifying a collective action under the flsa,granted defendants motion for summary judgment on both the flsa and nyll claims as to both the named and plaintiffs,concluding that as a matter of law,plaintiffs are properly classified as independent contractors rather than employees for purposes of both statutes.saleem.transp,supp.we agree with the district court that,even when the historical facts and the relevant factors are viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,they constitute independent contractors for flsa purposes as a matter of law barfield health hosps,cir.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
plaintiffs are drivers in the area who owned or operated franchises and were affiliated with defendants six defendants collectively,franchisor defendants each own a base license that allows them to operate a dispatch base in new york city,and to sell franchises to individual drivers see c.the remaining three defendants are various incarnations of the corporate transportation group collectively,ctg,which provides administrative support for the operation of the franchisor defendants dispatch bases as well as for other vehicle enterprises by handling,inter alia,billing,referral,payment,bookkeeping,accounting,voucher processing,and dispatching the franchisor defendants and ctg operate out of a single facility in brooklyn and constitute a single integrated enterprise joint employer for the purposes of the flsa.joint appendix.among the approximately people employed in ctg dispatch unit at the time relevant here,were in billing,six or seven were in customer service,five were in driver relations,and at least two were in sales there were roughly black cars affiliated with the franchisor defendants dispatch bases and operating under the ctg umbrella.ctg clients were primarily corporate entities,such as deutsche bank and bank of america.
the named plaintiffs rented or purchased their franchises directly from the franchisor defendants or,in some cases,from other franchisees plaintiffs who rented franchises paid to per week,while plaintiffs who purchased their franchises directly from a franchisor defendant did so pursuant to franchise agreements,which required them to pay franchise fees ranging from a nominal amount or even nothing to as much as.the franchise agreements also required franchisees to pay additional fees,some upfront and some recurring,which varied from agreement to agreement.for example,in exchange for a high upfront fee,platinum franchises offered by certain franchisor defendants provided for a significantly lower voucher processing fee the percentage of a fare charged to a driver for payment processing than their free gold franchises.see.franchisees also had to obtain a new york city taxi limousine commission tlc license,insurance,and a vehicle which they were responsible for maintaining.
plaintiffs franchise agreements describe the nature of the relationship between franchisor and franchisee as follows 
franchisee is not an employee or agent of franchisor,but merely a subscriber to the services offered by franchisor.franchisee shall at all times be free from the control or direction of franchisor in the operation of franchisee business,and franchisor shall not control,supervise or direct the services to be performed by franchisee.
each franchise agreement also contains a provision which prohibited drivers from driving ctg customers without processing payment for such services through ctg.failure to comply with this and other terms was grounds for termination of the franchise.significantly,however,the franchise agreements did not prohibit drivers from transporting customers for a competitor company,or independently,during their affiliation with ctg 
the franchise agreements also required that drivers comply with rulebooks manuals setting out certain standards of conduct specific to each franchisor defendant the rulebooks forbid,for instance,harassing customers or other drivers and submitting fraudulent vouchers.the rulebooks also include a dress code,which required drivers to dress neatly in specified business attire,as well as guidelines for keeping vehicles clean.drivers were not required to wear a uniform,however,or to mark their cars with insignia denoting an affiliation with the defendants.
the rulebooks were enforced by each franchisor defendant security committee,each of which was composed entirely of drivers who served elected terms.security committees could hold hearings on complaints and suspected violations.if a security committee determined that a driver had broken a rule,it could impose a monetary penalty on the driver,temporarily suspend the driver,or even terminate the driver franchise agreement.although it is undisputed that drivers elected the members of the security committees,the parties dispute whether ctg exercised influence over the committees.
during their affiliation with the defendants,plaintiffs,like other drivers in the ctg network,possessed considerable autonomy in their affairs.drivers could,for example,choose among three principal ways of securing fares for driving ctg customers.first,they could wait in a physical queue of cars outside certain ctg clients businesses.second,they could elect to drive under a ctg contract with the new york city metropolitan transport authority mta,transporting by prearrangement clients who were unable to travel via public transportation third,drivers could access ctg proprietary dispatch system,through which ctg transmitted requests for service from servers in a dispatch room to an application app on drivers smart phones in all three cases,clients provided vouchers to the driver transporting them in lieu of cash payment,and these vouchers were thereafter processed by ctg.
drivers also determined when and how often to drive,and the record reflects that they worked vastly different amounts of time,without providing any notice to defendants plaintiffs likewise chose which area in which to work,and they were at liberty to and did accept or decline jobs that were offered significantly,plaintiffs also could and did drive for dispatch bases other than the one with which they were affiliated,and they were thus free to shift as they chose during the workday from one dispatch service to another.most of the named plaintiffs drove for other companies regularly,and some earned substantial sums as a result some drivers also transported and were paid directly by customers with whom they had made individual arrangements,and others,though it was contrary to tlc regulations,see a,picked up street hails 
although ctg negotiated rates with its clients,supplied the proprietary dispatch technology,and operated the dispatch system,the record suggests that plaintiffs took home the majority in some cases up to of each ctg fare,less some small additional fees.on this basis,plaintiffs classified themselves as independent contractors on their tax returns and took substantial business deductions.
ii.procedural history 
on november,plaintiffs mazhar saleem and jagjit singh filed a complaint in district court,seeking to recover unpaid overtime and other wages under the flsa and the nyll on behalf of a class of similarly situated drivers.on june,the district court conditionally certified a collective action pursuant to section b of the flsa,b,and approved a notice to be sent to potential plaintiffs.the court subsequently denied class certification of their nyll claims,a determination not before us on appeal.saleem.transp,civ.jmf,wl,at.
on september,judge furman granted defendants motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment as to both the named plaintiffs and those plaintiffs who had opted into the collective action.saleem,supp.at.in concluding that defendants were entitled to summary judgment because plaintiffs were not,as a matter of law,employees of defendants for flsa purposes,the district court applied the five factors enumerated by this court in brock superior care,cir,analyzing each factor individually and considering whether the totality of the circumstances suggested that plaintiffs were employees or independent contractors,saleem,supp.at.the district court concluded that n otwithstanding that the final superior care factor,the degree to which employees are integral to a business,favors employment status,w eighing all of the superior care factors and considering the totality of the circumstances,the drivers here fall into the independent contractor category as a matter of law.id.
on january,plaintiffs timely appealed.
discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,and we will affirm only if the evidence,when viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom it was entered,demonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that judgment was warranted as a matter of law.barfield,at see also delaney bank of am,cir.here,we examine the district court conclusion that,as a matter of law,plaintiffs are properly classified as independent contractors rather than employees for purposes of the flsa.saleem,supp.at.we begin,then,with a brief explication of our case law,as is relevant to this distinction.
the flsa defines an employee as any individual employed by an employer.e.an entity employs an individual under the flsa if it suffer s or permit s that individual to work.zheng liberty apparel,cir.alterations in original quoting g see also d defining employer as any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of any employer in relation to an employee.in light of the definition circularity,courts have endeavored to distinguish between employees and independent contractors based on factors crafted to shed light on the underlying economic reality of the relationship as the district court recognized,this court has focused on the totality of the circumstances in addressing our ultimate concern whether,as a matter of economic reality,the workers depend upon someone else business for the opportunity to render service or are in business for themselves.superior care,at see also goldberg whitaker house,e conomic reality rather than technical concepts is to be the test of employment.quoting united states silk,bartels birmingham,e mployees are those who as a matter of economic reality are dependent upon the business to which they render service.
our case law has identified certain factors,first set out in silk,at,as relevant to separating employees from independent contractors in the context of the flsa see superior care,at.nevertheless,t hese factors are merely aids to analysis,thibault bellsouth,cir,and are helpful only insofar as they elucidate the economic reality of the arrangement at issue,superior care,at.relevant flsa precedent,despite endorsing the silk factors,cautions against their mechanical application.id.as we stated in barfield new york city health hospitals,at,t he determination of whether an relationship exists for purposes of the flsa should be grounded in economic reality rather than technical concepts,determined by reference not to isolated factors but rather upon the circumstances of the whole activity,citation omitted first quoting goldberg,at,and then quoting rutherford food mccomb,thus,while the following discussion draws upon and discusses the silk factors where relevant,it trains on the ultimate question the economic reality of plaintiffs relationship with ctg.
upon de novo review,even when the historical facts and the relevant factors are viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,id.at,and despite the broad sweep of the flsa definition of employee,darden,at,the record here does not permit the conclusion that plaintiffs were employees,but instead establishes that they were in business for themselves.as discussed below,plaintiffs independently determined the manner and extent of their affiliation with ctg whether to work exclusively for ctg accounts or provide rides for ctg rivals clients develop business of their own the degree to which they would invest in their driving businesses and when,where,and how regularly to provide rides for ctg clients.while none of these facts is determinative on its own,considered as a whole with the goal of discerning the underlying economic reality of the relationship here,the district court correctly determined that plaintiffs are,as a matter of law,properly classified as independent contractors rather than employees for purposes of the flsa.saleem,supp.at.as a result,defendants were properly granted summary judgment.
affiliation with ctg 
from the start,plaintiffs were who made significant decisions regarding the operation of their small businesses.silk,at.plaintiffs chose not only to enter into a franchise agreement with a ctg franchisor defendant instead of seeking more conventional employment,but also exercised considerable discretion in choosing the nature and parameters of that affiliation.some plaintiffs elected to purchase a franchise,either directly from a franchisor defendant or on the secondary market,while others opted to rent one.further,because the franchise agreements contained different terms,and particularly because there was wide variation in both the price of the franchises and the fees associated with using them,plaintiffs had to strike a balance between a franchise upfront cost and the favorability of its terms,a choice which ultimately affected its profitability.
the franchise agreements termination provisions also are indicative of plaintiffs independence.while plaintiffs could reassess their choice to affiliate with ctg not to mention the nature of that affiliation and terminate the franchise agreements as they pleased saleem,supp.at,the terms of the agreements committed the franchisor defendants to maintaining them for substantial durations,or even indefinitely,absent plaintiffs breach of those terms.because plaintiffs were free to drive for competitors,for personal clients,or not at all without violating their franchise agreements,the termination provisions constituted a significant restriction on the ability of franchisor defendants to exercise control.
in addition,each of plaintiffs agreements also designated them as independent contractors,and some plaintiffs formed corporations to operate their franchises.though an employer label of workers as independent contractors is not controlling,superior care,at see also thibault,at noting that contractual designation of the worker as an independent contractor is not necessarily controlling emphasis added,such a designation in the franchise agreement is pertinent to the parties beliefs about the nature of the relationship,estate of suskovich anthem health plans of,cir.see also johnson city of saline,cir.observing,in ada case,that the contractual relationship reads unmistakably as one with an independent contractor as opposed to one with an employee thus,in the language of the silk factors,plaintiffs demonstrated independence and initiative in selecting franchise agreements that best fit their business plans,and in choosing independent of franchisor defendants to persist in those affiliations,all of which suggests,in the circumstances of this case,that plaintiffs were in business for themselves.superior care,at.
entrepreneurial opportunities 
the fact that plaintiffs could and did work for ctg business rivals and transport personal clients while simultaneously maintaining their franchises without consequence suggests,in two respects,that ctg exercised minimal control over plaintiffs.first,on its face,a company relinquishes control over its workers when it permits them to work for its competitors.second,when an individual is able to draw income through work for others,he is less economically dependent on his putative employer.this lack of control,while not dispositive,weighs in favor of independent contractor status.see,keller miri microsystems llc,cir.if a worker has multiple jobs for different companies,then that weighs in favor of finding that the worker is an independent contractor.herman express delivery,cir.noting fact that t he drivers can work for other courier delivery systems supported independent contractor status kirsch fleet street,cir.affirming finding of independent contractor status when,inter alia,the worker was allowed to sell merchandise on behalf of other companies see also freund satellite,app x,cir.per curiam affirming district court finding that worker ability to take jobs from competitors,and to take as many or as few jobs as he desired,supported district court conclusion that there was not a significant degree of permanence in the relationship at issue,baker flint eng g constr,cir.stating that,generally speaking,e mployees usually work for only one employer and such relationship is continuous and indefinite in duration quoting dole snell,cir.
more specifically,plaintiffs here operated business organization s that could or did shift as a unit from one to another,suggesting defendants did not exercise significant control.rutherford food mccomb.neither plaintiffs franchise agreements nor tlc regulations barred plaintiffs from either providing rides arranged through dispatch bases other than the franchisor defendant with whom they had affiliated,or from driving for other,competing companies the agreements likewise did not prohibit plaintiffs from driving clients of their own provided that payment by any ctg client was processed through the ctg system,or from picking up street hails though doing so was forbidden by tlc rules.
to be clear,pursuant to the economic reality test,it is not what plaintiffs could have done that counts,but as a matter of economic reality what they actually do that is dispositive.brock v.w fireworks,cir.it is undisputed,however,that plaintiffs here actually did provide rides to clients in at least three different ways.
first,many plaintiffs provided rides by driving for competing companies.tax returns demonstrate that plaintiffs derived substantial revenue from this practice.ranjit bhullar,for instance,earned driving for exec.charge between and,and malook singh earned driving for elite between and.indeed,some of deposed plaintiffs earned at least some income by driving for companies.
second,it is undisputed that some plaintiffs regularly drove personal clients.anjum ali,for example,had a repeat,customer who first hailed him in and later arranged for in various places in new york city by calling ali at his home number jose solorzano,for his part,also had one personal client for eight to ten years and avneet koura was contacted directly o nce or twice a week by repeat personal clients between and.plaintiffs made investments to build these relationships,too.some created business cards describing their services,while others placed advertisements 
third,for the sake of completeness,many plaintiffs also picked up passengers via street hail,despite tlc apparently prohibition of this practice.see.in fact,one driver admitted doing so while logged in to the ctg app and waiting in the dispatch queue.as with individual,clients,street hail passengers paid in cash or via independent merchant accounts,rather than through the ctg voucher system.
moreover,these alternate means of generating revenue aside,plaintiffs also wielded considerable independence and discretion when working under ctg umbrella.to offer rides to ctg clients,plaintiffs could join a physical queue outside of a high volume client business,offer assistance to disabled customers seeking prearranged rides pursuant to ctg contract with the mta,or book into ctg dispatch system.further,some plaintiffs who owned franchises chose not to drive at all and,instead of letting their franchises lie dormant,permitted other individuals to drive for them see silk,at observing that practice of hir ing their own helpers supported finding of independent contractor status.
accordingly,far from a circumstance,like that in superior care,where the individuals seeking employee classification depended entirely on the putative employer referrals to find job assignments,at,plaintiffs here possessed considerable independence in maximizing their income through a variety of means.by toggling back and forth between different car companies and personal clients,and by deciding how best to obtain business from ctg clients,drivers profits increased through the ir initiative,judgment,or foresight all attributes of the typical independent contractor.keller,at quoting rutherford,at.whatever control ctg exerted over negotiated fares and its rolls of institutional clients,plaintiffs retained viable economic status that could be and was traded to other car companies.usery,at.thus,as a matter of economic reality,plaintiffs affiliation with defendants was but one means by which they generated income from their driving businesses.
investment and return 
regardless whether they actually purchased a franchise,the record also shows that plaintiffs invested heavily in their driving businesses another indication that they were in business for themselves.superior care,at.in the economic reality test,large capital expenditures as opposed to negligible items,or labor itself are highly relevant to determining whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor.dole,at see also id.at deeming annual investment of in tools or equipment to be negligible berger transfer storage cent.states,se.sw.areas pension,cir.affirming finding of independent contractor status under common law agency test in part because t he were responsible for purchasing and maintaining the leased equipment,and paying operating expenses such as fuel and repairs.in assessing such expenditures,we ask whether the alleged employee made financial commitments in an attempt to generate a return on investment.dole,at see,silk,at affirming independent contractor status when they,inter alia,own ed their trucks.here,plaintiffs indisputably did.
in disclosures to the new york state attorney general,each franchisor defendant presented an estimated initial investment to be expected in acquiring a franchise.see.one franchisor defendant estimated expenses for an individual purchasing a franchise as totaling between and.such sums constitute a substantial financial outlay on plaintiffs part,even beyond the purchase or rental of the franchise itself,and in essential facets of plaintiffs business operations vehicle acquisition fuel,repair,and maintenance,license,registration,and insurance fees,and tolls,parking,and tickets.ctg did not provide reimbursements for these expenses never mind for discretionary investment in business cards,advertising,or other ventures designed to attract customers.
because plaintiffs were free under their franchise agreements to branch out on their own,or to drive for other,competing companies,the degree to which these expenditures yielded returns was a function not only of ctg network,but also of the business acumen of each plaintiff,who thus had significant control over essential determinants of profits in the business.dole,at.further,while plaintiffs ultimately all chose to affiliate with the franchisor defendants,their investments were valuable and likely necessary even had they chosen to affiliate with a different dispatch base.thus,plaintiffs expenditures created the platform for a business that could be operated throughout the area,whether for defendants or otherwise,again suggesting plaintiffs were independent contractors,and not employees.
schedule flexibility 
the ability to choose how much to work also weighs in favor of independent contractor status.see herman,at arena plandome taxi,cv drh wdw,wl,at,noting fact that transportation company dictated the hours the drivers worked supported employee status arena delux transp,supp,noting fact that defendants had little control over when plaintiff drove,how much he dr o ve,or how frequently very persuasive ly supported independent contractor status.berger transfer storage,at affirming finding of independent contractor status based in part on considerable autonomy regarding when and how long they would work under common law agency test.here,plaintiffs schedules were not merely relatively flexible,doty elias,cir.emphasis added,but rather were entirely of their making.
after purchasing or leasing a franchise and securing a suitable vehicle,plaintiffs set their own schedules,selecting when,where,and how often to work if at all.defendants provided no incentive structure for plaintiffs to drive at certain times,on particular days,or in specific locations,leaving the decision to work to the whims and choices of its drivers.dole,at.likewise,defendants required no notice on the part of drivers as to when they intended to work,nor did they make any effort to coordinate drivers schedules.
here,as always with the economic reality inquiry,it is not merely that plaintiffs nominally could set their own schedules,but also that they actually did so.id.at.some plaintiffs took vacations for weeks at a time without ever notifying defendants.anjum ali,for example,took five weeks off to travel abroad,and regularly took off long weekends.mazhar saleem took a month vacation in and vacationed for over two months in.jose cabrera t ook the entire year of off from driving for defendants,and resumed doing so in.
on the days when plaintiffs did work,their hours varied again,based on their own preferences,and without defendants making any attempt to coordinate schedules or set lower or upper limits on working hours.dole,at holding that workers were employees because they did not act autonomously,or with any degree of independence which would set them apart from what one would consider normal employee status.jagjit singh sometimes worked as many as fifteen to sixteen hours a day,while anjum ali would typically log in from until approximately midnight.others drove on a far more sporadic basis.
plaintiffs also exercised considerable discretion in choosing when and where to drive.superior care,at.marlene pinedo,for instance,explained that she drove f rom sunday to friday b ecause those are the days when there is the most work.pinedo made a similar calculation when determining the times of day during which she would drive,performing two separate shifts,to and to,because they used to give good jobs at those times.anjum ali,on the other hand,preferred to drive in the evenings in part because,with friends driving at the same time,he could count on them if he needed help.similarly and predictably drivers often selected a geographic zone based on the available jobs there,and record testimony indicates that certain zones in manhattan were more active than others 
additionally,the record demonstrates that,as a matter of economic reality,plaintiffs accepted and rejected despite the penalty of being placed at the end of the queue varying numbers of job offers,a fact indicative of the discretion and independence associated with independent contractor status.berger transfer storage,at affirming district court finding that it was indicative of independent contractor status that truckers could and did refuse assignments without penalty herman,at noting that couriers could reject job offers without retaliation in making the same determination.for example,in march,bhavesh shah accepted jobs,jamshed choudhry accepted,and jose solorzano accepted fifteen.likewise,from may to may,ranjit bhullar rejected job offers,while wilman martinez rejected none 
plaintiffs flexible work schedules and considerable control over when,where,and in what circumstances to accept a ctg fare not surprisingly resulted in wide disparities in gross earnings for rides provided through defendants for example,while jagjit singh grossed more than in and,anjum ali earned between and a year from through.these differences only underscore the economic reality,namely that the work force was composed of individuals who came and went as they alone pleased,dole,at,an undisputed fact that is all the more remarkable given the nature of the business.
in the language of the silk factors,these undisputed facts demonstrate that defendants did not exercise control,and that plaintiffs demonstrated initiative.superior care,at.they also show that,whatever the permanence or duration of plaintiffs affiliation with defendants,id.at,both its length and the regularity of work was entirely of plaintiffs choosing,keller,at we may look at the length and regularity of the working relationship between the parties in assessing the nature of their relationship.
these circumstances are readily distinguishable from those in which courts have identified an relation.in superior care,for instance,the employer limited working hours to per week where nurses claimed they were owed overtime,at,and in reich circle investments,the employer exercise d a great deal of control over the plaintiffs,who were required to comply with weekly work schedules,cir.in dole snell,the plaintiff schedules were totally controlled by their employer they were expected to arrive at the premises at a particular hour,prevented from leaving until they had decorated all the cakes to their bosses satisfaction,and required to seek their employer approval for vacation.at.in short,t he demands of the business controlled the workers schedule,which was indisputably not the case for plaintiffs here.
instead,this case resembles those in which we and other circuits have recognized independent contractor status.in kirsch fleet street,for example,we upheld a jury finding that the plaintiff was an independent contractor when,inter alia,he was not required to spend time in the company offices and was free to set his own schedule and take vacations when he wished.at.likewise,in herman express delivery service,the fifth circuit concluded that a courier service had minimal control over its drivers such that they were independent contractors because,inter alia,t he drivers set their own hours and days of work.at.similarly here,plaintiffs freedom in choosing when,where,and with what regularity to drive ctg clients shows the extent of their economic independence that they operated their business organization s on their own terms,and as they saw fit.rutherford,at.
in sum,plaintiff drivers exercised their business acumen in choosing the manner and extent of their affiliation with ctg were able to work for rival services,cultivate their own clients,and pick up street hails made substantial investments in their businesses and determined when,where,and how regularly to work.they owned or operated enterprises which were flexible and adaptable to market conditions.in short,based on the record here,t hese were small businessmen.silk,at.
plaintiffs,for their part,rely on record evidence that they contend shows that defendants exercised control over drivers,so as to make them economically dependent on ctg.such evidence,plaintiffs contend,creates a genuine issue as to whether defendants exercised control over drivers such that they constituted employees pursuant to the flsa.see anderson liberty lobby.we disagree.only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.id.here,the evidence on which plaintiffs rely does not change the economic reality of their business relationship with defendants.superior care,at.
plaintiffs marshal evidence principally in support of two propositions.first,they argue that the record shows that defendants exercised control over all significant aspects of its black car business.appellant br.plaintiffs point,inter alia,to ctg roll of organizational clients,its development and operation of the dispatch system,and the fact that ctg negotiated rates with clients and charged a fee to drivers.second,in plaintiffs telling,defendants exerted influence over drivers by enforcing the rulebooks indirectly through the security committees and,at times,directly through eduard slinin,ctg president.
neither proposition,even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,changes the analysis.while defendants did exercise direct control over certain aspects of the ctg enterprise,they wielded virtually no influence over other essential components of the business,including when,where,in what capacity,and with what frequency plaintiffs would drive.a ccepting that defendants engaged in some monitoring and discipline with respect to rulebook standards does not alter this picture.saleem,supp.at.while it may reflect a degree of control over plaintiffs conduct,here,as in herman,the opportunity for profit and loss was determined by the drivers to a greater degree than it was by defendants.at.drivers decided with which dispatch base to affiliate even among those integrated with ctg,whether to purchase or rent franchises,and,once affiliated,how to go about their work.they could and did provide rides in three separate ways for ctg,for multiple car services concurrently,for independent,personal clients,and through street hails albeit in contravention of tlc rules.in short,the economic reality was that plaintiffs,with the assistance of ctg and as a subscriber to its services,operated like small businesses they decided to affiliate with defendants based on their perceived economic interests,and not those of ctg.
to be clear,we note in conclusion the narrow compass of our decision.specifically,we do not here determine that it is irrelevant to the flsa inquiry that the defendants provided plaintiffs with a client base,that defendants charged fees when plaintiffs utilized defendants referral system,or that defendants had some involvement,if limited,in rule enforcement among franchisees.we conclude only that assessing the totality of the circumstances here in light of each silk factor,undisputed evidence makes clear as a matter of law that these plaintiffs were not employees of these defendants.in a different case,and with a different record,an entity that exercised similar control over clients,fees,and rules enforcement in ways analogous to the defendants here might well constitute an employer within the meaning of the flsa.plaintiffs here,however,have raised no material issue to this effect.the district court therefore properly found them to be independent contractors as a matter of law.
conclusion 
we have considered plaintiffs remaining contentions and find them to be without merit.for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
although plaintiffs appealed from the district court september,grant of summary judgment as to their flsa and nyll claims,plaintiffs briefs on appeal make no mention of the nyll,and instead focus exclusively on the flsa.accordingly,we deem plaintiffs nyll claims waived for purposes of this appeal.see hughes bricklayers allied craftworkers local,cir.
except as otherwise noted,the following facts are undisputed.

notably,some drivers of vehicles neither owned nor rented a franchise,but instead drove for other drivers who themselves owned or rented a franchise.
while tlc regulations require that drivers be affiliated with one,and only one,dispatch base,h i,they may legally accept work from another dispatch base provided certain disclosures are made to the customer,see e.
the parties dispute ctg role in formulating the rules contained within the rulebooks.
during the period relevant to this litigation,drivers desiring mta work informed ctg of the block of time and the zone in which they wished to work on a given day,and ctg computerized dispatch system matched the drivers with available assignments.notably,because the mta paid less for jobs under its contract with ctg than many of ctg other accounts did as set forth below,ctg was not always able to provide sufficient drivers,notwithstanding its relationship with plaintiffs and other drivers.on such occasions,ctg reached out to other companies for assistance.
drivers signaled their availability to work by consulting the smart phone app which permitted them to see both how many jobs were available and how many other affiliated drivers were operating in particular zones in the city,choosing a zone,and booking into it.
jagjit singh,for instance,testified that he worked seven days a week,sometimes as much as to hours a day,while anjum ali typically worked about eight hours a day,from around until approximately midnight.
when a driver logged in to the dispatch system,he saw how many jobs were available and how many other drivers were booked into each zone in new york city.the driver then decided which zone to book into.having chosen a zone,the driver was placed at the end of a virtual queue,where he waited until a work offer appeared on his phone.once an offer appeared,the driver had seconds to accept or decline the job.if the driver rejected the job,he would be booked out of the app for five minutes and,after booking in again,placed at the end of the queue.after accepting a job,the driver received the pickup address,passenger name,destination,rate of the fare,and the ctg account number associated with the passenger.even with this information in hand,however,the driver could bail out,decline to complete the job.after a bailout,the driver was not permitted to log into the dispatch system for one to three a driver picked up a client,he was free to choose the route to that client destination.when the driver completed the trip,he asked the customer to sign a voucher.the driver then dropped off the voucher at ctg facility in brooklyn at his or her convenience there appears to have been no time limit and ctg processed vouchers daily,weekly,or every three weeks,according to the driver preference.
ranjit bhullar,for instance,earned driving for exec.charge from to,and malook singh earned driving for elite from to.
drivers generally collected payment for such services themselves,sometimes through accounts established with credit card merchant companies.the record indicates that some plaintiffs earned significant sums in this way one driver,for instance,processed over through a credit card merchant service account in an period.
the district court also rejected plaintiffs claim that the drivers were employees within the meaning of the nyll.because the factors for determining whether an individual is an employee under the nyll are similar to the superior care factors,the court referred to much of its flsa analysis in concluding that all five nyll factors favor independent contractor status.saleem,supp.at.this part of the ruling,concerning whether plaintiffs constitute employees under the nyll,is not at issue in the present appeal.
the supreme court has noted that the flsa stretches the meaning of employee to cover some parties who might not qualify as such under a strict application of traditional agency law principles.nationwide mut.ins.darden.
