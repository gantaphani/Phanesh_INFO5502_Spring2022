we previously accepted maytag corporation petition for permission to appeal,pursuant to the class action fairness act cafa,stat.codified in scattered sections of,from the district court order granting leslie miedema motion to remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.on appeal,maytag contends that the district court erred by placing the burden of proving subject matter jurisdiction on maytag and resolving all doubts in favor of remand.maytag further objects that,even if it did have this burden,the district court applied too high a standard of proof with respect to cafa amount in controversy requirement.finally,maytag claims that the district court erroneously relied upon a amended complaint in reaching its decision.after careful review of the record and the briefs,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
in october of,leslie miedema filed a class action suit against maytag in florida state court,alleging that various designed and manufactured by maytag contained a defective motorized door latch assembly that allowed heat to escape and damage other components.specifically,miedema pleaded that she brought her action on behalf of herself and all other similarly situated consumers of maytag that incorporate the defective motorized door latch assembly,as a statewide class action,pursuant to.civ.b or b.she included in the putative class a ll purchasers of maytag,in the state of florida,bearing certain model numbers,and stated her belief that there were thousands of members of the class.miedema asserted causes of action for negligence,breach of express warranty,and violation of florida deceptive and unfair trade practices act,demanding compensatory damages,pre and interest,costs,and any and all such further relief to which she is entitled.
within a month of being served with miedema complaint,maytag filed a notice of removal in federal district court,invoking,and.according to maytag,the class action was removable under cafa because miedema and maytag were of diverse citizenship,the putative class consisted of thousands of floridians,and the amount in controversy exceeded,in the aggregate.see d,a,b.in support of its claim regarding the amount in controversy,maytag submitted a declaration by its information analyst jodi jarrett.jarrett declared that she had researched those models identified in miedema description of the putative class,that a total of bearing the alleged model numbers had been sold in florida,and that the total value of those was.
miedema responded by moving to remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.she argued that maytag had the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence,and that maytag had failed to carry that burden with respect to the amount in controversy.for example,miedema stated,jarrett declaration did not specify whether each of the sold incorporated the allegedly defective motorized door latch assembly at issue,what maytag meant by total value,or how that total value was calculated.maytag opposed the motion to remand,arguing,among other things,that any vagueness in its determination of the amount in controversy was due to the breadth of miedema complaint.the district court,noting the existence of disagreement among courts as to which party bears the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction under cafa,ordered additional briefing on the issue,as well as on whether the requisite amount in controversy had been established.miedema then proceeded to depose jodi jarrett,and submitted this deposition as additional evidence of maytag failure to establish that more than was in controversy.
after receiving the parties additional submissions,the district court issued an order granting miedema motion to remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction the district court adhered to the traditional rule in the cafa context that a removing defendant bears the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction.the court then determined that maytag did not satisfy that burden,finding that the jarrett declaration and deposition were flawed in this regard.although miedema also contributed to the uncertainty surrounding the amount in controversy,the court noted,it must ultimately resolve all doubts in favor of remand.we granted maytag subsequent petition for permission to appeal the remand order,see c,and now reach the merits of that appeal.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court decision to remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.evans walter,wl,at cir.may,see c notwithstanding d,court of appeals may review remand order where case was removed under cafa.
iii.discussion 
cafa review of remand.application rule 
the cafa permits a court of appeals to accept an application to appeal if the application is made to the court of appeals not less than days after entry of the district court order granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the state court from which it was removed.c emphasis added.several circuits have declined to read the not less than language literally,concluding that it was a typographical error,or that such a reading would be illogical.see pritchett office depot,cir the statute should read that an appeal is permissible if filed not more than seven days after entry of the remand order.amalgamated transit union local,laidlaw transit,cir following pritchett and also excluding,in calculating the period,intermediate weekends and holidays under fed.a patterson dean morris,cir.while we have not addressed this issue directly,it is clear that we did not read c literally in evans,where we stated that c provides for an application to the court of appeals within days of the district court remand order.evans,at,wl,at emphasis added.we now reaffirm that construction of c,for to read it literally would produce an absurd result there would be a waiting period an application filed days after entry of a remand order would be premature,but there would be no limit an application filed days after entry of a remand order would not be untimely.when applying the plain and ordinary meaning of statutory language produces a result that is not just unwise but is clearly absurd,another principle comes into the picture.that principle is the venerable one that statutory language should not be applied literally if doing so would produce an absurd result.merritt dillard paper,cir.here,the district court remand order was entered on april.maytag filed its petition for permission to appeal,its application with the circuit clerk on april,days later,when the intervening weekend is excluded under fed.a.accordingly,there was no violation of c when we granted maytag petition.
review limit 
the cafa requires us to complete all action on this appeal,including rendering judgment,not later than days after the date on which such appeal was filed,unless an extension is granted c in granting maytag petition for permission to appeal,we directed the parties to address the question of whether the period is measured from the date the petition is filed,or instead is measured from the date of entry of this order.evans,however,has now decided that issue,holding that the period begins to run from the date when the court of appeals granted the appellants application to appeal and thus filed the appeal.at,wl,at.we granted maytag petition for permission to appeal on april.thus,so long as our ruling on this appeal is issued within days of that date assuming no extension is granted,our ruling is timely.
burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction 
the cafa authorizes removal of a class action in accordance with without regard to whether any defendant is a citizen of the state in which the action is brought,except that such action may be removed by any defendant without the consent of all defendants.b.a class action includes a civil action which,like miedema,is filed under a state rule of judicial procedure authorizing an action to be brought by or more representative persons as a class action.id.d.under cafa,federal courts have original jurisdiction over class actions in which the amount in controversy exceeds and there is minimal diversity at least one plaint
