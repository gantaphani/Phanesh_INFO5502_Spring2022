this case invokes the old adage that the sum is greater than the parts.national elevator industry pension fund national elevator,lead plaintiff on behalf of investors who purchased verifone holdings,verifone stock between august,and april,appeals the dismissal of its securities fraud class action.national elevator alleged that verifone,douglas bergeron the company chief executive officer and former chairman of the board of directors,and barry zwarenstein the company former chief financial officer and executive vice president,violated b,a,and of the securities exchange act of and securities and exchange commission rule b in connection with a december restatement of financial results 
in three consecutive quarters,verifone preliminary internal reports accurately showed it had fallen short of its earnings and gross margins projections.three consecutive times,verifone ceo and cfo supervised accounting staff as they made baseless adjustments that brought reported results in line with expectations.each time,the ceo and cfo accepted the adjustments without question,representing publicly that a recent merger was driving the company success even as the adjustments grew in size and negatively impacted key metrics.national elevator characterizes the conduct as either intentionally directing a subordinate to make false adjustments or being deliberately reckless in failing to question and account for unsupported entries.in contrast,verifone paints itself as the victim of a difficult acquisition complicated by incompatible systems.
the district court dismissed national elevator third amended complaint for failure to sufficiently allege scienter as to each of the defendants.viewed in isolation,any one allegation may not compel an inference of scienter.however,when we consider the allegations holistically,as the supreme court directed in matrixx initiatives,siracusano,the inference that bergeron,zwarenstein,and verifone were deliberately reckless as to the truth of their financial reports and related public statements is at least as compelling as any opposing inference.id.citing tellabs,makor issues rights.we reverse in part and affirm in part.national elevator adequately pleaded its b,and rule b claims.it did not sufficiently plead its a claims,which the district court properly dismissed.
background 
verifone,based in san jose,california,engages in the design,marketing and service of transaction automation systems,including devices that enable secure electronic payments among consumers,merchants,and financial institutions.its main customers include global financial institutions,payment processors,large retailers,government organizations,and healthcare companies.in november,verifone acquired lipman electronic engineering lipman,an developer,manufacturer,and seller of electronic payment systems and software,and began integrating the two companies.
verifone touted the merger as likely to improve its financial condition,increasing its pro forma gross margin expectations from to.however,in the five quarters prior to the merger,verifone own gross margins had never exceeded lipman had just dropped to after five years of declines and were skewed towards areas.national elevator alleges that defendants were aware of these facts and knew that their representations of increasing gross margins of up to during the class period had no reasonable basis.
in the three quarters following the merger the first three quarters of verifone fiscal,referred to as,and,verifone reported gross margins of,and,respectively,allowing the company to claim the merger was an immediate success.it is undisputed that these reports were false.
in each quarter,verifone initial internal financial reports known as flash reports painted a different,accurate picture,in which verifone gross margins were well short of its projections.national elevator alleges that bergeron and zwarenstein characterized these results as an unmitigated disaster and directed company management to figure it out and fix the problem.the fixes focused on accounting decisions,not operations.zwarenstein and bergeron gave verifone supply chain controller,paul periolat,analyses of the shortfalls and suggested accounting adjustments,but their figures apparently had no basis other than verifone desire to meet market expectations.nonetheless,periolat made the adjustments,enabling verifone to report results in line with its projections.
national elevator alleges that these manipulations were deliberate and pervasive and done for the specific purpose of meeting public guidance and were made possible by verifone lack of appropriate internal controls.in march,verifone auditors ernst young e y raised concerns about inventory controls,requesting that verifone add further measures to address inaccuracies in inventory counts and other deficiencies.verifone told e y it was addressing the issues,but,as it turns out,any remedial measures did not prevent financial misstatements.instead,the company continued to and inflate inventory even though bergeron,who received internal reports showing a sharp and unprecedented increase in inventory as a result of periolat adjustments had earlier stated that reducing inventory was as important as any goal we set in the past.
in accordance with accepted standards,e y did not audit verifone quarterly reports during fiscal year,relying instead on the accuracy of information from zwarenstein and periolat.when e y did audit verifone annual financials in november and periolat was unable to explain his adjustments,the accounting irregularities came to light.
on december,verifone announced that its consolidated financial statements for,and should not be relied upon due to errors in accounting related to the valuation of inventory and allocation of manufacturing and distribution overhead to inventory.this restatement resulted in reductions to net revenue of approximately million,million,and million in the respective quarters.those revenue reductions,in turn,resulted in reductions to previously reported income approximately million with a net loss of,million,and million.cumulatively,operating income for the three quarters fell from million to million,reflecting an overstatement of.gross margins were accordingly reduced from,and to,and.national elevator further alleges that verifone overstated earnings per share by,and.
on the day of the restatement,verifone shares dropped over,falling from to.the next day,the first of nine securities fraud class actions was filed in the district court.the cases were consolidated pursuant to the private securities litigation reform act pslra,with national elevator designated as lead plaintiff.
national elevator first amended complaint,which was dismissed for failure to adequately plead scienter,advanced six allegations of fraud committed by bergeron and zwarenstein.in a second amended complaint,verifone,atkinson,bondy,and periolat were added as defendants.the second amended complaint relied on a securities and exchange commission complaint the sec complaint filed in september.the sec complaint charged verifone and periolat with books and records violations.before the district court ruled on verifone motion to dismiss the second amended complaint,national elevator filed its third amended complaint adding new allegations based on transcripts of sec investigatory interviews with verifone executives and employees.for ease of reference,the complaint at issue in this appeal the third amended complaint is simply referred to as the complaint.
the district court concluded that national elevator allegations failed to raise a strong inference of scienter with respect to any of the defendants and granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice.in reaching this conclusion,the district court grouped individual allegations by topic and discussed their sufficiency.after determining that the allegations associated with each grouping were insufficient to establish scienter,the district court engaged in a holistic analysis,stating that t here are many allegations in this case,but they fare no better when read in combination than when read independently.national elevator appeals the dismissal with respect to bergeron,zwarenstein,and verifone.
ii.pleading requirements 
in our de novo review of the district court grant of the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b and for failure to allege fraud with particularity under rule b,we pay particular attention to the heightened pleading requirements for securities fraud cases.these requirements present no small hurdle for the securities fraud plaintiff.a securities fraud complaint under b and rule must satisfy the dual pleading requisites of federal rule of civil procedure b and the pslra.zucco partners,llc digimarc,cir.under rule b,claims alleging fraud are subject to a heightened pleading requirement,which requires that a party state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.b.the pslra mandates that the complaint shall specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,and the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading b b.the pslra further provides that the complaint state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.s.b a.
to satisfy the requisite state of mind element,a complaint must allege that the defendant made false or misleading statements either intentionally or with deliberate recklessness.zucco,at citation omitted.facts showing mere recklessness or a motive to commit fraud and opportunity to do so provide some reasonable inference of intent,but are not sufficient to establish a strong inference of deliberate recklessness.in re silicon graphics.sec,cir,abrogated on other grounds by south ferry lp,killinger,cir.
the falsity of verifone financial reports is undisputed.the only issue on appeal is whether national elevator allegations were sufficient to create a strong inference of scienter.
tellabs and scienter 
in tellabs,the supreme court clarified the appropriate inquiry for determining whether a plaintiff allegations are sufficient as to scienter,stating that t he strong inference standard unequivocally raise d the bar for pleading scienter.tellabs,at first alteration added.under this analysis,a court must first accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true.id.at.the court then must consider the complaint in its entirety,as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on rule b motions to dismiss,in particular,documents incorporated into the complaint by reference.id.the relevant inquiry is whether all of the facts alleged,taken collectively,give rise to a strong inference of scienter,not whether any individual allegation,scrutinized in isolation,meets that standard.id.at emphasis in original see also new mexico state inv.council ernst young llp,cir.
in determining whether the pleaded facts give rise to a strong inference of scienter,the court must take into account plausible opposing inferences.tellabs,at.thus,t he strength of an inference can not be decided in a vacuum and a court must consider plausible,nonculpable explanations for the defendant conduct,as well as inferences favoring the plaintiff.id.at.under the proper analysis,a complaint will survive only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.id.at emphasis added.
scienter can be established by intent,knowledge,or certain levels of recklessness.sec platform wireless int l,cir.we adopted the following standard in hollinger titan capital,cir en banc 
r eckless conduct may be defined as a highly unreasonable omission,involving not merely simple,or even inexcusable negligence,but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,and which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it t he danger of misleading buyers must be actually known or so obvious that any reasonable man would be legally bound as knowing,and the omission must derive from something more egregious than even white head good faith.
first alteration in original emphasis added citations omitted.scienter requires either deliberate recklessness or conscious recklessness a form of intent rather than a greater degree of negligence.platform wireless,at.we have also clarified that although we may consider the objective unreasonableness of the defendant conduct to raise an inference of scienter,the ultimate question is whether the defendant knew his or her statements were false,or was consciously reckless as to their truth or falsity.gebhart sec,cir.
holistic analysis under matrixx 
in matrixx,the supreme court reiterated that courts must review all the allegations holistically when determining whether scienter has been sufficiently pled.matrixx.at quoting tellabs,at.other than this general directive,the court did not prescribe a particular analysis that a court must undertake,nor did it purport to alter the scienter analysis previously articulated in tellabs.see id.a complaint adequately pleads scienter under the pslra only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.quoting tellabs,at.
prior to matrixx,we adhered to a dual inquiry in which 
first,the court will determine whether any of the plaintiff allegations,standing alone,are sufficient to create a strong inference of scienter and second,if no individual allegations are sufficient,the court will conduct a holistic review of the same allegations to determine whether the insufficient allegations combine to create a strong inference of intentional conduct or deliberate recklessness.
zucco,at.matrixx on its face does not preclude this approach and we have consistently characterized this or dual inquiry as following from the court directive in tellabs.see id.in cases where an individual allegation meets the scienter pleading requirement,whether we employ a dual analysis is most likely surplusage because the individual and the holistic analyses yield the same conclusion.also,as a practical matter,some grouping and discussion of individualized allegations may be appropriate during a holistic analysis.
our cases have employed varied approaches some discuss first the sufficiency of specific allegations and then conduct a holistic review,while others conduct only a holistic analysis.compare wpp luxembourg gamma three sarl spot runner,cir providing a brief summary of plaintiffs allegations and defendants arguments and concluding that,taken as a whole,plaintiffs complaint sufficiently alleged fraudulent intent with new mexico state,at examining first plaintiffs specific allegations and then briefly surmising that the allegations were sufficient under a holistic analysis.other circuits have also used both approaches.see generally in re level commc ns.sec,cir assessing allegations holistically and then analyzing relevant individual allegations saltz first frontier,wl,at cir.june,analyzing allegations individually,though noting tellabs requirement for collective consideration findwhat investor grp,cir v iewing all of the plaintiffs allegations in concert,the complaint contains no allegations from which we can infer that anyone in the company management knew or must have known about the fraud ashland,oppenheimer,cir explaining that district court analysis was not proper but concluding on holistic basis that competing inferences were more compelling.
in cases where courts have undertaken a dual analysis,a brief statement that the court has also viewed the claims holistically has been sufficient to meet the demands of matrixx.see,new mexico state,at.because the court in matrixx did not mandate a particular approach,a dual analysis remains permissible so long as it does not unduly focus on the weakness of individual allegations to the exclusion of the whole picture.the risk,of course,is that a piecemeal analysis will obscure a holistic view.frank dana,cir holding that former method of reviewing each allegation before reviewing them holistically risks losing the forest for the trees and that such a method is unnecessarily inefficient.to avoid potential pitfalls that may arise from conducting a dual analysis,we approach this case through a holistic review of the allegations to determine whether they combine to create a strong inference of intentional conduct or deliberate recklessness.in doing so,however,we do not simply ignore the individual allegations and the inferences drawn from them.
the district court here did not err as a matter of law by first engaging in an individualized discussion of the complaint allegations and then summarily concluding that in combination the allegations did not sufficiently allege scienter.the court error lies in its undue discounting of the claims and the conclusion that an inference of deliberate recklessness was not warranted.
iii.exchange act section b and sec rule claims 
section b of the exchange act makes it unlawful for any person t o use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe as necessary or for the protection of investors.b.sec rule implements this provision by making it unlawful to,among other things,make any untrue statement of material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.matrixx.at quoting b b.the rule also makes it unlawful for any person t o employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud or t o engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.b a,c.national elevator alleges that zwarenstein,bergeron,and,by extension,verifone violated each subsection of rule.
summary of allegations 
the complaint pleads intentional or deliberately reckless conduct on the basis of a host of allegations.a summary of these allegations follows.although our ultimate analysis is holistic,it would be folly to simply skirt the major allegations.
according to verifone executives,verifone gross margin was one of the most important financial measures of the company overall financial condition.defendants touted the company gross margin in every major earnings press release,conference call and sec filing and acknowledged that they closely monitored gross margins.national elevator alleges that zwarenstein and bergeron knew the merger would put downward pressure on margins,noting that they emailed each other expressing concern about their projections regarding gross margins.nonetheless,defendants were determined to show the market that the lipman merger was an immediate and unqualified success.
national elevator further alleges that investors and analysts were troubled by verifone increased projections,and verifone knew it had to deliver gross margins and earnings to convince investors that the lipman merger was a success and would drive future growth.verifone thus had sufficient motive to manipulate its actual gross margin percentages 
repeated accounting manipulations 
each of the three restated quarters followed the same pattern.just after,internal flash reports showed verifone gross margins at approximately,far off the company projections and market expectations.although certain documents and testimony from verifone executives revealed that flash reports typically contained inaccuracies and required revision,prior preliminary reports had not reflected such a drastic difference from initial projections.
bergeron and zwarenstein viewed these results as unacceptable and oversaw the company efforts to remedy the situation,providing accounting staff with dollar figures and particular adjustments that would bring results in line with projections.their efforts included monitoring of specific adjustments and their impact on earnings and margins.even though zwarenstein and bergeron knew in each quarter the adjustments were unusually high in fact,inventory adjustments increased in magnitude each quarter,they recklessly failed to question or demand supporting documentation for them.significantly,their communications did not reflect concern with operational issues that might have been driving margins down their priority was the financial statements and publicly reported results.
at the end of,bergeron and zwarenstein received internal flash reports indicating that the actual gross margins were,markedly lower than the verifone had estimated for the quarter.at least with respect to,the gap between the preliminary flash reports and the initial gross margin forecast was one of the bigger ones,if not the biggest gap verifone had ever seen.zwarenstein emailed periolat directly,saying that it would be an unmitigated disaster if cogs cost of goods sold are truly what is in the flash report.bergeron sent an email to zwarenstein that week saying,we need to get to cents in earnings.figure it out.when zwarenstein replied can i speak to you bergeron responded you should wait until i cool down,use the time to figure out how we get to cents.bergeron had a history of putting accounting staff under pressure already that quarter he had advocated against a more stringent revenue recognition policy,telling zwarenstein that if we need to be a bit aggressive on accounting to hit verifone revenue target,do it.
zwarenstein repeatedly emailed periolat the week after the end of,providing him with the specific dollar amounts necessary to hit targets we are still off by versus the forecasting.is there an error in there somewhere however,the email traffic does not reflect a search for errors.instead,periolat emailed verifone controller merkl to say that we have to put a million plug into direct material,which according to merkl meant that an unsupported million entry was required for verifone to hit its goals.the next day,zwarenstein circulated a revised flash report to bergeron and others showing that verifone had met its projections,saying,i needed to reduce cogs by million to get to what i think is cents,as bergeron had insisted.zwarenstein later concluded that even larger revisions were required to hit projections those increases were incorporated into periolat adjustments.the adjustments were without basis and were reversed during the restatement.
national elevator acknowledges that zwarenstein communicated to verifone staff that the company accounting had to comply with generally accepted accounting principles gaap,though it states without support that this directive was a cover.merkl testimony before the sec also indicated that zwarenstein would not have directed periolat to falsify numbers and that the company was attempting to determine the true cause of the discrepancy.however genuine these instructions and inquiries were,zwarenstein and bergeron did not concern themselves with the accuracy of or basis for the manual accounting adjustments.during,they received weekly reports on cogs and margins and specifically monitored how inventory costs impacted company financials.bergeron had also committed to reducing inventory and making the company supply chain a profit center.yet,when periolat adjustment increased inventory by millions of dollars,they neither objected nor inquired further,and in fact repeated this silence in the coming quarters even as inventory manipulations grew in size.this complacency can be described only as willful at this stage of the pleadings.
verifone flash reports for showed a gross margin of which,as with the prior quarter,was significantly lower than the guidance provided to investors.although they received reports during the quarter that margins would likely deteriorate,bergeron and zwarenstein rejected these initial reports and instructed accounting staff,including periolat,to determine the source of the discrepancy.zwarenstein worked directly with periolat and personally reviewed periolat adjustments,even directing their timing.periolat fixed the problem by preparing a journal entry that increased shipped from lipman to verifone but not yet received inventory by million and decreased cogs by the same amount.there was no basis for this adjustment because goods were never actually shipped between the international headquarters and the united states.after checking with a subordinate,periolat gave his calculations to another subordinate to prepare a manual journal voucher that was used to make manual adjustments to verifone corporate records.periolat signed the vouchers as a reviewer,despite the fact that he made the initial calculations.
national elevator claims as to that bergeron and zwarenstein deliberately concealed these manipulations from investors.specifically,when asked by analysts during a conference call if there were any unusual items that caused verifone to report such high gross margins,zwarenstein falsely replied,no,there was sic no unusual items.whether he truly believed the company results,zwarenstein at least knew at the time of the substantial accounting adjustments and that the company inventory levels were unusual.
the third quarter of proved no different.after it appeared that business pressures might drive margins down,initial reports came in significantly lower than verifone projections.zwarenstein realized that to meet the gross margin target,verifone would need to reduce cogs by approximately million,resulting in a corresponding increase in inventory,which would end up at approximately million.he had never seen an inventory projection quite that high zwarenstein and periolat discussed specific adjustments over email,including an million of receiving inventory and a million increase in in transit inventory,totaling million.national elevator notes that bergeron,who focused on inventory levels,admitted that verifone had been less than perfect in its ability to manage inventory levels.despite awareness of the inventory management problems,and that for the third straight quarter periolat adjustments had increased company inventories by millions,zwarenstein and bergeron accepted periolat manual adjustments without question or without conducting a separate review.again,periolat adjustments had no legitimate basis.
the sec complaint 
the sec complaint incorporated into national elevator complaint focuses primarily on verifone and on periolat,who national elevator has dismissed from its appeal of the district court order although the complaint makes no direct allegation that anyone knew that periolat accounting adjustments were false at the time they were made,it alleges that there was no reasonable basis for any of periolat manual entries,which relied on an unfounded assumption that goods were in transit between verifone international headquarters and the united states.the sec also alleges that for each of the three quarters,no one reviewed periolat work during the quarter closing process.senior management was aware of his adjustments but never questioned them senior management simply assumed the preliminary actual results were wrong when they differed from the forecasts.in fact,according to the sec,senior management never questioned the increases despite monthly reports showing a sharp and unprecedented increase in inventory as a result of periolat adjustments.
the errors did not come to light until the annual audit in november,at which time periolat concluded that his adjustments were wrong and reported the problem to senior management.the sec complaint suggests that because bergeron and zwarenstein did not ask about the basis for periolat manual adjustments,they were not actually aware that the adjustments were erroneous until november.the december press release announcing the need for a restatement followed shortly thereafter.
verifone sarbanes oxley certifications 
as part of verifone form q filings,bergeron and zwarenstein certified that,as ceo and cfo,they carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of verifone disclosure controls and procedures and b ased on that evaluation concluded that verifone disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.in compliance with sarbanes oxley,bergeron and zwarenstein also signed sworn certifications to each form q indicating,among other things,that they d isclosed any change that has materially affected,or is reasonably likely to materially affect,verifone internal control over financial reporting and disclosed a ll significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect verifone ability to record,process,summarize and report financial information.
national elevator alleges that the disarray caused by the lipman integration and prior awareness of lost or missing inventory sufficiently evinces that zwarenstein and bergeron were aware of problems related to verifone internal controls.statements from two confidential witnesses suggest there were significant inventory problems at the facility where much if not all of the lipman inventory was eventually transferred,although the timing of their employment does not directly coincide with the time at which the accounting adjustments were made.
national elevator also references a march,letter from e y informing verifone audit committee and management regarding verifone control deficiency by stating that entire pallets of inventory were missed,part numbers were wrong and incomplete boxes were being counted as full.internal quotation marks omitted.according to the complaint,e y then asked verifone to add further measures to validate the correctness of the counts performed,and the verifone board represented to e y that it was enhancing its training materials and also taking additional steps to identify and remove the poor performers.internal quotation marks omitted.the complaint acknowledges that verifone took certain remedial measures,but alleges that these measures were insufficient because they did not have any material impact in preventing verifone false financial reporting.the complaint further alleges that these inventory control deficiencies enabled periolat to enter the incorrect manual adjustments that allowed verifone to hit its targets.national elevator also notes that in disclosures and press communications issued after bergeron and zwarenstein certified the sec filings,verifone admitted numerous material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting throughout.
sufficiency of the allegations 
while the pslra significantly altered pleading requirements in private securities fraud litigation,in re daou systems,cir,it did not impose an insurmountable standard.it may well be the case that,as the district court concluded,the complaint does not establish or create a strong inference that anyone at verifone,including periolat,actually knew that the manual adjustments were improper.however,that was not the only permissible inference.recklessly turning a blind eye to impropriety is equally culpable conduct under rule.
national elevator allegations,viewed holistically,give rise to a strong inference that bergeron,zwarenstein and verifone were deliberately reckless to the truth or falsity of their statements regarding verifone financial results,particularly gross margin percentages.this inference is cogent and equally as compelling as the competing inference that verifone was simply overwhelmed with integrating a large new division into its existing business.zucco,at.the difficulty of the lipman integration combined with general downward pressure on gross margins makes zwarenstein and bergeron claims that they innocently relied on the company optimistic models and projections implausible at best.see frank dana,cir finding that it was difficult to grasp the thought that the top two executives who reported gangbuster earnings really had no idea that their company was headed towards bankruptcy given their knowledge of operational problems and industry difficulties.an inference of scienter is more compelling in light of bergeron and zwarenstein public statements celebrating the merger as an unprecedented success,particularly those early statements touting the merged entity supposed financial transparency.
in three consecutive quarters,bergeron and zwarenstein rec
