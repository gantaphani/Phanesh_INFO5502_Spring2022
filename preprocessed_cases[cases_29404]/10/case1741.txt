in this action for violation of california unfair competition law bus,et and related counts,plaintiffs craig seastrom and gary hutcheson appeal an order denying their motion to certify a class consisting of all persons who purchased a version of the product biogevity that contained human growth hormone hgh,which the defendants illegally sold without a prescription.seastrom and hutcheson challenge the trial court findings that since they were distributors of biogevity and profited from the sale of the product,their claims are not typical of those of other class members and they would not adequately represent the class.we find no abuse of discretion and affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
between approximately march and april,defendant neways,manufactured and distributed an oral spray called biogevity,which contained hgh,known as somatropin or somatotropin neways promoted biogevity as an dietary supplement.hgh can not legally be sold without a prescription,and neways did not require prescriptions.
in a pyramid sales scheme,neways contracted with independent distributors to distribute biogevity.distributors could purchase the various formulations of biogevity for between and per bottle,and the suggested resale price was to.distributors were entitled to keep the difference between the wholesale and retail prices on products they sold directly,and to commissions on the sale of products by distributors under them in the pyramid scheme.
in december hutcheson,under the business name seed sowers,entered into a distribution agreement with neways.in march a business called october dynamics,owned by seastrom and his wife,entered into a distribution agreement with neways.october dynamics earned at least in commissions from neways and obtained the level of diamond ambassador,and hutcheson earned at least in commissions from neways.hutcheson and october dynamics,directly or indirectly,sold thousands of bottles of neways product,totaling more than and,respectively.hutcheson had more than distributors in his pyramid downline.
before distributing biogevity for neways,both seastrom and hutcheson distributed a nasal spray that contained hgh for a company named quantum leap.while with quantum leap hutcheson read a book on the effects of hgh,after which he believed hgh was a great thing and something that baby boomers would love.while at quantum leap seastrom also read a book about the benefits of hgh supplementation.the texas attorney general investigated quantum leap for its sale of hgh products without prescriptions,and it ceased doing business in approximately march.
when neways introduced biogevity at a convention in february,hutcheson realized it had the same formula as the product he distributed for quantum leap.hutcheson was excited because this oral spray hgh product with the polymer matrix that i was taught all about at quantum leap shows up at neways.
the united states attorney office investigated neways sale of biogevity without prescriptions.in september neways pleaded guilty to knowingly selling approximately bottles of a product that contained hgh in violation of title united states code section e,and to criminal forfeiture under sections e and a.neways stipulated to a fine of and the forfeiture of million,the profits it made from the sale of biogevity.the government agreed not to prosecute neways distributors.
this action began in june when marc lewis sued neways for unfair competition.lewis had never purchased biogevity and his claim was eliminated after proposition amended the standing requirements of unfair competition law.other plaintiffs filed first and second amended complaints,but those plaintiffs withdrew.seastrom and hutcheson were added in a third amended complaint,and in may they filed a fourth amended complaint,which is at issue here,for fraud,breach of contract,rescission and violation of business and professions code section et.the fourth amended complaint hereafter complaint prays for reimbursement or restitution of the purchase price of biogevity and punitive damages for fraud.
seastrom and hutcheson then moved for certification of a class consisting of all persons who purchased biogevity containing somatropin or an analogue thereof.the court denied the motion,finding their claims are not typical of those of other class members,and they would not adequately represent the class.
discussion 
class actions serve an important function in our judicial system.by establishing a technique whereby the claims of many individuals can be resolved at the same time,the class suit both eliminates the possibility of repetitious litigation and provides small claimants with a method of obtaining redress.richmond dart industries,cal d.however,because group action has the potential to create injustice,trial courts are required to carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts.linder thrifty oil cal th,d.
the party seeking certification as a class representative must establish the existence of an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members.citation.the community of interest requirement embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.richmond dart industries,supra,cal d at,see also code civ.
because trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action,they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification i n the absence of other error,a trial court ruling supported by substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous legal assumptions were made citation.citation.under this standard,an order based upon improper criteria or incorrect assumptions calls for reversal even though there may be substantial evidence to support the court order.citations.accordingly,we must examine the trial court reasons for denying class certification.any valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th at,d.
in denying class certification,the court found seastrom and hutcheson did not demonstrate their claims are typical of the class,or that they would adequately and fairly represent the class.the court was concerned with how high they were up in the pyramid at neways and the possible ramifications of that,and what was their involvement with quantum leap and the possible ramifications of that.the court elaborated that if i certify a class with these two class representatives and defendant showed that they were high in the pyramid,made a lot of money in the pyramid,knew of the requirement for a prescription for the product that,to me,is the vulnerability or potential vulnerability of these two prospective representatives.seastrom and hutcheson counsel acknowledged that if they were class representatives,they would testify at trial and be subject to on their positions in the neways hierarchy and their prior experience at quantum leap.
the court was also concerned seastrom and hutcheson may not have suffered any compensable damage,as they profited on their distribution of biogevity.further,the court pointed out that seastrom and hutcheson had acknowledged in their depositions that they were potentially subject to civil claims by buyers downstream of them on the distribution line,and that was some concern to them.
the court properly exercised its discretion.named representatives will not fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class when there are conflicts of interest between them and the class they seek to represent.janik rudy,exelrod zieff th,d.it is axiomatic that a putative representative can not adequately protect the class if his interests are antagonistic to or in conflict with the objectives of those he purports to represent.richmond dart industries,supra,cal d at.
given that seastrom and hutcheson are potential defendants in the proposed class action,they have an in
