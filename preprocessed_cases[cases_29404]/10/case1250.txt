petitioners carlos navarro and belem carolina navarro the navarros moved the board of immigration appeals bia to reopen their deportation proceedings on the basis that they qualified for the benefits of the ashcroft,d ii,class action settlement that settlement allows certain eligible aliens to apply for suspension of deportation under the less stringent immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,stat,as amended by,stat,continuous physical presence standard.id.at.the bia found that the navarros did not qualify for relief and denied their motion to reopen.the navarros now seek our review of the bia order.we have jurisdiction and,for the reasons that follow,grant the navarros petition for review.
background 
because this case requires us to interpret the settlement and to determine whether the navarros qualify for its benefits,we begin with a discussion of the events that gave rise to the settlement followed by a discussion of the settlement itself.
i.the history of the settlement 
before iirira took effect on april,an alien against whom deportation proceedings had been commenced could apply for suspension of deportation,if,among other things,she had been continuously physically present in the united states for seven years.see ashcroft,cir citing repealed.under the statutory regime,an alien in deportation proceedings continued to accrue time toward satisfying the residency requirement during the pendency of her immigration proceedings.see id.at.the regime set no limit on the number of applications for suspension of deportation that the attorney general could grant.see a repealed.
relevant here,iirira contained a provision which provided that an alien stopped accruing time toward the residency requirement when she was served with a notice to appear or an order to show cause osc the equivalent.see,at.iirira also provided that the attorney general was limited to granting applications for suspension of deportation per fiscal year.see e.both changes applied to all applications for suspension of deportation pending at the time of iirira april,effective date.see reno,cir i.
as iirira effective date drew,by february,attorney general executive office for immigration review had already granted approximately applications for suspension of deportation that fiscal year.see id.chief immigration judge ij michael creppy was concerned that the number of suspension applications granted might exceed iirira statutory application cap.see id.accordingly,on february,chief ij creppy directed that all ijs reserve decision on any suspension of deportation application on which the ij intended to grant suspension of deportation,or to make such grants conditional on the number of applications already granted.see id.the bia also stopped processing appeals in which a grant of suspension of deportation relief might result.see id.
in march of,several aliens who were eligible for suspension of deportation under law,but whose applications would be denied under iirira,sought and won preliminary injunctive class relief that prevented ijs and the bia from implementing chief ij creppy directive.see id.at.we upheld that preliminary injunction on appeal.see id.at.
in december,the district court for the northern district of california approved a settlement between attorney general john ashcroft and the class of aliens who had been adversely affected by chief ij creppy directive or its bia equivalent.see ii,d at reproducing settlement agreement.the settlement permitted certain eligible aliens to apply for renewed suspension of deportation under the rules.see id.at.
included among those eligible for relief,according to the settlement,were individuals for whom the immigration judge scheduled a merits hearing on a suspension application between february,and april,and the hearing was continued until after april,ii,d at.the settlement also required the bia to reopen cases where it had denied an application for suspension of deportation based solely on iirira section c.id.at 
ii.the navarros petition for review 
the navarros,brother and sister,are natives and citizens of mexico.they entered the united states without inspection on november,and have since remained.
on october,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued an osc,charging the navarros as deportable under section a b of the immigration and nationality act ina,a b,because they entered the united states without inspection.they were ordered to appear before an ij.
after several pro se appearances and continuances,the navarros appeared with counsel for their deportation hearing on march.they conceded deportability and indicated that they wished to apply for suspension of deportation.the ij asked both parties to submit a brief about whether rule in apply to the applications,and continued the navarros deportation hearing to april.after receiving testimony from the navarros and their mother on april,the ij denied their applications.the ij concluded that the rule applied as of april,date of the that,under the new rule,the navarros were unable to establish seven years of continuous physical presence prior to service of the oscs.
the navarros appealed to the bia.on november,the bia affirmed the ij decision in an unpublished order.on july,the navarros filed a motion asking the bia to reopen their cases on the basis that they were eligible for relief.the bia denied their motion,explaining that they did not qualify as members in the class.this petition for review followed.
jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction to review the bia determination of eligibility for benefits of the settlement.see sotelo gonzales,cir.
standard of review 
eligibility under is a question of law reviewed de novo.see id.our interpretation of the settlement agreement is governed by principles of california contract law.see id.
discussion 
i.the navarros are class members eligible for relief 
the settlement agreement defines class members eligible for relief as 
individuals for whom the immigration judge either reserved a decision,or scheduled a merits hearing on a suspension application under immigration and nationality act ina as such section existed in,before amendment by iirira,between february,and april,and the hearing was continued until after april,other than where all three of the following are present the continuance was at the request of the alien,the alien was represented by an attorney,and the transcript of the hearing was prepared following an appeal,and makes clear which party requested the continuance,and iv a decision was issued denying or pretermitting suspension based on iirira c,the appeal was filed,and the bia denied the appeal based on iirira c irrespective of whether further relief was pursued in federal court,or whether a motion to reopen was subsequently filed with the bia.
this definition can be broken down into two requirements first,the ij must have a either reserved a decision or scheduled a merits hearing on a suspension application between february,and april,and b continued the hearing until after april.second,the application for suspension must have been denied on the basis of the rule.the parties agree that the navarros applications for suspension of deportation were denied on the basis of the rule.consequently,the navarros satisfy the second requirement.both parts of the first requirement,however,require further analysis.
scheduled a merits hearing 
the parties disagree about what it means to say that the ij scheduled a merits hearing between february,and april.the navarros argue that the clause requires that the ij undertook the act of setting the hearing between february and april.the government,in contrast,argues that to meet this requirement,the ij must have scheduled the hearing to take place between february and april 
because the interpretation of this settlement agreement is governed by california contract law,see sotelo,at,we first determine whether the contract language is clear or ambiguous,see bank of the west superior court,cal th,d.if the contract language is clear,we give effect to its plain meaning.see id.
we believe that the settlement language is ambiguous in that it does not support unambiguously
