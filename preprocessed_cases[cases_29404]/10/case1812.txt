plaintiff eileen quacchia appeals after the trial court denied her motion for class certification.we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that common issues do not predominate in this action.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
certain vehicles manufactured by defendant daimlerchrysler corporation dcc contain a seat belt buckle known as the buckle.plaintiff,the owner of a dodge caravan equipped with buckles,brought this action,alleging the buckles were subject to accidental release at any time,especially in the event of a collision,because the release button sticks out above the outside cover.according to plaintiff,the defective buckles had been installed in numerous dcc vehicle models manufactured between and the present plaintiff sought to pursue this action on behalf of a class of all persons and entities in california who currently own or lease model year through vehicles manufactured or sold by dcc that contain buckles however,she excluded those that purchased dcc vehicles for resale,those who have suffered physical injury as a result of defective buckles,and those who had filed separate,nonclass legal actions based on the alleged defectiveness of buckles.
plaintiff complaint sets forth three causes of action.on behalf of herself and the california general public,she seeks injunctive relief and restitution under california unfair competition law ucl bus,et.on behalf of herself and the alleged class,she seeks injunctive relief and restitution under the ucl,and damages,injunctive relief,restitution,and punitive damages under the consumers legal remedies act clra,et.plaintiff moved for class certification of her second and third causes of action the trial court denied the motion,and this timely appeal ensued.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
because trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action,they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification.the denial of certification to an entire class is an appealable order citations,but in the absence of other error,a trial court ruling supported by substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous legal assumptions were made citation citation.under this standard,an order based upon improper criteria or incorrect assumptions calls for reversal even though there may be substantial evidence to support the court order.citations.accordingly,we must examine the trial court reasons for denying class certification.any valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.citation.linder thrifty oil cal th,d,linder see also washington mutual bank superior court cal th,d,washington mutual.in reviewing an order denying class certification,we consider only the reasons given by the trial court for the denial,and ignore any other grounds that might support denial.corbett superior court th,d corbett.
citing a number of cases,including nally grace community church cal d,plaintiff contends that the trial court must grant the motion for class certification if there is substantial evidence that the requirements of certification were met and must disregard any conflicting evidence or inferences.plaintiff then asks us to review the record de novo to determine whether the trial court carried out this task properly.while plaintiff correctly states she need only present substantial evidence of the class requirements lockheed martin superior court cal th,d,lockheed martin,there is no rule that conflicting evidence or inferences must be disregarded.the cases relied upon by plaintiff for this contention address the standard used for granting a nonsuit or a directed verdict they do not apply to class certification motions.
we reject plaintiff novel contention that,because c lass certification parallels nonsuit in many respects,the cited cases are controlling.a nonsuit cuts off a plaintiff right to obtain a determination of her claims by a jury.it can be granted only if the evidence favorable to plaintiff will not sustain a verdict as a matter of law.cossman daimlerchrysler th,d a motion for nonsuit concedes the truth of the facts proved,but denies as a matter of law that they sustain the plaintiff case.therefore,evidence that conflicts with the plaintiff theory of the case must be ignored by the trial court in ruling on a motion for nonsuit.ibid.in contrast,the grant or denial of a class certification motion is not a ruling on the merits of plaintiff claims,but only determines whether the case should proceed as an individual action or a class action.the question is whether plaintiff has presented substantial evidence of the class action requisites this is a discretionary determination to be made by the trial court.linder,supra,cal th at,d.nothing in the law prevents the court from considering the totality of the evidence in making that determination.washington mutual,supra,cal th at,d.if this were not the rule,plaintiff could pick and choose among the facts to present to the court,providing an incomplete picture of the litigable issues,in order to ensure a certification.

requisites for class certification 
a ucl claim may be certified as a class action where the requirements of code of civil procedure section are met.corbett,supra,th at,d.that statute authorizes class actions when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court.code civ.thus,t o obtain certification,a party must establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members.citations.the community of interest requirement involves three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.citation.linder,supra,cal th at,d.the party seeking class certification has the burden to establish the existence of an ascertainable class and a community of interest.richmond dart industries,cal d,norwest mortgage,superior court th,d.
the requirements of the clra are similar.the clra provides that the court shall allow a class action if all of the following conditions exist it is impracticable to bring all members of the class before the court.the questions of law or fact common to the class are substantially similar and predominate over the questions affecting the individual members.the claims or defenses of the representative plaintiffs are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.the representative plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class,subd.b see also linder,supra,cal th at,d.as particularly relevant here,both code of civil procedure section and the clra require a showing that common questions of law or fact predominate in order for class certification to be proper.
predominance of common issues 
the trial court found common issues did not predominate.before so finding,the court stated the court will not dwell on the distinctions among the three prongs of the ucl unfair,fraudulent and unlawful,the nine legal bases that support the unlawful prong of the ucl,and the three subsections of the clra.these distinctions ultimately boil down to whether the claim rests on a common law or federal defect in the product or the product failure to comply with.citing daly general motors cal d,daly,the court held that the alleged seat belt defect,as defined by common law,must be examined in the context of the overall effectiveness of the restraint systems in specific vehicles.because the belts had been installed in different vehicles over model years,and there was evidence that the location,shielding,and installation of the buckle all affect whether the buckle is subject to accidental release,the court concluded that t he numerous different contexts in which any defect would have to be determined preclude class certification of any claim based on a defect in the buckle.regarding plaintiff claim that dcc had violated the ucl by failing to disclose a defect in the buckle as defined in federal law the trial court relied on united states general motors corporation wheels to conclude that a component in a vehicle contains a defect only if it is subject to a significant number of failures in normal operation.this would require the trier of fact to look separately at the buckle installation and operation in each vehicle.therefore,according to the trial court,common issues did not predominate in the ucl claim.
the record contains evidence to support the trial court conclusion that the location,shielding,and installation of the buckle affect whether it is subject to accidental release.gary chapman,an engineer at dcc,stated in a declaration that buckle placement,orientation and accessibility vary among makes and models of dcc vehicles,and within the same vehicle model.different types of seats,armrests,consoles,buckle mounts and latch plates the plate that is inserted into the buckle to secure the passenger are available within the proposed class,among various years for the same vehicle models,as options for the same vehicle models,or in different seating positions in the same vehicle,and that equipment affects the placement and accessibility of the buckles.indeed,although plaintiff experts opined that the buckle was unsafe in any configuration,they also agreed that the likelihood of accidental release is determined in part by how accessible the buckle is.
plaintiff attempts to avoid this evidence by arguing that the trial court failed to consider her clra and ucl claims separately.as noted above,the ucl defines unfair competition in part as any unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent business act or practice.bus.plaintiff contends first that the trial court erred in concluding common issues did not predominate in her claim under the ucl unlawful prong.ibid.according to plaintiff,dcc acted unlawfully under the ucl by violating title united states code section c,which requires a manufacturer of a motor vehicle or replacement equipment to notify the secretary of transportation and the owners,purchasers and dealers of the vehicle or equipment if the manufacturer learns the vehicle or equipment contains a defect and decides in good faith that the defect is related to motor vehicle safety.plaintiff appears to be arguing that the safety of buckles should be evaluated in isolation from the vehicles in which they are installed.this position is undercut,however,by wheels,an enforcement action by the government under the former national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of et alleging the manufacturer violated the act by failing to issue defect notices on pickup truck wheels.wheels,supra,at fn.there,in interpreting title united states code former section the court concluded that in order to prove a violation of the act,the government would need to show a significant number of wheel failures resulting from operation of trucks and that the defect poses an unreasonable risk of accident,death,or injury.wheels,at fn.the court also noted that the same component may contain a defect in performance relating to motor vehicle safety in one class of vehicle or use but not in another.id.at,fn.
here,as discussed above,there is evidence that the risk of accidental release of buckles in the operation of dcc vehicles would vary from model to model,and from year to year.we see no abuse of discretion in the trial court conclusion that common issues do not predominate in plaintiff claim that dcc actions were unlawful under the ucl because they violated title united states code section c.
plaintiff second contention under the ucl unlawful prong,that dcc violated california common law against selling defective products,fares no better.as plaintiff recognizes,a product has a design defect if the risk of danger inherent in the challenged design outweighs the benefits of such design.barker lull engineering cal d.it is difficult to see how the risk of danger inherent in the design of the buckle,and any concomitant benefit,could be evaluated without reference to the vehicles in which it is placed,since the buckles are used only in connection with the use of the vehicles.given this predicate,there is ample evidence from which the trial court could reasonably conclude that issues common to the class would not predominate.
our conclusion is buttressed by our supreme court reasoning in daly,supra,cal d.there,the court considered whether a defect in a vehicle should be considered in light only of the allegedly defective component or of the product as a whole.the plaintiffs contended that an exposed push button on the exterior door handle,which caused the car door to open during an accident,constituted a product defect.id.at.plaintiffs challenged an instruction directing the jury to consider all of the vehicle safety equipment in determining whether or not it was defective.id.at.the supreme court stated the jury could properly determine whether the opel overall design,including safety features provided in the vehicle,made it crashworthy,thus rendering the vehicle nondefective.product designs do not evolve in a vacuum,but must reflect the realities of the market place,kitchen,highway,and shop.similarly,a product components are not developed in isolation,but as part of an integrated and interrelated whole the danger of piecemeal consideration of isolated components has been expressly recognized.citations.specifically,it has been observed that a design rendered safe in one situation may become more dangerous in others.citation.however phrased,these decisions emphasize the need to consider the product as an integrated whole.id.at.plaintiff downplays the importance of daly,pointing out that it was a products defect action,not a case under the clra or the ucl.however,in her briefing below,plaintiff acknowledged that her claims based on the unfair,unlawful,and fraudulent prongs of the ucl would all require proof of the same basic conduct by chrysler,which plaintiff characterized as the manufacture and sale of vehicles equipped with seat belt buckles that chrysler knew and concealed were defective.thus,even with respect to plaintiff ucl claim,daly provides support for the trial court conclusion that common issues will not predominate.
plaintiff also contends the trial court erroneously failed to consider her claim that dcc conduct violated the ucl prohibition against unfair and fraudulent business acts and practices separately from her claim that dcc actions were unlawful.bus.according to plaintiff,dcc acted unfairly and fraudulently by concealing from consumers the fact that it had thrown out a safety standard and by using a buckle that was not tested to the same safety standard as its other buckles plaintiff is correct that conduct can be unfair even if no other law prohibits the challenged conduct.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.in the context of consumer cases,unfairness is determined by weighing the utility of the practice against the gravity of the harm to the consumer.kunert mission financial services th,d.she is also correct that to state a claim under the ucl one need not plead and prove the elements of a tort.instead,one need only show that members of the public are likely to be deceived.bank of the west superior court cal th,d.however,we can not conclude the trial court erred in ruling that issues common to the class as a whole would
