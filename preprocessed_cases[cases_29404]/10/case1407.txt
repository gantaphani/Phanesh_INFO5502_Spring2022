appellants,plaintiffs in the underlying action,appeal the district court order decertifying their collective action alleging violations of the fair labor standards act flsa of,as amended,and severing the defendants,cagle,cagle and cagle foods jv,llc cfjv and its grant of summary judgment in favor of cfjv.having thoroughly reviewed the record and the parties briefs on appeal,and with the benefit of oral argument,we affirm the district court order decertifying the collective action and its grant of summary judgment in favor of cfjv.therefore,we need not and do not address the district court decision to sever the defendants.
background 
cagle and cfjv collectively the employers are engaged in the business of hatching,growing,slaughtering,and processing chickens for distribution and eventual consumption.during the relevant time period,cagle owned and operated multiple production facilities located in georgia and alabama.prior to the relevant time period,in,cagle partnered with executive holdings,to create cfjv for the purpose of operating a production facility in camilla,georgia,previously operated solely by cagle.
the plaintiffs in the underlying action,some of whom are not parties to this appeal,can be divided into four distinct groups three named plaintiffs who at the time the lawsuit was filed were employed or had been employed directly by cagle in the company macon,georgia,pine mountain valley,georgia,plants named cagle plaintiffs plaintiffs who at the time they joined the lawsuit were employed or had been employed directly by cagle in any of several plants,including the macon and pine mountain valley plants cagle plaintiffs nine named plaintiffs who at the time the lawsuit was filed were employed or had been employed directly by cfjv in the camilla plant named cfjv plaintiffs and plaintiffs who at the time they joined the lawsuit were employed or had been employed directly by cfjv in the camilla plant cfjv plaintiffs 
at the time the lawsuit was filed,the twelve named plaintiffs worked or had worked on the employers production lines and were paid according to a method that calculates compensable time based on when the chicken to be processed reaches the production line.pay begins when the first chicken reaches the production line.it ends when the last chicken reaches the production line.
as part of their jobs,the named plaintiffs are required to wear various articles of protective clothing,including smocks,nets,gloves,and hearing protection,though the clothing required varies depending upon the particular job responsibilities.the employers require employees to arrive before begins in order to don the clothing and remain after ends to doff the clothing.in addition,the named plaintiffs,who are represented by the retail,wholesale,and department store union rwdsu,are required to the protective clothing in conjunction with their breaks.prior to the adoption of the most recent collective bargaining agreement in,the named plaintiffs received no compensation for the protective clothing,which they contend is compensable under the flsa.
the named plaintiffs also challenged the employers pay policy to the extent that it interferes with their unpaid breaks.according to the named plaintiffs,the employers require them to remain on the production line after has stopped,and breaks have begun,in order to process the last chicken on the production line.this,too,the named plaintiffs contend,violates the flsa.
the district court initially certified the collective action and facilitated notice to plaintiffs in all,approximately employees or former employees of cagle cfjv joined the lawsuit.of those who joined,approximately were later dismissed,of whom the named plaintiffs themselves sought to dismiss because their claims were not commensurate with the named plaintiffs primary claims.of the other who were dismissed,were dismissed because their claims fell outside the statute of limitations,and were dismissed for failure to comply with discovery requests.
following discovery,both cagle and cfjv moved to sever the claims against the respective defendants and decertify the collective action.the district court granted the motions after finding that the putative plaintiff class members remaining were not all similarly situated.subsequently,both cagle and cfjv separately filed motions for summary judgment.before the district court ruled on the motions,however,the three named cagle plaintiffs settled their claims,and,accordingly,the district court denied as moot the summary judgment motion filed by cagle.the district court subsequently granted cfjv motion for summary judgment after concluding that the time the named cfjv plaintiffs spent changing in and out of their protective clothing at the beginning and end of the workday was not compensable according to section d of the fair labor standards amendments of,d,stat,codified at o o.the district court then entered judgment against the named cfjv plaintiffs on all of their claims.
the named cfjv plaintiffs filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment.before the district court ruled on that motion,however,the named cfjv plaintiffs and all of the former plaintiffs joined in a motion to intervene to permit the plaintiffs to appeal the district court orders decertifying the collective action and severing the defendants.the named cfjv plaintiffs and the former plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on the same day they moved to intervene.the district court denied the motion to intervene after concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to grant the motion.the district court also denied the named cfjv plaintiffs motion to alter or amend the judgment.immediately thereafter,the appellants,which do not include the named cagle plaintiffs,amended their notice of appeal to challenge these denials as well.

iv.discussion 
jurisdiction 
cagle challenges our jurisdiction as well as the appellants standing to name cagle as a party to this appeal.essentially,cagle takes the position that all claims against it were resolved when the district court adopted the settlement agreement between cagle and the named cagle plaintiffs.
the arguments cagle presents fail to acknowledge or address the named and cfjv plaintiffs contention,which they have maintained throughout the underlying action,that cagle was their employer in conjunction with cfjv and,thus,liable to them directly for flsa violations.see d,g defining,respectively,employer and employ b prescribing a private right of action against employers who violate the flsa.although the outcome of this opinion renders it unnecessary to address the issue of joint liability,the merits of the arguments on appeal have no bearing on the threshold question of our jurisdiction.see,jackson cintas,cir describing jurisdiction as a threshold issue.
cagle focuses on the appellants ability to challenge the district court adoption of the settlement agreement and the effects of the district court severance order,which regrettably lacks explanation of both the district court rationale and intent.cagle does not offer any legal argument explaining why,assuming the appellants joint liability theory is correct,this court nevertheless would lack jurisdiction.the argument cagle offers regarding the named and cfjv plaintiffs standing is similarly lacking.the employers alleged joint liability is directly at issue.therefore,we have jurisdiction over cagle,and the named and cfjv plaintiffs have standing to name cagle as a party to this appeal.see prescribing appellate jurisdiction over final decisions of district courts knight alabama,cir a litigant who is aggrieved by a judgment or order may appeal.internal quotation citation omitted.
decertification 
the district court engaged in a analysis to determine whether a collective action was proper.at the first stage,the district court determined that the plaintiffs were similarly situated based primarily on the named plaintiffs detailed allegations,which established essentially the same job requirements and almost identical treatment among the group of employees defined in the notice the district court ultimately approved.importantly,the allegations were supported to some extent by the employers admissions,and other documentary evidence.the district court,therefore,certified the collective action,but only conditionally,noting the possibility of later decertifying the collective action upon a proper motion filed by the employers a fter discovery is substantially completed and the matter is ready for trial.
following discovery,the employers separately filed motions to decertify the collective action.the district court granted the motions after determining that the plaintiffs were not similarly situated to the named plaintiffs.specifically,the court found that n amed plaintiffs essentially employed by a single employer,based on the discovery before the court,can not fairly and adequately represent the variously assigned employees,the wide variety of work assignments and varied compensation structures affecting the purported class.in its analysis,the district court contrasted the employers independent identities,locations,and work forces the various methods by which the putative class members were compensated and the protective clothing the putative class members were required to wear.
the appellants contend that the district court applied an incorrect standard for determining whether the and named plaintiffs are similarly situated.although they do not challenge the district court approach,they do challenge the district court view of the facts and go so far as to accuse the district court of exaggerating the distinctions among the putative class members.their arguments lack merit.
to maintain a collective action under the flsa,plaintiffs must demonstrate that they are similarly situated.hipp,at see also b.the appellants rely for the most part on hipp,as well as an earlier case,grayson k mart,cir,both of which discuss the similarly situated standard as well as the appropriate analysis for making the necessary determination.
in grayson,we interpreted the flsa collective action provision to require plaintiffs alleging age discrimination to demonstrat e a reasonable basis for their claim of discrimination by making substantial allegations of discrimination,that is,detailed allegations supported by affidavits which successfully engage defendants affidavits to the contrary.at quotations citations omitted.in hipp,we followed grayson,but we also acknowledged,albeit somewhat implicitly,that the lenient standard we adopted in the grayson opinion may be most useful when making a certification decision early in the litigation before discovery has been completed.hipp,at.hipp suggested that district courts deciding whether to certify a collective action engage in a analysis as described in detail by the fifth circuit court of appeals in mooney aramco servs,cir from which the hipp court quoted at length.see hipp,at.
in mooney,the court noted that at the initial stage the district court decision to certify a class is based primarily on pleadings and affidavits.at.in this respect,the first stage resembles the analysis conducted in the grayson decision.see grayson,at accordingly,at the initial stage,courts apply a fairly lenient standard for determining whether the plaintiffs are truly similarly situated.mooney,at,quoted in hipp,at.
at the second stage,which is typically precipitated by a motion for decertification by the defendant usually filed after discovery is largely complete and the matter is ready for trial,the court has much more information on which to base its decision,and makes a factual determination on the similarly situated question.mooney,at,quoted in hipp,at.the similarly situated standard at the second stage is less lenient than at the first,as is the plaintiffs burden in meeting the standard.see thiessen capital,cir describing the similarly situated standard at the second stage as stricter than that applied at the first stage and noting several relevant factors courts consider,including disparate factual and employment settings of the individual plaintiffs the various defenses available to defendant s that appear to be individual to each plaintiff and fairness and procedural considerations,cert.denied,d.exactly how much less lenient we need not specify,though logically the more material distinctions revealed by the evidence,the more likely the district court is to decertify the collective action.as a district court in this circuit has correctly observed,although the flsa does not require potential class members to hold identical positions,see grayson,at,the similarities necessary to maintain a collective action under b must extend beyond the mere facts of job duties and pay provisions.white osmose,d.otherwise,it is doubtful that b would further the interests of judicial economy,and it would undoubtedly present a ready opportunity for abuse.id.
we also need not specify how plaintiffs burden of demonstrating that a collective action is warranted differs at the second stage.it is sufficient to conclude,again quite logically,that at the second stage plaintiffs ultimate decision rests largely within the district court succeed in maintaining a collective action under b based solely on allegations and affidavits,depending upon the evidence presented by the party seeking decertification.
the appellants direct the court to evidence in the record they contend undermines the district court conclusion.whether the record contains evidence arguably supporting the appellants position is not dispositive,however,and whether we would have come to the same conclusion as the district court is not relevant.a district court abuses its discretion if it applies an incorrect legal standard,follows improper procedures in making the determination,or makes findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.chicago tribune,cir.we recognize in this instance that the district court had a range of choice,and so long as its decision does not amount to a clear error of judgment we will not reverse even if we would have gone the other way had the choice been ours to make.mcmahan toto,cir.
we have thoroughly reviewed the record in this case and conclude that the district court view of the evidence is reasonable,and its findings,therefore,are not clearly erroneous furthermore,the district court decision to decertify the collective action based on the distinctions noted in its opinion does not constitute legal error.see mooney,at concluding that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it decertified a plaintiff class it had earlier conditionally certified finally,the district court decision is not at odds with either grayson or hipp,neither of which involved the degree or nature of disparities present in the instant case in conclusion,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it decertified the collective action.
the district court granted cfjv motion for summary judgment after determining that the named cfjv plaintiffs claims were foreclosed by o.section o excludes from the definition of hours worked,in the context of the flsa minimum wage and maximum hours provisions time spent in changing clothes or washing at the beginning or end of each workday which was excluded from measured working time during the week involved by the express terms of or by custom or practice under a bona fide agreement applicable to the particular employee.o.the named cfjv plaintiffs,the only plaintiffs remaining in light of our affirmance of the district court decertification order,contend that o is inapplicable because it does not address the of the protective clothing at issue.they further contend that the employers failure to compensate for the of the protective clothing was not a custom or practice under a bona fide collective bargaining agreement at least,prior to the adoption of the collective bargaining agreement cba,which specifically addresses compensation for clothes changing.
changing clothes 
relying on a fairly recent opinion from the ninth circuit court of appeals squarely addressing this same issue,the named cfjv plaintiffs contend that the act of the garments at issue does not constitute clothes changing,and the garments themselves do not constitute clothes.see alvarez ibp,cir,aff on other grounds,d we disagree.
it is by now axiomatic that we interpret a statute with the aim of giving effect to the drafters intent.see,united states ballinger,cir.we do this,first,by reference to the plain meaning of the statute language,based on the words ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.garfield ndc health,cir quoting perrin united states,d.
the dictionary defines clothes as clothing,which itself is defined as covering for the human body or garments in general all the garments and accessories worn by a person at any one time.webster third new international dictionary unabridged webster.this broad definition,we believe,is consistent with the common understanding of the word,and we see no need to distinguish uniforms from protective clothes,for example,worn in the workplace.
we recognize that there may be limits to the application of o based on the nature or purpose of the garments at issue.other courts have drawn distinctions between general protective clothing,like the garments we are concerned with in this case,and specialized protective clothing,such as plastic shields,steel mesh gloves or,perhaps,spacesuits.see alvarez,at describing as nonunique protective gear such as hardhats and safety goggles holding that the of these items required only de minimis time and effort and therefore were noncompensable and noting later that the broad dictionary definition would encompass all manner of items worn on the body,including armor,spacesuits,riot gear,or mascot costumes reich ibp,cir concluding that the of standard safety equipment such as a pair of safety glasses,a pair of ear plugs and a hard hat was not work under the flsa whereas the donning,doffing,and cleaning of the special protective gear used by the was.we need not decide whether this distinction is legitimate in the context of o.the district court in the instant case concluded that the employees required to wear more specialized garments were compensated for the time necessary to these items,and the named cfjv plaintiffs do not challenge this finding.in addition,aside from their contention that o does not apply to any protective clothing,the named cfjv plaintiffs do not attempt to draw any finer distinctions.thus,we conclude that the garments the named cfjv plaintiffs were required to to perform their job duties fit squarely within the commonly understood definition of clothes as that term is used in o.
the definition of change is similarly broad.it means to make different,that is to modify in some particular way but short of conversion into something else.webster.thus,we see no logic in appellants unsupported argument that changing clothes can only refer to the specific act of arriving at work in one set of clothes,removing those clothes,and putting on a different set of clothes.appellant br.at.nothing in the statute language suggests that its application turns on whether one must fully disrobe or exchange one shirt,for example,for another.therefore,we conclude that one need not exchange clothes to change clothes for the purpose of applying o.
our interpretation of the term changing clothes is consistent with that of the agency responsible for administering the flsa.in a recent advisory opinion,the administrator of the wage and hour division of the department of labor stated that,for the purpose of applying o,clothes include items worn on the body for covering,protection,or sanitation.fair labor standards act,dep t of labor,wage hour div.advisory op.ltr.no.june,advisory opinion i.the named cfjv plaintiffs contend that the administrator opinion is not entitled to deference because it conflicts with earlier administrator advisory opinions that expressly excluded protective clothing from o coverage.see ins,d an agency interpretation of a relevant provision which conflicts with the agency earlier interpretation is entitled to considerably less deference than a consistently held agency view.internal quotation omitted.contrast advisory opinion i with fair labor standards act,dep t of labor,wage hour div.advisory op.ltr,fair labor standards act,dep t of labor,wage hour div.advisory op.ltr.while less deference may be called for,the most recent advisory opinion is entitled to some deference just the same.moreover,this most recent opinion provides a far more detailed rationale for its conclusion than the previous opinions.thus,all things being equal,the more recent opinion is a great deal more persuasive than the earlier ones.
relying on the ninth circuit opinion in alvarez,the named cfjv plaintiffs contend that the term clothes must be construed against the employers.we acknowledge that our conclusion conflicts with the ninth circuit opinion.
the ninth circuit premised its conclusion in large part on its view that o constitutes an exemption from flsa requirements.alvarez,at.consequently,the ninth circuit held that o must be narrowly construed against employers and should not be applied except in contexts plainly and unmistakably within the given exemption terms and spirit.id.quotations omitted citing arnold ben kanowsky,d mitchell kentucky fin,d auer robbins,d klem county of santa clara,cir do ocean peace,cir dole extension irrigation,cir.
none of the cases on which the ninth circuit relied held that o constituted an exemption under the flsa.indeed,none of these cases even discussed o.rather,they concerned of the flsa,which is titled,appropriately,exemptions.had congress sought to bestow upon o the same status as the exemptions set forth in,it easily could have amended instead of,which is titled,not coincidentally,definitions.therefore,although this court once,in dicta,referred to o as an exemption,mitchell se.carbon paper,cir having today addressed the issue for the first time,we conclude that o is not an exemption under the flsa but is instead a definition that limits the scope of the flsa key minimum wage and maximum hour provisions.
the statute plain meaning aside,our conclusion in this regard also finds support in the circumstances surrounding passage of the provision that became o.in,approximately nine years after the flsa was enacted to eliminate conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health,efficiency,and general of workers,congress passed the act.the act aimed to countermand judicial interpretations of the flsa that congress found to evidence a 
disregard of customs,practices,and contracts between employers and employees,thereby creating wholly unexpected liabilities,immense in amount and retroactive in operation,upon employers with the results that,if said act as so interpreted or claims arising under such interpretations were permitted to stand,the payment of such liabilities would bring about financial ruin of many employers and seriously impair the capital resources of many others the credit of many employers would be seriously impaired there would be created both an extended and continuous uncertainty on the part of industry,both employer and employee,as to the financial condition of productive establishments and a gross inequality of competitive conditions between employers and between industries employees would receive windfall payments,including liquidated damages,of sums for activities performed by them without any expectation of reward beyond that included in their agreed rates of pay there would occur the promotion of increasing demands for payment to employees for engaging in activities no compensation for which had been contemplated by either the employer or employe
