state officials charged with the administration of the medicaid program in florida appeal two separate orders arising out of the same litigation.the first appeal is from a contempt order entered on october,for their alleged failure to comply with the injunctive relief ordered in a final judgment involving the state medicaid program.the second appeal is from a class certification order entered on february,approximately three months after the defendants filed their notice of appeal from the contempt order and nearly four years after the entry of final judgment in the case.we consolidated the two appeals.
this litigation has been since the district court entered its terse final judgment in.the scope and reach of that judgment has been a source of contention between the parties leading to this point.there are a number of issues,all of which we will discuss in the course of this opinion.for the present introductory purposes,suffice it to say that we have concluded that the district court finding of contempt,as well as its belated entry of the class certification order,are due to be reversed,and the case remanded to the district court which will then have an opportunity to more clearly define the obligations it intends to impose upon the defendants.
procedural background 
in,thirteen unnamed developmentally disabled individuals plaintiffs who had been placed on waiting lists for entry into intermediate care facilities icf brought a action against officials of the florida department of health and rehabilitative defendants.the suit alleged that defendants were allowing eligible individuals to languish on waiting lists for intermediate care facilities for the developmentally disabled services services for years in violation of the medicaid act,title xix of the social security act,et.in,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs,determining that a requires that defendants provide placement to all eligible individuals with reasonable promptness.accordingly,in a separate order entered on august,the district court entered the following final judgment 
ordered and adjudged that defendants shall,within days of the date of this order,establish within the state medicaid plan a reasonable waiting list time period,not to exceed ninety days,for individuals who are eligible for placement in institutional care facilities.
on appeal,this court affirmed the district court.see doe chiles,cir.
a.the contempt order 
on june,two months after this court affirmed the district court final judgment order,plaintiffs filed a motion for contempt arguing that defendants had not taken any steps to comply with the final judgment.on november,the district court conducted a show cause hearing on whether defendants should be held in contempt.at the hearing,defendants estimated that there were developmentally disabled individuals in need of services who were not receiving them.that number represented an estimate of the individuals who had requested or were likely to request services,and was not based on individualized eligibility assessments 
following the show cause hearing,on november,the district court determined that defendants were not complying with the final judgment,but it did not hold them in contempt.instead,the district court entered an order that allowed additional time to complete specific acts of compliance.the defendants were ordered to provide medicaid services to the named members of the class,to identify and locate for immediate delivery of services the persons whom defendants had estimated were eligible for those services,and to fully comply with the final judgment as to all members of the numbered class.
on january,defendants filed their plan of compliance,setting forth the steps they had taken or intended to take in order to comply with the final judgment.on may,the district court conducted a three day hearing in order to determine whether the defendants were complying with the judgment.on october,the court held the defendants in contempt for failure to comply with that final judgment and it fined them per day until a comprehensive plan,which comports with the letter and spirit of the final judgment is submitted,ready for implementation.the validity of the contempt order is the subject of the first half of the consolidated appeal.
b.the class certification order 
plaintiffs originally captioned their complaint as civil complaint class action.the complaint stated repeatedly that it was filed on behalf of the named plaintiffs and those similarly situated.on july,plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class.the magistrate judge filed a report and recommendation on the certification issue on august,recommending that plaintiffs motion to certify the class be granted.the described the scope of the class as follows 
all developmentally disabled individuals in the state of florida who are entitled to intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded placement but have not received a placement with reasonable promptness.
although the district court received the two days prior to entering final judgment,and acknowledged as much,the court entered final judgment without addressing the class certification issue.in that same final judgment order,the district court denied as moot all pending motions,including presumably,plaintiffs motion for class certification.the district court did not address the class certification issue again before entering its contempt order in.
in their appeal of the district court october,contempt order,one of the arguments the defendants made was that no class had ever been certified.aware of that,the district court,on february,sua sponte and without notice to the parties,entered an order adopting the magistrate and granting class certification.the district court decision to certify a class at that late date was motivated by the defendants appeal of the contempt order,as the court order granting class certification acknowledged in a pending appeal the defendants have challenged the breadth of an order on grounds that it compels relief for a class of individuals beyond the named plaintiffs.this order on class certification is germane to that issue and should be added to the record on appeal as a supplement.the district court modified the class that was originally proposed in the to include 
medicaid eligible individuals with developmental disabilities who have formally requested placement in an intermediate care facility and for whom the placement would be medically and otherwise appropriate but who have not received a placement with reasonable promptness.specifically included in this class are the approximate individuals the state of florida had identified as eligible for placement who have been awaiting placement for more than days.footnote omitted.
the validity of the class certification order is the subject of the second half of the consolidated appeal.
ii.discussion the contempt order 
a.the defendants conduct 
before discussing the district court holding that defendants were in contempt of its final judgment,we need to set out in some detail precisely what the defendants did following the issuance of the final judgment and this court mandate affirming that judgment,see chiles.
defendants amend the florida state medicaid plan 
on april,the federal health care financing administration approved an amendment,which had been submitted by defendants in response to the final judgment,to the florida state medicaid plan.under the amended plan,an applicant is not deemed eligible for services unless it is first determined that such services are medically necessary.specifically,the plan provides 
intermediate care facility for the developmentally disabled service 
limitations 
the recipient need for services must be determined by the agency designee based on medical necessity.
the agency designee will maintain a waiting list for persons who have been determined by the agency designee to be eligible for,require and have chosen placement.the time from placement on the waiting list until admission to an for such persons will not exceed days.
see florida medicaid plan,attachment 
medical necessity is defined in florida administrative code,which provides that in order for a service to be considered medically necessary,it must 
a meet the following conditions 
be necessary to protect life,to prevent significant illness or significant disability,or to alleviate severe pain 
be individualized,specific,and consistent with symptoms or confirmed diagnosis of the illness or injury under treatment,and not in excess of the patient needs 
be consistent with generally accepted professional medical standards as determined by the medicaid program,and not experimental or investigational 
be reflective of the level of service that can be safely furnished,and for which no equally effective and more conservative or less costly treatment is available,statewide and 
be furnished in a manner not primarily intended for the convenience of the recipient,the recipient caretaker,or the provider.
admin.code.under the amended plan,the defendants also look to the code of federal regulations section for further guidance on how to determine medical necessity.subsection b of that section of the regulations provides that clients who are admitted into an must be in need of active treatment services.b.active treatment is defined as a continuous active treatment program,which includes aggressive,consistent implementation of a program of specialized and generic training,treatment,health services and related services described in this subpart,and does not include services to maintain generally independent clients who are able to function with little supervision or in the absence of a continuous active treatment program.a see also.stat.defining active treatment.admin.code defining active treatment plan,establishing the recipient eligibility criteria for intermediate care facilities for the mentally disabled,including the need for continual active treatment.thus,under florida medicaid plan,an individual will not be deemed eligible for services unless such services are determined to be medically necessary for the individual as expressed by a need for continuous active treatment see central admission policy for intermediate care facilities for persons with developmental disabilities in compliance with doe chiles.
defendants adopt the status tracking survey 
after entry of the final judgment,defendants designed and adopted what they deemed a uniform assessment instrument,known as the florida status tracking survey,to determine which applicants for services satisfy the medical necessity standard.under the status tracking survey defendants evaluate applicants for services to determine if their level of need indicates that they require continuous active treatment so that services are medically necessary.
the status tracking survey was designed in part to evaluate an applicants level of need for services in three categories daily functioning,behavioral risk,and status.those individuals who score a sufficiently high level of need are deemed to require care for severe medical,behavioral,and functional deficits.the purpose of the status tracking survey was explained during the show cause hearing by ray foster,who consulted with the state in developing it 
in terms of taking a look at the status tracking survey,its purpose is really to identify individuals who are at higher levels of need for assistance,support,intervention,service,supervision,the kinds of things that you would need in your daily life day to day,to help you eat and dress and function and get around,to take care of behaviors that would pos e a risk to yourself or someone else and to take care of health conditions that would require special treatment or extended periods of monitoring or supervision in some way i n the end the decision you have to come down to is whether or not,based on this person characteristics and levels of need,are they high enough are they substantial enough are they enduring enough to require the top ended service that we can deliver in our state.that is really the purpose of this tool.
the new eligibility criteria contained in the status tracking survey were not subject to notice and comment rulemaking and they have never been published.
defendants develop the review process 
determining that an applicant has an appropriate level of need is only part of the first of two steps in defendants revised eligibility determination process.under the first step,after an applicant submits an initial request for services,defendants determine both whether the applicant is medicaid eligible and,using the status tracking survey,whether the applicant is eligible to receive services,whether such services are medically necessary.if the applicant is determined to be eligible,defendants then schedule an interview with the applicant to discuss alternative services,such as home and waiver services,to ensure that the applicant actually does want services eligible applicants who do want services are placed on a waiting list.under defendants revised review process,they have days from the date the applicant is put on the waiting list after the initial request for services to place that applicant in an facility.see florida medicaid plan,attachment.
defendants apply the status tracking survey and the review process 
utilizing their revised criteria and admissions practices,defendants began evaluating the level of need of the individuals they had previously identified to the district court as requiring services,plus an additional individuals who were subsequently identified as potentially eligible candidates.defendants reviewed the files of these individuals using a uniform screening instrument not the status tracking survey that measured three indicators of eligibility medicaid eligibility a request for placement and a preliminary indication that the individuals were likely to need active treatment.of the individuals screened,only were identified for further evaluation.
most of the who were identified as likely to meet the criteria for services were further reviewed using the status tracking survey to evaluate their level of need.of those individuals,were identified as having a level of need of,or,which was required at that time to support a finding of medical necessity those individuals were subsequently interviewed to determine whether they wanted placement or whether they would prefer home and waiver services.according to defendants,of the individuals,only people requested placement after the interviews.thus,by application of the new eligibility criteria and the revised review process,the defendants reduced their initial estimate of eligible individuals awaiting services from to.
b.the grounds for the contempt holding 
at the show cause hearing,the defendants argued that they should not be held in contempt because they had offered services to all of the remaining eligible individuals.the district court was not impressed.
the primary reasons the court gave for finding the defendants in contempt of its final judgment can be organized and listed as follows defendants had failed to seek adequate funds from the florida legislature to comply with the judgment,then had claimed inadequate funds as a basis for their defendants had sought to avoid the effects of the final judgment by making procedurally and substantively improper changes to the state law criteria used to determine eligibility for services pursuant to the revised application review process,defendants had offered eligible plaintiffs phantom choices of treatment alternatives,and had unreasonably interpreted the final judgment as allowing them two successive time periods in which to determine eligibility for and then ensure the provision of,services and defendants had offered improper or inappropriate services to feign compliance.
standard of review 
we generally review civil contempt orders for abuse of discretion,see jove eng g,cir,and we review findings of fact arising out of contempt proceedings under the clearly erroneous standard,see gathering,watkins,cir.t he focus of the court inquiry in civil contempt proceedings is not on the subjective beliefs or intent of the alleged contemnors in complying with the order,but whether in fact their conduct complied with the order at issue.howard johnson,khimani,cir citations omitted.but a civil contempt order may be upheld only if the proof of the defendant contempt is clear and convincing.mcgregor chierico,cir.this clear and convincing proof must demonstrate that the allegedly violated order was valid and lawful the order was clear,definite and unambiguous and the alleged violator had the ability to comply with the order.id.internal marks and citation omitted.
defendants threshold arguments 
before turning to the four grounds underlying the district court contempt holding,we will first address two arguments the defendants make that do not specifically involve those grounds.they argue in effect that the district court erred by finding them in contempt for failing to provide relief to an extent and on a scale not contemplated by the final judgment.
defendants reading of the final judgment 
defendants first argument is that the final judgment,strictly construed,required only that they amend florida medicaid plan to include a reasonable waiting list time period for the provision of services and not that they actually provide those services within a reasonable time.defendants point out that they have already made an amendment to the plan adopting the required reasonable waiting list time period.attachment of the florida medicaid plan,which was amended on april,now provides that 
the agency designee will maintain a waiting list for persons who have been determined by the agency designee to be eligible for,require and have chosen placement.the time from placement on the waiting list until admission to an for such persons will not exceed days.
the contention is that the final judgment did not require the defendants to actually admit those on the waiting list to an as their own amendment to the plan requires,and that the district court should not have concerned itself with whether the required waiting list time period was actually making any difference in the provision of services.
this contention is untenable.the defendants themselves have not previously interpreted the final judgment so narrowly.for example,in the emergency motion to stay the final judgment,which the defendants filed on october,they argued without a stay of the final judgment,defendants will be required to immediately begin to create additional institutional infrastructure in the form of bricks and mortar,and that p resumably,if there are not sufficient beds available,the final judgment would require the actual construction of facilities within days,an impossible feat.the defendants interpretation of the final judgment is also directly at odds with our prior interpretation of it.in chiles,we rejected the defendants argument that the district court abused its discretion in enjoining them to provide the medicaid services at issue within ninety days.at.
although the district court observed in the second sentence of the contempt order that this lawsuit was brought by thirteen developmentally disabled individuals,the court did not hold the defendants in contempt for failing to timely provide services to those thirteen plaintiffs.instead,it appears that the court based its finding of contempt,in part,on the defendants alleged failure to provide services on a or basis accordingly,one of the grounds of the defendants challenge to the contempt order is that the district court exceeded the scope of the final judgment by ordering defendants to provide relief.this ground of challenge raises issues about the existence of a formally certified class and an implied class.
i the existence of a certified class 
the defendants contend that they can not be held in contempt of the final judgment for failure to provide services to members of the class because no class had been properly certified prior to the issuance of the contempt order.specifically,they say that 
the contempt order attempts to enforce relief,apparently for all developmentally disabled people in florida wanting services.the district court neither defined and hence appropriately limited this class,nor did it certify the class.
the district court did not certify a class before issuing its final judgment or at any time while the case was still properly before it.although the magistrate judge had recommended that plaintiffs motion for class certification be granted,the district court did not adopt the magistrate recommendation or otherwise resolve the class certification question before entering final judgment.instead,at the time the court issued its final judgment it appears to have deliberately decided not to certify a class.the court still had not done so four years later when it found the defendants in contempt.the court explicitly recognized as much in the contempt order,stating only eligible individuals are plaintiffs in this lawsuit as an order certifying a class was never entered.
however,as we discuss in the next section,the fact that the district court failed to properly certify a class does not necessarily establish that no class exists,or that the defendants can not be held in contempt for failing to provide relief.
ii the existence of an implied class 
in three fifth circuit cases,this court addressed the question of whether the absence of a proper class certification order entered pursuant to.was necessarily fatal to the putative class members claims.see johnson motors,cir bolton murray envelope,cir bing roadway express,cir.those decisions are binding upon us,see bonner city of prichard,cir en banc,and we find their reasoning fits the circumstances of this case.accordingly,although we recognize that the district court failed to properly certify a class,we conclude,nevertheless,that an implied class exists.
in bing,the plaintiffs filed their complaint as a class action but did not subsequently move the district court for a class certification order and one was never entered.at.regardless,the former fifth circuit stated we may infer that the trial court approved the class action nature of this lawsuit and held that the class relief could stand.id.in reaching its conclusion,the court was persuaded by several factors,including that the complaint was brought on behalf of the plaintiff and all others similarly situated that the defendants never objected to the class nature of the action that the trial court made statements that suggested it thought the case was a class action and the judgment rendered by the district court contained relief that was aimed at a class of people.id.at.the bing court concluded that because defendant discriminated against a class,class relief was sought,and class relief was given to say that this is not a class action would be to ignore the substance of the proceedings below in favor of an excessively formalistic adherence to the federal rules of civil procedure.id.the court went on to conclude that the type of class as well as the identity of the class members could be determined from the nature of the relief contained in the judgment.id.at.bolton reaffirmed the holding in bing and also recognized that,as a general matter,a rule b class does not require notice as a precondition for its existence at see also,jefferson ingersoll int,cir rule b authorizes a and class for final injunctive relief that operates with respect to the class a whole.crawford honig,cir observing that the right to notice does not apply to class actions brought under rule b kincade tire rubber,cir same.
in johnson,the issue was whether a plaintiff who was seeking monetary damages was barred from so doing by the preclusive effect of a prior class action.johnson,at.the plaintiff argued that he was not barred because,among other reasons,the class in the preceding action had never been certified.id.relying on bing,the johnson court rejected plaintiffs argument.id.at.in the course of doing so,it construed the holding in bing as turning on the district court,and not the parties,treatment of the action as a class action.id.as the johnson court stated,in short,it is beyond dispute that despite the lack of a proper order certifying the previous action as a class suit,the case was in fact a class action and was specifically described and treated as such both at trial and on appeal.id.
there are a number of decisions from other jurisdictions that contain language consistent with bing holding.see,senter motors,cir recognizing that,although the district court should have ruled on the class certification issue prior to resolving the merits,the simple fact is that no one was misled as to the class nature of the action see also,cir under similar facts as in the present case,the first circuit held that even in the absence of a rule certification order,because this case was instituted by a complaint seeking class relief,implicitly granted class relief,and was conducted for years as a de facto class action,it should and may be recognized as such graves walton county bd.of,cir i t is clear that despite the lack of a formal order certifying this case as a class suit,this case was in fact a class action and was specifically described and treated as such by the parties and the trial court.
the present case is a strong one for recognizing the existence of an implied class.the plaintiffs filed this suit as a class action and timely filed for class certification.the magistrate judge recommended that class certification be granted.the plaintiffs acted at all times as though the relief entered would extend.so did the district court.it referred to plaintiffs as a class in the final judgment,stating 
currently pending,and rendered moot by this order,is plaintiffs emergency motion for preliminary injunction t he concerns expressed in that motion are adequately addressed in a case pending before this court plaintiffs in this action,as a class,may intervene in that action.
emphasis added.this court also appears to have treated the case as involving medicaid applicants other than the named plaintiffs,stating 
the plaintiffs have certainly established that the defendants ongoing violation of federal law is systemwide.the record reveals that hundreds,perhaps even thousands,of eligible developmentally disabled persons are not being provided services with anything resembling reasonable promptness.consequently,we reject the defendants contention that there was no showing of statewide or system wide injury.
moreover,the defendants themselves have always understood that the relief granted in the final judgment was intended to be,and not just limited to the named plaintiffs.for example,in defendants emergency motion to stay final judgment,filed october,they argued without a stay of the final judgment,defendants will be required to immediately begin to create additional institutional infrastructure in the form of bricks and mortar,and that p resumably,if there are not sufficient beds available,the final judgment would require the actual construction of facilities within days,an impossible feat.in defendants argument on appeal from the final judgment they stated that the system wide relief in the judgment below was erroneous as there was no showing of statewide or system wide injury.and at the november,show cause hearing,counsel for defendants agreed with the court that an estimated people were then in need of services but argued that defendants should not be held in contempt,stating it does take time.there are a lot of people,a lot of considerations.these decisions,even though this is a class action,these are ultimately individualized decisions.emphasis added.
notwithstanding all of this,the defendants say that they have always contested class certification.true,but they only contested formal class certification they did not contest the nature of the relief contemplated by the final judgment.that much is evident from the objections they submitted to formal class certification,where they argued class certification is unnecessary because the benefits of the relief sought will inure to all individuals who are potential members of the proposed class and that no useful purpose would be served by permitting the case to proceed as a class action inasmuch as the injunction sought would benefit all members of the proposed class.it was not until the contempt four years after entry of final defendants first suggested that the relief ordered in the final judgment should be limited to the named plaintiffs.in other words,everyone involved in this case,including the defendants themselves,always treated the relief sought and provided in the final judgment as extending,until the threat of contempt sanctions inspired the defendants to see things differently for the first time.we do not share their vision.
additional factors militate in favor of recognizing the existence of an implied class in this lawsuit.plaintiffs did not occasion the delay in certifying the class.they should not be penalized because the district court either forgot to address the certification question sooner,or determined that it was not necessary to do so.see senter,at recognizing that t he language of rule c is obviously directed to the district court.it does not impose upon a plaintiff the additional burden of ensuring that the district court adhere to c directive.moreover,as in bing,it is a simple matter to determine the type and scope of the class by looking to the relief contained in the final judgment.as to its type,because we are dealing with injunctive relief,the class is a rule b class,and would not require that notice be given to all potential class members.see bolton,at.as to its scope,the district court defined the relief as follows 
ordered and adjudged that defendants shall,within days of the date of this order,establish within the state medicaid plan a reasonable waiting list time period,not to exceed ninety days,for individuals who are eligible for placement in institutional care facilities.
the general parameters of the class include all individuals who are eligible for placement in institutional care facilities.
this is also how we viewed matters in our prior opinion in this case where we construed the final judgment language to mean that defendants must incorporate into their present scheme of providing services procedures that ensure a waiting list period of not more than ninety days.chiles,at.that language clearly envisioned a revision,as is also evident from our recognition that perhaps thousands of individuals were being denied services in violation of federal law.id.at.
therefore,to the extent such recognition is necessary we recognize the existence of an implied class in this case.we also hold that the existence of that implied class defeats the defendants challenges to the contempt order premised on the court failure to certify a class.the parameters of the implied class are as follows 
medicaid eligible individuals with developmental disabilities who have requested,and have been determined eligible for,placement in an intermediate care facility but who have not received a placement with reasonable promptness.
to keep the paper current,the district court should enter an order to that effect upon remand 
the four grounds underlying the contempt holding 
we turn now to the four grounds,which we have previously listed,upon which the district court based its contempt order.
a.the inadequate funding ground 
the first ground is that the defendants sought inadequate funds from the florida legislature to comply with the final judgment.the district court stated that the defendants had requested only enough funds to reduce the waiting list by,from which the court inferred that there was never an intent to timely comply with the mandate of the eleventh circuit or this court order.
however,the district court made its inadequate funding determination based upon the estimated t thousand individuals who are currently on waiting lists for services.that number is not even close to the number of individuals who were actually eligible for services but who had not yet received them at the time of the contempt hearing.as we have previously discussed,the defendants estimate,and the plaintiffs do not appear to seriously disagree,that the number of individuals actually eligible for placement in facilities but who had not been placed at the time of the hearing is indeed,the district court pretty much adopted that number in both its november,order and in the contempt order itself,where the court stated,o nly eligible individuals are plaintiffs in this lawsuit the defendants insist that the figure represents an estimate of all individuals with developmental disabilities who may need some state services of some kind,although only a small fraction of that number need services the plaintiffs do not disagree.
civil contempt proceedings are brought to enforce a court order that requires a party to act in some defined manner.chairs burgess,cir internal marks omitted.here,the final judgment did not require the provision of services to any and all developmentally disabled individuals,nor did it require the provision of any medicaid services other than services.therefore,to the extent that the district court based its finding of contempt on defendants failure to request sufficient funds to provide services or any other kind of services to individuals,it erred.
b.the modification of eligibility status tracking survey 
the second ground upon which the district court relied to find defendants in contempt involves their modification of the eligibility requirements,which they accomplished through the development and implementation of the status tracking survey.the final judgment ordered the defendants to provide services within days for individuals who are eligible for placement in institutional care facilities.what the district court found is that instead of providing services to the individuals who were eligible for placement in institutional care facilities,the defendants changed the definition of eligibility for placement in those facilities in order to eliminate all but ten of the people from eligibility.the district court reasoned 
the consequence and obvious intent of adopting the experimental status tracking survey tool for assessing need has been to remove a large number of individuals from the list of those eligible for and receiving services.circumvention of the final judgment entered in,which ordered that services be provided to identified eligible individuals,is thus effectively accomplished.
the court did not have any problem with the defendants requiring medical necessity as an eligibility criterion for services but it had serious problems with the use of the status tracking survey to determine medical necessity,and those problems were a large part of the reason the court concluded that the defendants were in contempt of its final judgment order.the district court did not suggest that the defendants would have been in contempt for making valid changes to the criteria used to determine eligibility,but instead concluded that their conduct was contemptuous because the changes they made with the adoption of the status tracking survey were procedurally and substantively invalid.
the district court thought that adoption of the status tracking survey constituted unlawful rulemaking.the court also determined that the status tracking survey is not a complete or ready screening tool and that it is contrary to the substance of the federal medicaid statute.in particular,the court noted that the status tracking survey does not require a certification of need by a physician and does not provide for an interdisciplinary evaluation prior to admission to an facility.the court also thought that the status tracking survey does not address many important factors that should be considered under the federal medicaid statute in determining the need for continuous active treatment.finally,the court found the status tracking survey lacking because it did not include safeguards in the form of an independent review of adverse eligibility determinations.
the reasoning that led the district court to conclude that creation and use of the status tracking system to determine medical necessity violated the final judgment order appears to have been this the new eligibility criteria contained in the status tracking system are invalid,either because they were adopted in a procedurally defective manner or because they are substantively in violation of the medicaid statute,or because they are simply unreliable using those new criteria the defendants denied services to a number of individuals many of these individuals would have been eligible under the old criteria with the result that defendants have failed to timely provide services to individuals who are truly eligible,meaning eligible under the original criteria which are the only remaining ones after the status tracking survey is thrown out.therefore,the reasoning goes,the defendants improperly circumvented and thereby violated the final judgment.
the district court finding of contempt can not stand if the first premise set out above,which is that the status tracking survey is invalid,falls.the district court gave four reasons for concluding the status tracking survey was invalid,and we take up each one of those reasons in turn.
i rulemaking and procedural requirements 
the district court held that the status tracking survey was procedurally invalid because it had been adopted without following formal rulemaking procedures and without publishing the changes so that the public could understand how eligible persons would be affected.that failure to comply with rulemaking requirements was fatal,in the court view.
compliance with the apa 
in holding that the defendants,in adopting the status tracking survey,failed to comply with administrative rulemaking requirements the district court cited both federal cases applying the federal administrative procedure act,et apa,as well as state cases applying florida administrative procedure act.stat.et.see cleveland clinic florida hosp.agency for health care,so d,dist.the statutory framework under which administrative agencies must operate in florida provides mechanisms for the adoption or amendment of rules.however,the federal apa clearly does not apply to state agencies.see b defining agency as certain authorities of the government of the united states.
moreover,to the extent that the defendants were in violation of florida own administrative procedures act,federal courts do not have the authority to compel state actors to comply with state law.see pennhurst state school hosp.halderman,d i t is difficult to think of a greater intrusion on state sovereignty than when a federal court instructs state officials on how to conform their conduct to state law.such a result conflicts directly with the principles of federalism that underlie the eleventh amendment.see also walker mintzes,cir a federal court should not rule upon the validity of a state regulation challenged on the sole ground that it was not properly adopted under state law by the state administrative agency.
there is,to be sure,some authority holding that a state administrative agency violation of state law can,under certain circumstances,also constitute a violation of federal law thereby avoiding the eleventh amendment problems described in the pennhurst opinion.in barnes cohen,cir,the third circuit determined that state officials were not adhering to their own regulations that were passed in accordance with the aid to families with dependent children afdc program.id.at.in response to the state argument that such a holding contravened pennhurst,the court pointed to a,which requires state afdc plans to be in effect in all political subdivisions of the state,and,if administered by them,be mandatory upon them.id.at.the court interpreted that provision as requiring states to adhere to their own afdc regulations,and held that the state violation of its own regulations also constituted a violation of a,rendering pennhurst inapplicable.see also wisconsin hosp.ass reivitz,cir the decree might seem to raise problems under pennhurst but it does not,because the federal regulations make compliance with the state plan a federal duty.
a similar argument could be made in this case because section a of the medicaid act contains language identical to that found in a see a.but see oberlander perales,cir rejecting a similar argument regarding section a as tortuous,noting that there is no authority anywhere supporting the proposition that a state medicaid regulation becomes a federal law merely by virtue of its inclusion in a state plan required by federal law.
but even if we were inclined to adopt the reasoning set out by the third circuit in barnes,it would not apply to the facts of this case.here,unlike barnes,the defendants are not alleged to have violated a state medicaid regulation or a provision of the state medicaid plan.instead,the district court determined that defendants violated certain general rulemaking requirements set forth in florida administrative procedure act.there is nothing in the federal medicaid statute or regulations that would require the defendants to follow florida apa.as this court has previously explained in another medicaid case where we distinguished barnes 
assuming arguendo that pennhurst ii is not applicable to a case such as that described in barnes cohen,we hold that we are not faced with such a situation.plaintiff has not alleged that the commissioner of the alabama medicaid agency has violated the state medicaid plan or regulations promulgated pursuant to the state medicaid plan.instead he argues that the commissioner has not complied with the state constitution and with state statutes which are not part of the medicaid plan.thus,the principles announced in barnes are not relevant here.
silver baggiano,cir.we have the same situation here,and our holding in silver fits this case precisely.
thus,the federal apa did not apply to the defendants adoption of the status tracking survey,and any violations of florida apa are not cognizable in this type of federal court proceeding.therefore,there is no proper basis for the district court holding that defendants adopted the status tracking survey in a procedurally defective manner,and any procedural problems with its adoption can not serve as a reason for holding defendants in contempt.
compliance with the medicaid statute 
in holding the defendants in contempt,the district court also concluded that,under the medicaid statute,notice of the rule change should have been provided for the numerous individuals who would have been eligible under the old criteria,but who were denied services under the revised criteria.it determined that such notice is mandated,citing a and,and a if we construe the district court statement the defendants were required to provide the plaintiffs with notice of the rule change the statutory and regulatory provisions the district court relied on are inapposite.those provisions involve only notice of denials of individual medicaid applications,and impose no obligation to publish notice of rule changes that will have a general impact on eligibility.
however,if we construe the district court statement to mean only that those individuals denied services pursuant to the new criteria have a right to notice and an opportunity to be heard,then the district court is correct on that point.see,cramer chiles,d,medicaid statutes require that a state provide individuals with an opportunity for a hearing before the governmental agency when a claim for medical assistance is denied or is not acted upon with reasonable promptness,including where the medicaid agency takes action to suspend,terminate,or reduce services.parry crawford,t he medicaid act clearly provides for notice upon the denial of an application in addition to denial of a claim for services,certain other actions,such as termination,reduction,or suspension of services also entitle the applicant to a hearing.citation omitted catanzano dowling,under federal regulation,the state medicaid agency must provide a proper notice to the patient informing him of the proposed change and his right to a hearing both at the time that the individual initially applies for medicaid and at any time the medicaid agency takes any action affecting his claim.emphasis in original.
the problem with this part of the district court reasoning is that recognizing the plaintiffs have such a right does not establish that the right was violated in this case.the court order contains no findings that anyone who was denied services failed to receive notification of that denial or was deprived of a requested hearing.more fundamentally,even if we assume that defendants violated the medicaid because they failed to provide notice to those denied services or they failed to provide hearings to those who requested would not,by itself,establish that the defendants had violated the final judgment.the final judgment dealt only with the timely provision of services,and not with notice and a hearing in connection with the denial of services.it follows that the defendants failure,if any,to provide notice and a hearing can not support the district court finding of contempt.
ii eligibility requirements 
the district court also determined that the status tracking survey contravenes certain requirements of the medicaid statute pertaining to eligibility for services.in particular,the court stated that the federal regulations require that the initial certification of need for care be made by a physician and that the evaluation for admission to an or payment for the service be conducted by an interdisciplinary team.the court was apparently troubled by the fact that defendants employ the status tracking survey to make initial eligibility determinations even though it does not provide for an initial certification of need by a physician or an evaluation by an interdisciplinary team.
while it is true that the federal medicaid regulations prescribe certain standards and procedures that must be satisfied before an applicant can be admitted to an icf,those provisions do not address,nor are they inconsistent with,the use of a screening mechanism to identify applicants who are not likely to need continuous active treatment services.for example,section provides,in pertinent part 
b standards admissions,transfers,and discharge.
clients who are admitted by the facility must be in need of and receiving active treatment services.
admission decisions must be based on a preliminary evaluation of the client that is conducted or updated by the facility or outside sources.
section a mandates that a physician must certify for each applicant or recipient that icf services are or were needed.a.section provides 
a before admission to an icf an interdisciplinary team of health professionals must make a comprehensive medical and social evaluation and,where appropriate,a psychological evaluation of each applicant need for care in the icf.
none of these regulations,which are designed to ensure that only applicants who are in need of icf services are placed in institutional care facilities,suggest that the defendants can not use the status tracking survey as a screening mechanism in addition to the procedures mandated by the regulations.the status tracking survey does not supplant the mechanisms the regulations require,but instead works in concert with them to screen out applicants who are unlikely to need continuous active treatment services.those applicants who satisfy the status tracking survey will still be evaluated,prior to their admission to an icf,in accordance with the appropriate regulations,including,a and.thus,to the extent that the district court finding of contempt was predicated on the fact that the status tracking survey is inconsistent with the medicaid eligibility requirements set out in the federal regulations,the finding of contempt can not stand.
in the context of analyzing the relationship between the status tracking survey and the eligibility requirements set out in the medicaid statute,the district court opined that the status tracking survey is not a complete or ready tool,and that n othing offered by the defendants showed the survey to be a valid instrument for measuring the needs of developmentally disabled individuals.for purposes of this analysis,we will assume that conclusion represents a finding of fact that is not clearly erroneous.see generally gathering,watkins,cir.nonetheless,it is irrelevant to the issue of contempt.
the issue before the district court was whether the defendants had violated the terms of the final judgment.parties can not be held in contempt unless they have violated a clear,definite and unambiguous order.see mcgregor chierico,cir.the final judgment did not address eligibility requirements or the efficacy of screening mechanisms.it dealt only with the timely provision of services to individuals who are eligible for placement in institutional care facilities.for that reason,the defendants can not be held in contempt based solely on the district court appraisal of the status tracking survey,even if we assume that it is not a complete or ready tool and that it is not a valid instrument for measuring the needs of developmentally disabled individuals.
iii continuous active treatment requirements 
the district court also questioned the validity of the status tracking survey on grounds that it fails to include all of the factors medicaid requires to be considered when determining an individual need for continuous active treatment.the court was specifically concerned with the status tracking survey failure to contain any provisions to ensure that applicants who are denied services do not regress to the point of needing them.although the district court did not cite any statutory or regulatory provision requiring care,it may have had in mind a.that regulation defines active treatment as 
a continuous active treatment program,which includes aggressive,consistent implementation of a program of specialized and generic training,treatment,health services and related services described in this subpart,that is directed toward 
i the acquisition of the behaviors necessary for the client to function with as much self determination and independence as possible and 
ii the prevention or deceleration of regression or loss of current optimal functional status.
a.another part of the same section also requires that c lients who are admitted by the facility must be in need of and receiving active treatment services.b.
regulations such as section establish certain requirements that icf facilities must satisfy in order to participate in the medicaid scheme.see.more specifically,section imposes two requirements relevant to the present discussion.first,it establishes the minimum level of services that an icf facility must provide before the facility will be permitted to participate in medicaid.see a.as the district court correctly observed,those services must be designed to prevent the regression of a client functional status.second,it establishes that individuals who are admitted to a facility must satisfy a certain baseline level of need before the facility which houses those clients will be allowed to participate in the medicaid scheme.see b.if an icf admits those who fall below the baseline level of need prescribed in section b,then that facility will not qualify to participate,at least with respect to those individuals.
however,to say,as the regulation does,that applicants who are admitted to icf must be in need of active treatment services,is not the same as saying that all applicants who are in need of active treatment services must be admitted to icf.this is an important distinction,one that is fundamental to the joint medicaid scheme.as we have explained previously,the federal medicaid statute does not require states to provide services.see a a ii.and states that elect to provide those services are granted substantial discretion in the formulation of their eligibility standards.see.section requires only that participating facilities provide services in a particular manner and solely to those individuals who truly need them.it does not require that services be provided to any individual who might benefit from them.
iv review requirements 
the district court final criticism of the status tracking survey is that it does not provide for review of adverse decisions that result from application of its criteria,and that the absence of such review procedures renders the status tracking survey substantively faulty.the court explained 
u se of the status tracking survey as a screening mechanism is substantively faulty because it fails to provide for an independent review of an adverse determination there are no safeguards against arbitrariness in canceling services to persons now receiving or who were eligible for services.the claimed protection against unfair cancellation of services,according to the defendants,is an examination of records by the agency physician.first,as previously noted,the review is not independent.second,the records are admittedly incomplete for an adequate review assuming that the status tracking survey could be constructed to serve as a valid instrument it is clear that much is left to be done.
those may or may not be valid criticisms of the status tracking survey,but the district court did not identify any particular provision of the medicaid statute or its accompanying regulations that would require a different review procedure.more fundamentally,the district court reasoning goes outside of the appropriate boundaries of the contempt proceeding.the defendants can not be held in contempt of the final judgment,which says nothing about review mechanisms,simply because they adopted a faulty one 
the district court holding that defendants were in contempt of its final judgment was based in large part on the premise that the status tracking survey was procedurally and substantively invalid.that premise does not withstand scrutiny.so far as procedural rulemaking requirements are concerned,the federal apa does not apply to the defendants adoption of the status tracking survey,and violations of state administrative procedure law are not cognizable in federal court in the circumstances of this case.it has not been established that the defendants development and implementation of the status tracking survey violates any provision of the medicaid statute or its accompanying regulations.finally,even if the status tracking survey is a faulty screening mechanism,that alone does not violate the terms of the final judgment.so,any perceived or actual flaws in the status tracking survey can not serve as a basis for holding the defendants in contempt for failure to comply with the final judgment.
c.the review process 
moving beyond the status tracking survey issues,the next two grounds upon which the district court found defendants in contempt involve defendants application review process that is initiated when an applicant applies for services.an application triggers two simultaneous inquiries an inquiry as to whether the applicant is medicaid eligible and also an inquiry as to whether the applicant is eligible for services.under defendants interpretation of the law,they have days to complete these two inquiries,which are together the first step of the process.
if the applicant is determined to be eligible for services under first step of the then schedule an interview with the applicant to explain the availability of alternative services,specifically home and waiver services,and to offer the applicant the choice between those and services.if the applicant chooses services after the interview,then there is a maximum day waiting period for the provision of services set out in the final judgment,and that day period does not begin running until the first step of the process is completed.the result is that under defendants application review process,from the time the applicant initially requests services,defendants allow themselves not one but two successive day time periods to place the applicant in a facility.the district court had two problems with the defendants application process that contributed to its conclusion that they had violated the final judgment.
i phantom choices 
first,the district court was persuaded that defendants were offering applicants phantom choices between services and the alternative waiver services.specifically,the court was concerned that applicants were not being told that if they elected to receive the alternative services they were not assured of receiving them in the immediate future.
but the final judgment only involved the time period for providing services.it said nothing at all about the provision of any other type of services,nor did it even specify how the defendants were to go about offering services.as we made clear in our prior decision in this case the plain language of the district court injunction does not prevent the appellants from continuing to pursue the home and waiver services program in accordance with federal statutory and regulatory dictates.chiles,at.counsel for the plaintiffs recognized as much,in a statement made at a hearing before the district court that we cited in doe chiles 
our position to the state has always been,if they want to provide everybody with services so that they do need to be taken out of their current housing arrangement that great.there wo be a lawsuit.they are always welcome to provide services to people in the manner in which they see fit and if they want to entice people away by offering some other package of services,that great.
ii the time period 
the second problem the district court had with the review process concerned what it termed the unreasonable construction by the defendants of the final judgment as allowing them days from the date of the initial request for services to determine eligibility,plus an additional days to actually place an applicant in an facility who is determined to be eligible and wants to be placed.the district court thought it clear that the final judgment required placement within days of the application there is no ambiguity in the final judgment.any request from a developmentally disabled individual or guardian for services,in whatever form,starts the time period in which the defendants are to evaluate the individual and provide or deny services.
again,it is worth emphasizing this is a contempt proceeding,and the question properly before the district court was whether or not defendants had violated a clear,definite and unambiguous order,mcgregor,at.our reading of the final judgment in this case does not convince us that it clearly and unambiguously prescribes the time limit for determining eligibility.the final judgment provides only that defendants must establish a waiting list,not to exceed ninety days,for individuals who are eligible for placement in institutional care facilities.the final judgment does not address the question of when that day waiting period is triggered,or how long the defendants have to determine who is eligible.
we need not choose between the competing interpretations of the final judgment.it is enough that there are two reasonable,competing interpretations,which is the very definition of ambiguity.given the ambiguity in the final judgment,defendants conduct in accordance with their reasonable interpretation of the judgment as permitting them to run the eligibility determination phase and the placement phase successively rather than concurrently can not be contumacious.see nba properties,gold,cir any ambiguities in a judgment are to be construed in favor of the alleged contemnor 
improper placements 
the final ground on which the district court based its conclusion that the defendants were in contempt concerns certain placements that the court deemed improper because the facilities were not close to the beneficiaries homes,or the beneficiaries were placed in facilities without first determining whether they possessed the ability to use appropriate sexual caution,or for both reasons.while these are concerns,they are not concerns that were addressed in the final judgment.therefore,defendants can not be held in contempt of the final judgment on the basis of the inappropriateness of any placements.
for all of these reasons,we conclude that the district court order holding defendants in contempt must be reversed 
expansion of the final judgment 
defendants also challenge as overly broad the district court reading of the injunctive relief provided in the final judgment.the district court stated that,pursuant to the final judgment entered in,it is now settled law that the defendants must provide a comprehensive,effectively working plan that provides adequate and appropriate services to eligible individuals within a reasonable time period.the court went on to hold that defendants were to be fined per day until a comprehensive plan,which comports with the letter and spirit of the judgment entered august,is submitted,ready for implementation.
defendants contend that the district court requirement of a comprehensive plan that provides adequate and appropriate services and that comports with the spirit of the final judgment,inappropriately expands the original scope of that judgment.they argue that the contempt order,read in its entirety,can only mean that the state of florida must completely restructure its medicaid program for the developmentally disabled.they base this assertion on the various grounds,previously discussed,upon which the district court found them in contempt,including the court conclusion that defendants sought inadequate funds to deal with the individuals on waiting lists,the court disapproval of the defendants new standards for determining eligibility,its conclusion regarding the time limits for determining eligibility and providing services,and its objections to the manner in which defendants were offering and providing alternative services.
the district court perceived there to be a wide array of problems with the manner in which defendants were providing services and decided that all of those problems could be remedied with a contempt order.as we have already decided,however,the matters that troubled the district court had not been addressed in the final judgment,so they can not serve as a valid basis for holding defendants in contempt.see reynolds roberts,cir long standing precedent evinces a strong public policy against judicial rewriting of consent decrees.a district court may not impose obligations on a party that are not unambiguously mandated by the decree itself.internal marks and citations omitted.
if the problems the district court perceived with the way in which defendants are providing medicaid lack of sufficient funding,the change in eligibility criteria,the time limit for determining eligibility,or the manner in which alternative services are from violations of state or federal law requiring judicial intervention,they can be addressed in another action id.at.alternatively,under appropriate circumstances and after the proper procedures have been followed,the original injunction in this case might have been modified to address the problems.see rufo inmates of the suffolk county jail,d s ound judicial discretion may call for the modification of the terms of an injunctive decree if the circumstances,whether of law or fact,obtaining at the time of its issuance have changed,or new ones have since arisen.citation omitted see also united states united shoe mach,d if the decree has not achieved its principal objects the time has come to prescribe other,and if necessary more definitive,means to achieve the result.internal marks omitted mann,hortex,cir it is well settled that the issuing court has continuing power to supervise and modify its injunctions in accordance with changed conditions.notice must be given,along with an opportunity to be heard,and,if aggrieved,either party may appeal.
here,the principal object of the final judgment injunction,as interpreted previously by this court,is to enforce plaintiffs federal right to reasonably prompt provision of assistance under section a.chiles,at.the assistance at issue is the provision of services to eligible individuals.if services are not being provided in a reasonably prompt manner to eligible individuals,the old injunction may be modified or a new one entered prescribing additional measures aimed at accomplishing this result,but only after proper procedures are followed.compliance with the modified injunction or a new one can then be enforced,if necessary,through a contempt proceeding.
governor bush as a party 
we are persuaded by defendants argument that because governor chiles had been dismissed from this lawsuit in,there was no basis for substituting governor bush in the present case,and therefore there was no basis for holding the governor in contempt.accordingly,governor bush is hereby dismissed from the case and his name should be struck from the case style.
