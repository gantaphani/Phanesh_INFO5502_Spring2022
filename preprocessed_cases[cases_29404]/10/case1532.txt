order modifying opinion no change in judgment 
the opinion filed february,and certified for publication is modified as follows 
on page,in the first paragraph,after the first full sentence ending with the words minimum hourly wage for such time,add as footnote the following,which will require renumbering subsequent footnotes 
this case does not involve,and we have no occasion to question,the propriety of compensation plans that pay employees a salary that compensates them for rest periods and other nonproductive work time.
on page,in the second sentence of the first full paragraph,on lines and,the words separately account are deleted and replaced with the words provide compensation.as modified,the sentence reads 
we conclude,however,that wage order applies equally to commissioned employees,employees paid by piece rate,or any other compensation system that does not provide compensation for rest breaks and other nonproductive time.
this order does not change the judgment.
introduction 
are employees paid on commission entitled to separate compensation for rest periods mandated by state law if so,do employers who keep track of hours worked,including rest periods,violate this requirement by paying employees a guaranteed minimum hourly rate as an advance on commissions earned in later pay periods we answer both questions in the affirmative,and reverse the trial court ruling granting summary judgment in favor of the employer.
factual and procedural background 
ricardo bermudez vaquero and robert schaefer worked as sales associates for stoneledge furniture,llc,a retail furniture company doing business in california as ashley furniture homestores.after termination of their employment,vaquero and schaefer filed a class action complaint alleging that stoneledge commission pay plan did not comply with california law.the parties largely agree on the relevant facts regarding stoneledge employee compensation system.
stoneledge compensation system 
from through march,stoneledge compensated sales associates pursuant to the sales associate commission compensation pay agreement.after a training period during which new employees received per hour,stoneledge paid sales associates on a commission basis.if a sales associate failed to earn minimum pay of at least per hour in commissions in any pay period,stoneledge paid the associate a draw against future advanced commissions.the commission agreement explained the amount of the draw will be deducted from future advanced commissions,but an employee will always receive at least per hour for every hour worked.the commission agreement included a table providing an example of how the draw and advanced commissions system worked,assuming hours of time in a work week 
week min.weekly advanced gross week draw cumulative weekly pay commission pay owe draw owe draw 
the commission agreement did not provide separate compensation for any time,such as time spent in meetings,on certain types of training,and during rest periods.sales associates recorded this time,however,using stoneledge electronic timekeeping system.sales associates clocked into the system at the start of each shift,clocked out and back in for meal periods,and clocked out again when their shifts ended.sales associates did not clock out for rest periods.stoneledge authorized and permitted sales associates to take rest periods of at least consecutive minutes for every four hours worked or major fraction thereof.
stoneledge contends that under its compensation plan all time during rest periods was recorded and paid as time worked identically with all other work time thus,sales associates are paid at least per hour even if they make no sales at all.although stoneledge deducted from sales associates paychecks any previously paid draw on commissions,stoneledge states such repayment was never taken if it would result in payment of less than the minimum pay of per hour for all time worked in any week.
effective march,stoneledge implemented a new commission agreement that pays sales associates a base hourly wage of for all hours worked.in addition,sales associates can earn various types of incentive payments based on a percentage of sales.under the new agreement,no portion of a sales associate base pay is deducted from or credited against incentive payments.
b.the litigation 
vaquero and schaefer filed a putative class action alleging causes of action for failure to provide paid rest periods under labor code section and the applicable wage order,failure to pay all wages owed upon termination under section,unfair business practices,and declaratory relief pursuant to the parties stipulation,the trial court certified a class comprised of three subclasses of sales associates corresponding to the plaintiffs three primary claims unpaid rest periods,unpaid wages upon termination,and unfair business practices.the class is limited to sales associates employed by stoneledge in california from september,through march,the time period during which the previous commission agreement was in effect.
stoneledge filed a motion for summary judgment or in the alternative for adjudication,arguing that the rest period claim failed as a matter of law because stoneledge paid its sales associates a guaranteed minimum for all hours worked,including rest periods.with respect to the claim for violation of section,stoneledge argued a claim for rest period premium pay is not an action to recover wages under section and,in any event,stoneledge did not willfully fail to pay wages,as required for a violation of section.stoneledge argued that,because the class claims for failure to pay for rest periods and for wages owed at termination failed as a matter of law,the derivative claim for unfair business practices also failed.
the trial court granted stoneledge motion and entered judgment for stoneledge.the court found stoneledge payment system specifically accounted for all hours worked and guaranteed that sales associates would be paid more than the an hour for those hours.with this system there was no possibility that the employees rest period time would not be captured in the total amount paid each pay period.the court stated,by tracking all the hours that its sales associates and employees were present at the facility,including rest periods,stoneledge was able to ensure that the compensation it paid its employees via commission would never fail to include payment for the time employees spent taking their mandatory rest periods.under stoneledge plan sales associates are uniformly paid at or above a rate which expressly encompasses all the time present in the workplace and all the time worked,including rest periods.the court therefore granted stoneledge motion for summary adjudication on the cause of action for violation of section.
the trial court,without examining the merits of the remaining claims,concluded they all failed because they were derivative of the rest period claim.the court stated,with regard to the causes of action for violation of labor code section,unfair business practices and declaratory relief,each of those causes of action are derivative of the cause of action for failure to pay rest periods.absent a failure by stoneledge to pay plaintiffs for the required rest period,there would,as a consequence,be no unpaid wages remaining at the termination of the employment.likewise,there would be no unfair business practice claim under government code section.and the declaratory relief claim would also fail absent the underlying statutory violation upon which the cause of action is based.the plaintiffs timely appealed from the judgment.
discussion 
wage order and compensation for rest periods 
the legislature authorized the industrial welfare commission iwc to regulate the wages,hours,and working conditions of various classes of workers to protect their health and welfare.augustus abm security services,cal th,rodriguez,th.to this end,the iwc promulgated wage orders for workers in a number of industries and occupations.rodriguez,at.as a consequence,wage and hour claims are today governed by two complementary and occasionally overlapping sources of authority the provisions of the labor code,enacted by the legislature,and a series of wage orders,adopted by the iwc.rodriguez,at see brinker restaurant superior court cal th.those laws and wage orders are also subject to enforcement by a state agency,namely,the division of labor standards enforcement dlse.rodriguez,at see brinker,at fn.
an employer is required to authorize and permit the amount of rest break time called for under the wage order for its industry.brinker,supra,cal th at.the rest period claim here is based on section and wage order,which applies to the mercantile industry.see cal.code regs.tit,subds,h defining m ercantile i ndustry wage order.
section provides an employer shall not require an employee to work during a meal or rest or recovery period mandated pursuant to an applicable statute,or order of the iwc,subd.b.if an employer fails to provide an employee a meal or rest or recovery period in accordance with a state law,including,but not limited to,an order of the iwc,the employer shall pay the employee one additional hour of pay at the employee regular rate of compensation for each workday that the meal or rest or recovery period is not provided,subd.c.

wage orders are regulations and are construed in accordance with the ordinary principles of statutory interpretation.gonzalez downtown la motors,lp th,see aleman airtouch cellular th,see also brinker,supra,cal th at t he iwc wage orders are to be accorded the same dignity as statutes.generally,w hen a wage order validity and application are conceded and the question is only one of interpretation,the usual rules of statutory interpretation apply.rodriguez,supra,th at see brinker,at.
the task of interpretation is to determine the legislative intent,looking first to the words of the wage order,construed in light of their ordinary meaning and statutory context.rodriguez,supra,th at see brinker,supra,cal th at gonzalez,supra,th at.if the language of the wage order is clear,it is applied without further inquiry.citation.if the language can be interpreted to have more than one reasonable meaning,a court may consider a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.gonzales,at see aleman,supra,th at.judicial construction that renders any part of the wage order meaningless or inoperative should be avoided.rodriguez,at accord,brinker,at gonzalez,at.dlse opinion letters,while not controlling,constitute the type of experience and considered judgment that may properly inform our judgment.augustus,supra,cal th at see brinker,supra,cal th at,fn.rodriguez,at.

the trial court concluded that wage order did not require stoneledge to pay its commissioned employees separately for their rest periods and that stoneledge commission agreement specifically accounted for all hours worked by the salespersons,including rest periods.we review this conclusion,which the trial court reached on summary judgment,and the court interpretation of wage order,de novo.schachter citigroup,cal th,rodriguez,supra,th at gonzales,supra,th at see araquistain pacific gas electric company th,the interpretation and application of a statutory scheme to an undisputed set of facts is a question of law citation which is subject to de novo review on appeal.
wage order requires employers to separately compensate covered employees for rest periods 
the parties agree that wage order applies to stoneledge sales associates and that stoneledge permitted and authorized the rest periods mandated by california law and wage order.the parties disagree,however,whether california law,including wage order,required stoneledge to separately compensate its sales associates for such rest periods.we conclude it does.
the plain language of wage order requires employers to count rest period time as hours worked for which there shall be no deduction from wages.cal.code regs.tit,subd.a,italics added.in bluford safeway stores,th the court interpreted this language to require employers to separately compensate employees for rest periods where the employer uses an activity based compensation system that does not directly compensate for rest periods.id.at.
bluford involved safeway truck drivers who sued safeway for,among other things,failing to provide paid rest periods.bluford,supra,th at.safeway paid the drivers based on mileage rates applied according to the number of miles driven,the time when the trips were made,and the locations where the trips began and ended.id.at.safeway asserted it intended to pay drivers for their rest periods and its compensation system purportedly subsumed those payments into the mileage rates safeway negotiated in the drivers collective bargaining agreement.id.at.none of the bases on which safeway paid its drivers,however,directly compensated them for rest periods.id.at.
the court found safeway compensation system violated california law because the wage order applicable in that case,like wage order,prohibited employers from deduct ing wages for rest periods.bluford,supra,th at.the court explained t he wage order requirement not to deduct wages for rest periods presumes the drivers are paid for their rest periods.ibid.in the context of a compensation plan like the one used by safeway this requirement means that employers must separately compensate employees for rest periods.id.at.
bluford relied on armenta osmose,th,which held that employers can not comply with minimum wage obligations by averaging wages across multiple pay periods instead,t he minimum wage standard applies to each hour worked by employees for which they were not paid.id.at.in armenta,the court addressed a compensation plan that paid employees only for productive time,and not for nonproductive time such as time spent traveling between job sites.the court explained that california wage orders like wage order that require employers to compensate employees for all hours worked require employers to pay employees for all hours,including nonproductive time,at the statutory or agreed rate and no part of this rate may be used as a credit against a minimum wage obligation.armenta,supra,th at.thus,under california law,the minimum or contracted wage requirement applies to each hour worked by employees for which they are not paid.id.at.
compensation plans do not directly account for rest periods during which,like the nonproductive hours in armenta,employees can not earn wages.the court in bluford held that allowing employers like safeway to account for rest periods indirectly by negotiating a purportedly higher piece rate violates the principles set forth in armenta because such compensation plans effectively averag e pay to comply with the minimum wage law instead of separately compensating employees for their rest periods at the minimum or contractual hourly rate.bluford,supra,th at.
we agree with bluford that wage order requires employers to separately compensate employees for rest periods if an employer compensation plan does not already include a minimum hourly wage for such time.see gonzales,supra,th at concluding that the identical language in wage order requires employers to separately pay workers for nonproductive time.all of the federal courts that have considered this issue of california law have reached a similar conclusion and have held employers must separately compensate employees paid by the piece for nonproductive work hours.see perez sun pacific farming,june,wl,ridgeway stores,cal.d,reinhardt gemini motor transport cal.d,carrillo schneider logistics,cal.d,cardenas mclane foodservices,cal.d,ontiveros zamora,no.wl.
c.the requirement to separately compensate for rest periods applies to employees paid on commission 
neither bluford nor the federal cases applying california law involved employees paid on commission.nor did any of those cases address the issue whether the requirement of separately compensating employees for rest periods applies to commissioned employees.we conclude,however,that wage order applies equally to commissioned employees,employees paid by piece rate,or any other compensation system that does not separately account for rest breaks and other nonproductive time.
the plain language of wage order covers employees paid by commission.see cal.code regs.tit,subd.applying to all persons employed in the mercantile industry whether paid on a time,piece rate,commission,or other basis id.at,subd.o wages includes amounts for labor performed by employees of every description,whether the amount is fixed or ascertained by the standard of time,task,piece,commission basis,or other method of calculation.where,as here,the language of a wage order is unambiguous,it is dispositive.brinker,supra,cal th at see also gonzales,supra,th at the wage order does not allow any variance in its application based on the manner of compensation.
moreover,nothing about commission compensation plans justifies treating commissioned employees differently from other employees.see gonzales,supra,th at t hat defendant compensated its technicians on a basis is not a valid ground for varying either the application or interpretation of the wage order ridgeway,supra,d at differences in pay structure are of the issue whether plaintiffs must be paid for all hours worked cardenas,supra,d at distinctions in payment systems do not detract from the holding in armenta that employers must compensate for all hours worked.the commission agreement used by stoneledge during the class period is analytically indistinguishable from a system in that neither allows employees to earn wages during rest periods.indeed,the purpose of a rest period is to rest,not to work.see,subd.b an employer may not require an employee to work during a meal or rest or recovery period mandated pursuant to an applicable wage order augustus,supra,cal th at a rest period,in short,must be a period of rest perez,supra,wl at w hen an employer pays its employees by the piece those employees can not add to their wage during rest breaks a break is not for rest if work continues dlse,enforcement policies and interpretations manual,the rest period begins when the employee reaches an area away from the work station that is appropriate for rest.
stoneledge argues that commission sales may continue through rest periods because sales and resultant commissions are routinely earned while employees are not present,including while on break.stoneledge cites no authority or evidence in the record for this assertion.it also makes no sense to assume that a employee who works minutes per work week longer than another employee for example,by greeting new customers,with potential leads,or answering emails and phone calls related to pending orders would not earn more in commissions than the employee who spent those same minutes in a break room.see cicairos summit logistics,th,citing testimony that an employee did not take rest breaks because rest break s would cost me money balasanyan nordstrom,cal,salespeople may have a difficult time selling to customers and earning commissions when they are not available to customers.stoneledge admits as much when it concedes t he only opportunity lost by taking a rest period is to make a sale that would increase wages beyond the minimum weekly pay rate.
the dlse enforcement policies and interpretations manual supports our conclusion.section of the dlse manual,entitled all hours must be compensated regardless of method used in computation,states that if,as a result of the directions of the employer,the compensation received by piece rate or commissioned workers is reduced because they are precluded,by such directions of the employer,from earning either commissions or piece rate compensation during a period of time,the employee must be paid at least the minimum wage or contract hourly rate if one exists for the period of time the employee opportunity to earn commissions or piece rate is reduced.dlse,enforcement policies and interpretations manual,italics added see peabody,supra,cal th,adopting the dlse manual interpretation of a wage order even though the dlse enforcement policies are not entitled to deference see candy shops,superior court th,although statements in the dlse manual are not binding on the courts because the rules were not adopted under the administrative procedure act,they may be considered for their persuasive value accord,augustus,supra,cal th at brinker,supra,cal th at,fn.thus,the dlse manual treats commissioned and employees alike for purposes of applying the minimum wage requirement to nonproductive working hours.there is no reason california law should not treat these categories of workers the same for purposes of complying with the requirement to provide paid rest periods.
stoneledge responds to the dlse manual interpretation of the labor code and wage orders by seizing on the language that refers to tasks performed as a result of the directions of the employer and arguing that,because rest breaks for commissioned employees do not fall into this category,the dlse manual guidance is not persuasive.the trial court agreed with this argument,stating that rest periods are readily distinguishable from the required yet uncompensated work at issue in other cases.both stoneledge and the trial court,however,improperly discount the language of wage order,which counts rest periods as hours worked and requires compensation for those hours even though rest periods are,admittedly and by design,nonproductive.cal.code regs.tit,subd.a see dlse manual,at subdivision of each wage order requires that the rest period time shall be counted as hours worked for which there shall be no deduction from wages.in addition,by requiring employers to compensate a commissioned employee for time during which the employee is working but precluded from selling such as while in a department meeting or training session,section of the dlse manual does not negate that requirement for time attributable to rest periods.it simply makes clear that commissioned employees,like all employees subject to wage order,are entitled to compensation for each hour worked.
moreover,california law and public policy have lon
