we must decide whether developmentally disabled recipients of medicaid funds and their service providers have a private right of action against state officials to compel the enforcement of a federal law governing state disbursement of such funds.we are also asked to decide,separately,whether the state of california has unlawfully discriminated by allegedly paying service providers lower wages and benefits than it pays employees in state institutions.
in may,seven named plaintiffs representing a class of developmentally disabled individuals,and six organizations that advocate for,or provide services to,the developmentally disabled,brought this action against california officials who manage and administer various state programs for the developmentally disabled.
the class collectively referred to by reference to the first named plaintiff as sanchez consists of those individuals who would be capable of living in the community with properly funded support services but who now live in,or are at risk of living in,state institutions because services are inadequately funded.all members of the class are entitled to services under title xix of the social security act,et the medicaid act,and are qualified individual s with a disability under of the rehabilitation act,a,and under title ii of the americans with disabilities act,the ada.
the organizational plaintiffs the providers are not part of the class,but receive reimbursement from the state of california under the medicaid act for providing services to the developmentally disabled.
the state officials are,respectively,officials of california department of health and human services,department of health services,department of developmental services dds and department of finance.these departments administer and oversee services funded,in part,through the medicaid act.generally,the department of health and human services ensures that the services of the other departments are provided in compliance with state and federal law the department of health services directs,organizes and administers california medical assistance programs,including,california medicaid program dds directs,organizes and administers california developmental disabilities services program and the department of finance oversees all of the state financial and business policies,including health care funding.
under the medicaid act,the federal government distributes funds to participating states to help them provide health care services for the poor and needy.because california accepts medicaid funds,it must administer its state medicaid program,in compliance with a state plan that has been by the department of health and human services.the medicaid act sets out the requirements for a state plan at a.
in,in response to the fact that a disproportionate percentage of medicaid resources were being used for institutional care and studies showing that many persons residing in institutions would be capable of living at home or in the community if additional support services were available,congress authorized the home and community based services hcbs waiver program.the hcbs program allows a variety of noninstitutional care options for persons who would otherwise be eligible for medicaid benefits in an institution,but who would prefer to live at home or in the community to obtain a hcbs waiver for a qualified person,the state must certify that the cost of placing that individual through the waiver program will be less than or equal to the cost of his care in an institution.see generally olmstead,d.
sanchez and the providers claim that,because california pays wages to service providers participating in the hcbs waiver program at a lower rate than it pays employees in state institutions,the state is in violation of the provision of the medicaid act that requires that 
a state plan for medical assistance must provide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of,and the payment for,care and services available under the plan as may be necessary to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.
a a a.they further claim that the lower pay in programs has resulted in some developmentally disabled persons remaining unnecessarily institutionalized,which,they allege,constitutes discrimination against them in violation of the ada and.sanchez and the providers seek injunctive relief requiring the state officials to increase wages and benefits for service providers to match substantially the wages and benefits of employees in state institutions.
the state officials moved for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the a claim,on the ground that a does not provide a private right of action enforceable under,and for summary judgment with respect to the ada and claims,on the ground that sanchez and the providers failed to provide sufficient facts to establish a prima facie case for discrimination.
the district court initially granted the state officials summary judgment motion,but denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the a claim.the state officials subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration of the a claim in light of the supreme court intervening decision in gonzaga doe,d,which clarified the standard for evaluating whether a statute creates a private right of action the district court granted the motion and,by opinion and order dated january,reversed its earlier decision.applying the supreme court guidance in gonzaga,the district court concluded that neither sanchez nor the providers could bring suit under for a violation of a.
sanchez and the providers timely appeal from the district court adverse decisions with respect to both their a and their ada and claims.
both sanchez and the providers claim that a creates an individual right enforceable by them under.their interests,however,though similar,are not congruent.sanchez claim requires us to decide whether a creates a private right of action for recipients of medicaid funding the providers claim requires us to decide the same question with respect to providers of medicaid services.both claims require us to consider the current state of the supreme court private right of action and jurisprudence.
in maine thiboutot,d,the supreme court held for the first time that permits suits against state officials to enforce statutes enacted pursuant to congress spending power.id.at.the scope of these new remedies available under was clarified in pennhurst state school and hospital halderman,d,in which the court explained that thiboutot did not alter the fact that the typical remedy for state noncompliance with federally imposed conditions is not a private cause of action for noncompliance but rather action by the federal government to terminate funds to the state.id.at.pennhurst established that the remedy announced in thiboutot was to be applied sparingly and only to statutes in which congress speak s with a clear voice,and unambiguously creates a right secured by the laws of the united states.id.at.quotation marks omitted.the court also advised that the identification of a substantive right embodied in a statute was only the first of at least two steps that must be considered when analyzing whether that right is enforceable under.id.at.because we conclude that confers no substantive rights,we need not reach the question whether there is a private cause of action under that section or under to enforce those rights.emphasis added.
ten years later,in wilder virginia hospital ass n,d,the court held that a a subsequently repealed of the medicaid act could give rise to a private right of action under.id.at.this anomalous decision appeared to mark a sudden expansion in the court jurisprudence.in hindsight,however,it was merely a rare case in which,as the court explained in gonzaga,a statute explicitly conferred specific monetary entitlements upon the plaintiffs and congress left no doubt of its intent for private enforcement gonzaga,at.
in blessing freestone,d,the court finally provided an analytical framework for courts to use when evaluating whether or not a statute creates a right enforceable under.blessing requires a court to consider three factors congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff,id.at.the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence,and the statute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the states.in other words,the provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory rather than precatory terms.id.at.somewhat confusingly,the first blessing factor addressed whether or not the plaintiff receives an intended benefit from the statute,whereas the second factor referred not to a benefit but to a right.in gonzaga,the court resolved this inconsistency.
the court first acknowledged that s ome language in our opinions might be read to suggest that something less than an unambiguously conferred right is enforceable by.gonzaga,at.referring specifically to the blessing test.correcting this misperception,the court announced that 
w e now reject the notion that our cases permit anything short of an unambiguously conferred right to support a cause of action brought under.section provides a remedy only for the deprivation of rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the united states.accordingly,it is rights,not the broader or vaguer benefits or interests,that may be enforced under the authority of that section.this being so,we further reject the notion that our implied right of action cases are separate and distinct from our cases.to the contrary,our implied right of action cases should guide the determination of whether a statute confers rights enforceable under.
id.at.the court repeatedly stressed that it is congress use of explicit,individually focused,language that reveals congressional intent to create an individually enforceable right in a spending statute see gonzaga,at.t he question whether congress intended to create a private right of action is definitively answered in the negative where a statute by its terms grants no private rights to any identifiable class.quotation marks and alterations omitted,emphasis added 
as examples of paradigmatic language,the court cited the texts of title vi of the civil rights act of and title ix of the education amendments of.id.at.comparing the text of ferpa unfavorably to the individually focused terminology of titles vi and ix.those statutes provide,respectively,that no person in the united states shall be subjected to discrimination,and that no person in the united states shall,on the basis of sex be subjected to discrimination.a.although our inquiry should not be limited to looking for those precise phrases,statutory language less direct than the no person shall must be supported by other indicia so unambiguous that we are left without any doubt that congress intended to create an individual,enforceable right remediable under.
since gonzaga,no federal court of appeals of which we are aware has concluded that a provides medicaid recipients or providers with a right enforceable under.
before gonzaga,the fifth and eighth circuits each held that medicaid recipients had such a private right of action.see evergreen presbyterian ministries,hood,cir.med.soc y,reynolds,cir.pharmacists ass houstoun,cir en banc positing,in dicta,a right for recipients while rejecting such a right for providers visiting nurse ass bullen,cir positing,in dicta,a right for recipients while holding that such a right existed for providers.the first,seventh and eighth circuits held that such a right existed for medicaid providers.see visiting nurse ass n,at cir methodist hosps.sullivan,cir.med.soc y,at.by contrast,the third and fifth circuits explicitly held that a did not create a right enforceable by medicaid providers.see.pharmacists ass n,at evergreen presbyterian ministries,at.
however,in light of gonzaga,the first circuit has since reversed itself in a case involving only the rights of providers.see long term care pharm.alliance ferguson,cir if gonzaga had existed prior to bullen,the panel could not have come to the same result providers such as pharmacies do not have a private right of action under subsection a.with the first circuit example in mind,we turn to the language of a to determine if it unambiguously manifests congressional intent to create individual rights,whether for medicaid recipients or providers,remediable under.
in contrast to the language of title vi and title ix,there is nothing in the text of a that unmistakably focuses on recipients or providers as individuals.moreover,the flexible,administrative standards embodied in the statute do not reflect a congressional intent to provide a private remedy for their violation.
in gonzaga,the supreme court instructed that,when a provision focuse s on the aggregate services provided by the state,rather than the needs of any particular person,it confer s no individual rights and thus can not be enforced by.id.at.quoting blessing,at.like the statute under review in gonzaga,a also has an aggregate focus,rather than an individual focus that would be evidence of an intent to confer an individually enforceable right.the statute speaks not of any individual right but of the state obligation to develop methods and procedures for providing services generally.indeed,the only reference in a to recipients of medicaid services is in the aggregate,as members of the general population in the geographic area.a statutory provision that refers to the individual only in the context of describing the necessity of developing policies and procedures does not reflect a clear congressional intent to create a private right of action.
the text does at least refer explicitly to medicaid providers,but as a means to an administrative end rather than as individual beneficiaries of the statute.the state is directed to provide methods and procedures sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.under a,providers are to be enlisted as subordinate partners in the administration of medicaid services.they may certainly benefit from their relationship with the state,but they are,at best,indirect beneficiaries and it would strain common sense to read a as creating a right enforceable by them.see gonzaga,at.for a statute to create such private rights,its text must be phrased in terms of the persons benefitted.
far from focusing on the rights of a specific class of beneficiaries,a is concerned with a number of competing interests.it requires a state to provide such methods and procedures relating to care and services as may be necessary to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care.the most efficient and economical system of providing care may be one that benefits taxpayers to the detriment of medical providers and recipients likewise,the provision of quality standard may be implied by such a nebulous likely to conflict with the goals of efficiency and economy.the tension between these statutory objectives supports the conclusion that a is concerned with overall methodology rather than conferring individually enforceable rights on individual medicaid recipients.
in gonzaga,justice breyer observed that the broad and nonspecific language of ferpa indicated that congress may well have wanted to achieve the expertise,uniformity,consultation,and resulting administrative guidance that can accompany agency decisionmaking and to avoid the comparative risk of inconsistent interpretations and misincentives that can arise out of an occasional inappropriate application of the statute in a private action for damages.at.breyer,concurring in the judgment.the language of a is similarly to judicial remedy the interpretation and balancing of the statute indeterminate and competing goals would involve making policy decisions for which this court has little expertise and even less authority.
the text and structure of a simply do not focus on an individual recipient or provider right to benefits,nor is the broad and diffuse language of the statute amenable to judicial remedy.we conclude,therefore,that congress has not spoken with an unambiguous,clear voice that would put a state on notice that medicaid recipients or providers are able to compel state action under.
this conclusion follows our discussion of the impact of gonzaga in price city of stockton,cir.in that case,former tenants of hotels and a nonprofit organization involved in assisting the homeless sued the city of stockton,alleging that the closing of residential hotels for health and safety reasons violated federal and state laws,including the housing and community development act.we were asked to decide whether the plaintiffs had a private right of action to enforce the relevant provisions of the act.
we began by observing that,after gonzaga,to create enforceable rights such as would satisfy the first prong of the blessing test the language of the statute must focus on individual entitlement to benefits rather than the aggregate or systemwide policies and practices of a regulated entity.price,at.applying this rule,we noted that f irst and foremost,section k mandates that each grantee shall provide for reasonable benefits to any person involuntarily and permanently displaced as a result of the use of assistance received under this chapter to acquire or substantially rehabilitate property.id.emphasis added.from this language,we concluded that the section is phrased with an unmistakable focus on the benefited class and does not speak only in terms of institutional policy and practice,but rather requires that benefits be provided to particular persons displaced by federally funded redevelopment activities,and,therefore,it evinces a clear intent to create a federal right.id.at quoting gonzaga,at.citations omitted.
we also held that the reasonable benefits to which displaced persons unquestionably are entitled under section k,were not too vague for judicial enforcement.id.because related statutory provisions and regulations enumerate d the monetary benefits to which displaced persons of low and moderate income are entitled,including reimbursement for actual and reasonable moving expenses,security deposits,credit checks,and other expenses,including any interim living costs,id.at,we concluded that the terms of the statute anticipated a clear,enforceable remedy for violations of the rights enumerated in the statute.id.at.
in contrast,we held that other provisions of the statute under consideration do not share section k focus on individual benefits,id.at,and,instead,are directed to governmental agencies and are phrased in aggregate terms,without reference to individual displaced persons.id.emphasis added,quotation marks omitted.we concluded that,i n consideration of this aggregate focus,we hold that the requirements of these other sections of the statute do not create individual rights directly the lack of language and the absence of any focus on individual entitlements,would prevent us from holding that they create individual rights.id.at quotation marks and citation omitted.
because a also lacks language and any focus on individual entitlements,and does not anticipate a judicially enforceable remedy,it shares the flaws that price identified as fatal to the sections of the housing and community development act that we held to be unenforceable.
our conclusion also accords with the first circuit analysis of the text of a in long term care.although that case was concerned only with medicaid providers,its reasoning applies also to recipients.the first circuit noted that a has broad coverage,sets forth general objectives,and mentions no category of entity or person specially protected and has no rights creating language and identifies no discrete class of touchstones in gonzaga analysis and of those earlier cases on which gonzaga chose to build.long term care,at citations omitted.instead,t he provision focuses upon the state as the person regulated rather than individuals protected,suggesting no intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons.id.quotation marks and citation omitted.the court concluded that,s ubsection a presents the same concern that justice breyer identified in gonzaga,namely that much of the statute key substantive language is broad and,id.at quoting gonzaga,at.breyer,concurring in the judgment alteration in original,which suggests that exclusive agency enforcement might fit the scheme better than a plethora of private actions threatening disparate outcomes.id.
we do not believe the third circuit case,sabree richman,cir,which held that it is difficult,if not impossible,as a linguistic matter,to distinguish the import of the relevant title xix language a state plan must provide from the no person shall language of titles vi and ix,id.at,to be applicable to our analysis of a.sabree involved two sections of the medicaid act that are prefaced by language very different from that which introduces a.those provisions specifically focus on entitlements available to all eligible individuals and provide for making medical assistance available to all individuals rather than on the methods and procedures by which a state can balance the often incompatible goals of efficiency,economy,and quality of care in the administration of medicaid services.compare a and a emphases added with a a.the third circuit observed that the phrase a state plan must provide,when read together with the individual focus of a and a,has an overall direction that is similar to the individually focused title vi and ix language approved by the court in gonzaga.such language is also notably absent from a.
although a sets out a comprehensive list of requirements that a state plan must meet,it does not describe every requirement in the same language.some requirements,such as those addressed in sabree,focus on individual recipients,while others are concerned with the procedural administration of the medicaid act by the states and only refer to recipients,if at all,in the aggregate.section a is one of the latter provisions it is directly concerned with the state as administrator and only indirectly with recipients and providers as beneficiaries of the administered services.gonzaga made it clear that simply being the intended beneficiary of a statute is not enough to demonstrate the intentional creation of an enforceable right.
after gonzaga,there can be no doubt that,to satisfy the blessing test,a plaintiff seeking redress under must assert the violation of an individually enforceable right conferred specifically upon him,not merely a violation of federal law or the denial of a benefit or interest,no matter how unambiguously conferred.the text and structure of a do not persuade us that congress has,with a clear voice,intended to create an individual right that either medicaid recipients or providers would be able to enforce under.because we hold that a fails the first prong of the blessing test,we do not need to consider the second and third prongs.
sanchez and the providers also appeal the district court order granting the state officials summary judgment motion with respect to the ada and claims.they allege that california has failed to pursue hcbs waiver reimbursements under medicaid aggressively,which,they further allege,could be used to set payment rates to service providers at a level high enough to provide care for all developmentally disabled persons who desire it.they request an injunction compelling the state officials to increase payments to service providers to prevent what they characterize as the continuing,unnecessary segregation of developmentally disabled persons in institutions.
both the ada and prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability in the administration of a public program receiving federal funding.because of the nearly identical language of and of the rehabilitation act and because the sanchez appellants are qualified individual s with a disability within the meaning of both statutes,for the purposes of this case we construe the two provisions as.barnes gorman,d lovell chandler,cir helen didario,cir.
regulations enacted pursuant to the ada and both express a clear policy preference in favor of integrating developmentally disabled persons into the community over institutional care one regulation requires programs that receive federal funding to administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped persons,d and one of the ada title ii regulations requires a public entity to administer services,programs,and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.d.again,for the purposes of this appeal,we interpret these provisions as.
in granting the state officials motion for summary judgment on sanchez and the providers ada and claims,the district court held that,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of sanchez and the providers,they had failed to establish any material factual dispute with respect to three key issues,all of which were necessary elements of a prima facie case for discrimination.
first,the court held that e ven if unjustified institutionalization is occurring,sanchez and the providers have failed to show that an increase in wages and benefits for direct care workers would remedy the alleged violation.second,the court held that the relief proposed by sanchez and the providers is not a reasonable modification of california current policies and practices because the billion of extra expenditure they request would represent a forty percent increase in the state budget for developmentally disabled services.third,the court held that california already has in place an acceptable plan for deinstitutionalization,the disruption of which would involve a fundamental alteration of the state current policies and practices in contravention of the supreme court instructions in olmstead.if we uphold any one of these conclusions,then the state officials must prevail.
in olmstead,the supreme court interpreted title ii of the ada as forbidding the arbitrary segregation of the disabled in large state institutions.unjustified isolation,the court held,is properly regarded as discrimination based on disability.at.however,the court recognize d,as well,the states need to maintain a range of facilities for the care and treatment of persons with divers mental disabilities,and the states obligation to administer services with an even hand.id.justice ginsburg,writing for a plurality of the court,elaborated on this balancing of integration with competing policy and fiscal considerations,emphasizing that t he state responsibility,once it provides treatment to qualified persons with disabilities,is not boundless.id.at.a state is only required to modify its current practices if the modifications necessary to satisfy the request for increased deinstitutionalization are reasonable and do not fundamentally alter the nature of the state services or program.b a public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies,practices,or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability,unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service,program,or activity.
one state defense under the ada,which was explicitly approved by the court is the existence of a state plan for deinstitutionalization an olmstead plan.the court held that,
i f the state were to demonstrate that it had a comprehensive,effectively working plan for placing qualified persons with mental disabilities in less restrictive settings,and a waiting list that moved at a reasonable pace not controlled by the state endeavors to keep its institutions fully populated,the standard would be met.
the district court concluded that california is currently operating an acceptable deinstitutionalization plan,which,under olmstead,should not be set aside or modified by the courts.
under california law,all persons with developmental disabilities are entitled to free health care services.the lanterman developmental disabilities services act,cal.welf,the lanterman act requires the state to provide a n array of services and supports which is sufficiently complete to meet the needs and choices of each person with developmental disabilities,regardless of age or degree of disability,and at each stage of life and to support their integration into the mainstream life of the community.id.as described by the california supreme court,
t he purpose of the statutory scheme is twofold to prevent or minimize the institutionalization of developmentally disabled persons and their dislocation from family and community,and to enable them to approximate the pattern of everyday living of persons of the same age and to lead more independent and productive lives in the community.
ass for retarded citizens dep t of developmental,cal d,arc citations omitted.the lanterman act gives dds jurisdiction over the execution of the laws relating to the care,custody,and treatment of developmentally disabled persons,cal.welf,but dds role is basically limited to promoting the of the operations of regional centers,and does not extend to the control of the manner in which they provide services or in general operate their programs.arc,at.the lanterman act also established regional centers,independent,private community agencies under contract with the dds,which coordinate services to provide each developmentally disabled person with services that enable him to live in the community.id.
through the regional centers,california provides care services for more than developmentally disabled persons.of these,approximately live in one of seven large,congregate institutions called developmental centers,which are located throughout the state and are operated by dds.although they are operated by dds,it is the regional centers that determine if a consumer needs to be institutionalized in a developmental center and for how long.regional centers are required to develop an individual program plan for each consumer.once an individual plan is prepared,the responsible regional center must review it annually and modify it as necessary.an individual plan must include an assessment of the consumer capabilities and limitations,a statement of objectives for improving his situation,a schedule of the type and amount of services necessary to achieve these objectives,and a schedule of periodic review to ensure that the services have been provided and the objectives met.
the percent of developmentally disabled persons who receive care in the community do so either at intermediate care facilities,which are licensed to provide nursing care and are scattered throughout the state community care facilities,which provide,residential care for developmentally disabled persons in need of personal services,and supervision or assistance essential for or through a variety of day programs and residential support services for developmentally disabled persons who live at home or in the community.it is the regional centers that select and contract with these community based service providers,which include family home agencies,foster family agencies,independent living programs,supported living services,and other support programs,such as vocational training,transportation,health care,respite services,community integration training,community activities support,adaptive skills training,behavior management,tutors,special education,recreation therapy,counseling,infant development,and speech pathology.
care of developmentally disabled persons in these programs may be eligible for medicaid reimbursement pursuant to the hcbs waiver program.however,in order to qualify for medicaid reimbursement,the recipient must be a low income person and the services must also be provided at a lower cost than if they were provided in a state institution.for qualifying recipients using qualifying services,medicaid provides matching funds equal to approximately half of the cost of those services 
the number of places in the hcbs waiver program is capped and a state must apply for any increases
