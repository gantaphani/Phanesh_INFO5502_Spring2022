introduction 
plaintiff asserts class action and individual claims for violations of the labor code.he alleges that defendant,his former employer,provided paystubs containing misstatements in violation of labor code section an employer,however,can not be liable for misstatements on paystubs unless it knowingly and intentionally makes such misstatements and an employee suffers injury as a result.plaintiff can not prove either element in this case.
plaintiff also asserts causes of action based on section on the ground that defendant failed to ensure that plaintiff and other class members took all meal periods and rest periods they were entitled to take.california law,however,only requires that employers make available such periods,which defendant did here.
we affirm the trial court order granting defendant summary adjudication with respect to plaintiff section and section causes of action.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff employment at public storage.
plaintiff and appellant fred brinkley worked as a property manager for defendant and respondent public storage,for a little more than four months before defendant terminated his employment.plaintiff was a employee.
plaintiff and other property managers received paychecks from defendant twice per month.the paychecks included a paystub called an earnings statement,which stated the hours worked,gross pay,pay rate,taxes withheld and other information regarding the employee compensation.the paystubs listed three categories of pay regular earnings,overtime earnings and assoc mileage,associated mileage.
plaintiff and other property managers were paid per hour worked for associated mileage,regardless of whether they traveled for work purposes and,if so,the number of miles they traveled.additionally,managers received actual reimbursement of all mileage expenses incurred in excess of miles for travel to specified meetings.
certain of plaintiff paystubs erroneously stated per hour as the rate for associated mileage instead of the actual rate of per hour the number of associated mileage hours and the dollar amount paid for associated mileage,however,were accurately stated in these paystubs.
an outside payroll service,adp,adp,prepared defendant paychecks and paystubs based on information provided by defendant.after plaintiff commenced this action,adp corrected the rate for associated mileage stated on the paystubs pursuant to defendant instructions.defendant claims that it did not know of this error prior to the lawsuit and that the error was inadvertent.
meal periods 
defendant had a policy requiring all employees to take a meal period whenever an employee worked at least five hours in a shift.further,employees were required to sign in and out during their meal break,but from did not do so.plaintiff understood that defendant policy required him and all hourly employees to take a meal period.james bottini and cindy kohler,two former managers who filed declarations opposing defendant motion for summary adjudication,also understood this policy.plaintiff g enerally took a meal period at some point.
defendant senior vice president candace krol testified that the company has reprimanded employees for working during lunch.krol was unaware of any employee being paid one hour of regular wages for failing to take a meal break.
plaintiff,bottini and kohler claim that they regularly worked shifts longer than six hours and rarely took an uninterrupted lunch within the first five hours of their shift.plaintiff timecards indicate that at times plaintiff did not take a meal break until more than five or six hours after his shift commenced.
rest periods 
defendant employee handbook states that employees may take two rest periods each day.it further states that such periods should be scheduled,insofar as possible,midway through the morning and midway through the afternoon.plaintiff received this handbook when he began his employment with defendant.defendant advised plaintiff and other employees at a district meeting that they were required to take rest and lunch breaks.plaintiff claims he rarely took rest breaks in the middle of any shift.
plaintiff allegations 
although his first amended complaint sets forth six causes of action,plaintiff only appeals from the trial court summary adjudication in defendant favor of plaintiff third,fifth and sixth causes of action.in his third cause of action,plaintiff alleges that defendant violated section by failing to provide plaintiff and the class he represents an accurate accounting of earned wages.in his fifth cause of action,plaintiff alleges that defendant violated section by failing to provide plaintiff and the class he represents meal periods as required by the statute.in his sixth cause of action,plaintiff alleges that defendant violated section by failing to provide plaintiff and the class he represents rest periods as required by the statute.
class certification 
on november,the court entered an order granting plaintiff class certification with respect to specified subclasses relating to plaintiff paystub and meal period claims.the paystub subclass included all property managers who received wage statements containing inaccurate mileage reimbursement rates and hours for reimbursable miles driven while working for defendant.
the meal period subclass included all property managers who worked a period of more than hours a without a meal period of not less than minutes or b without a meal period within the first five hours of work or worked a period of more than hours per day i without being provided a second meal period of not less than minutes,ii without a meal period within the second five hours of work except if a the total hours worked were not more than hours per day,b the second meal period except sic was waived by mutual consent of public storage,and the employee,and c if the first meal period was not waived.
the court did not certify a subclass of employees in connection with plaintiff rest period claims.
motion for summary adjudication 
on march,defendant filed a motion for summary judgment,or in the alternative,for summary adjudication.on june,the court denied defendant motion for summary judgment and granted,in part,its motion for summary adjudication.the court ruled that defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law with respect to plaintiff third,fifth and sixth causes of action.plaintiff filed a timely appeal from this order
