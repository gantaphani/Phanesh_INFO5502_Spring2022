plaintiffs,marc bacon and terry harden,brought this employment discrimination action against defendant honda of america manufacturing,seeking to represent a class of all current and former employees at honda four manufacturing plants located in central ohio.plaintiffs appeal,asking for review of both the denial of class certification and the subsequent grant of summary judgment to honda on all of plaintiffs individual claims.bacon and harden allege that the company uses discriminatory procedures for promoting employees in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et,ohio revised code,and ohio common law.the district court correctly determined that bacon and harden failed to meet the prerequisites for class certification and that they could not show that they were denied promotions for which they were eligible.for the reasons elaborated upon below,we affirm the decision of the district court in its entirety.
on august,bacon and harden plaintiffs,who were employed as nonexempt production associates pas for honda,filed a class action complaint,alleging that honda engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination against employees by denying them promotions.relying on both disparate impact and disparate treatment theories to prove liability,plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief,promotion to desired positions,back pay,and compensatory and punitive damages.
honda has four manufacturing plants in central ohio marysville auto plant map marysville motorcycle plant mmp anna engine plant aep and east liberty plant elp.these four facilities have various purposes that range from manufacture of accord and acura automobiles,to production of honda motorcycles,to building of engines and other components.in addition,honda plants have quality departments,which are responsible for inspecting products coming off the line purchasing departments and various administrative offices,such as human resources.in all,there are departments at honda.
sixty percent of honda employees are production associates,who are nonexempt employees supervised by team leaders,the first supervisory level.production staff share this secondary level of authority with team leaders.the next level of management is production coordinator,an exempt position,who reports to an assistant manager or department manager,who in turn reports to a senior manager or plant manager.
in general,production associates may seek promotion to team leader but only in the department in which they are currently working.furthermore,an employee becomes eligible for promotion only after meeting minimum requirements for time working both in the department and for honda in general.in addition,he or she must have a strong attendance record,typically percent or above,and a disciplinary record that shows no counseling by a manager within the past twelve months.past performance evaluations are also taken into account and some departments require the production associate to pass a trade test to have completed a certain number of special projects.a team leader must be willing to work any shift or to travel.see bacon honda of am,giving detailed description of honda production facilities and corporate structure.
the motion for class certification was filed in september,and an evidentiary hearing was held in december.on march,the district court denied the motion for class certification,finding that plaintiffs did not satisfy the requirements of commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation with respect to the disparate treatment claims under.a the predominance of monetary relief precluded certification of injunctive class under rule b requirements for class certification under rule b were not met and seventh amendment concerns made bifurcation and certification of certain issues improper,or at least prevented that process from being the most fair and efficient way to litigate the claims.id.at.
honda moved for summary judgment on plaintiffs individual claims.the plaintiffs filed a rule f motion in response,requesting a revised discovery schedule and a new trial date.the district court denied the motion,although it allowed one additional deposition.on april,the district court granted summary judgment to honda on the individual claims of bacon and harden.that order thoroughly addressed each of the plaintiffs claims under both the disparate impact and disparate treatment theories.this appeal followed.
class action certification 
this court reviews denial of class action certification for abuse of discretion.alkire irving,cir.in order for one or more litigants to represent all parties in a class,four prerequisites must be met the class must be so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,there must be questions of law or fact common to the class,the claims or defenses of the representative parties must be typical of the claims or defenses of the class,and the representative parties must fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.a.in this case the district court conducted the mandatory rigorous analysis to confirm that the prerequisites of rule a have been satisfied.falcon,d.we agree with its conclusion that the disparate treatment claim fails the second,and the disparate impact claim the third,part of the rule a test.
numerosity 
there is no automatic point at which the number of plaintiffs makes joinder impractical,thereby making a suit the only viable alternative.in re am.med,cir.however,sheer number of potential litigants in a class,especially if it is more than several hundred,can be the only factor needed to satisfy rule a.herbert newberg alba conte,newberg on class actions,at ed.the facts of the case guide a court determination that the class is sufficiently large to make joinder impractical.eeoc,d.in this case,bacon proposes a class of some current and former honda employees,a number well beyond the point that joinder would be feasible.the requirement of rule a is met.
commonality 
in order to show disparate treatment,a potential class representative must show that the employer intentionally discriminated against a protected class and that there are questions of law or fact common to the class.falcon,at.burger,concurring in part.the supreme court has noted that class certification is appropriate when i t is unlikely that differences in the factual background of each claim will affect the outcome of the legal issue.califano yamasaki,d upholding class certification for litigation of an issue of interest to all social security beneficiaries.variations in the circumstances of class members are acceptable,as long as they have at least one issue in common.in re am,at citations omitted reversing a grant of certification because the putative plaintiffs had used many different models of a certain medical device,which had produced a range of side effects,so that the malfunction could not be attributed to a common cause 
bacon and harden were responsible for satisfying the court concerns related to whether 
i the nature of the alleged unlawful employment practice genuinely had a impact 
ii employment practices affecting the class were uniform or diverse,given factors such as size of the work force,number of plants involved range of employment conditions,occupations,and work activities geographic dispersion of the employees and extent of employee transfers 
iii members treatment would be likely to involve common questions 
iv relevant employment and personnel policies and practices were centralized and uniform and 
v similar conditions prevailed throughout the time period covered by the allegations.
stastny bell and,cir citing harriss pan am.world airways,newberg,at requiring a specific showing of underlying facts that might raise an inference of a common pattern or practice through allegations of specific incidents of discrimination,supporting affidavits,or evidence at the class certification hearing.
bacon and harden are attempting to certify a class of all workers at honda four ohio facilities over the past twenty years who were involved in the company promotion system.they assert that subjective practices and similar promotion criteria across departments satisfy the requirements of rule a.conclusory allegations and general assertions of discrimination are not sufficient to establish commonality.falcon,at.plaintiffs failed to show how hourly wage earners and salaried employees would have the same interests,especially in terms of promotion procedures in which at least some of the nonexempt employees would be competing to join the ranks of exempt management.they also did not demonstrate how differing promotion criteria for jobs as diverse as welding,accounting,and could discriminate against each employee.nor did they elaborate on why this court should disregard the objective criteria for promotion and find that all employees were harmed by managers who made subjective decisions.
we hold that plaintiffs have failed to produce sufficient evidence to convince us that the district court abused its discretion in finding that the factors enumerated above had not been met.we view with skepticism a class that encompasses both workers and supervisors workers and those in administrative positions workers in four plants with different production capabilities and workers and supervisors spread over more than departments.because class members have such different jobs,we find it difficult to envisage a common policy regarding promotion that would affect them all in the same manner.
the only way bacon and harden can place such a diverse group under one umbrella is to demonstrate that honda operated in a discriminatory fashion against all the workers in the class through an entirely subjective process.falcon,at.if they can make this showing,then they can establish commonality and typicality.however,honda is not completely subjective it also uses objective criteria for promotion,such as time in service,attendance records,and test scores bacon and harden rebut this by citing another supreme court case that held that mixed systems for determining promotions would generally have to be subjective in nature.watson worth bank trust,d.
we do not accept the argument that honda process is entirely subjective because,as a matter of fact,it is not.plaintiffs can not avoid the heavy lifting of showing eligibility for class certification by conflating two exceptions to separate rules for adjudicating discrimination cases.an entirely subjective process may,theoretically,allow different kinds of employees to be in the same question of class membership falcon.for the entirely separate purpose of establishing a prima facie case of disparate impact,mixed objective and subjective standards may be considered to be purely subjective watson.see k b i.
the two exceptions are not interchangeable,however.plaintiffs are trying to demonstrate eligibility for class membership,which is governed by the entirely subjective requirement in falcon.they must prove that the potential members of the class actually have something in common they are subject to random.as an entirely separate matter,the court has been cognizant of the difficulties inherent in proving discrimination and therefore set a relatively low bar for establishing a prima facie case.see,texas dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d the burden of establishing a prima facie case of disparate treatment is not onerous.therefore,counting mixed criteria as subjective furthers the goal of making sure that valid claims get to a jury.the constructive subjectivity in watson can not substitute for the actual and complete subjectivity required for the exception in falcon because the cases deal with two unrelated legal issues class membership and the elements of a prima facie case.we hold that the falcon requirement is not met because the plaintiffs have not shown that the wide range of class members are all subject to the same,process.
bacon and harden rely on senter general motors,but the class in that case was more circumscribed the class consisted of all black employees who,during a period between july,and september,were denied an opportunity for promotion to salaried supervisory positions from hourly positions although possessing seniority and qualifications equivalent to white employees who were so promoted.senter motors,cir.in contrast,plaintiffs here want to certify a class of employees who worked at honda over a period of twenty years in both hourly and salaried positions with different qualifications and varying levels of seniority.senter focused on one transitional step in the career path of the plaintiffs over a period the jump from hourly wage earner to salaried employee.in contrast,plaintiffs are challenging honda practices for all promotions,regardless of department or starting point in the company hierarchy,and regardless of comparability in objective qualifications.therefore,senter can be distinguished from the facts of this case and does not compel us to find that the commonality factor has been met.
typicality 
assuming,arguendo,that honda promotion procedures had a disparate impact on employees,we hold that neither bacon nor harden is a typical member of the class.the typicality requirement is designed to limit the class claims to those fairly encompassed by the named plaintiff claims,at.in order to meet the typicality requirement,the plaintiffs must show that their injury arises from or is directly related to a wrong to a class,and that wrong includes the wrong to the plaintiff.in re am,at quoting newberg,supra,at.however,their personal choices,independent of any practices by honda that have a disparate impact,have rendered them ineligible for promotion for the majority of their time at the company.therefore,honda can assert legitimate reasons,or business reasons,for not promoting them,which would not be available as an explanation for discrimination against other employees.
honda career track on the production line starts with production associates.the next rung up the ladder is team leader or production staff.from july to july,of promoted pas were elevated to team leader or production staff in their home departments.the remaining were promoted to a different type of work,such as quality control or administration.in,map assembly,where both plaintiffs worked for the majority of their tenure,changed its policy to no longer allow promotion directly from production associate to production staff a line worker would have either to request promotion to team leader,transfer out of the department with the attendant wait for eligibility,or seek promotion to administration or the quality department.
the position of team leader is not inherently desirable it requires availability for overtime and imposes added responsibility for a marginal increase in pay.therefore,advancement through transfer to a parallel track is desirable,but,like any career shift,involves overcoming an experience deficit in comparison to other candidates.both named plaintiffs in this case chose to avoid seeking advancement through becoming a team leader and concentrated on acquiring positions in the quality department or administration.because this strategy circumscribed their chances for advancement,we hold that they are not typical of workers at honda.
bacon started working at honda in and was first eligible for promotion in april.he was eligible for months until may,when he transferred to a new department map assembly.in,when there were three promotions to team leader,bacon was not eligible for consideration because he did not have the attendance required for the position and had not completed an overtime special project new honda nh circle within the last months,another prerequisite.from,he did not express interest in a production team leader position and so was not eligible for consideration,and he did not take the required test in.he transferred to a new department mmp assembly in,rendering him ineligible for promotion until february.in april,the promotion process was changed to be considered for elevation to team leader,an employee had to submit a pool interest form,which bacon never did.
in order to be considered for a position in a department,an employee had to fill out a career interest application cia,which was valid for one year.bacon filled out cias in during most of which time he was not eligible for any promotion,and.selection for interviews under this program was done by blind assessment of the application form.bacon was selected for interviews on several occasions,including three times in the purchasing department,but not selected because other candidates had stronger educational backgrounds and experience.four and twelve caucasians were promoted through this process from.
harden was hired in and became eligible for promotion in march.he expressed interest in promotion to team leader or production staff,which remained a possibility for months,until may,when he requested,and was authorized,to transfer to another department map assembly,making him ineligible for promotion for the next months.in,harden indicated a desire for promotion to production staff,which was no longer an option due to the change in policy in map assembly,or to the quality department.he was not considered for promotion to team leader because he did not indicate interest furthermore,he also did not meet the qualification of attendance or participation in overtime special projects required for consideration.
harden rejected the most obvious path to advancement and was not eligible to be considered for team leader until april,when he indicated that he wanted to take the qualification test.he received a score of on that exam,some ten points below the cutoff,and therefore was not eligible for a team leader position he did not take the exam in.in april,the promotion process was changed and to be considered for elevation to team leader,an employee had to submit a pool interest form,which harden did not do.in,he did not see the notification,posted on september,of the october deadline for submitting the requisite interest form to take the qualification test.he heard about the possibility from his wife around october,but was out on bereavement leave starting october and did not return until october,when honda determined that it was too late to sign up for the october test.harden joined this lawsuit on february.
therefore,largely as a result of his personal promotion preference,harden was eligible for promotion to team leader for only months out of the ten years at issue in this case.he expressed interest in,and pursued,other avenues of advancement,most notably inclusion in the pool for employment in the quality department.because he was pursuing a different career track,he was unable to compete with other candidates who had directly relevant experience.harden was so often ineligible for promotion,particularly for the position of team leader that he was most likely to get,he can not reasonably represent the interests of those who may have consistently applied for promotion and been turned down for discriminatory reasons.
in sum,to qualify for class certification,all the parts of rule a must be met.on their class certification claim based on disparate treatment,plaintiffs can not demonstrate a common issue of fact or law applicable to every member of the proposed class.on their disparate impact claim,plaintiffs can not show that the facially neutral policies regarding promotion affected them in a typical way because they opted out of the most common and reliable path of advancement.the plaintiffs can not meet the requirements of rule a and and the district court correctly denied class certification.
we therefore do not consider the rule a issue of whether the plaintiffs attorneys could fairly represent the class due to their involvement in parallel litigation against honda.in light of the posture of this case,it would be inappropriate for us to address the split between the second and fifth circuits concerning whether monetary damages can be sought in a rule b class action suit,and we do not decide any aspect of that question in this opinion.compare allison citgo petroleum,cir with robinson metro commuter,cir.we therefore turn to the plaintiffs individual claims of discrimination under theories of disparate treatment and disparate impact.
individual claims 
the district court granted summary judgment to honda on bacon and harden claims of individual disparate treatment and disparate impact.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.pinney dock transp.penn cent,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
disparate treatment 
the plaintiffs claim of disparate treatment is analyzed under the rubic established in mcdonnell douglas.mcdonnell douglas green,d.the same basic pattern is used in a claim concerning racial discrimination in promotion specifically,each plaintiff must show that he is a member of a protected class he applied for and was qualified for a promotion,he was considered for and denied the promotion and other employees of similar qualifications who were not members of the protected class received promotions at the time the plaintiff request for promotion was denied.nguyen city of cleveland,cir.the district court provided a detailed analysis demonstrating how failure to establish a prima facie case warrants summary judgment on the individual claims and we need not belabor the issue,other than to affirm a few critical points of law.
method of proof 
the district court found,based on the weight of authority outside the sixth circuit,that the method of proving discrimination,in which the plaintiff shows that the company had a policy of discriminating against a protected class,is not available to individual plaintiffs.see,lowery circuit city stores,cir,vacated on other grounds,d brown coach stores,cir.all interpret the supreme court discussion of the method of proof as being limited to class actions or suits by the government.int l of teamsters united states,d.although plaintiffs argue on appeal that the district court improperly analyzed their basis for class certification,they have not specifically challenged the court finding that the method of proof is not available to them on their individual claims.
we therefore hold that the method of proving discrimination is not available to individual plaintiffs.we subscribe to the rationale that a claim is focused on establishing a policy of discrimination because it does not address individual hiring decisions,it is inappropriate as a vehicle for proving discrimination in an individual case.lowery,at observing that t he supreme court has never applied the teamsters method of proof in a private,suit charging employment discrimination.rather,the court has noted that there is a manifest and crucial difference between an individual claim of discrimination and a class action alleging a general pattern or practice of discrimination.citing cooper fed.reserve bank of richmond,d.this reading has also been adopted by at least one district court in this circuit.herendeen.state police,d.however,evidence may be relevant to proving an individual claim for disparate treatment under the mcdonnell douglas framework.
exemption from application requirement 
as demonstrated above,bacon and harden were not eligible for promotion for a sizable percentage of their tenure at honda,did not apply to be in the available promotion pools,as required in part two of the test for a prima facie case.they now argue that they should be exempt from such a requirement because,given the discriminatory nature of promotions at honda,such an application would have been futile.although it is true that failure to apply for a promotion may be excused,the circumstances must reveal overwhelming evidence of pervasive discrimination in all aspects of the employer internal employment practices,and that any application would have been futile and perhaps foolhardy.harless duck,cir quoted in kreuzer brown,cir.plaintiffs can not come close to meeting this standard.not only did other receive some of the promotions for which the plaintiffs applied,but bacon supervisor expressed willingness to help him in his application to the purchasing department.nor was the application process arduous in most cases,all the plaintiffs had to do was fill out a form expressing interest.it is not unreasonable to expect plaintiffs to make such a minimal effort to preserve their rights.
