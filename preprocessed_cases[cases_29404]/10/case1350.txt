park university enterprises,park university was sued in a state court class action by jc hauling company jc hauling for alleged violations of the telephone consumer protection act tcpa,a federal statute that bans unsolicited fax advertisements.park university insurer,american casualty company of reading,american,declined to provide any defense or coverage in the action.park university filed this action seeking a declaratory judgment that american has a duty to defend it in the underlying state court suit.on for partial judgment on the pleadings,the district court concluded that american does owe park university a defense,park,am.cas.of reading,d,and certified that decision as final under.b.we affirm 
the tcpa makes it unlawful for any person to use any telephone facsimile machine,computer,or other device to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine.b c.it defines an unsolicited advertisement as any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property,goods,or services which is transmitted to any person without that person prior express invitation or permission.id.a.the act creates a private right of action that permits recipients of unwanted faxes to seek injunctions and damages,and allows courts to grant treble damages if they find a fax sender has acted willfully or knowingly.id.b.
jc hauling filed suit in illinois state court alleging that park university violated the tcpa when it sent an advertisement to jc hauling telephone fax machine in illinois without prior express invitation or permission.at.it brought the suit as a class action consisting of all individuals who received unsolicited advertisements via fax from or on behalf of park university.id.jc hauling sought an injunction and treble damages,contending that park university actions were willful and knowing and that it knew or should have known that it did not have the prior express invitation or permission of plaintiff and the other members of the class to send the advertisements and knew or should have known that its actions constitute a violation of law.id.at.in response,park university asserted that any fax advertisements it sent to jc hauling were not unsolicited because park university had an existing business relationship with jc hauling or,in the alternative,it had prior express invitation or permission from jc hauling to send the fax advertisement.specifically,park university contended that any fax it had sent to jc hauling was addressed to patty evansco,one if its employees,who had registered for one of park university seminars while acting in the scope of her employment and had supplied jc hauling fax number to park university.consequently,park university denied intentionally violating the tcpa.
park university has a commercial general liability insurance policy with american and sought a defense and coverage upon jc hauling instigation of the state class action suit.american declined to provide either,prompting park university to bring the instant action.park university contends the insurance company owes it a defense under two different provisions of its policy property damage liability coverage and advertising injury liability coverage 
the property damage provision of the policy states 
bodily injury and property damage liability 
insuring agreement 
a.we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.we will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages.
b.this insurance applies to bodily injury and property damage only if t he bodily injury or property damage is caused by an occurrence.
id.at emphasis added.property damage includes the l oss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured id.at.the policy defines an occurrence as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.id.at.it does not,however,define the terms loss of use or accident.finally,the policy excludes coverage for property damage expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.id.at emphasis added.
the advertising injury provision states in relevant part 
personal and advertising injury liability 
insuring agreement 
a.we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of personal and advertising injury to which this insurance applies.we will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages.
id.at.the policy defines advertising injury as injury,including consequential bodily injury,arising out of o ral or written publication of material that violates a person right of privacy.id.at emphasis added.the terms oral or written publication and right of privacy are not defined.the policy characterizes an advertisement as a notice that is broadcast or published to the general public or specific market segments about your goods,products or services for the purpose of attracting customers or supporters.id.at.
both parties moved for partial judgments on the pleadings pursuant to.c.the district court concluded that american has a duty to defend park university in the state action under the property damage and the advertising injury provisions of the policy.park,d at.we address each issue in turn.
we review a district court grant of a motion for judgment on the pleadings de novo,using the same standard that applies to a rule b motion.see aspenwood inv.martinez,cir.so doing,we accept all facts pleaded by the party as true and grant all reasonable inferences from the pleadings in favor of the same.judgment on the pleadings should not be granted unless the moving party has clearly established that no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.united states any all radio station transmission,cir.as with our practice for motions to dismiss under rule b,documents attached to the pleadings are exhibits and are to be considered in our review of the district court grant of park university rule c motion.see hall bellmon,cir.c.
our primary task is to construe the insurance policy between park university and american.because this case arises under our diversity jurisdiction,we apply kansas principles.trierweiler croxton trench holding,cir.kansas follows the general rule that the law of the state where the insurance contract is made controls.safeco ins.of am.allen.the policy in this case was made for park university in kansas and was delivered to it there.as a result,we apply kansas law.like any other contract,the language of an insurance policy is construed to give effect to the intention of the parties.catholic diocese of dodge city raymer.if a policy is unambiguous,the intention of the parties and the meaning of the contract are determined from the instrument itself.wolfgang.motorsports,cir applying kansas law.under kansas law,the test for determining the meaning of an insurance policy language is what a reasonable person in the position of the policyholder would understand the language to mean.see farm bureau mut.ins.horinek.moreover,the duty to defend under an insurance policy is not necessarily coextensive with the duty to indemnify.spivey safeco ins.rather,an insurer duty to defend arises whenever there is a potential of liability under the policy.see also state farm fire cas.finney.the insurer determines if there is a potential of liability under the policy by examining the allegations in the complaint or petition and considering any facts brought to its attention or which it could reasonably discover.spivey,at emphasis added.with these principles in mind,we turn to the policy provisions.
property damage 
under the property damage provision at issue here,a duty to defend arises if a plaintiff contends that loss of use of tangible property was caused by an occurrence.american agrees that sending an unsolicited fax can result in loss of use of tangible property.here,jc hauling lost the use of its fax machine,ink,and paper.see missouri ex rel.nixon am.blast fax,cir discussing tcpa legislative history identifying the range of harms created by junk faxes.american nevertheless maintains that this loss of use was not caused by an occurrence because the loss of use damages were inflicted intentionally by park university and were therefore not the result of an accident within the meaning of the policy.it also argues that kansas public policy prohibits its coverage for loss or damage,so that the loss would be excluded under the policy intentional act exclusion even if it could be deemed an occurrence.we are not persuaded by these arguments.
in determining for insurance purposes whether the damages resulting from an insured acts were accidental and therefore an occurrence under a policy,the state of kansas follows the natural and probable consequences test.under this test,an insured intent to injure can be inferred if the resulting injury,from the standpoint of the insured,is the natural and probable consequence of the act ultimately causing the injury.harris richards.a finding of specific intent to injure is not necessary.id.at.alternatively,even if an act itself is intentional,it may result in an unintended injury.spruill motors,universal underwriters ins,duty to defend where intentional wrongful taking of truck resulted in unintentional injury see also state farm fire cas.falley,d.therefore,when determining whether an insurer is required to defend an insured under a policy barring coverage for intentional injuries,the courts must examine,from the standpoint of the insured,whether the injury for which insurance coverage is being sought is the natural and probable consequence of the insured act.
the district court held there was a possible occurrence under the policy because the alleged property damage may have been an accident and not the natural and probable consequence of park university intentional fax transmission.in arguing to the contrary,american cited case law supporting the general proposition that intent to injure can be inferred from an intentional act because the resulting injury was the natural and probable consequence of the act.see,harris,at no occurrence under policy where insured fired shots into vehicle knowing it was occupied and as a result one occupant was killed and the other severely injured spivey,at applying missouri law similar to that in kansas and finding no coverage where insured could expect injury from intentionally threatening with weapons,firing a gun at her,and forcing her to perform sexual acts see also bell tilton,no duty to indemnify where one could infer intent to injure from insured intent to hit playmate with pellet from bb gun.the district court distinguished these cases as inapposite,because their egregious facts clearly supported an inference under the natural and probable consequences test that by the insureds intentional acts they also intended to cause injury.park,d at.the court declined to draw the same inference from park university intentional fax transmission,reasoning that the recipient of a fax is not injured by the loss of paper and use of its fax machine if he or she welcomes or solicits the fax.thus,because park university believed it was transmitting a fax to a recipient who wished to receive it whether mistaken or not,one could not conclude it intended to injure the recipient.id.at.consequently,the alleged injury was potentially an occurrence within the meaning of the policy,requiring american to defend park university.id.under this reasoning,the court also rejected american arguments that the damages were,see atchison,topeka santa fe ry.stonewall ins,is a defense to policy providing coverage for accidents,and that the policy exclusion for expected or intended injury should apply.park,d at.
on appeal,park university does not dispute that it intentionally sent a fax.instead,it reasserts its claim that it did not intend to injure the fax recipient because it believed the fax was solicited,either as part of an existing business relationship or through prior express invitation or permission.we agree with the district court that the distinction under kansas law between intent to act and intent to injure is dispositive in this case.see spruill motors,at.significantly,the policy provides the intent to injure must be inferred from the standpoint of the insured.at see harris,at.when park university sent the fax to jc hauling,it thought it had permission to do so.hence,from its standpoint,any resulting use of jc hauling fax machine,paper,and toner could not have resulted in injury because park university thought the fax was welcome.unlike intentionally firing a gun into an occupied car as in harris or intentionally firing a gun at an employee and forcing her to perform sexual acts as in spivey,neither of which is even arguably a welcome act,jc hauling injury can not be deemed the natural and probable consequence of park university act in sending the fax when park university thought jc hauling welcomed the transmission.if park university intentionally sent a solicited fax,one can not infer it intended to injure the recipients anymore than one can infer from the intentional taking of someone truck that the driver subsequent accidental injury of the victim was intentional,as in spruill motors.
this case is distinguishable from two other federal circuit court cases holding that property damage insurance provisions did not require a duty to defend in tcpa cases.see resource bankshares paul mercury,cir,cert.denied,d am.states ins.capital assocs.of jackson county,cir.contrary to the present case,where the question of park university intent to cause injury to those it sent faxes lies at the heart of the underlying controversy,the intentional nature of the alleged injuries in american states appears to have been wholly undisputed.see at.moreover,the underlying state complaint here alleged both intentional and negligent conduct park university knew or should have known that it did not have the prior express invitation or permission of plaintiff to send the advertisements and knew or should have known that its actions constitute a violation of law.at emphasis added.in american states,the court focused its brief analysis regarding the property damage insurance clause solely on intentional conduct.at.because an occurrence could result from negligent conduct on the part of park university,any need for analysis of whether intentional conduct and injury occurred is obviated.see,fidelity deposit of hartford cas.ins,d,noting that natural and probable consequences test has not been applied to allegations of negligent conduct by an insured.
in resource bankshares,at,the plaintiff argued that although it did send a fax,it only intended to fax ads to recipients who actually wanted them,and only did otherwise inadvertently.the plaintiff cited the district court published opinion from the instant case in support of its argument that a tcpa violation could be accidental.id.the court pointed out that the tcpa defines unsolicited advertisement as one that is transmitted to any person without that person prior express invitation or permission.a emphasis added.id.because the plaintiff there failed to present any evidence that would cause a reasonable person to mistakenly believe that they had received prior express consent to send their fax ads,the resource bankshares court decided against it on summary judgment.id.at.we stand in a different posture here because we are reviewing the district court judgment on the pleadings.in so doing,we are permitted to treat exhibits attached to a complaint as part of the pleadings.indus.constructors bureau of reclamation,cir citation omitted.park university assertions that its actions were in fact solicited are clearly expressed in its answer in the state court action,which in turn was attached to the complaint in this case.at,resources bankshares is thus inapposite.
in conclusion,under the minimal potential of liability standard of kansas law,see finney,at,we conclude that an occurrence was possible under the insurance contract,and that american must provide a defense to park university pursuant to the property damage provision.for similar reasons,as detailed by the district court,see park
