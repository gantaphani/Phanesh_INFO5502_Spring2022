opinion of the court 
this matter came before the united states court of appeals for the third circuit on appeal from a final judgment of the united states district court for the district of new jersey.appellant brought a class action and appellees filed a motion to compel arbitration based upon an agreement between the parties.the district court treated the motion to compel as a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b and dismissed appellant complaint with prejudice in favor of arbitration on an individual basis.this appeal raises important issues under state law.nevertheless,we must first consider whether the federal arbitration act faa,precludes this court from applying state law unconscionability principles to void a waiver.we conclude that it does not.see doctor associates,casarotto,d u nconscionability may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening the faa.
factual and procedural background 
american express centurion bank aecb is a utah industrial bank engaged in the business of,among other things,issuing american express credit cards.american express company aec is a new york corporation and is the ultimate parent of aecb.in september of,aec started a promotional credit card reward program in which it claimed that users of its blue cash credit card blue cash card could earn up to cash back on purchases made with the card.on february,aecb issued a blue cash card to appellant homa homa,a new jersey resident.on june,homa filed a complaint in the district of new jersey,purporting to represent a class of new jersey consumers who obtained a blue cash card on or after september,as well as a subclass of new jersey cardholders who carried a monthly balance on their cards.homa contends that aec and aecb collectively,appellees misrepresented the actual terms of the rewards program and failed to award him the promised amount of cash back in violation of the new jersey consumer fraud act.
upon issuance of the blue cash card,appellees mailed homa a document entitled agreement between american express credit cardmember and american express centurion bank agreement,which delineated the terms and conditions governing each cardholder account.the agreement included a provision requiring arbitration of all claims upon election of either party and that specifically required all claims to be arbitrated on an individual basis with no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated as a class action.waiver.the agreement also included a provision indicating that any disputes arising out of the agreement would be governed by utah state law.
appellees cited the aforementioned clauses from the agreement in arguing that homa should be required to arbitrate his claims on an individual basis because utah law expressly allows waivers in consumer credit agreements.homa,on the other hand,argued that new jersey law applied because,as the application of utah law would violate new jersey public policy against certain waivers,new jersey principles dictated that the agreement choice of utah law was invalid.the district court agreed with appellees and ultimately dismissed homa complaint with prejudice in favor of arbitration on an individual basis.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
federal jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship pursuant to d.this court has appellate jurisdiction under a.we exercise plenary review over questions regarding the validity and enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate.edwards hovensa,llc,cir.
appellees contend that the agreement choice of utah law governs the current dispute.if the clause is valid,homa appeal will fail,as utah code ann.expressly allows class action waivers in consumer credit agreements.in evaluating whether a contractual clause is enforceable,federal courts sitting in diversity apply the rules of the forum state,which in this case is new jersey.see gibbs carnival cruise lines,cir citing klaxon stentor electric.
ordinarily,when parties to a contract have agreed to be governed by the laws of a particular state,new jersey courts will uphold the contractual choice if it does not violate new jersey public policy.instructional,computer curriculum,citations omitted emphasis added.in deciding whether to enforce a contractual choice of law,the supreme court of new jersey has cited the restatement second of conflicts of laws restatement,which provides that the law of the state chosen by the parties will apply unless 
b application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue and which would be the state of the applicable law in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties.

homa contends that muhammad county bank of rehoboth beach,indicates that the agreement ban on violates a fundamental public policy of new jersey.muhammad held that a waiver in a consumer contract between a customer and a bank that gave out pay day loans was unconscionable and stated that the most important consideration in its holding was the public interests affected by the contract.at.in analyzing the public interests factor,muhammad engaged in a lengthy discussion of the virtues of the class action mechanism,ultimately concluding that 
a s a matter of generally applicable state contract law,it was unconscionable for defendants to deprive plaintiff of the mechanism of a action,whether in arbitration or in court litigation.the public interest at stake in the ability of consumers effectively to pursue their statutory rights under new jersey consumer protection laws overrides the defendants right to seek enforcement of the bar in their agreement.
id.at.muhammad ultimately struck the class action waiver and remanded with instructions to arbitrate on a basis.id.at.
muhammad suggests that the supreme court of new jersey might well find that the application of utah law allowing waivers in the context of a consumer credit suit violates a fundamental policy of new jersey before discussing this issue further,however,we first must dispose of appellees argument that the faa and this court decision in gay creditinform,cir,preclude us from applying new jersey unconscionability principles to a waiver.
iv.the federal arbitration act 
under section of the faa,an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of a transaction involving commerce shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.emphasis added.the united states supreme court has interpreted the italicized provision as meaning that 
state law may be applied if that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity,revocability,and enforceability of contracts generally.thus,generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening.
doctor associates,at.quoting perry thomas,d emphasis in original citations omitted.accordingly,this court has stated that t he federal policy encouraging recourse to arbitration requires federal courts to look first to the relevant state law of contracts in deciding whether an arbitration agreement is valid under the faa.spinetti service.int l,cir see also alexander anthony int l,cir finding an arbitration agreement unconscionable under virgin islands law.
in gay,this court addressed an argument that a waiver should not be enforced because it was unconscionable and ultimately applied the parties choice of virginia law in concluding that the waiver was valid.at.the gay court then engaged in a lengthy discussion of pennsylvania law and rejected two pennsylvania citifinancial,abrogated by salley option one mortgage,and thibodeau comcast,as being preempted by the faa 
to the extent that lytle and thibodeau hold that the inclusion of a waiver of the right to bring judicial class actions in an arbitration agreement constitutes an unconscionable contract,they are not based upon such grounds as exists at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract pursuant to section of the faa,and therefore can not prevent the enforcement of the arbitration provision in this case.
gay,at quoting emphasis in original.in support of this statement,gay reasons that 
i t would be sophistry to contend that the pennsylvania cases do not rely on the uniqueness of an agreement to arbitrate as a basis for a holding that enforcement would be unconscionable,because,though the pennsylvania cases are written ostensibly to apply general principles of contract law,they hold that an agreement to arbitrate may be unconscionable simply because it is an agreement to arbitrate.
id.at quoting perry,at.
we note at the outset that gay discussion of whether pennsylvania law is preempted by the faa appears to be dicta,as the court determined that it should enforce the terms of the provision selecting the application of virginia law and concluded that the waiver at issue was not unconscionable under that law,but nonetheless engaged in a discussion of unconscionability under pennsylvania law even if we disregard the provision and apply pennsylvania law we would reach the same result.gay,at emphases added see also in re mcdonald,cir defining dictum as a statement in a judicial opinion that could have been deleted without seriously impairing the analytical foundations of the holding quoted reference omitted.
whether dicta or not,appellees contend that gay rejection of lytle and thibodeau dictates our course here.more specifically,appellees argue that,even if the provision were invalidated and new jersey law were applied,under gay the faa would preempt us from even considering whether the waiver is unconscionable under muhammad.we disagree.whatever is true of lytle and thibodeau,muhammad plainly does not hold that an agreement to arbitrate may be unconscionable simply because it is an agreement to arbitrate.gay,at.what was held unconscionable in muhammad was not that the arbitration clause prevented the bringing of a judicial class action rather,it was that the arbitration provision deprive d muhammad of the mechanism of a action,whether in arbitration or in court litigation.at emphasis added.in other words,the defense muhammad provides is a general contract defense,one that applies to all waivers of actions,not simply those that also compel arbitration.therefore,there are no grounds for faa preemption.see lowden usa,cir holding that the application to an arbitration provision of a general ban on waivers was not preempted by the faa because that ban appl ies equally to a contract that permits only individual,not aggregate,litigation in court.
gay only compels the opposite conclusion if,as appellees suggest,it is read as a blanket prohibition on unconscionability challenges to provisions.but such a reading is in direct conflict with the language of the supreme court,which clearly holds that generally applicable contract defenses,such as unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening.doctor associates,at.see also mitsubishi motors soler,d of course,courts should remain attuned to claims that the agreement to arbitrate resulted from the sort of fraud or overwhelming economic power that would provide grounds for the revocation of any contract.thus appellees argument that gay prohibits use of muhammad to challenge the agreement waiver is unpersuasive.
having determined that the faa would not prevent this court from applying new jersey law to the current case,we return to the issue.as discussed supra in section iii,this court must predict whether the parties choice of utah law,which expressly allows waivers,would be enforced under new jersey rules.
in light of the muhammad court holding that t he public interest at stake in consumers ability to effectively pursue their statutory rights under new jersey consumer protection laws constituted the most important reason for holding a similar waiver unconscionable,we predict that the supreme court of new jersey would find that the waiver at issue violates the fundamental public policy of new jersey.at.in coming to the opposite conclusion,the district court made much of muhammad confirm ation that waivers are not per se unenforceable.homa american exp,d,quoting muhammad,at.we do not find this reasoning persuasive because muhammad analysis addressed an issue identical to that presented in the current the supreme court of new jersey would permit enforcement of the provision in plaintiff contract that allegedly precludes any realistic challenge to the substance of her contract terms.muhammad,at emphasis added.the muhammad court answered that question with a resounding no,noting that a class action waiver becomes problematic when the waiver is found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages.id.quoting discover bank superior court,cal th,d,holding that a waiver in a consumer credit contract was unconscionable.
in the current case,as in muhammad,the contract at issue bears the hallmarks of a contract of was presented on a basis,in a standardized printed form,and without opportunity for the adhering party to negotiate except perhaps on a few particulars and,as appellant underlying claim implicates less than five percent of a cardholder overall credit card balance,predictably involves a small amount of damages.id.at,quoting rudbart north jersey dist.water supply comm n.is proper at the b the claims at issue are of low monetary value the district court should have denied the b motion and concluded that,in light of muhammad,at this stage the waiver at issue violates new jersey fundamental public policy.
having decided that,at this stage,the waiver violates fundamental new jersey public policy as applied to cases,we will now examine the other two prongs of restatement b that new jersey law would apply in the absence of the parties provision and that new jersey has a materially greater interest than utah in the determination of the waiver validity.we combine the analysis of the remaining b prongs because,as new jersey rules require application of the law of the state with the greatest interest in resolving the particular issue that is raised in the underlying litigation,new jersey law will necessarily apply in the absence of an agreement if new jersey has a materially greater interest than utah in the determination of the waiver validity.gantes kason.
new jersey analysis requires an initial inquiry into whether there is an actual conflict between the laws of utah and new jersey.id.comparison of muhammad,which declared unconscionable a waiver that would preclude relief under new jersey consumer fraud act njcfa,with utah code ann,which explicitly states that waivers in consumer credit contracts are valid,reveals such a conflict.having established an actual conflict,we must now identify the governmental policies underlying the law of each state and how those policies are affected by each state contacts to the litigation and to the parties so that we can determine which state has the greater interest in resolving the issue of the waiver validity.id.at,quoting veazey doremus.
we have already discussed the policies underlying muhammad holding that t he public interest at stake in consumers ability to effectively pursue their statutory rights under new jersey consumer protection laws overrides the defendants right to seek enforcement of the bar in their agreement.at.this is consistent with the fact that the available legislative history of the njcfa demonstrates that the act was intended to be one of the strongest consumer protection laws in the nation and should be construed liberally in favor of protecting consumers.huffmaster robinson,internal quotation marks omitted.the parties have pointed us to no caselaw which directly addresses utah code ann.or the policies underlying it,and our own research has uncovered none.however,the fact that utah is,to our knowledge,the only state to have enacted such legislation indicates a strong policy in favor of the enforcement of the waivers.it
