ronald prince,thomasina lawrence,and michael gleaton filed a class action complaint against cls transportation,charles horky,and marcy horky to recover allegedly unpaid wages cls demurred on the ground that this is not an appropriate class action,contending there is no community of interest,and that a class action is not superior to other methods of adjudicating these particular claims.over prince opposition,the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend the class action allegations,noting that the case would proceed with the named plaintiffs.prince appeals we conclude that,in this context,class suitability should not have been determined at the pleading stage,and that the order thus must be reversed.
the complaint 
this is a wage and hour class action brought by prince for himself and on behalf of more than drivers who are or were employed by cls.the complaint alleges that t his action involves common questions of law and fact because it focuses on cls systematic course of illegal payroll practices and policies throughout the state of california,which was applied to all drivers and others similarly situated in violation of the california industrial welfare commission wage orders,the california labor code,and the california business and professions code prince alleges that his claims are typical of the proposed class,and that he is able to fairly and adequately protect their interests.in eight causes of action,he alleges a variety of wage law violations,including cls alleged failure to pay overtime compensation,to pay compensation for all hours worked,to reimburse the drivers for certain expenses,to provide required meal and rest periods,to provide itemized wage statements,to pay its former employees all wages due at the time of,with regard to all of these things,that cls acted in violation of the unfair business practices act bus,et.
the gist of the action,according to prince,is that cls paid its drivers only for the time they were on driving assignments rather than for the full duration of their shifts.cls did not pay its drivers for the time they spent waiting between driving assignments,after a drop off and before the next pickup.cls also required its drivers to arrive at least thirty minutes before a scheduled pickup,but did not consider that time as hours worked.cls also improperly calculated the wage rates of its drivers under the total remuneration rule for purposes of determining overtime wages,and also withheld gratuities intended for its drivers.in doing these things,cls also failed to accurately record hours worked as required by california law.
the demurrer 
cls demurred,contending prince could not establish a community of interest among the potential class members,and that class treatment is not a superior method of adjudicating this matter.according to cls,the right to recover the allegedly unpaid wages and allegedly withheld benefits must be determined individually,not as a class,and an effort to address these claims through a class action would burden the court without benefiting the potential class members.in his opposition,prince characterized the demurrer as nothing more than an improper preemptive opposition brief to a future motion for class certification,and contended that a class action is not inappropriate simply because each member of the potential class may at some point be required to individually establish eligibility and damages.
the trial court ruling 
as noted at the outset,the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend the class action allegations,permitted the action to proceed with regard to prince and the other named plaintiffs,and explained its ruling this way 
the court determines there is no reasonable possibility that prince can plead a prima facie community of interests among the class members except the same employer and legal bases as pled in the complaint,because the ability of each member of the class to recover clearly depends on a separate set of facts applicable only to him silva block th,d.all of prince claims would require highly individualized determinations of each potential class member right to recover for actual work performed,waiting time,time,overtime compensation,meal and rest periods,gratuities,expenses incurred in the course and scope of employment.
additionally,the court finds the class action is not the most efficient and effective means of settling the controversy.in this case a speedy,informal,affordable alternative is available with the labor commissioner.cuadra millan cal th,d.

discussion 
courts long have acknowledged the importance of class actions as a means to prevent a failure of justice in our judicial system by establishing a technique whereby the claims of many individuals can be resolved at the same time,the class suit both eliminates the possibility of repetitious litigation and provides small claimants with a method of obtaining redress generally,a class suit is appropriate when numerous parties suffer injury of insufficient size to warrant individual action and when denial of class relief would result in unjust advantage to the wrongdoer but because group action also has the potential to create injustice,trial courts are required to carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts 
section of the code of civil procedure authorizes class suits in california when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court.to obtain certification,a party must establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members the community of interest requirement involves three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class other relevant considerations include the probability that each class member will come forward ultimately to prove his or her separate claim to a portion of the total recovery and whether the class approach would actually serve to deter and redress alleged wrongdoing linder thrifty oil cal th,d,all citations and all internal quotation marks omitted.
there are two lines of facially inconsistent cases relevant to the issue before us but the inconsistency evaporates when the facts of the cases are considered,at which point it becomes apparent that it is only in mass tort actions or other actions equally unsuited to class action treatment that class suitability can and should be determined at the pleading stage.in other cases,particularly those involving wage and hour claims,class suitability should not be determined by demurrer 
in vasquez superior court cal d,a consumer class action alleging that fraudulent misrepresentations were made with regard to contracts for the purchase of frozen foods and freezers,the supreme court reversed an order sustaining a demurrer to the class action allegations.in rejecting the defendant claim that individual issues of fact would predominate,the court found the contention unpersuasive at the pleading stage of the proceedings because we can not assume that plaintiffs will be unable to establish their allegations without the separate testimony of each class member at least they must be afforded the opportunity to show that they can prove their allegations on a common basis for the purpose of determining if the demurrers should have been overruled,it is sufficient that there is a reasonable possibility plaintiffs can establish a prima facie community of interest among the class members on the false representation issue.plaintiffs inability to do so,if that be the ultimate result,can be determined at a later stage of the proceeding.id.at.
