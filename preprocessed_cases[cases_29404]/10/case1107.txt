benjamin berger appeals from the stipulated dismissal with prejudice of his putative claims against home depot.he alleges that home depot automatically imposed a ten percent surcharge for a damage waiver on tool rentals in its california stores,and although that fee was to be optional,home depot failure to inform customers of their ability to decline the surcharge was a violation of california unfair competition law,the california consumer legal remedies act,and theories of unjust enrichment and money had and received.cal.bus.cal.we have jurisdiction under because,in the absence of a settlement,a stipulation that leads to a dismissal with prejudice does not destroy the adversity in that judgment necessary to support an appeal.we affirm the denial of class certification because the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the proposed classes that berger is capable of representing do not meet the requirement that common questions predominate over individual issues under.b,and that was the only of rule b on which berger relied.
the district court denied berger motion for class certification,concluding that the proposed class and subclasses were not ascertainable and that berger did not meet the commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation requirements of federal rule of civil procedure rule a.having rejected certification on grounds of ascertainability of the class and on grounds that rule a was not satisfied,the district court at first recited that it declined to reach the requirements of rule b,but then discussed those requirements and concluded,accordingly,because independent issues predominate and it is not clear that class action is a superior means of adjudication,plaintiff motion fails for the additional reason that he can not satisfy the requirements of rule b.
berger then stipulated with home depot to dismiss the action with prejudice,noting his intent to appeal the denial of class certification.in the stipulation,home depot contested his ability to appeal.the district court dismissed the action under rule a,and berger filed a timely notice of appeal.
the district court had jurisdiction over berger complaint under the class action fairness act,d,because the parties met minimal diversity and the amount in controversy exceeded million.we have jurisdiction under because a dismissal of an action with prejudice,even when such dismissal is the product of a stipulation,is a sufficiently adverse and thus appealable final decision.
home depot challenges our jurisdiction,relying on our published order in seidman city of beverly hills,cir.in seidman,we concluded that we had no jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a stipulated dismissal of a putative class action after the lead plaintiff settled his individual claims against the defendant.id.at.however,seidman does not control here.as seidman correctly noted,a final judgment must be adverse to a party in order to be appealable.id.at.while a stipulated dismissal pursuant to a settlement does not have the adversity required for appellate jurisdiction,absent a settlement,a stipulation alone does not destroy that adversity.see coursen robins,cir concha london,cir distinguishing seidman and holding that plaintiffs may appeal from a voluntary dismissal with prejudice,at least where the plaintiff is not acting pursuant to a settlement agreement intended to terminate the litigation.omstead dell,cir concluding that there was appellate jurisdiction in a class action case after a dismissal pursuant to rule a laczay ross adhesives,cir collecting cases from various circuits for the same proposition.a leading procedural treatise also takes the position that finality for appeal purposes can be achieved in this manner.see charles allan wright,arthur miller,mary kay kane,federal practice procedure ed 
the sixth method of obtaining review following a court order eliminating the allegations is tactically risky.if the district court strikes the designation with leave to amend so that the action may proceed on an individual basis,the party seeking class treatment may refuse to do so and allow the court to enter a final judgment dismissing the complaint with prejudice.an appeal then can be taken since the adjudication is final and falls within section.however,this procedure is a dangerous one.if the district court order is sustained on appeal,plaintiff may be deemed to have forfeited the right to present the merits of the claims by insisting on a review of the question.

here,there is no allegation that the parties have entered into a settlement.after receiving the district court denial of class certification,berger voluntarily stipulated to the dismissal of his complaint with prejudice so as to reach a final judgment.we conclude that this stipulated dismissal is sufficiently adverse to his interests to allow him to appeal.concluding that we have jurisdiction over this appeal,we next address the merits of the district court denial of class certification.
although berger filed four distinct legal claims,which are considered separately below,each claim is based on the same set of facts.when home depot rents tools to customers,it offers a damage waiver.if purchased,the damage waiver allows the customer to avoid liability if a tool is damaged during the period of the rental.berger alleges that when he rented a tool from home depot in april of,he purchased the damage waiver without notice that the waiver was optional.berger further alleges that home depot does not tell customers that this waiver is an optional.he claims that the cost of the waiver is automatically added to the rental price by home depot computer system.home depot does not deny that its computers default to adding the damage waiver to a customer receipt,but says that customers are told of the optional nature of the waiver in three ways by the sales associate,by signs posted in home depot stores,and by the language of the final sales contract.berger contests this by alleging that as a matter of policy,home depot employees are not trained to inform customers of the optional nature of the waiver,and in practice,even if its policy is to make such a disclosure,the disclosures are not made.
a salient fact in our view is that over the span of time covered by this lawsuit,home depot has used five different versions of its tool rental agreement version version march may version june august version august april and version april present,each of which discussed the damage waiver in a different way.to respond to these changes,berger proposed subdividing his action into three subclasses,with the first to include those who rented tools from july to february,the second from march,to june,to the present,and the third from june,to the present.

although it was decided in a different context,that of denial of a motion for a new trial,we think that our circuit en banc decision in hinkson sheds light on how we should apply the abuse of discretion standard here.a bdullah sec,cir.hinkson holds that the abuse of discretion test requires us first to consider whether the district court identified the correct legal standard for decision of the issue before it.second,the test then requires us to determine whether the district court findings of fact,and its application of those findings of fact to the correct legal standard,were illog
