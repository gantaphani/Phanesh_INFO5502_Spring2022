this appeal presents an issue of first impression for this circuit regarding the application of the home state exception to federal jurisdiction under the class action fairness act of cafa,stat.congress enacted cafa in response to perceived abuses by plaintiffs counsel in keeping class action cases of national importance out of the federal courts.see cafa a,stat.at see also amoche guarantee trust life ins,cir johnson advance,cir.defendant essential argument is that the plaintiff has drawn his complaint in terms limiting the class and the defendants in order to defeat federal jurisdiction in violation of congressional intent.plaintiff retorts that this suit fits precisely into an exception to the exercise of federal jurisdiction set forth explicitly in cafa.
here,a class defined to consist entirely of florida citizens sued a single corporation,also a florida citizen,in florida state court.after defendant removed to federal court under cafa,plaintiff sought remand to the state court under cafa home state exception,which requires a federal court to decline to exercise jurisdiction if at least of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate and the primary defendants are citizens of the state where the action was originally filed.see d b.
the district court found that this case fit squarely within cafa home state exception and granted the plaintiff motion to remand.see in re hannaford.customer sec.breach,d.we agree and reject,on the facts here,the defendant argument that the application of cafa home state exception depends on a broader assessment of the claims brought by others who do not fall within the complaint class definition or of the claims available to the class against other possible defendants.
defendant kash n karry food stores,operates a chain of grocery stores in florida.a computer hacker stole the credit card information of customers who had shopped at kash n karry stores between december and march.plaintiff thomas grimsdale,iii regularly shopped at kash n karry stores in tampa,florida during this period and paid for his purchases using his bank debit card.
on april,grimsdale sued kash n karry in florida state court,alleging that kash n karry had failed to adopt adequate security measures to protect its customers credit card information.he sought to represent a class of approximately million persons who had used cards at kash n karry stores between december,and march,had their personal and sensitive confidential information stolen compromised as a result of the security breach.the class definition explicitly excluded any persons and entities who are not citizens of the state of florida.
kash n karry removed the case to federal court in florida under cafa on april.on april,grimsdale filed a motion to remand the case to state court,arguing that cafa home state exception applied.
on october,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred the case to the district of maine,where other suits had been consolidated against entities related to kash n karry,raising similar allegations of wrongdoing in the security breach.these related entities were kash n karry sister corporation,hannaford brothers,and their common corporate parent,delhaize america.combined,the multidistrict litigation involved an estimated million class members.on december,the district court granted grimsdale motion to remand,finding the requirements of cafa home state exception satisfied.see in re hannaford,d at.
kash n karry timely petitioned for leave to appeal the district court remand order under c.we granted kash n karry petition on march.after expedited briefing,we heard oral argument in this appeal on april.
congress expanded diversity jurisdiction through cafa to allow for federal court jurisdiction over class actions satisfying the statute amount in controversy and minimal diversity requirements.see d see also amoche,at.yet that grant of jurisdiction is subject to several exceptions.here,our focus is on the home state exception,which provides 
a district court shall decline to exercise jurisdiction where or more of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate,and the primary defendants,are citizens of the state in which the action was originally filed.
there is a threshold question of which party bears the burden of showing that cafa home state exception applies.we hold that the burden is on the plaintiff to show that an exception to jurisdiction under cafa applies.this is the rule adopted by our sister circuits.see kaufman allstate ins,cir serrano connect,cir hart fedex ground package,cir frazier pioneer ams.llc,cir evans walter,cir.and it is consistent with the supreme court general approach to removal jurisdiction.see breuer jim concrete of brevard,d w henever the subject matter of an action qualifies it for removal,the burden is on a plaintiff to find an express exception.here,however,as the parties agree,the burden of proof is largely immaterial because the outcome turns purely on questions of law.
at first blush,the requirements of cafa home state exception appear to be satisfied here.as grimsdale has defined the class in his complaint,all class members are florida citizens.kash n karry,the only defendant in this case,is also a florida citizen because its principal place of business is in florida.see c a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of the state where it has its principal place of business.and this case was originally filed in florida state court.
still,kash n karry offers a different reading of cafa home state exception,turning on the interpretation of the the members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate within the home state exception.see id.d b a district court shall decline to exercise jurisdiction where or more of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate,and the primary defendants,are citizens of the state in which the action was originally filed.specifically,kash n karry argues that the plain meaning of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate requires reference outside the four corners of the complaint in the particular case before the court to all previously filed class actions which arise from a core nucleus of operative facts such as to meet an article iii case or controversy requirement it contends that the term aggregate means that congress intended to refer beyond the plaintiff complaint otherwise,congress would have simply used the term class members as it did in d d applying this principle here,kash n karry says the previously filed national class actions involving hannaford that were consolidated by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation are the appropriate reference point to measure the members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate.
we reject kash n karry reading as contrary to the plain language of d b.the most natural reading of the home state exception is that congress meant d b to be read in conjunction with the federal class action rule,or similar state statutes and rules of judicial procedure that is made explicit by the definition of class action in d b,which refers to rule or similar state rules.under rule,a class may be divided into subclasses that are each treated as a class under this rule.c.the home state exception use of the plural classes,therefore,does not indicate that congress intended an inquiry into what kash n karry has termed the broader article iii case or controversy because a single complaint may contain multiple classes 
in rejecting kash n karry reading of d b,we do not mean to say that the four corners of the plaintiff complaint necessarily control the question of whether cafa home state exception applies.we do not rely on the maxim that the plaintiff is the master of his own answer to that question is that it depends.indeed,as we recently recognized in amoche,at,courts need not accept the plaintiffs allegations regarding the amount in controversy when it appears to a reasonable probability that more than the jurisdictional minimum is at issue.we can imagine example,if the plaintiff has omitted an indispensable looking beyond the four corners of the plaintiff complaint may be necessary
