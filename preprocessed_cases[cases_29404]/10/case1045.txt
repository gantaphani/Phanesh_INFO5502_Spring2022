the class action fairness act cafa,stat,authorizes the removal to federal court of mass actions.d a,b.mass actions are civil actions in which monetary relief claims of or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs claims involve common questions of law or fact.id.d b i.the statute excludes from the mass action definition actions in which the claims are joined upon motion of a defendant,id.d b ii ii,or in which the claims have been consolidated or coordinated solely for pretrial proceedings,id.d b ii iv.
plaintiffs appellants plaintiffs in this consolidated appeal filed five separate tort cases in a california state court,each with fewer than one hundred plaintiffs.plaintiffs alleged that they,or the deceased individuals they represent,suffered from pancreatic cancer due to their use of therapies for diabetes,including those developed by defendant appellee merck sharp dohme corporation merck,and other defendant drug companies.at the time plaintiffs filed suit,a coordinated proceeding covering similar claims was pending in a california state court in a different county.merck removed four of the five cases based on conventional federal diversity jurisdiction,but the district court granted plaintiffs motions to remand.merck then removed all five cases based on cafa,contending that plaintiffs statements to the court during the earlier remand proceedings converted four of the five cases into a mass action,and that the filing of the fifth case in the same state court as the other four had the same consequence.plaintiffs moved to remand the five cases.the district court denied the motions for remand and subsequent motions for reconsideration.
this appeal presents two questions.first,were plaintiffs petitions for permission to appeal timely the answer depends on whether a timely motion for reconsideration of an order denying or granting a motion for remand under c restarts the period during which a party may file a petition for permission to appeal.we hold that it does.
second,do these five cases,or any of them,constitute a mass action under cafa when plaintiffs filed the five cases,a coordinated proceeding involving similar issues and overlapping defendants was already underway in state court.plaintiffs in four of the five cases made statements in the first federal court remand proceeding indicating that they anticipated that their cases would be joined to the existing coordinated state proceeding after remand.some of the defendants in the cases now before us were and are defendants in the coordinated state proceeding indeed,defendants initiated that proceeding.plaintiffs in one of the five cases had petitioned unsuccessfully in state court to join the coordinated state proceeding.despite these actions by plaintiffs,we hold that in none of the five cases did plaintiffs propose that the claims of one hundred or more persons be tried jointly.
we therefore reverse and remand with instructions to grant plaintiffs motions to remand to state court.
background 
three sets of cases 
five distinct groups of plaintiffs filed suit in superior court for the county of san diego during the spring and summer of.the five cases are kreis,kelly,johnson,briggs,and martinez.the complaints alleged various tort claims against manufacturers and a distributor of drugs,including byetta,which is manufactured and promoted by eli lilly and company and amylin pharmaceuticals,and januvia and janumet,which were developed by merck.plaintiffs in kreis,johnson,and briggs have common counsel.plaintiffs in kelly and martinez have different common counsel.each of the five cases has fewer than one hundred plaintiffs.
when plaintiffs filed their five complaints in superior court in san diego,a second set of cases involving drugs was already pending in the superior court for the county of los angeles as a coordinated state proceeding under california code of civil procedure section.section provides 
coordination of civil actions sharing a common question of fact or law is appropriate if one judge hearing all of the actions for all purposes in a selected site or sites will promote the ends of justice taking into account whether the common question of fact or law is predominating and significant to the litigation the convenience of parties,witnesses,and counsel the relative development of the actions and the work product of counsel the efficient utilization of judicial facilities and manpower the calendar of the courts the disadvantages of duplicative and inconsistent rulings,orders,or judgments and,the likelihood of settlement of the actions without further litigation should coordination be denied.
eli lilly and amylin pharmaceuticals initiated the state court coordinated proceeding in for the purpose of litigating claims that the drug byetta causes pancreatitis.judge highberger of the los angeles superior court presides over the coordinated proceeding.we refer to the coordinated proceeding as the byetta judicial council coordinated proceeding byetta jccp.
the byetta jccp has been expanded to cover claims dealing with other drugs,other injuries including pancreatic cancer,and other drug companies including merck.an august,case management order,which expressly applies to cases,states that the order does not constitute a determination that these actions should be consolidated for trial.in a june,status conference report,the byetta jccp plaintiffs stated that they have said several times that a small group of bellwethers provide an extremely useful and practical backdrop and context for the many issues that will arise as the cancer cases progress,including the generic causation phase.
the kreis plaintiffs conceded in their brief and at oral argument before us that they petitioned to join the byetta jccp in may.the kreis plaintiffs filed their petition in state court one day after merck removed the case to federal court for the first time.the kreis plaintiffs petition states that c oordinated proceedings will promote the ends of justice by efficiently utilizing this state judicial resources,avoiding inconsistent rulings and promoting economy and efficiency for all parties,witnesses and counsel.in a declaration attached to the petition,counsel for the kreis plaintiffs stated that p etitioners do not seek joint trials of any cases or plaintiffs,but rather,all claims shall be tried individually.
throughout most of this litigation,merck has asserted that the johnson plaintiffs also petitioned to join the byetta jccp.however,in a letter to this court sent just before oral argument,and again in oral argument,merck acknowledged that the petition in johnson had also been filed by a defendant rather than by plaintiffs.merck further acknowledged at oral argument,contrary to its earlier assertions,that a second petition in kreis had been filed by a defendant rather than plaintiffs.after the state court received the two petitions filed by the defendants in kreis and johnson,it notified the parties that because the cases had been removed to federal court it could not process them.we infer that the state court sent the kreis plaintiffs a similar notice in response to their petition,though we do not have access to the state court record that would confirm that the state court did so.
when plaintiffs filed their five complaints,a third set of cases was pending as litigation mdl in the united states district court for the southern district of california,sitting in san diego.district judge battaglia presides over the mdl.see in re incretin mimetics prods.liab,md ajb mdd.mdl.when plaintiffs five cases were removed to federal court from san diego superior court,they were assigned to judge battaglia as related cases.judge battaglia in the mdl and judge highberger in the byetta jccp have worked closely to coordinate their respective proceedings.
removal proceedings 
on april and may,merck filed notices of removal in kelly,kreis,and johnson based on an assertion of diversity jurisdiction under.the martinez and briggs complaints had not yet been filed.plaintiffs moved to remand the three cases to state court based on a lack of complete diversity.merck moved to sever the claims of three plaintiffs and to dismiss as fraudulently joined,or to sever,claims against one of the defendants in an attempt to create complete diversity.
at the hearing on plaintiffs remand motions,held on august,judge battaglia asked,i f remanded,are these cases going to end up,through the jccp,with judge highberger,or are they going to end up with some other judge for management purposes,or do we know counsel for the kelly plaintiffs answered on behalf of the plaintiffs in all three cases,they will be transferred to judge highberger and be assigned to him for all purposes and be coordinated with this court as we have been doing with all of the other cases that are in the jccp.judge battaglia then asked what the benefit would be of keeping the cases in state court,if ultimately they are going to be coordinated in part following the same part of the process of the mdl counsel for kreis responded that given the large number of cases pending in federal court and plaintiffs desire to resolve the cases before plaintiffs and their died,they preferred to proceed before judge highberger because he has a smaller docket and was likely to process the cases more quickly.speaking generally of the many ongoing cases,counsel for kelly remarked,some plaintiffs would prefer to be in state court,to get their trials in the jccp.others will be in federal court and with different federal judges around the country.in opposing the remand,merck argued that the byetta jccp was the wrong forum for these cases,since that proceeding primarily involved different drugs and injuries than those at issue in kelly,kreis,and johnson.
on august,the district court denied merck motion to sever and to dismiss the parties,and granted plaintiffs motions to remand.the court observed in its remand order that given that these cases would join the current actions pending in california state court as part of the jccp action and the fact that this court has been in coordination with the los angeles state court,the risk of inconsistent rulings is unpersuasive at this point.after the remand to state court,defendant eli lilly petitioned unsuccessfully to add kreis,kelly,and johnson to the byetta jccp.
on july,merck filed a notice of removal in briggs,also based on.on august,the briggs plaintiffs filed a motion to remand based on lack of complete diversity.in their supporting memorandum,they cited the district court remand in kelly just a few days before.they wrote in a footnote,r emand will result in these cases joining the judicial council coordinated proceeding jccp,in re byetta cases,jccp,in los angeles,where coordination with this court mdl is underway.the language in the footnote replicates the language in the district court august remand order.
on september,while the briggs plaintiffs motion for remand was still pending in the district court,merck filed second notices of removal in kreis,kelly,and johnson,filed an amended notice of removal in briggs,and filed a first notice of removal in martinez.merck now asserted cafa jurisdiction as the basis for removal.merck contended that briggs,johnson,kelly,kreis,and martinez are removable under the mass action provision because plaintiffs counsel expressed intent that the cases be transferred to the jccp constitutes a proposal to try the claims of those plaintiffs jointly.
plaintiffs moved to remand all five cases to state court.the district judge stayed proceedings pending our rehearing en banc of corber xanodyne pharmaceuticals,cir en banc.the question in corber was whether plaintiffs petition in several cases in state court to initiate a coordinated proceeding under california code of civil procedure section for all purposes was a proposal for a joint trial within the meaning of cafa.we held that it was.id.at.
on december,after we decided corber,the district judge denied plaintiffs motions to remand in all five cases.ten days later,on january,plaintiffs moved for reconsideration.the district judge denied the motions on january.in his order,he wrote that he had denied remand in kelly,kreis,and johnson based on those plaintiffs representations in the august hearing had denied remand in briggs based on the those plaintiffs footnote in their august memorandum and had denied remand in martinez because by filing the case in san diego superior court,along with the four other actions,plaintiffs implicitly proposed the claims in martinez be joined with the claims of plaintiffs in the four other cases.the district judge had mentioned in his initial order the petitions he believed had been filed by the kreis and johnson plaintiffs,but he explained in denying the motion for reconsideration that he did not find these petitions dispositive.
on january,ten days after the district judge denied plaintiffs motions for reconsideration plaintiffs filed petitions for permission to appeal,seeking review of the orders denying their motions for remand and reconsideration.merck contends that we lack jurisdiction because plaintiffs did not file their petitions within ten days of the district court initial orders denying remand.a motions panel of this court consolidated the five cases,conditionally granted the plaintiffs permission to appeal,and directed the parties to brief whether plaintiffs petitions for permission to appeal were timely filed pursuant to c.
ii.appellate jurisdiction 
an appeal in a cafa case may be sought from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the state court from which it was removed if application is made to the court of appeals not more than days after entry of the order.c see d a explaining that for purposes of d and,a mass action shall be deemed a class action under paragraphs through if it otherwise meets the provisions of those paragraphs.merck contends that the word order in c refers only to a district court initial remand order.merck therefore contends that we must deny permission to appeal on the ground that plaintiffs sought permission to appeal within ten days of the district judge orders denying reconsideration rather than within ten days of his order denying the motions to remand.we disagree with merck reading of the word order.we hold that the time to seek permission to file an appeal runs from the later of either the date of an initial order granting or denying remand,or the date of an order granting or denying reconsideration,provided the motion for reconsideration was timely filed.
it has long been accepted that the time period to file an appeal generally runs from the denial of a timely motion for reconsideration,rather than from the date of the initial order.see united states ibarra,per curiam united states dieter,per curiam united states healy.we see no good reason to depart from this rule and the traditional and virtually unquestioned practice of applying it.healy,at.
merck contends that we should not apply the general rule of ibarra,dieter,and healy on the ground that c deadline is statutory,jurisdictional,and specific.we have three responses.first,it does not matter that the deadline is statutory.the deadline in dieter was statutory.the supreme court held in that case that the denial of a timely petition for rehearing marked the start of the period during which to take an appeal.dieter,at.second,it does not matter if the timeliness requirement of c is jurisdictional assuming arguendo that it is.federal rule of appellate procedure a is jurisdictional,see united states sadler,cir,and it has long been held that reconsideration orders mark the start of the time to appeal under that rule.see browder,dep t of corr.of.further,even if the timeliness requirement is jurisdictional which we do not decide,and even if we therefore lack the authority to find an equitable exception to the requirement,merck misapprehends the question before us.we are determining what that rule means we are not addressing any exceptions to the rule.third,c may be specific in some respects,but both c and federal rule of appellate procedure,which governs appeals under c,see amalgamated transit union local laidlaw transit,cir,do not specify the effect of a timely motion for reconsideration.as to that is
