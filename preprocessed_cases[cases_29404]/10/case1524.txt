in this case,a california resident filed a class action against a group of nevada hotels for failing to provide notice of an energy surcharge imposed on hotel guests.although these hotels conduct no business and have no bank accounts or employees in california,they do advertise heavily in california and obtain a significant percentage of their business from california residents.these advertising activities include billboards located in california,print ads in california newspapers,and ads aired on california radio and television stations.these hotels also maintain an internet web site and phone number where visitors or callers may obtain room quotes and make reservations.we now consider whether,based on these activities,california courts may exercise personal jurisdiction over these hotels,and conclude that they may.
defendants harrah las vegas,harrah laughlin,harrah operating company,hoc,rio properties,and harveys tahoe management company,collectively defendants own and operate hotels in nevada.plaintiff frank snowney is a california resident.in,plaintiff reserved a room by phone from his california residence at one of the hotels owned and operated by defendants.to make the reservation,plaintiff gave the reservation agent his credit card number.at the time plaintiff made the reservation,the agent told him that the room would cost per night plus the room tax.when plaintiff paid his bill at checkout,however,the bill included a energy surcharge.
plaintiff filed the instant class action against defendants and other entities on behalf of himself and other persons who were charged an energy surcharge as an overnight hotel guest in one of the defendant hotels,yet were never given notice that there was an energy surcharge what such charge would be.in the complaint,plaintiff alleged that defendants charged him and other guests an energy surcharge during their stays at hotels owned and operated by defendants without providing notice of these charges during the reservation or process.he further alleged that,in doing so,defendants charged more than the advertised or quoted price.his complaint alleged causes of action for fraudulent and deceptive business practices in violation of business and professions code section et breach of contract unjust enrichment and violations of business and professions code section et.
in response,defendants and other entities filed a motion to quash the summons for lack of personal jurisdiction.in support of the motion,defendants submitted a declaration from brad kerby,the corporate secretary of hei.kerby stated that defendants were incorporated in either nevada or delaware and maintained their principal place of business in nevada.according to kerby,defendants conducted no business in california and had no bank accounts or employees in california.kerby,however,acknowledged that hoc was licensed to do business in california and that harrah marketing services corporation hmsc,a wholly owned subsidiary of hoc,operated offices in california to assist customers who contact those offices and attempt ed to attract a limited number of gaming patrons to harrah properties.
in opposition,plaintiff submitted several declarations,a transcript of kerby deposition,and various exhibits.this evidence established that defendants advertised extensively to california residents through billboards in california,california newspapers,and california radio and television stations had a joint marketing agreement with national airlines,which served los angeles and san francisco,and advertised in the airline print media maintained an interactive web site that accepted reservations from california residents,provided driving directions to their hotels from california,and touted the proximity of their hotels to california accepted reservations from california residents through their internet web site and a phone number listed on the site and in their advertisements obtained a significant percentage of their patrons from california through reservations made through the number and web site and regularly sent mailings to those california residents among the four to six million people enrolled in their total rewards program.plaintiff evidence also confirmed that hsmc maintained several offices in california to handle reservations and market defendants hotels.
the trial court granted the motion to quash for lack of personal jurisdiction.specifically,the court found that plaintiff had failed to establish either general or specific jurisdiction.plaintiff appealed.
the court of appeal reversed as to defendants,concluding that defendants had sufficient contacts with california to justify the exercise of specific jurisdiction.specifically,the court held that by soliciting and receiving the patronage of california residents through their advertising activities,defendants have purposefully directed their activities at california residents,have purposefully derived benefit from their contacts with california,and have established a substantial connection with this state defendants california contacts are substantially connected to causes of action that challenge an alleged mandatory surcharge imposed on all hotel guests and the exercise of jurisdiction over defendants would be fair and reasonable.in doing so,the court declined to follow circus circus hotels,superior court d.circus circus,disapproved in part in vons companies,seabest foods,cal th,d,vons.
we granted review to determine whether the exercise of jurisdiction over defendants is proper.
california courts may exercise personal jurisdiction on any basis consistent with the constitution of california and the united states.code civ.the exercise of jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant comports with these constitutions if the defendant has such minimum contacts with the state that the assertion of jurisdiction does not violate traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.vons,supra,cal th at d,quoting internat.shoe washington.pavlovich superior court cal th,d,pavlovich.
the concept of minimum contacts requires states to observe certain territorial limits on their sovereignty.it ensure s that the states,through their courts,do not reach out beyond the limits imposed on them by their status as coequal sovereigns in a federal system.vons,supra,cal th at,d,quoting volkswagen woodson,d volkswagen.to do so,the minimum contacts test asks whether the quality and nature of the defendant activity is such that it is reasonable and fair to require him to conduct his defense in that state.kulko california superior court,d,quoting internat.shoe,supra,at.the test is not susceptible of mechanical application rather,the facts of each case must be weighed to determine whether the requisite affiliating circumstances are present.kulko,at.
under the minimum contacts test,p ersonal jurisdiction may be either general or specific.vons,supra,cal th at,d.because plaintiff does not claim general jurisdiction,we only consider whether specific jurisdiction exists here.
when determining whether specific jurisdiction exists,courts consider the relationship among the defendant,the forum,and the litigation.helicopteros nacionales de colombia hall,d,quoting shaffer heitner,d.a court may exercise specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant only if the defendant has purposefully availed himself or herself of forum benefits vons,supra,cal th at,d,the controversy is related to or arises out of the defendant contacts with the forum,quoting helicopteros,supra,at.and the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice vons,supra,cal th at,d,quoting burger king rudzewicz,d burger king.pavlovich,supra,cal th at,d.
when a defendant moves to quash service of process for lack of specific jurisdiction,the plaintiff has the initial burden of demonstrating facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction.vons,supra,cal th at,d.if the plaintiff meets this initial burden,then the defendant has the burden of demonstrating that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.pavlovich,supra,cal th at,d,quoting vons,at,d.where,as here,no conflict in the evidence exists the question of jurisdiction is purely one of law and the reviewing court engages in an independent review of the record.vons,at,d.applying these standards to the facts of this case,we conclude that california may exercise specific jurisdiction over defendants.
we first determine whether defendants purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of doing business in california.based on defendants purposeful and successful solicitation of business from california residents,we find that plaintiff has established purposeful availment.
the purposeful availment inquiry focuses on the defendant intentionality.citation.this prong is only satisfied when the defendant purposefully and voluntarily directs its activities toward the forum so that it should expect,by virtue of the benefit it receives,to be subject to the court jurisdiction based on its contacts with the forum.pavlovich,supra,cal th at,d,quoting swiss american bank,cir.thus,purposeful availment occurs where a nonresident defendant purposefully direct s its activities at residents of the forum burger king,supra,at,purposefully derive s benefit from its activities in the forum id.at,create s a substantial connection with the forum id.at,deliberately has engaged in significant activities within the forum id.at,or has created continuing obligations between itself and residents of the forum id.at.by limiting the scope of a forum jurisdiction in this manner,the purposeful availment requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of random,fortuitous,or attenuated contacts id.at.instead,the defendant will only be subject to personal jurisdiction if it has clear notice that it is subject to suit there,and can act to alleviate the risk of burdensome litigation by procuring insurance,passing the expected costs on to customers,or,if the risks are too great,severing its connection with the state.pavlovich,at,d,quoting volkswagen,supra,at.
here,defendants contacts with california are more than sufficient to establish purposeful availment.we begin by examining defendants internet contacts.to determine whether a web site is sufficient to establish purposeful availment,we first look to the sliding scale analysis described in zippo zippo dot com.zippo.see pavlovich,supra,cal th at,d.at one end of the spectrum are situations where a defendant clearly does business over the internet.if the defendant enters into contracts with residents of a foreign jurisdiction that involve the knowing and repeated transmission of computer files over the internet,personal jurisdiction is proper.citation.at the opposite end are situations where a defendant has simply posted information on an internet web site which is accessible to users in foreign jurisdictions.a passive web site that does little more than make information available to those who are interested in it is not grounds for the exercise of personal jurisdiction.citation.the middle ground is occupied by interactive web sites where a user can exchange information with the host computer.in these cases,the exercise of jurisdiction is determined by examining the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of information that occurs on the web site.zippo,at.
defendants web site,which quotes room rates to visitors and permits visitors to make reservations at their hotels,is interactive and,at a minimum,falls within the middle ground of the zippo sliding scale in determining whether a site falling within this middle ground is sufficient to establish purposeful availment,however,courts have been less than consistent.
some courts have held that sufficient minimum contacts are established,and the defendant is doing business over the internet where the defendant website is capable of accepting and does accept purchase orders from residents of the forum state.shamsuddin vitamin research products d.other courts have suggested that something more is necessary,such as deliberate action within the forum state in the form of transactions between the defendant and residents of the forum or conduct of the defendant purposefully directed at residents of the forum state.millennium,supra,d at see also toys r us,step two,cir,there must be evidence that the defendant purposefully availed itself of conducting activity in the forum state,by directly targeting its web site to the state,knowingly interacting with residents of the forum state via its web site,or through sufficient other related contacts.other courts have criticized zippo emphasis on website interactivity shamsuddin,at and focus instead on traditional due process principles id.at,asking whether the site expressly targets residents of the forum state hy cite,d.according to these courts,website interactivity is important only insofar as it reflects commercial activity,and then only insofar as that commercial activity demonstrates purposeful targeting of residents of the forum state or purposeful availment of the benefits or privileges of the forum state.shamsuddin,at see also neogen neo gen screening,cir,a defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of acting in a state through its website if the website is interactive to a degree that reveals specifically intended interaction with residents of the state.
we need not,however,decide on a particular approach here because defendants web site,by any standard,establishes purposeful availment.by touting the proximity of their hotels to california and providing driving directions from california to their hotels,defendants web site specifically targeted residents of california.see burger king,supra,at.defendants also concede that many of their patrons come from california and that some of these patrons undoubtedly made reservations using their web site.as such,defendants have purposefully derived a benefit from their internet activities in california id.at,and have established a substantial connection with california through their web site id.at.in doing so,defendants have purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting business in california via the internet.enterprise international,d,holding that a web site that specifically targeted the forum state and its residents established purposeful availment.
defendants attempt to analogize their web site to the site in bensusan restaurant king,is unavailing.in bensusan,the federal district court declined to exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendant based on his web site.but,unlike the web site at issue here,the site in bensusan was wholly did not specifically target forum residents.id.at.moreover,the defendant in bensusan,unlike defendants here,conducted no business with forum residents through his web site.
in any event,even assuming that defendants web site,by itself,is not sufficient to establish purposeful availment,the site in conjunction with defendants other contacts with california undoubtedly is.aside from their web site specifically targeting california residents,defendants advertised extensively in california through billboards,newspapers,and radio and television stations located in california.they also listed a phone number for making reservations at their hotels in their california advertisements and on their web site,and many of their california patrons used this number to make reservations.finally,defendants regularly sent mailings advertising their hotels to selected california residents.as a result of these promotional activities,defendants obtained a significant percentage of their patrons from california.thus,defendants purposefully and successfully solicited business from california residents.in doing so,defendants necessarily availed themselves of the benefits of doing business in california and could reasonably expect to be subject to the jurisdiction of courts in california 
in reaching this conclusion,we reject defendants contention that no purposeful availment exists here because the subject matter of their contracts with california residents resides exclusively in nevada.unlike the cases cited by defendants,which held that a few contracts with california residents could not,by themselves,establish purposeful availment our finding of purposeful
