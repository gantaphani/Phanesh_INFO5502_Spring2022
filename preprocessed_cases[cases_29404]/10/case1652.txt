complaint allegations and factual background 
on january,hale was admitted to sharp grossmont hospital.she was uninsured at the time,and on her admittance sharp required her to sign a form entitled admission agreement for inpatient and outpatient services hereafter admission agreement.the admission agreement provided,you hereby individually obligate yourself to pay the account of the hospital in accordance with the regular rates and terms of the hospital.sharp discharged hale the following day.during her stay,sharp provided her with medical treatment,central services,lab work,medication,emergency hospital care,and scans.sharp billed her for the services.
in august hale filed a putative class action against sharp for violation of the ucl,violation of the clra,breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.in september hale filed a first amended complaint fac with the same causes of action.
sharp successfully demurred to the fac,and in may hale filed the sac,which contains the same causes of action and is the subject of this appeal the sac alleges that contrary to sharp promise in its admission agreement to charge uninsured patients its regular rates,it engaged in an unfair and unreasonable pricing practice by charging them exponentially more for the same services than it accepted from patients covered by medicare or private insurance.the sac also alleges sharp practice has a significant detrimental impact on the large population of uninsured persons,who are generally the least able to afford medical care.
additionally,the sac alleges that hospitals,including sharp,maintain documents called chargemasters,which are spreadsheets that list the gross charge for each product and service provided by the hospital.plaintiff is informed and believes that these gross charges rarely,if ever,bear any relation to the hospital costs for providing treatment and differ from the actual,lower charges assessed against the overwhelming majority of patients who participate in medicare or private insurance programs.the sac alleges the chargemaster rates often form the starting point for negotiations with insurance companies and managed care organizations to determine reasonable and lower reimbursement rates,or for determining medicare outlier payments to hospitals.further,the sac alleges that when sharp admitted hale to its hospital,she made a down payment of.
sharp demurred to the sac.in a tentative ruling,the court sustained the demurrer to the ucl claim with leave to amend.the ruling states the sac sufficiently pleads injury in fact,but it is insufficient because it does not allege she relied on sharp charging its regular rates in receiving treatment.the ruling also sustained the demurrer to the clra claim with leave to amend,again on the ground the sac does not plead reliance on an alleged misrepresentation.the ruling overruled the demurrer to the breach of contract and implied covenant claims,explaining the sac sufficiently alleges hale performance or excuse for nonperformance.
after a hearing,the court took the matter under submission.the court later sustained the demurrer to all causes of action,without leave to amend on the ground the sac was hale third attempt to plead a valid cause of action.
hale moved for reconsideration and submitted a proposed third amended complaint tac.the court denied the motion.sharp then moved ex parte for dismissal of the sac,and the court granted the motion.a judgment was entered on january.

istandard of review 
a demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law.city of chula vista county of san diego th,d.in reviewing the propriety of the sustaining of a demurrer,the court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.citations.the court does not,however,assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.citation.the judgment must be affirmed if any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken.citations.citation.however,it is error for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory.citation.and it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d.

hospital billing practices 
preliminarily,we dispose of sharp argument that courts should discourage lawsuits based on disparities in hospital billing rates for uninsured and insured patients,since the matter is highly regulated.sharp cites such statutes as health safety code,section,subdivision a,which provides that a hospital shall make a written or electronic copy of its charge description master available either on its internet web site or at the hospital,and business and professions code section,subdivisions a and b,which,respectively,allow a hospital to grant a discount in fees for services in exchange for prompt payment,or when it reasonably believes a patient is not entitled to or eligible for insurance coverage.sharp asserts there is a disturbing national trend of cases that,like this one involving hale,seek to drag the judiciary into the complex area of health care finance and economic policy.further,sharp cites cases for the proposition these cases are generally unsuccessful.
when the legislature has permitted certain conduct,courts may not override that determination by declaring such conduct to be actionable under business and professions code section.citation.to forestall an action under the ucl,a provision must actually bar the action or clearly permit the conduct.there is a difference between not making an activity unlawful,and making that activity lawful.puentes wells fargo home mortgage,th,d.sharp does not defend the demurrer ruling on the ground the legislature has permitted sharp conduct or has actually barred this action.to the contrary,sharp concedes the statutes that govern the billing practices of hospitals are not precisely germane to this appeal.accordingly,sharp argument is irrelevant.
