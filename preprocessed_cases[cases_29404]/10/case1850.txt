introduction 
plaintiffs robert rocher and connie dahlin plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated brought this class action against defendant drug stores,defendant.plaintiffs allege that defendant wrongfully failed to pay overtime wages to class members,consisting of current and former employees classified by defendant as operating managers om and assistant managers am of defendant retail stores and claimed by defendant to be managerial employees exempt from overtime wage laws.the trial court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification.defendant petitioned this court for a writ of mandate to compel the trial court to deny class certification.we issued an order to show cause.
we shall issue the writ directing the trial court to vacate its order granting class certification.we hold the trial court abused its discretion.the disputed issue in this case,whether the class members were exempt from overtime wage laws,involves individual fact questions that predominate over undisputed common issues,rendering class action treatment inappropriate.in a later portion of this opinion we dispose of routine procedural issues regarding this writ proceeding.
legal background 
exemption from overtime wage requirements 
the underlying merits involve whether the am and om should have been paid overtime wages.defendant treated them as salaried managers exempt from the overtime wage laws.the period covered by the present complaint is april to april.a wage order of the industrial welfare commission relating to the mercantile industry,codified in title,california code of regulations section,provided that the overtime requirements do not apply to persons employed in administrative,executive,or professional capacities,defined as engaged in work which is primarily intellectual,managerial,or creative,and which requires exercise of discretion and independent judgment,subd.a.primarily was defined as more than the employee work time,subd.j.
in ramirez yosemite water cal th,d,involving an analogous wage order of the industrial welfare commission relating to outside salespersons,the california supreme court construed this quantitative test.the court held that in determining whether an individual employee is exempt,the first and foremost factor is the work actually performed by the employee the amounts of time the employee spends on exempt and nonexempt work,together with the employer realistic expectations and the realistic requirements of the job,must be considered.id.at fn,d.
the parties do not dispute that ramirez states the applicable test to determine whether an individual employee is exempt from the overtime requirements.parenthetically,we note that the industrial welfare commission subsequently adopted the ramirez test,in addition to other specific criteria,in its current wage order determining exemptions in the mercantile industry.industrial welfare commission wage order regulating wages,hours and working conditions in the mercantile industry,effective january,see.as before,primarily means more than the employee work time.
class action requirements 
a class action must meet certain prerequisites.among these,the questions of law or fact that are common to all members of the class must predominate over the questions of law or fact that are individual to each member.despite the existence of some common questions of law or fact,a class action may not be maintained if each member right to recover depends on separate facts applicable only to that individual.city of san jose superior court cal d,gerhard stephens cal d,weaver pasadena tournament of roses cal d,mccullah southern cal.gas th,d kennedy baxter healthcare th,d clausing san francisco unified school dist.d.brown regents of university of california d.

the issue in dispute in this writ proceeding is whether the common issues or the individual issues predominate.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs proposed two subclasses,all current and former salaried employees classified by defendant as om like plaintiff rocher who worked overtime hours but were not paid overtime compensation,and all current and former salaried employees classified by defendant as am like plaintiff dahlin who worked overtime hours but were not paid overtime compensation.the parties estimated there are between and members of the class,based on defendant having operated approximately retail stores during the relevant time period.plaintiffs alleged the members of the class were improperly and illegally by defendant as exempt managerial employees when,in fact,they were,employees according to california law.plaintiffs alleged,the duties and responsibilities of the salaried operating managers and assistant managers are virtually identical from region to region,area to area,store to store,and,employee to employee.further,any variations in job activities between the different individuals are legally insignificant to the issues presented by this action since the central facts remain,to wit,plaintiffs and the class members performed work in excess of of the time in their workday,that their workday routinely included work in excess of hours per week hours per work day and they have not been paid overtime compensation for their work under california law.
in their motion for class certification plaintiffs contended defendant store operations were standardized and that class certification was appropriate because defendant considered all am and om,as a class,to be exempt employees.
in its opposition to the motion defendant contended that whether any member of the class was exempt or nonexempt depended primarily on the tasks performed and the amount of time spent on those tasks.defendant contended,the range of activities performed by managers and the amount of time spent in such activities vary significantly from manager to manager based on multiple factors such as store location,size,physical layout,sales volume,hours of operation,management structure and style,experience level of the individual manager,and the number of hourly employees requiring supervision the evidence shows that it is impossible to make any meaningful generalizations regarding the employment circumstances of defendant managers.thus,contrary to plaintiffs position,the evidence demonstrates that the individual and unique factual inquiries required to determine whether defendant managers have been properly classified as exempt precluded determination of that issue on a basis.as for plaintiff argument that a class action was proper because defendant treated all am and om as exempt,defendant contended,the mere fact that defendant has treated its oms and ams as exempt,based on its reasonable expectation that managers in those positions would be performing primarily managerial duties,is not the equivalent to a finding that the legality of that determination can also be made on a basis.
in their reply memorandum plaintiffs continued to argue,it is the defendant who created this class when it unilaterally decided that every class member was exempt w hether or not the class created by defendant was properly classified is a predominant common issue that can be addressed on a basis i t is defendant,and,more precisely,its policy that is on the individual class members.
defendant contended that the declaration of its human resources manager and the declarations of of its am and om demonstrated significant variations from store to store and manager to manager in the tasks performed and amount of time spent on those tasks.plaintiffs contended the variations were not significant and that at trial plaintiffs would be able to show by valid representative or statistical evidence that as a class,the am and om spend more than percent of their time on nonexempt tasks.
after considering the parties papers and exhibits supporting and opposing class certification including the parties issue statements under los angeles superior court rule,the trial court certified the class.the court did not specifically discuss defendant contention that the individual issues predominate over the common issues.the court simply stated it granted the motion for class certification.the court written order,prepared by plaintiffs counsel for the court,included a recital that plaintiffs established by a preponderance of evidence that common questions of fact and law predominate.
on defendant petition for an extraordinary writ to review the trial court order granting class certification,we granted an order to show cause.relief by extraordinary writ is appropriate to prevent a burdensome trial in a massive class action.see city of glendale superior court th,d tjx companies,superior court th,d.
propriety of class action 
plaintiffs basic contention is that the propriety of class certification follows obviously from defendant having treated all its om and am as exempt employees.we disagree.even if plaintiffs could show that some om and am spend more than percent of their time on nonexempt tasks,it would not follow that all of them do.the fact that defendant has a common policy of treating all its om and am as exempt does not necessarily mean the common policy,when challenged in court,is either right as to all members of the class or wrong as to all members of the class.
defendant is entitled to defend against plaintiffs complaint.a defendant may defeat class action certification by showing that the defenses to be offered raise individual issues specific to each member of the class that predominate over the issues in common.gerhard stephens,supra,cal d,in claims regarding mineral rights,not only would each plaintiff member need to establish his or her individual proof of title from predecessors,but the defendants would undoubtedly raise the defense of abandonment of the mineral interests as to each alleged member of the class,which creates a factual issue as to the individual owner intent kennedy baxter healthcare,supra,th,d as to class of users of latex gloves,d efenses will require individual litigation of claims.health care workers may have been using latex gloves for a period of time exceeding the statute of limitations,thus requiring an examination of the viability of each plaintiff claim.questions will arise concerning assumption of the risk and comparative negligence block major league baseball th,d as to right of publicity of class of baseball players,affirmative defenses of consent,waiver,or estoppel would not be common for all members.the fact that the trial court would be obligated to evaluate each of these defenses for each member of the class weighed heavily against certification.
in this case,defendant showed that the proposed class action involved operations at approximately different stores and an estimated om and am.defendant showed there were wide variations in the types of stores and consequently wide variations in the types of activities and amounts of time per workweek spent on different types of activities by the om and am in those stores.
brad adams declared he is defendant human resources manager for the southern california northern area drug division and in that capacity is familiar with the personnel structure of defendant operations.between and defendant had between and retail stores in southern california.stores are located in broadly diversified communities.they range from stores to express stores in a shopping mall to combination stores inside a grocery store.they range in size from square feet to square feet.sales volume varies widely among stores,which affects how much time a manager spends regulating inventory,meeting with vendors,and merchandising.stores range in hours of operation from hours days per week to hours days per week,which affect the types of activities performed by a manager.defendant had three management classifications general manager gm,operating manager om,and assistant manager am.large stores might employ a gm,one or two om,and one or two am,whereas small stores or combination stores might employ only one gm and either one om or one am.most stores also employ supervisors.the number of supervisors varies from store to store depending on the gm staffing preferences,the hours of operation,and the sales volume.the number of hourly employees to be supervised range from to.during each shift the salaried managers supervise between and hourly employees.the number of hourly employees and the composition of the employee base affect the om or am supervisory duties.om and am with many employees spend virtually all their time delegating and supervising,whereas am with only a few employees may spend more time on nonmanagerial duties.an am or om in a store with high turnover or a large percentage of employees may spend significantly more time interviewing,hiring,training,and closely supervising employees.the management style and experience level of gm,who exercise broad discretion in assigning duties to their management teams,differ from store to store.as a result,there can be significant variations among the duties of am and om.another variation is that some gm are also market managers mm responsible for several stores such gm spend less time in their store,which may result in greater responsibility for an om or am.defendant publishes corporate policies and procedures to provide guidance to managers,but these are not rigid prescriptions,only guidance to assist managers in exercising their discretion and independent judgment based on the circumstances of the particular store.defendant publishes job descriptions for am and om providing guidance on the general nature and level of work expected,but these are not exhaustive.
next,defendant submitted declarations from different am and om describing in detail the nature of their work.defendant offered a summary to show that the declarations exhibited significant variations from store to store and manager to manager depending on variables such as the gm management style,experience level,and status as an mm the number of om and am the experience level of the am or om and the store location,type,size,and sales volume.
by this showing defendant demonstrated there would be individualized fact issues as to each member of the class in order to determine whether that member spent more than of his or her workweek on activities constituting exempt work,which is the primary test of the exemption from overtime compensation.
plaintiffs failed to sustain their burden to show,to the contrary,that the operations in defendant stores and the amounts of time spent by om and am on exempt or nonexempt activities were so uniform as to be appropriate for determination.
plaintiffs contend they established the necessary commonality of issues through defendant own company policies,practices,and procedures.plaintiffs cite the following examples defendant issued job descriptions for the titles of am and om describing their functions,and as discussed ante,defendant treated all its am and om as exempt,based on defendant reasonable expectations that am and om primarily perform exempt tasks defendant used the same form for conducting performance reviews of management associates defendant had compensation programs applying to am and om defendant had training programs for am and om designed to ensure a consistent message defendant had a minimum workweek of hours for all exempt members of management defendant had no compliance program to train employees on the differences between exempt and nonexempt work activities under california law and defendant admitted it lacked knowledge of,and had performed no studies or surveys to determine,the actual hours worked by am and om or the amounts of time spent by them on exempt and nonexempt tasks.
these factors do not prove plaintiffs point.they tend only to prove issues that will not be in dispute in the underlying trial of the merits.defendant does not dispute that it considers all the am and om to be exempt from overtime wage requirements.the issue in dispute is how the am and om spend their time.the policies,practices,and procedures cited by plaintiffs do not address that issue nor show that the way the am and om spend their time is so standard or uniform as to be triable on a basis.
plaintiffs next claim they submitted evidence of the actual tasks performed by class members through defendant own admissions in answers to interrogatories.the answers cited do not support plaintiffs position.the interrogatories requested defendant to describe nonexempt tasks performed by om and am.defendant answered that the om and am do not routinely perform nonexempt tasks,and,further and specifically,the types of tasks,if any,vary significantly from employee to employee and from store to store based on a wide variety of operational factors.
plaintiffs next claim to have offered statistical evidence to support their assertion the amount of time spent on exempt and nonexempt activities may be determined.they analogize to stephens montgomery ward d.stephens was a gender discrimination case,in which the class plaintiff showed by statistics that women were underrepresented in management positions.combined with evidence that promotional decisions were centrally controlled,this was held sufficient to show that the common issues predominated,as against the defendant claim that the facts relating to promotional decisions varied from store to store.id.at.plaintiffs evidence in the present case was nothing of the kind.this evidence was merely plaintiffs summary of defendant declarations,summarizing what percentage of time each declarant allocated between what the declarant characterized as managerial versus nonmanagerial tasks.this was not at all like disparate impact statistics in a discrimination case.if anything,plaintiffs summary merely confirmed defendant point that the allocations of time spent on exempt and nonexempt tasks varied considerably from store to store and employee to employee.
finally,plaintiffs claim several declarations and answers to interrogatories support their position that the activities of the am and om are sufficiently uniform to make a determination.
the answers to interrogatories of the named plaintiffs rocher and dahlin merely describe their work and do not address whether the work of other om and am is uniformly similar.similarly a declaration of mario gardner,a former am,addresses only his work.
benissa clifford declared that for the past years she has been a gm at several of defendant stores and has trained am.in her opinion am spend most of their time in mundane nonmanagerial work and hardly ever do anything which can be considered intellectual,managerial,creative or training.based on her experience,the practices and conduct described herein were typical of drug stores in california.stephen aldag declared that he has worked at of defendant stores from through,and since as a gm.he based his opinion on his experience at different stores as a gm,and on working with different am who were frequently rotated among stores,by which he came to know their work and the operations of others of defendant stores.in his opinion,am perform little,if any,managerial work.further,the type of work performed by assistant managers does not vary by store.each store was and is operated in the same manner,and requires the same essential work,as one might expect in a chain of retail stores.therefore,the actual work performed by assistant managers on a daily basis was virtually identical in stores,and remains so.finally,richard featherstone declared he has been an am and an om in his years of experience at of defendant stores.in his experience working with am,they did little managerial work,if any at all.b y far the majority of their time more than was spent performing tasks.in the same words as aldag,featherstone stated the type of work performed by am does not vary from store to store.
these declarations are not determinative.a trial court order granting or denying class certification is reviewed by an appellate court under an abuse of discretion standard.city of san jose superior court,supra,cal d,trial court abused its discretion by granting class certification linder thrifty oil cal th,d,trial court did not abuse its great discretion by denying class certification.although deferential to the trial court ruling,appellate courts utilize their own reasoning in determining whether individual issues would arise in the litigation and predominate over common issues.see gerhard stephens,supra,cal d,appellate court added reasons relating to defenses that would be raised,in addition to trial court reasons concerning issues individual to each plaintiff title claim accord,linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th at,d,trial court reasoning must be examined.appellate courts insist that trial courts carefully weigh the respective benefits and burdens and deny class certification when each member right to recover depends on facts individual to the member case.city of san jose superior court,supra,cal d at.
we conclude based on all the circumstances of this case that the trial court abused its discretion in certifying this class action.this case involves approximately stores and am and om.defendant showed that the stores and the circumstances under which the am and om operate are not identical but rather involve significant variations affecting their tasks and the amounts of time spent on those tasks.the evidence relating to the disputed issue in the litigation,whether the members of the class spend more than percent of their workweek on nonexempt tasks,would involve separate facts applicable only to each member of the class,rendering a class action inappropriate.the trial court did not offer reasons why the common issues predominate,and its conclusion that they do was unreasonable based on the whole record.the mere existence of two declarations opining that all the work of all the am at all of defendant stores is identical is not conclusive and does not compel upholding the trial court ruling.plaintiffs evidence to show that the work is so uniform as to justify class action litigation addressed irrelevant issues or was otherwise insubstantial,conclusory,or incredible.
defendant does not contend,nor do we hold,that a class action can never be appropriate for managerial employees claiming to have been wrongly treated as exempt from overtime wage requirements.in another case,evidence might exist justifying a reasonable inference that the hours spent by managers on nonexempt tasks are so uniform as to be triable on a class basis.but,in this case,with so many stores and managers operating under different conditions,plaintiffs failed to sustain their burden to show that common issues predominate over individual issues.
we are aware of several california appellate cases in which overtime entitlements were adjudicated in a class action.in most of these the propriety of a class action was not a disputed issue addressed in the appellate opinion.morillion royal packing cal th,d,whether agricultural employees were entitled to compensation for time spent traveling to and from the fields on buses on demurrer,court addressed the merits,not the propriety of class action madera police officers city of madera cal d,whether police officers were entitled to overtime for meal periods when they were required to remain available to be called away for emergencies trial on merits conducted on appeal,merits decided with no discussion of propriety of class action bell farmers ins.exchange th,d whether claims representatives were exempt from overtime wage requirements as administrative employees summary adjudication of issues reviewed on the merits,with no discussion of propriety of class action.tjx companies,superior court,supra,th,d,is more closely in point but also failed to decide the issue of propriety of the class action.similar to this case,it was a class action by assistant managers of retail stores in two store chains,maxx and marshalls.on demurrer,the defendant argued,like defendant here,that how th
