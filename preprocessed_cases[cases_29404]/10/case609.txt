dryvit systems,petitions for review,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f,of the district court certification of a plaintiff class of homeowners who allege that dryvit stucco siding product,fastrak system fastrak,was negligently designed and that dryvit failed to warn purchasers of the product alleged defects.this circuit has not yet had occasion to articulate the standard governing our consideration of petitions under rule f.we adopt a sliding scale test to guide the consideration of such petitions,grant the petition,and hold that certification of this class is inappropriate at this time because it is likely that individual issues necessary to adjudicate dryvit liability will predominate over class issues in a manner inconsistent with the dictates of federal rule of civil procedure b.we thus grant dryvit petition for review and vacate the district court class certification order.
fastrak is a stucco siding product that is installed on the exterior of a building in order to provide a shield that protects the building from weather.fastrak consists of several component parts a a sheathing comprised of georgia pacific corporation dens glass gold product b dryvit base coat ncb c reinforcing mesh and d dryvit finish coat.dryvit sells the various components of the system to independent distributors and provides instructions and specifications to applicators,who buy the components from various suppliers and produce the final product.applicators are usually hired by general contractors to install fastrak on the exterior of a new building responsibility for installing fastrak and integrating it with other building components,such as windows,doors,flashing,and the roof is shared between applicators,general contractors,and subcontractors.dryvit asserts that fastrak can fail for various reasons related to the conduct of third parties,such as applicator error,use of incorrect materials,or improperly sealing fastrak to other components of a building,such as windows or the roof.
fastrak design is based upon the premise that a properly barrier can prevent the intrusion of water behind the siding product,eliminating the need for drainage between the siding and the wall of a structure.the plaintiff class argues that a barrier of this sort can not be installed correctly in the field and will inevitably lack water resistance and ability to resist applied loads.
on july,plaintiff robert lienhart and others collectively lienhart filed a complaint in the superior court for wake county,north carolina against defendant dryvit,for themselves and on behalf of a class comprised of all entities in north carolina whose buildings were constructed after january,using fastrak.lienhart alleged that dryvit had committed negligence,gross negligence,negligent misrepresentation,fraud,and unfair and deceptive trade practices.lienhart alleged that fastrak caused damage to their structures by trapping water within each structure walls.on july,dryvit removed this action to the united states district court for the eastern district of north carolina based on diversity of citizenship.on december,the district court certified the proposed class.certification was limited to the issues of whether dryvit product was defectively designed and whether dryvit had breached a duty to warn homeowners of the hazards inherent in the use of its product.
dryvit timely filed a petition for review pursuant to rule f with this court 
this circuit has not yet had occasion to consider the standards for granting a petition to appeal class certification under federal rule of civil procedure f,a new provision added in to rule,the rule governing class actions.
rule f provides 
a court of appeals may in its discretion permit an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying class action certification under this rule if application is made to it within ten days after entry of the order.an appeal does not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the court of appeals so orders.
the advisory committee note to rule f states that the court of appeals is given unfettered discretion whether to permit a rule f appeal,akin to the discretion exercised by the supreme court in acting on a petition for certiorari.f advisory committee note.noting that t he courts of appeals will develop standards for granting review that reflect the changing areas of uncertainty in class litigation,the advisory committee note states that p ermission to appeal may be granted or denied on the basis of any consideration that the court of appeals finds persuasive.id.the note discusses three circumstances in which such review may be especially appropriate where an order denying certification effectively ends the litigation because the individual claims are uneconomical to litigate,so that no review will in practice be available from a final judgment where an order granting certification effectively ends the litigation because it produces irresistible pressure on the defendant to settle and when the certification decision turns on a novel or unsettled question of law.id.
the first federal court of appeals decision addressing the standards for granting a rule f petition was the seventh circuit opinion in blair equifax check,cir.the seventh circuit noted that in light of the discretionary nature of rule f,it would be inappropriate to adopt a approach which would unduly constrain the court discretion.id.at.however,the court discussed and elaborated upon some circumstances which may justify the grant of a rule f petition.first,the court stated that when denial of class status seems likely to be fatal,and when the plaintiff has a solid argument in opposition to the district court decision,review is warranted.id.in this area,however,the seventh circuit cautioned that courts entertaining such death knell rule f claims must be wary lest the mind hear a bell that is not tolling,noting that even where individual claims would ordinarily be too small to litigate individually,law firms with substantial resources may pursue an individual claim to final judgment in the hope of winning a favorable ruling on class certification on appeal from final judgment.id.second,the court stated that review may be appropriate where a grant of class certification creates irresistible pressure on the defendant to settle,especially where the plaintiff probability of success on the merits is slight.id.noting that some plaintiffs or even some district judges may be tempted to use the class device to wring settlements from defendants whose legal positions are justified but unpopular,the court suggested that the interaction of procedure with the merits justifies an earlier appellate look.id.third,the seventh circuit held that whether hearing an appeal would help to facilitate the development of the law by clearing up a significant unresolved issue also is relevant.id.at.the court reasoned that one of the purposes of rule f was to promote the development of case law regarding certain fundamental class action issues which tend to be because so many class actions are settled or otherwise resolved in ways that preclude eventual appellate consideration of procedural issues.the court noted that when the basis for granting review is to contribute to the development of the law,it is less important to show that the district judge decision is shaky,as affirmances as well as reversals may serve to illuminate important questions.id.thus,the court granted the rule f petition before it to resolve issues related to the propriety of multiple,overlapping,concurrently litigated class actions,but it ultimately affirmed the district court certification order.id.at.
the first circuit,in waste management holdings,mowbray,cir,adopted several variations on the seventh circuit approach in blair.the court noted that it ordinarily will grant leave to appeal when a rule f application falls into one of the three blair categories,but noted its ongoing discretion in this area.id.at.the court also restricted the third blair category to those instances in which an appeal will permit the resolution of an unsettled legal issue that is important to the particular litigation as well as important in itself and likely to escape effective review if left hanging until the end of the case.id.the stated rationale for this additional restriction was that otherwise it would be too easy for creative lawyers to argue that their case involves a fundamental issue,undermining the objective of making rule f review the exception,not the rule.id.
in bush,cir,the eleventh circuit further elaborated upon rule f standards.noting that given the volume of class action litigation in the district courts,routine interlocutory appellate review of class certifications is simply not practicable,the court announced several guideposts to be used in evaluating rule f petitions.id.at.recognizing that rule f was explicitly promulgated to replace the use of mandamus in reviewing manifestly erroneous class certifications,the court stated that it would be inappropriate to review such petitions under standards as stringent as those which govern mandamus.id.at.accordingly,the court set forth five factors that are relevant to the appropriateness of granting a rule f petition whether the certification ruling is likely dispositive of the litigation whether the district court certification decision contains a substantial weakness whether the appeal will permit the resolution of an unsettled legal question of general importance the nature and status of the litigation before the district court such as the presence of outstanding dispositive motions and the status of discovery and the likelihood that future events will make appellate review more or less appropriate.id.at.
in explaining the second factor,substantial weakness in the class certification,the eleventh circuit noted that interlocutory review may be appropriate when it promises to spare the parties and the district court the expense and burden of litigating the matter to final judgment only to have it inevitably reversed on an appeal.id.at.the eleventh circuit held that this factor is to be viewed on a sliding scale with the other factors,such that the stronger the case that class certification was a clear abuse of discretion,the weaker a showing is needed on the other factors to gain review.id.at.as to the third factor,the court noted that the impact of the questions at issue to related actions involving the same or parties is an appropriate part of the inquiry relative to this prong.id.at.the eleventh circuit explained its fifth factor,the likelihood that future events may make appellate review more or less appropriate,by reference to issues such as the prospect of imminent settlement negotiations or the status of an action as the of a number of similar claims.id.
dryvit reads to suggest that a sufficient showing of substantial weakness,the third factor,alone can constitute grounds for granting a rule f motion.dryvit also embraces somewhat more expansive list of factors capable of supporting a grant of a rule f petition.lienhart,on the other hand,argues that mowbray,with its emphasis on the importance of an unsettled issue of law of general importance,substantially narrowed the blair approach,and contends that further limited mowbray approach.respondent answer,at asserting that each successive court of appeals that has dealt with.f has limited and narrowed the availability of such an appeal.
we do not believe that limited mowbray to the contrary,by adding the weakness of the district court certification decision as an independent factor supporting review and noting that the impact of a question raised in a rule f petition on related litigation can favor review,the court broadened the bases for a grant of review.see,at rule f review may be appropriate to spare the parties and the district court the expense and burden of litigating the matter to final judgment only to have it inevitably reversed.in light of rule f purpose to eliminate the unduly restrictive review practices which obtained when mandamus was the only available means to review a class certification prior to final judgment in the absence of a district court decision to voluntarily certify the issue for immediate review,we do not believe the exceptionally stringent standards for review urged by lienhart are appropriate.standards certainly must reflect the limited capacity of appellate courts to consider interlocutory appeals,as well as the institutional advantage possessed by district courts in managing the course of litigation and the judicial diseconomy of permitting routine interlocutory appeals.routine interlocutory review of class certifications is simply not feasible as a practical matter.see id.at noting that there are too many class actions filed each year for federal appeals courts practicably to adjudicate class certification decisions on an interlocutory basis as a matter of course.however,we must remain cognizant that rule f was enacted by the supreme court to permit such appeals,pursuant to an express grant of authority by congress to create appellate jurisdiction over judgments.see e.in addition to addressing death knell situations and promoting the resolution of legal questions of general importance,a careful and sparing use of rule f may promote judicial economy by enabling the correction of certain manifestly flawed class certifications prior to trial and final judgment.
where a district court certification decision is manifestly erroneous and virtually certain to be reversed on appeal,the issues involved need not be of general importance,nor must the certification decision constitute a death knell for the litigation.such a rule would waste,rather than conserve,judicial resources,because defective classes would proceed through trial to final judgment,only to face certain decertification on appeal and a requirement that the process begin again from square one.the weakness of the district court certification,viewed in terms of the likelihood of reversal under an abuse of discretion standard,operates on a sliding scale in conjunction with the other factors enumerated by the eleventh circuit in.in extreme cases,where decertification is a functional certainty,the weakness of the certification order may alone suffice to permit the court of appeals to grant review.conversely,when the weakness of the district court certification is less substantial or insubstantial,a commensurately stronger showing on the other factors is necessary to support review.we thus adopt the eleventh circuit test for judging the appropriateness of granting a petition for review under rule f,and hold that the substantial weakness prong operates on a sliding scale to determine the strength of the necessary showing regarding the other factors.see,at.
having adopted,with some elaboration,the test for determining when to grant a rule f petition,we now apply this test to the rule f petition before us.the grant of oral argument in this case for the purpose of addressing the proper rule f issue of first impression in this of necessity led to an extensive examination of the merits of class certification.for the reasons set forth below,and after extensively reviewing the merits of the district court certification,we conclude that,on the current state of the factual record,the proposed class certification is manifestly erroneous and is certain to be vacated on appeal from final judgment.thus,under the approach we have adopted,review is appropriate without regard to the other factors in order to avoid the judicial diseconomy entailed in allowing a class certification which is clearly infirm to be litigated to final judgment only to face vacatur on appeal.therefore,we grant the petition for review under rule f
