usa,appeals the district court certification of a class action brought against it on behalf of its former sales employees regarding the company policy for paying commissions on the sale of prepaid cellular telephone accounts.the class seeks damages to recover those commissions.after a thorough review,we find numerous flaws,both procedural and substantive,in the district court class certification analysis under rule of the federal rules of procedure and find,further,that the proposed class,as pled,is not amenable to rule certification.we therefore hold that the district court abused its discretion in certifying the class,vacate the certification order,and remand with the instruction that the plaintiff claims proceed individually.
is a provider of cellular telephone services.although it offers various service plans,those plans generally fall under one of two classifications term contract plans,in which a customer pays a monthly access fee for a specified period of time,one or two years and prepaid or pay as you go plans,under which a customer purchases a set number of telephone minutes,and,when that bucket of minutes runs out,the customer chooses whether or not to buy more minutes.under the prepaid plans,the customer makes a,payment for the minutes purchased and may use those minutes at any time prior to the minutes expiration,which is specified in the customer agreement.
plaintiff henry vega was employed by from april through july,when he was discharged for poor attendance.he worked as a retail sales representative at a retail store in miami,florida.throughout his tenure,vega compensation was subject to the guidelines set forth in the company sales incentive compensation program the compensation program,which took effect on march,upon commencing his employment,vega received a copy of the written compensation program,including an attachment outlining the compensation plan for his specific position,and returned a signed acknowledgment form indicating that he read and understood the compensation program,both generally and with respect to his specific position.
as reflected in the compensation program,the compensation structure for sales employees varied by business channel and job position within a given channel.generally,paid its retail sales representatives,its employees,like vega,who sold products and services through owned and operated retail stores an hourly wage plus commissions.part of the monthly commission was derived from the employee net activations for the month.the sales representative received credit and payment for a new activation whenever one of his customers commenced a new service plan.should that customer later deactivate the service within days of activation,however,would charge back the amount of the incentive compensation previously paid in order to reclaim that amount from the sales representative.as explained repeatedly in the compensation program,both generally and specifically with respect to retail sales representative compensation,c ommissions are paid as an advance against commissions anticipated to be earned in the future.commissions are not earned until the expiration of the commission charge back window.accordingly,if the customer deactivates their sic account with sic the period,will revoke the advanced commission it previously paid out.
significantly,although it set forth general guidelines describing compensation structure and procedures,the written document outlining the compensation program carried a number of disclaimers.for instance,the front cover of the document prominently included the following boxed statement 
notice this document contains guidelines relating to the compensation of certain sales professionals.this document and any oral,written or electronic communication related to the subject matter contained in this document are not intended and shall not be read to create any express or implied contract or promise of specific treatment or benefits in specific situations.your employment relationship with is and either you or can terminate your employment at any time without cause or advance notice.in sole discretion,this document and the guidelines stated herein may be changed or discontinued at any time without prior notice.

in january,instituted a new business rule with respect to its accounting for prepaid service plans.specifically,began to consider a prepaid account to be deactivated when the customer did not use his prepaid service for ninety consecutive days.the impetus for this change was to ensure an accurate tally of the number of active subscribers in the company financial reports.even though,under the new annual prepaid plan introduced that year,the customer could use his prepaid minutes for up to a year following the date of purchase,the company decided to consider customers with accounts that have been inactive for ninety days no longer to be active subscribers,and their accounts were deemed deactivated.by july,this new business rule had been implemented throughout operations,including its incentive commission structure.this meant that sales representatives who received advanced commissions for sales of prepaid accounts,which subsequently were deactivated due to ninety days of inactivity during the commission charge back period,would be charged back for those commissions.according to testimony from william steele,manager of sales compensation design,while the company did not formally amend the compensation program document to include this supplementation to the definition of deactivation,informed its sales force of this new business rule and its potential impact on sales commissions,as it regularly did when it instituted similar procedural modifications,through the transmission of sales commission pieces,including conference calls,the company website,newsletters,bulletins,and formal and informal training.
vega filed this putative class action in florida state court on december.the gravamen of his complaint is that,by charging back commissions advanced on sales of deactivated prepaid service plans,violated the terms of the compensation program,failed to pay commissions earned by the sales representatives,and was unjustly enriched by retaining the benefit of its employees services without fully compensating them for such services.vega complaint,however,does not expressly connect alleged payment obligations to any particular contract,including the written compensation program.indeed,the complaint does not even mention the sales incentive compensation program.instead,with respect to its claims,the complaint simply alleges that,because prepaid customers paid for their service,bore no risk of that when charged its employees back for commissions on prepaid plans,even though received the full benefit of its agreement with the prepaid plan customers,commission based employees lost the benefits of those sales and the resulting commissions and that has unfair sic and unjustly profited from its internal systems error by unduly charging back its employees on the prepaid plans and retaining its employee sic wages for its own use and benefit.
the complaint contains two counts count i,unpaid wages,and count ii,unjust enrichment.both counts seek damages for sales commissions that vega claims improperly withheld or charged back from its employees furthermore,assuming or implying though never expressly alleging in the complaint that all sales employees were subject to the same compensation program,vega brought his action on behalf of,and sought certification of,a putative nationwide class defined as follows 
all employees of who received,or were entitled to receive,commissions for the sale of prepaid cellular telephone plans who did not receive their commissions or were charged back by for their commissions between the commencement of the statute of limitations through the date that the court certifies this suit as a class action.
despite the incomplete and ambiguous allegations in the complaint,vega essentially argued in the district court and in this court that the written compensation program document exclusively and uniformly controlled the compensation of sales representatives,that the compensation program did not provide for commission charge backs on prepaid service plans,and that,by implementing its business rule,unfairly and unilaterally attempted to the compensation agreement with respect to prepaid plans.
on march,removed the case on the basis of diversity jurisdiction pursuant to,as amended by the class action fairness act cafa on january,following the close of all discovery including merits discovery and more than a year after filing the complaint,vega moved for class certification.on the same day,although the district court had established a may,deadline for amending the pleadings,vega moved to amend his complaint to add a count for breach of contract,specifically referencing the compensation program.in his class certification motion,in addition to the nationwide class definition initially pled,vega alternatively sought certification of a subclass consisting of employees who worked in florida vega also expressly excluded current employees,among others,from the class definitions proposed in his motion.filed an opposition to vega motion for class certification,and,while that motion was pending,it also filed a motion for summary judgment.
on april,the district court denied vega motion for leave to amend his the court described as having been filed in the fourth quarter of the game,with the minutes ticking down to conclusion because it found that such untimely amendment would prejudice the defendant as discovery has ended,and would cause undue delay if discovery were.
on may,six days before the case was scheduled to go to district court entered its order on class certification and summary judgment.the district court found two problems with the class definition proposed by vega the putative nationwide class lacked commonality due to variations in the contract and employment laws of the fifty states and as the factual allegations in the complaint focused on charge backs of commissions already paid,but indicated nothing about any failure to pay commissions in the first instance,the inclusion in the class of employees who were entitled to receive commissions who did not receive their commissions would implicate claims falling outside the scope of the complaint,as pled,and,thus,failed the typicality requirement.nevertheless,pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,the district court certified the following modified class 
all employees in florida who received commissions for the sale of prepaid cellular telephone plans,but were charged back by for those commissions between the commencement of the statute of limitations through the date that the court certified this suit as a class action.excluded from the class are the officers,directors,agents,servants,or employees of defendants sic 
in the same order,the district court also denied motion for summary judgment,finding that vega adequately pled claims for breach of an employment contract and unjust enrichment and that the evidence revealed disputed issues of material fact.

we review the procedures the district court undertook in conducting the rule analysis,whether the conclusions it reached were within its discretion given the mandates of rule,and whether vega complaint,as pled,can sustain class action certification under rule.finding deficiencies on all three scores,we vacate the class certification and remand with the instruction that vega claims proceed individually.
initially,we examine whether the factual record provided the district court with an adequate basis to find that the class,as certified,meets rule a numerosity requirement,whether the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.a.the district court,after first noting that,as a general rule,one may say that less than is inadequate for a finding of numerosity,more than forty is adequate,and numbers falling in between are open to judgment based on other factors,concluded that well over forty individuals fall within the class definition adopted by this court.see cox am.cast iron pipe,cir citing moore fed.prac.at see also kilgo bowman,cir affirming certification of a class of at least individual class members.but see crawford western,cir we certainly can not say that a class of satisfies the numerosity requirements as a matter of law.
vega,in his class certification motion,cited only the deposition testimony of william steele,manager of sales compensation design,in support of his argument for numerosity.in his testimony,steele agreed that the number of retail sales associates employed by between the years and was in the thousands.while this testimony easily would constitute a sufficient basis for a finding of numerosity as it relates to a nationwide class,the district court,significantly,certified a class.we have noted that,a lthough mere allegations of numerosity are insufficient to meet this prerequisite,a plaintiff need not show the precise number of members in the class.evans pipe foundry,cir.nevertheless,a plaintiff still bears the burden of making some showing,affording the district court the means to make a supported factual finding,that the class actually certified meets the numerosity requirement.vega has not cited,and we can not locate in the record,any evidence whatsoever or even an allegation of the number of retail sales associates employed during the class period in florida who would comprise the membership of the class,as certified by the district court 
yes,is a large company,with many retail outlets,and,as such,it might be tempting to assume that the number of retail sales associates the company employed in florida during the relevant period can overcome the generally low hurdle presented by rule a.however,a plaintiff still bears the burden of establishing every element of rule,see valley drug,at,and a district court factual findings must find support in the evidence before it.in this case,the district court inference of numerosity for a class without the aid of a shred of evidence was an exercise in sheer speculation.accordingly,the district court abused its discretion by finding the numerosity requirement to be satisfied with respect to a class when the record is utterly devoid of any showing that the certified class of sales representatives in florida is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.a 
we next turn to the question of commonality under rule a.after observing that the district court improperly conflated the commonality determination with a review for predominance pursuant to rule b,and in the process failed to make a sufficient finding of either,we explain why vega claims,as pled,can not satisfy the commonality or predominance requirements.
the district court described the commonality inquiry as assessing whether issues that are subject to generalized inquiry,and thus applicable to the class as a whole,predominate over issues that are amenable only to individualized inquiry.initially,this is a clear misreading of rule.
the commonality requirement demands only that there be questions of law or fact common to the class.a.this part of the rule does not require that all the questions of law and fact raised by the dispute be common,cox,at,or that the common questions of law or fact predominate over individual issues.here,however,the district court took this relatively light burden and appears to have merged it with the rule b predominance requirement,albeit without saying so directly.
the district court certification order was rather opaque about the way in which the court conducted its rule analysis.we assume for three reasons that the court attempted to collapse its predominance analysis into the commonality under a section heading entitled commonality.first,as mentioned,the court described its commonality assessment as a determination of whether issues that are subject to generalized inquiry predominate over issues that are amenable only to individualized inquiry emphasis added.second,the section of the district court order entitled rule b and the class definition where we would expect to see a discussion of rule b only to superiority and contains no mention of predominance at all.therefore,if the court did not attempt to include its predominance assessment in its discussion of commonality,then it entirely neglected to consider the critical element of situation that would constitute an obvious abuse of discretion and clear reversible error jackson motel multipurpose,cir rule b,however,imposes two additional requirements,and increased efficiency is only one of them.predominance is the other.third,the district court language purporting to find commonality among a class has the distinct ring of a predominance determination 
this entire dispute centers essentially on the meaning and justifiable applicability of one compensation sales incentive compensation applied uniformly by to its employees.as such,the adjudication of the disputes concerning this compensation program will resolve the liability issues for all members of the class.
accordingly,the district court apparent intermingling of the commonality and predominance inquiries demonstrates,at best,imprecision in the organization of the class certification order or,at worst,a fundamental misapplication of rule.either way,the district court rule methodology causes us great concern.
on the one hand,it arguably could be said that the district court implicitly found both commonality and predominance.after all,the court effectively appears to have made a predominance determination,notwithstanding its appearance in the section of the order on commonality and the absence of an invocation of rule b in that section,and such a questions of law or fact common to the class members predominate over any question affecting only individual members.b necessarily requires an antecedent finding that there is at least one common question of law or fact in the first place.
nevertheless,the rigorous analysis required of a district court under rule does not allow us to be so generous or forgiving.castano,at.here,the district court misstated the commonality requirement as the predominance analysis and,in the process,elided at best a direct finding of commonality.indeed,although it ambiguously alluded to disputes concerning this compensation program and the program meaning and justifiable applicability,the court never actually identified a single specific common question of law or fact.furthermore,while the court arguably made an effective predominance determination,it managed to do if by a single reference to rule b and with an discussion of the relevant facts.rule demands significantly greater analytical rigor and precision backing into the requisite findings,and relying on a reviewing court to connect the dots,is not enough.we therefore find that the district court abused its discretion by following improper procedures in making its determinations,to the extent it made them at all,with respect to commonality and predominance.
in addition,even if we were to deem adequate the district court commonality and predominance methodologies,the court substantive application of these rule requirements in this case was unreasonable enough to constitute an abuse of discretion.
vega,on behalf of the putative class,asserted two claims in his complaint unpaid wages and unjust enrichment.for the complaint to support class certification as to commonality and predominance,there must be common questions of law or fact among the class relating to one or both of these substantive claims,and,in addition,those common questions must predominate such that they ha ve a direct impact on every class member effort to establish liability that is more substantial than the impact of individualized issues in resolving the claim or claims of each class member.klay,at citation omitted alteration in original.under the rule a commonality requirement,a class action must involve issues that are susceptible to proof.murray auslander,cir.even if the court can identify common questions of law or fact,however,t he predominance inquiry is far more demanding than rule a commonality requirement.rutstein avis,cir quoting jackson,at,which quotes,in turn,amchem,windsor,d.
whether an issue predominates can only be determined after considering what value the resolution of the issue will have in each class member underlying cause of action.klay,at quoting rutstein,at.in practical terms,we have described the test for predominance as follows 
where,after adjudication of the classwide issues,plaintiffs must still introduce a great deal of individualized proof or argue a number of individualized legal points to establish most or all of the elements of their individual claims,such claims are not suitable for class certification under rule b i f common issues truly predominate over individualized issues in a lawsuit,then the addition or subtraction of any of the plaintiffs to or from the class should not have a substantial effect on the substance or quantity of evidence offered.put simply,if the addition of more plaintiffs to a class requires the presentation of significant amounts of new evidence,that strongly suggests that individual issues made relevant only through the inclusion of these new class members are important.if,on the other hand,the addition of more plaintiffs leaves the quantum of evidence introduced by the plaintiffs as a whole relatively undisturbed,then common issues are likely to predominate.
klay,at quotations omitted.
at the threshold,the parties dispute whether florida law even recognizes an independent cause of action for unpaid wages.argues that vega asserted the unpaid wages claim exclusively under.stat,a section of florida labor statutes that provides for the payment of attorneys fees and costs to prevailing parties in actions for unpaid wages but that does not,itself,create an independent cause of action see edwards niles sales,d,noting that an action for unpaid or back wages,for which may permit recovery of fees and costs,must be brought pursuant to some other law.vega responds that his unpaid wages claim is based on a breach of the compensation agreement and on common law in short,that it is basically a breach of contract claim.
the common law concerning breach of contract could certainly constitute one form of the some other law that could undergird an action for unpaid wages however,we see no indication in florida law that an unpaid wages claim,in and of itself,is necessarily the equivalent of a breach of contract claim.rather,actions for unpaid wages are typically pled as breach of contract claims wherein the agreement in question happens to be an employment or compensation contract.indeed,vega implicitly acknowledged that unpaid wages and breach of contract claims are distinct,and at least that the latter does not fully encompass the former,when he attempted to amend his complaint to add a count for breach of contract and to plead the first the compensation program,which attempted amendments the district court rejected therefore,although vega nominal unpaid wages claim includes language about breach ing the agreement and the breach,he,in his operative complaint,neither pled a claim for breach of contract nor identified a contract or agreement that purportedly breached.as such,vega own pleading precludes him from relying on a breach of contract theory to support his unpaid wages claim.
nevertheless,vega essentially argues that we should treat his unpaid wages claim as a breach of contract claim.the district court,notwithstanding its express denial of leave to amend the complaint to add a breach of contract claim,apparently accepted this argument,as the court identified vega claims as breach of contract and unjust enrichment and proceeded to conduct its rule analysis as if vega had pled the very breach of contract claim that the court had disallowed just two weeks earlier.we have no ready explanation for this display of cognitive dissonance by the district court,and we strongly disapprove of this exercise in judicial rewriting of the plaintiff pleading.in any event,although the legal adequacy of the unpaid wages claim and allegations pled in vega complaint is certainly suspect,even if we were to consider the unpaid wages count as one for breach of only common law basis vega advances for the allegations in his complaint can not satisfy the commonality and predominance elements required for class certification.
for a breach of contract claim,florida law requires the plaintiff to plead and establish the existence of a contract a material breach of that contract and damages resulting from the breach.see,friedman life ins,so d,dca.to prove the existence of a contract,a plaintiff must plead offer acceptance consideration and sufficient specification of the essential terms.joe mciver,so d,citing townsend contracting,jensen civil,so d,dca.it is to these elements that we must address the commonality and predominance inquiries,and vega complaint fails on both points.
most importantly,vega has not shown commonality under a breach of contract theory because he has not alleged in his complaint the existence of a common contract under which employed all class members.as such,he could not utilize identical evidence on behalf of every member of the class to prove offer,acceptance,consideration,or the essential terms.instead,these mandatory elements of each class member claim depend on such individualized facts and circumstances as when a given employee was hired,what the employee was told and agreed to with respect to compensation rules and procedures at the time of hiring,the employee subjective understanding of how he would be compensated and the circumstances under which his compensation might be subject to charge backs,and when and how any pertinent part of the employee compensation agreement or understanding thereof may have changed during the course of that employee tenure at.without the existence of a common contract,of course,there can also be no commonality with respect to whether conduct relating to commission charge backs,even if undertaken pursuant to a uniform policy,constituted a breach of every class member particular employment contract,whether any such breach was material for every class member,or whether each class member suffered cognizable damages as a result.lacking commonality,the allegations in vega complaint obviously must fail the predominance test as well.
vega argues,and the district court seems to have agreed,that the common contract at issue is the compensation program.this agreement,however,as we have already noted,is not or by description or other vega complaint.instead,vega sought certification of a broad class of all employees who received,or were entitled to receive,commissions for the sale of prepaid cellular telephone plans who did not receive their commissions or were charged back by for their commissions regardless of the specific compensation contract or contracts under which any given employee worked.while the district court limited the certified class to florida employees who received advanced commissions on prepaid plans in the first instance,it defined the class in terms similarly disconnected from any specific compensation program,including all employees who received commissions for the sale of prepaid cellular telephone plans,but were charged back by for those commissions but specifically excluding current employees.therefore,the compensation program is unavailable as the source of common issues given the pleading and posture of the case.
regardless,there is no dispute that the class certified by the district court includes members who either were never subject to the compensation program or were also subject to other policies during portions of their tenures,so issues involving that plan alone are not common to the entire class.in short,the district court was demonstrably incorrect when it concluded that the adjudication of the disputes concerning this compensation program will resolve the liability issues for all members of the class.
on appeal,vega has conceded that the class should be modified,on remand,such that it not include members who were paid under compensation plans other than the sales incentive compensation program.the suggestion appears to be that the class commonality and predominance problems would vanish if the claims were limited to those relating to the compensation program.we disagree that such a modification would make a difference.
first,vega suggestion that the compensation program could serve as the relevant common contract for a class limited to employees who labored under that policy is stymied by applicable state law.it is well established florida law that policy statements contained in employment manuals do not give rise to enforceable contract rights in florida unless they contain specific language which expresses the parties explicit mutual agreement that the manual constitutes a separate employment contract.quaker oats jewell,so d,dca finding policy statements in employment manual relating to overtime pay did not constitute the terms of a contract of employment citing muller stromberg carlson,so d dca see also onesource facility,mosbach,d,holding that employer compensation plan did not create enforceable contract right in employee to bonus compensation,noting that employer retained authority and discretion to amend,terminate,or modify the plan at any time sleit ricoh,wl,at,employee manuals such as handbooks and those that include compensation unilateral policy statements and do not contractually bind employers.
could not have been clearer that it did not intend its compensation program to create enforceable contract rights or to constitute a separate,employment contract.the front cover of the compensation program document expressly stated,this document and any oral,written or electronic communication related to the subject matter contained in this document are not intended and shall not be read to create any express or implied contract or promise of specific treatment or benefits in specific situations emphasis added.furthermore,it continued,in sole discretion,this document and the guidelines stated herein may be changed or discontinued at any time without prior notice.additionally,the document cautioned,retains sole discretion to determine what transactions qualify for commission payout.in the written acknowledgment form that he signed and submitted upon receiving the compensation program document,vega expressly confirmed that he read and understood these caveats.therefore,under florida law,the compensation program can not serve as a common contract even for a class narrowed to include only employees subject to it.
furthermore,even assuming arguendo that the compensation program could be construed as a binding contract,which arguably could create common issues of fact and law,the narrowed class would still lack predominance.presented evidence in the form of affidavits from several sales employees who attested to their understanding of the incentive compensation and charge back procedures.these employees stated that,based on their training and other information provided to them by the company,they were aware that advanced commissions on prepaid sales were subject to charge back if the plans were deactivated including by virtue of ninety days of account inactivity per business rule within the charge back window.even positing a common contract,this testimony illustrates the existence of significant individualized issues with respect to breach,materiality,and damages.sorting out and proving the claims,if any,of these class members,and others with similar understandings or,at least,understandings as substantially different from the one vega purports to have had,would require substantial individualized evidence different from and in addition to that which vega would proffer to establish his own claim.see klay,at.
additionally,apparently would proffer individualized and varying evidence to defend against claims of individual class members by showing what they knew or should have known about the charge back procedures.see id.at in determining whether class or individual issues predominate in a putative class action suit,we must take into account the claims,defenses,relevant facts,and applicable substantive law,to assess the degree to which resolution of the classwide issues will further each individual class member claim against the defendant.emphasis added citation omitted.accordingly,even after the resolution of any common issues generated by the compensation program,significant questions concerning ultimate liability would remain for many class members.as such,the common questions would not predominate.
vega unjust enrichment claim also lacks commonality and predominance.in florida,t he essential elements of a claim for unjust enrichment are a benefit conferred upon a defendant by the plaintiff,the defendant appreciation of the benefit,and the defendant acceptance and retention of the benefit under circumstances that make it inequitable for him to retain it without paying the value thereof.rollins,butland,so d,dca see florida power city of winter park,so d.critical for present purposes,before it can grant relief on this equitable claim,a court must examine the particular circumstances of an individual case and assure itself that,without a remedy,inequity would result or persist.due to the necessity of this inquiry into the individualized equities attendant to each class member,courts,including ours,have found unjust enrichment claims inappropriate for class action treatment.see,klay,at rollins,so d at ortiz ford motor,so d,dca noting that the equities surrounding each class member interaction with the defendant is sic not the same.in short,common questions will rarely,if ever,predominate an unjust enrichment claim,the resolution of which turns on individualized facts.
in the end,vega unjust enrichment claim suffers from many of the same commonality and predominance problems that beset vega unpaid wages claim.klay,at.there is no evidence that the circumstances under which accepted a benefit from each of the putative class each employee awareness of applicable compensation common indeed,has presented affidavit evidence suggesting that the circumstances were not common.although vega alleges he did not know that his commissions for prepaid plans were subject to charge back,the record indicates that many of his sales colleagues were in procedures.accordingly,whether or not a given commission charge back was unjust will depend on what each employee was told and understood about the commission structure and when and how commissions were earned.those employees who concede awareness that commissions advanced on the sale of prepaid cellular plans that are later deemed deactivations including due to account inactivity during the charge back window are not earned,but are instead subject to charge back,can not claim injustice when the company follows its compensation policies as expected and understood.the uncommon and individualized nature of this critical inquiry,and its foundational importance to the liability determination for each class member,renders class certification inappropriate.
we next review the district court analysis of the rule requirement that the claims or defenses of the representative parties be typical of the claims or defenses of the class.a.a class representative must possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members in order to be typical under rule a.t ypicality measures whether a sufficient nexus exists between the claims of the named representatives and those of the class at large.busby jrhbw realty,cir quotations and internal citations omitted alteration in original.although typicality and commonality may be related,we have distinguished the two concepts by noting that,t raditionally,commonality refers to the group characteristics of the class as a whole,while typicality refers to the individual characteristics of the named plaintiff in relation to the class.piazza ebsco,cir citing ex rel.prado bush,cir.
first,we find that the district court abused its discretion procedurally by failing to conduct any typicality analysis of the class it ultimately certified.after getting off to a promising start with respect to typicality by correctly describing the requirement,noting typicality problems with the class proposed by vega,and shaving the acknowledged atypical components from the class definition,the district court abruptly stopped short and neglected to provide any findings or reasoning for why vega claims are typical of those of the remaining class members.
in its discussion of typicality,the district court first observed that the plaintiff proposed statewide class definition serves up a mixed bag when scrutinized in light of the typicality prong.the court went on to find that vega class definition overreache d a bit in that it included employees whose commissions were withheld,never paid in the first instance,when vega complaint only contained allegations regarding commissions that advanced and subsequently charged back.the complaint said nothing about commissions that had never been paid at all.accordingly,finding that vega could not claim to have suffered the same harm as individuals on behalf of whom he had averred nothing,the court excluded from the class definition employees who never received their commissions and limited the remaining class to those employees,like vega,alleging that advanced and then charged back their commissions.we have no quarrel with the district court typicality decision on this point.
but that was the end of the typicality analysis.the court did not even attempt to describe whether and how vega claims are typical of the remaining class that it actually certified of employees who received commissions for the sale of prepaid cellular telephone plans,but were charged back by for those commissions.this utter failure to interrogate vega claimed typicality with respect to the certified class was an abuse of discretion that can not stand.
in any event,had it conducted a proper typicality analysis on the remaining class,the district court would have discovered that vega claims are not typical of the class he seeks to represent.as noted,vega complaint contains no allegation of a common contract among all class members.because of this,vega claims are not typical of the class for many of the same reasons as the class fails for lack of commonality and predominance.see supra part.
vega concedes on appeal that his claims are not typical of those employees who worked under compensation plans other than the compensation program.nevertheless,as with commonality and predominance,simply narrowing the class definition to claims arising in connection with the compensation program would not solve the typicality problem.first of all,such a modification would be inconsistent with and unsupported by vega complaint.the allegations in the complaint are not limited to the compensation,they do not even mention it.the district court rejected vega proposed amended complaint,which sought to add references to the compensation program.therefore,the operative pleading in this case provides no basis for a class limited to claimants under the compensation program.
moreover,the claims vega has asserted on behalf of the class depend on the terms,conditions,and mutual understandings regarding compensation that each class member had with.without a common contract,it is impossible for vega to bring a case typical of all other class members.rather,the court would have to look to such individualized factors as each employee individual contract,when he was hired,what he was told and agreed to at the time of hiring,his subjective understanding of how he would be compensated and when charge backs might occur,and when and how any material aspect of his agreement or understanding of the agreement may have changed during his employment with.see moore am.fed of television radio artists,cir doubting existence of typicality where the district court would have to examine each class member contract.
even treating the compensation program as a common contract does not render vega claims typical.for one thing,the class includes all classes of employees who received sales commissions,regardless of job title or position.the compensation program,however,contains different attachments,ostensibly with different terms,for various specific positions within the company.vega received,and worked under,the compensation program for the retail sales channel and that was applicable to retail sales representatives like him.his claims,therefore,could not be typical of class members from other business units or channels or even class members from the retail sales channel with different job titles,all of whom were subject to divergent compensation rules and procedures and may have received different information about the compensation policies.
furthermore,affidavit evidence shows that,unlike vega,many class members were told about,and fully understood,how the charge back procedure worked and that it applied to prepaid accounts that were deemed deactivated including by way of account inactivity during the charge back window.this evidence,just as with commonality and predominance,highlights the individual variation in the claims and defenses applicable to each class member and how those claims and defenses frequently will differ from vega individual case.this is particularly true on the unjust enrichment claim,where such individualized facts concerning each employee knowledge of the compensation policies and procedures will delineate the equities in a given case.
in sum,vega claims are not typical of those of the certified class,and the district court abused its discretion by applying the law in an unreasonable or incorrect manner in finding otherwise.this shortcoming in the class is another reason why class certification was inappropriate.
the district court also in extremely cursory the class satisfied rule b.we next address this issue and conclude,once again,that the district court abused its discretion.
rule b requires findings both that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.b.the rule sets forth four specific though considerations pertinent to these findings 
a the class members interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions 
b the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members 
c the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum and 
d the likely difficulties in managing a class action.
here,the district court engaged in virtually no rule b analysis at all.in fact,the court entire discussion of rule b consisted of the following 
rule b may be satisfied in a number of ways.in present case sic,the foregoing reasons accommodate rule b because class litigation emerges as the superior method for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy.rule b.
this conclusory statement,which can not truly be called analysis,is grossly insufficient and easily rises to the level of an abuse of discretion.
first,while the district court discussion lightly touches on the superiority requirement,it contains no mention whatsoever of predominance,which is perhaps the central and overriding prerequisite for a rule b class.see jackson,at rule b,however,imposes two additional requirements,and increased efficiency is only one of them.predominance is the other.to the extent that the district court may have attempted to engage in a predominance assessment sub silencio in other portions of its order,we have already addressed why its efforts were insufficient in part,supra.this failure to address predominance,along with the substantive absence of predominance with respect to the certified class,is fatal to the class certification order in this case 
second,the district court did not engage in any meaningful superiority analysis either.all it suggested was that a class action would be the superior method on account of the foregoing reasons.the foregoing reasons,of course,were nothing more than the district court often incomplete or outright why the class met the various requirements of rule a.by relying wholly on its rule a findings,the district court engaged in no independent rule b analysis at all.the court did not address any of the four factors bearing on the efficiency of a class action listed in rule b or,for that matter,any other considerations see zinser accufix research,cir.in determining superiority,courts must consider the four factors of rule b,amended on denial of reh g,cir.allowing this class certification to stand,therefore,would require us to find that satisfaction of rule a alone is enough to justify class certification.such a holding would remove all independent meaning and significance from rule b requirements indeed,it would effectively read subsection b out of rule.this we can not do.
in this case,the fourth rule b factor the likely difficulties in managing a class action raises particular concerns.b d.due to the central indiv
