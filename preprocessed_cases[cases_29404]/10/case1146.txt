bank fees,like taxes,are ubiquitous.and,like taxes,bank fees are unlikely to go away any time soon.the question we consider here is the extent to which overdraft fees imposed by a national bank are subject to state regulation.
at issue is a bookkeeping device,known as posting,which has the potential to multiply overdraft fees,turning a single overdraft into many such overdrafts.the revenue from overdraft fees is massive.between and,wells fargo bank wells fargo assessed over billion in overdraft fees.disturbed by the number of overdrafts caused by small,everyday purchases,veronica gutierrez and erin walker collectively gutierrez sued wells fargo under california state law for engaging in unfair business practices by imposing overdraft fees based on the posting order and for engaging in fraudulent business practices by misleading clients as to the actual posting order used by the bank.
the district court found that the bank dominant,indeed sole,motive for choosing posting was to maximize the number of overdrafts and squeeze as much as possible out of what it called its odri customers item.the district court also found that wells fargo had affirmatively reinforced the expectation that transactions were covered in the sequence the purchases were made while obfuscating its contrary practice of posting transactions in order to maximize the number of overdrafts assessed on customers.the court issued a permanent injunction against posting and ordered million in restitution.on appeal,wells fargo seeks refuge from state law on the ground of federal preemption.it also challenges the district court factual and legal findings.we conclude that federal law preempts state regulation of the posting order as well as any obligation to make specific,affirmative disclosures to bank customers.federal law does not,however,preempt california consumer law with respect to fraudulent or misleading representations concerning posting.as a consequence,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
posting is the procedure banks use to process debit items presented for payment against accounts.during the wee hours after midnight,the posting process takes all debit items presented for payment during the preceding business day and subtracts them from the account balance.these items are typically transactions and checks.if the account balance is sufficient to cover all items presented for payment,there will be no overdrafts,regardless of the bookkeeping method used.if,however,the account balance is insufficient to cover every debit item,then the account will be overdrawn.when an account is overdrawn,the posting sequence can have a dramatic effect on the number of overdrafts incurred by the account even though the total sum overdrawn will be exactly the same.the number of overdrafts drives the amount of overdraft fees.
before april,wells fargo used a posting order.under this system,the bank posted settlement items from dollar amount.posting paid as many items as the account balance could cover and thus minimized the number of overdrafts.beginning in april of,wells fargo did an in california and began posting purchases in order of dollar amount.this system had the immediate effect of maximizing the number of overdrafts.the customer account was now depleted more rapidly than would be the case if the bank posted transactions in order or,in some cases,chronological order.
as an illustration,consider a customer with in his account who uses his to buy ten small items totaling,followed by one large item for,all of which are presented to the bank for payment on the same day.under chronological posting or posting,only one overdraft would occur because the ten small items totaling would post first,leaving in the account.the charge would then post,causing the sole overdraft.using sequencing,however,these purchases would lead to ten overdraft events because the largest item,would be posted first depleting the entire account balance followed by the ten transactions totaling.overdraft fees are based on the number of withdrawals that exceed the balance in the account,not on the amount of the overdraft.when sequencing is used,the fees charged by the bank for the overdrafts can dramatically exceed the amount by which the account was actually overdrawn.for example,gutierrez incurred in overdraft fees as a consequence of a overdraft,and erin walker incurred in overdraft fees for exceeding her account balance by.
gutierrez claims that wells fargo made the switch to processing in order to increase the amount of overdraft fees by maximizing the number of overdrafts.the bank amplified the effect of its fee maximization plan,which it named balance sheet engineering,through several related practices that are not at issue here.
california unfair competition law allows individual plaintiffs to bring claims for unfair,unlawful,or fraudulent business practices.cal.bus.although remedies under the unfair competition law are limited to injunctive relief and restitution,the law scope is sweeping.cel tech commc ns,los angeles cellular,cal th.gutierrez sued on behalf of a class,alleging independent violations of both the law unfair and fraudulent prongs.gutierrez alleged that wells fargo resequencing practices are unfair because they contradict the legislative policy expressed in california commercial code b amendment cmt,which provides that items may be accepted,paid,certified,or charged to the indicated account of its customer in any order so long as the bank act s in good faith and not for the sole purpose of increasing the amount of returned check fees charged to the customer.id.
the district court certified a class of all wells fargo customers from november,to june,who incurred overdraft fees on transactions as a result of the bank practice of sequencing transactions from highest to lowest.after a bench trial,the district court issued a comprehensive page decision and found that wells fargo decision to post transactions in order was made for the sole purpose of maximizing the number of overdrafts assessed on its customers.the court also concluded that wells fargo led customers to expect that the actual posting order of their purchases would mirror the order in which they were transacted while hiding its actual practice of posting transactions in order so that the bank could maximiz e the number of overdrafts assessed on customers.
the district court rejected wells fargo numerous defenses federal preemption pursuant to various statutes and regulations,gutierrez lack of standing,and the impropriety of class certification and held wells fargo actions to be both unfair and fraudulent under the unfair competition law.as a remedy,the court entered a permanent injunction requiring wells fargo to cease its practice of posting in order for all transactions and either reinstate a posting method or use a chronological posting method or some combination of the two methods for transactions.it also imposed various related disclosure requirements.in addition to injunctive relief,the district court ordered wells fargo to pay million in restitution.both parties appealed.wells fargo appeal focuses on its preemption argument and on the merits of gutierrez unfair competition law claims.gutierrez is directed to the district court denial of prejudgment interest and punitive damages.
arbitration 
as a threshold matter,we consider whether this dispute should be arbitrated.although the contract between the parties contained a permissive arbitration clause,neither party requested arbitration,and consequently the district court did not consider the issue.on appeal,wells fargo seeks to compel arbitration and claims that its enforceable right to arbitration did not mature until the supreme court decision in at t mobility llc concepcion.wells fargo asks us to vacate the judgment and remand so that the district court can dismiss the case or stay it pending arbitration.gutierrez argues that wells fargo has waived any claim to arbitration.
after considering the terms of the arbitration agreement,the conduct of the parties,and the course of the litigation,along with the traditional benchmarks regarding waiver of arbitration and the purpose of the federal arbitration act faa,we conclude that the district court judgment should not be vacated on the basis of concepcion.to do so at this stage would undermine the parties agreement regarding arbitration,severely prejudice gutierrez and the certified class members,and result in a waste of judicial resources.this is an unusual,perhaps sui generis,case in which the specific circumstances counsel this result.
in concepcion,the supreme court held that the faa preempted california discover bank rule,id.at,which rendered arbitration waivers unenforceable if it was alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money,discover bank superior court,cal th.
the central purpose of the faa is to ensure that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their terms.stolt nielsen animalfeeds int l,quoting volt info,bd.of trs.of leland stanford junior.section of the faa provides that an agreement to arbitrate shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.although the faa savings clause permits agreements to arbitrate to be invalidated by generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,it does not allow defenses that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.concepcion.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.in concepcion,the court struck down the discover bank rule because it was applied in a manner that disfavored arbitration and interfered with the enforcement of private arbitration agreements,thus standing as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.id.at quotation marks and citation omitted.
the effect of concepcion,as intervening supreme court law,on a judgment on appeal after trial,is an issue of first impression.the mine run of cases claiming waiver of arbitration stem from situations where,before trial,a party belatedly asserts a clear right to arbitration.see,cox ocean view hotel,cir declining to find that defendant initial refusal to arbitrate employee complaints constituted waiver of right to arbitrate subsequent legal action.but we have not found,nor have the parties cited,any cases involving waiver of a permissive arbitration right where the applicability of the right was not,arbitration was never demanded,and the claim was first asserted on appeal following trial.
our analysis begins with the customer account agreement caa between wells fargo and the class members,which provides 
either of us may submit a dispute to binding arbitration at any reasonable time notwithstanding that a lawsuit or other proceeding has been commenced.if either of us fails to submit to binding arbitration following a lawful demand,the one who fails to submit bears all costs and expenses incurred by the other compelling arbitration.
the caa further states that e ach of us agrees that any arbitration we have shall not be consolidated with any other arbitration and shall not be arbitrated on behalf of others without the consent of each of us.
this arbitration clause stands in contrast to the mandatory arbitration provision found in many consumer contracts,such as the provision in concepcion.to begin,it is a permissive clause in which either party may demand arbitration.the penalty for failing to consent to arbitration upon demand is bearing the costs involved in compelling arbitration.four points stand out an arbitration demand is required the agreement contemplates that the parties may decide to remain within the judicial system to settle their disputes the agreement permits class arbitration on consent and any demand for arbitration must be made within a reasonable time.
the procedural posture of this case is reflective of the parties intentions and expectations.notably,wells fargo never made a demand for arbitration,raised it as a defense,or even mentioned it until after the concepcion decision,at which point the trial was over and the district court had issued its judgment.although the faa allows for interlocutory appeals of orders denying motions to compel arbitration,see a b,unlike the defendant in concepcion,wells fargo undertook no such tack.see.at see also franceschi hosp.san carlos,cir arbitration right is forfeited where no interlocutory appeal was filed because it would prejudice plaintiffs to have a full trial and then determine by a appeal that the whole matter should have been arbitrated and so should start again internal quotation marks omitted.
the timing of the arbitration demand is informative.the certiorari petition in concepcion was filed on january,three months before the bench trial began in april.petition for writ of certiorari,concepcion.on may,the supreme court accepted review.at t mobility llc concepcion.at that stage,final argument in the district court was more than a month away,no decision had been issued,and the parties were exchanging proposed findings.the arbitration issue was,however,squarely before the supreme court.the district court decision was not issued until august.even in that interim period,wells fargo was silent as to arbitration and did not seek a stay pending the supreme court decision in concepcion.instead,wells fargo proceeded full steam ahead with this litigation in federal court.only in april,after an unfavorable result in the district court and the supreme court opinion did wells fargo seek to vacate the district court judgment via a motion to compel arbitration filed with this court.the appellate commissioner denied the motion without prejudice to renewing the arguments in the brief on.see order,july.
gutierrez argues that wells fargo was driven by its preference to litigate this case in federal court in order to obtain favorable rulings from the district court on federal preemption and other issues.the record is devoid of wells fargo motives for its chosen course of action,although wells fargo offered only argument,not evidence or declarations,as to the rationale for its litigation strategy.we make no judgment about wells fargo motives.
against this background,we consider gutierrez argument that wells fargo waived any rights to arbitration given the belated nature of its request.for such a waiver to occur,there must be knowledge of an existing right to compel arbitration acts inconsistent with that existing right and prejudice to the party opposing arbitration resulting from such inconsistent acts.fisher becker paribas,cir.
wells fargo claims that any existing right arose only after concepcion and thus it did not act inconsistently with that existing right because it would have been futile to seek arbitration earlier.see fisher,at.the futility of an arbitration demand,however,is not clear cut here.in contemporaneous consumer litigation,litigants did succeed in compelling arbitration despite the existence of the discover bank rule.see,dalie pulte home,d,recognizing that under california law a class action waiver is only unenforceable in a narrow set of circumstances mccabe dell,no.cv,wl,at,compelling arbitration after finding the arbitration clause enforceable under california law galbraith resurgent capital,no.cv,wl,at,same.especially because the caa did not prohibit class arbitration,a motion to compel arbitration was not inevitably futile under the prescribed analysis.see douglas dist.court for cent.dist.of,cir whether arbitration can be compelled depends on the facts and circumstances developed during the course of litigation.
given the differing circumstances in our case and fisher with respect to the first two prongs of fisher,we focus on prejudice.we reject wells fargo attempt to collapse all three fisher prongs into one.adopting this course would ignore the procedural posture of the case and also the court approach in fisher,which laid out the waiver analysis.although fisher held that the defendant there had not acted inconsistently with an existing right,it went on to discuss the prejudice that the fishers would suffer if the court were to order arbitration.see at.we do the same.
ordering arbitration would severely prejudice gutierrez.the caa requires the demand to be made at a reasonable time.the series of dispositive motions,voluminous discovery,preparation for trial,bench trial,briefing,and appellate proceedings amply demonstrate the resources both the parties and the courts have already expended,all of which would be undone if arbitration is now required.the prejudice to gutierrez and the class stemming from wells fargo invocation of arbitration five years into this litigation time,expense,delay and uncertainty is apparent.see found.for cancer research edwards sons,to give defendant a second bite at the very questions presented to the court for disposition squarely confronts the policy that arbitration may not be used as a strategy to manipulate the legal process.
independent of the fisher analysis,arbitration at this juncture would frustrate the purposes of the faa.the overarching purpose of the faa,evident in the text of,and,is to ensure the enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms so as to facilitate streamlined proceedings.concepcion.at.far from facilitating streamlined proceedings,sending this case to arbitration would be wholly duplicative and lead to further delay and expense for both parties.
nor would arbitration at this late stage serve any contractual purpose.the caa calls for all claims to be resolved through either litigation or arbitration,if timely demanded by one of the parties.because the caa does not require arbitration,gutierrez prejudice is in no way.ordering arbitration would undercut her contractual expectations,be inconsistent with the parties agreement,and contradict their conduct throughout the litigation.see concepcion.at arbitration is a matter of contract,and the faa requires courts to honor parties expectations.because we reject wells fargo belated effort to invoke arbitration,we proceed to the parties remaining arguments.
ii.federal preemption 
we next consider whether the national bank act of,stat.codified at et,preempts application of california unfair competition law.consistent with the principles of federalism,the united states has a dual banking system.see,atherton.during the first century of the nation existence,banks were the norm and federally chartered banks an exception.id.at.after the civil war,congress passed the national bank act to ensure that national and state banks could coexist on a basis of competitive equality.first bank of logan,utah walker bank trust.the act vests nationally chartered banks with enumerated powers,such as the power to make contracts,to receive deposits,and to make loans,together with all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking.third,seventh.in addition to the national bank act,the activities of national banks are governed by related regulations promulgated by the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ.see,a.
in analyzing preemption,we ask whether the state law prevent s or significantly interfere s with the national bank exercise of its powers.barnett bank of marion,nelson.although states can not exercise visitorial oversight over national banks,state laws of general application continue to apply to national banks when doing so does not prevent or significantly interfere with the national bank exercise of its powers.id.at see also watters wachovia bank,federally chartered banks are subject to state laws of general application in their daily business to the extent such laws do not conflict with the letter or purposes of the nba.as the supreme court explained in cuomo clearinghouse ass n,llc,this balance of authority preserves a regime of exclusive administrative oversight by the comptroller while honoring in fact rather than merely in theory congress decision not to substantive state law.this system echoes many other mixed regimes in which the federal government exercises general oversight while leaving state substantive law in place.indeed,s tates have always enforced their general laws against national banks.id.at.
against the framework of extensive federal statutory and regulatory oversight of national banks,the question is whether wells fargo implementation of posting is subject to california unfair competition law,a consumer protection statute of general applicability.cal.bus.we do not tackle the unfair competition law generally federal banking regulation.rather,reviewing de novo,we analyze each unfair competition law claim separately,martinez wells fargo home,cir,though as a practical matter,the remedy ordered by the district court boils down to a complete prohibition on the method.
unfair business practices and high to low posting 
the district court deemed wells fargo posting method an unfair practice in violation of the unfair competition law because it was imposed in bad faith,in contravention of the policy reflected in california commercial code b in terms of remedy,the district court permanently enjoined wells fargo use of posting.the court ordered wells fargo to either reinstate a posting method or use a chronological posting method or some combination of the two methods.with respect to disclosures,the court required all agreements,disclosures,websites,online banking statements,and promotional materials to conform to the new posting system.finally,the court ordered million in restitution because it found that wells fargo acted in bad faith when it decided to post transactions in order.the appeal of this claim turns on whether state law can dictate wells fargo choice of posting method.we hold that it can not.
under the national bank act,key powers of national banks include the authority to receive deposits,as well as all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking.seventh.the deposit and withdrawal of funds are services provided by banks since the days of their creation.indeed,such activities define the business of banking.bank of am.city and cnty.of san francisco,cir.both the business of banking and the power to receiv e deposits necessarily include the power to post transactions,tally deposits and determine the balance in the customer account.see seventh.
the ability to choose a method of posting transactions is not only a useful,but also a necessary,component of a posting process that is integrally related to the receipt of deposits.designation of a posting method falls within the type of overarching federal banking regulatory power that is not normally limited by,but rather ordinarily s,contrary state law.watters,at quotation marks omitted.
in addition to the broad power vested by statute,federal banking regulations adopted by the occ specifically delegate to banks the method of calculating fees.b.as the agency charged with administering the national bank act,the occ has primary responsibility for the surveillance of the business of banking authorized by the national bank act.nationsbank of c,variable annuity life ins.the occ is authorized to define the incidental powers of national banks beyond those specifically enumerated.see.authorizing the occ to prescribe rules and regulations to carry out the responsibilities of the office.
the occ has interpreted these incidental powers to include the power to set account terms and the power to charge customers charges and fees,such as the overdraft fees at issue here.a more specifically,the occ has determined that t he establishment of charges and fees,their amounts,and the method of calculating them are business decisions to be made by each bank,in its discretion,according to sound banking judgment and safe and sound banking principles.b emphasis added.
occ letters interpreting specifically consider posting and associated overdraft fees to be a pricing decision authorized by federal law within the power of a national bank.occ interpretive letter,wl,at may,see also occ interpretive letter,wl,at,occ interpretive letter,wl,at may.the occ has opined that a bank authorization to establish fees pursuant to a necessarily includes the authorization to decide how they are computed.occ interpretive letter,wl,at may.accordingly,the occ has determined that a national bank may establish a given order of posting as a pricing decision pursuant to section seventh and section.id.in sum,federal law authorizes national banks to establish a posting order as part and parcel of setting fees,which is a pricing decision.
the district court held that the bank determination of posting order did not constitute a pricing decision because wells fargo did not follow the four factor decision making process for safe and sound banking principles mandated by the occ.b the national bank act gives to the occ the exclusive authority to exercise visitorial oversight over national banks,and it entrusts the occ with the supervision of national banks activities that are authorized by federal law.a see also cuomo,at.whether wells fargo internal processes regarding posting orders complied with the safe and sound banking principles under b is an inquiry that falls squarely within the occ supervisory powers.the district court findings with regard to wells fargo compliance with the occ regulation,then,are both inapposite to the issue of preemption and fruitless.martinez,at citing watters,at.in martinez,we addressed whether wells fargo had followed safe and sound banking principles in making a pricing decision and emphasized that the determination of the bank compliance with these principles is within the exclusive purview of the occ.id.
wells fargo decision to resequence the posting order falls within the occ definition of a pricing decision authorized by federal law.the district court is not free to disregard the occ determinations of what constitutes a legitimate pricing decision,nor can it apply state law in a way that interferes with this enumerated and incidental power of national banks.
the restriction that the district court imposed on posting is akin to the fee restriction addressed in the eleventh circuit recent preemption ruling.see baptista jpmorgan chase bank,cir.the court in baptista held that a state statute that disallowed banks from charging for cashing a check was preempted because it significantly reduced the banks latitude in deciding how to charge fees.id.at.the same logic applies here.
we hold that a good faith limitation applied through california unfair competition law is preempted when applied in a manner that prevents or significantly interferes with a national bank federally authorized power to choose a posting order.see barnett,at state statute could not bar small town national banks from selling insurance where federal statute gave the banks such authority bank of,at federal regulations allowing banks to collect charges preempted a local law governing what atm fees a bank could charge.the federal court can not mandate the order in which wells fargo posts its transactions.therefore,we vacate the permanent injunction and the million restitution award.the district court premised both of these remedies on only a violation of the unfair business practice prong of the unfair competition law tethered to the good faith requirement of california commercial code b.
fraudulent business practices and wells fargo representations 
the district court found not only a violation of the unfair prong of the unfair competition law with regard to the posting order,but also a violation of the fraudulent prong of the unfair competition law with regard to wells fargo representations about posting.the unfair competition law authorizes injunctive relief and restitution as remedies against a person or entity engaging in unfair competition,including fraudulent business practices.cal.bus.see also cel tech commc ns,cal th at each of the three unfair competition law prongs constitutes a separate and independent cause of action.the district court faulted wells fargo both for its failure to disclose the effects of posting and for its misleading statements.the district court concluded that wells fargo did not tell customers that frequent use of a for purchases could result in an avalanche of overdraft fees for each of those purchases due to the posting order.instead,wells fargo directed misleading propaganda at the class that likely led class members to expect that the actual posting order of their purchases would mirror the order in which they were transacted.
we have determined that the district court injunction ordering a particular kind of posting and ordering million in restitution under the unfair prong of california unfair competition law is preempted.the question arises whether we need to address preemption under the fraudulent prong as well.we conclude that we do because,on remand,the district court may determine that appropriate relief is available to the extent a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation is not preempted.
the requirement to make particular disclosures falls squarely within the purview of federal banking regulation and is expressly preempted a national bank may exercise its powers without regard to state law limitations concerning,among other things,disclosure requirements.b.in martinez,plaintiffs claim that the bank engaged in fraudulent practices by failing to disclose actual costs of its underwriting and tax services was expressly preempted by the occ regulation preempting state disclosure requirements in real estate transactions.martinez,at,see also c.a.similarly,the unfair competition law can not impose liability simply based on the bank failure to disclose its chosen posting method.see rose chase bank usa,cir the national bank act preempts affirmative disclosure requirements of a california statute,insofar as those requirements apply to national banks parks mbna am.bank,cal th,state law directed at credit card issuers,which prescribed specific disclosures on convenience checks,was preempted.imposing liability for the bank failure to sufficiently disclose its posting method leads to the same result as mandating specific disclosures.both remedies are tantamount to state regulation of disclosure requirements.
we turn now to the different question of state law liability based on wells fargo misleading statements about its posting method.notably,the unfair competition law itself does not impose disclosure requirements but merely prohibits statements that are likely to mislead the public.as a state law of general applicability that does not conflict with federal law,frustrate the purposes of the national bank act,or impair the efficiency of national banks to discharge their duties,the unfair competition law prohibition on misleading statements under the fraudulent prong of the statute is not preempted by the national bank act.bank of,at.
wells fargo position that b dictates preemption is conclusively undercut by the occ itself,which,far from concluding that the unfair competition law is expressly preempted under its regulations,has specifically cited california unfair competition law in an advisory letter cautioning banks that they may be subject to such laws that prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices.martinez,at.the advisory letter warns that the consequences of engaging in practices that may be unfair or deceptive under federal or state law can include litigation,enforcement actions,monetary judgments,and harm to the institution reputation.occ advisory letter,guidance on unfair or deceptive acts or practices,wl,at.the occ recognizes that state laws that withstand preemption typically do not regulate the manner or content of the business of banking authorized for national banks,but rather establish the legal infrastructure that makes practicable the conduct of that business.bank activities and operations.by prohibiting fraudulent business practices,the unfair competition law does exactly that it establishes a legal infrastructure.
although wells fargo insists that a state law prohibiting misleading statements necessarily touches on checking accounts,such an expansive interpretation with no limiting principle would swallow all laws.aguayo bank,cir.we recently declined a bank invitation to interpret the term lending operations expansively because every action by the bank,due to the nature of its business,affects its ability to attract,mana
