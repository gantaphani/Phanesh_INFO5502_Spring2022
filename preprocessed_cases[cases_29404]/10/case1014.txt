securities litigation uniform standards act jurisdiction 
the panel affirmed the district court dismissal of a class action suit,brought on behalf of a class of preferred stock shareholders,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and held,inter alia,that the securities litigation uniform standards act did not provide an independent basis for federal question jurisdiction under.
the sole claim in plaintiff complaint was a claim arising under nevada law.
the panel held that the district court properly concluded that it lacked federal question jurisdiction under because the plaintiff did not assert a federal claim and the securities litigation uniform standards act,d a,did not provide an independent basis for federal question jurisdiction over plaintiff claim.
the panel also held that the district court properly concluded that it lacked diversity jurisdiction over the class action suit under d because of the exception in d c,which provides that d shall not apply to any class action that solely involves a claim relating to a security.
finally,the panel held that the district court properly held that it lacked diversity jurisdiction over plaintiff individual claim under a,and therefore could not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the class members claims.specifically,the panel held that plaintiff original complaint did not even plead individual diversity jurisdiction,nor did it contain allegations that would be sufficient to create such jurisdiction.the panel further held that granting leave to amend would have been futile because plaintiff proposed amended complaint also failed to allege a sufficient amount in controversy.

in light of the decisions in shaw and leeward,rainero sought partial summary judgment as to the method for calculating the redemption price.the district court granted rainero motion on november.on january,archon filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the class members claims did not reach the million amount in controversy required by d.archon argued in its motion to dismiss that the class held only shares of preferred stock,and therefore the amount in controversy is only.without ruling on archon motion,the district court entered a minute order on september,requiring rainero to show cause why the action should not be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to d,which excludes certain class actions from d grant of subject matter jurisdiction.both parties submitted briefs addressing the issue of subject matter jurisdiction.in addition,rainero filed a motion for leave to amend his original complaint and submitted a proposed first amended complaint.whereas rainero original complaint relies solely on class action diversity jurisdiction under d,his proposed first amended complaint also asserts federal question jurisdiction under and,individual diversity jurisdiction under a,and supplemental jurisdiction over the class members claims under.the district court subsequently dismissed the case,without prejudice,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.rainero timely appealed.we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.young united states,cir.
the district court properly held that it lacked federal question subject matter jurisdiction.under,t he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.the presence or absence of federal question jurisdiction is governed by the complaint rule,which provides that federal jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented on the face of the plaintiff properly pleaded complaint.california ex rel.sacramento metro.air quality mgmt.dist.united states,cir.citation omitted.the sole claim in rainero complaint was a claim arising under nevada law.because rainero did not assert a federal claim,the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under.
rainero argues that the securities litigation uniform standards act slusa,pub,stat.codified in relevant part at,provides a basis for the district court federal question jurisdiction under because d a is a federal statute that allows certain class actions,including this one,to be maintained in either state or federal court.specifically,he asserts that this case is a covered class action under that is based upon the statutory or common law of the state in which the issuer is incorporated,d a,and therefore the federal district court has jurisdiction over this case.contrary to rainero arguments,slusa does not create an independent basis for federal question jurisdiction.although we have not had the occasion to review this issue,the circuit addressed it in campbell american international group,cir,and held that slusa does not confer federal jurisdiction over claims.we agree with and adopt campbell analysis of this issue.
