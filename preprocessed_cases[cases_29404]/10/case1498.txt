this is a military pay class action case brought on behalf of officers of the united states air force terminated pursuant to a reduction in force rif.the basis of their complaint is that the formal instructions governing selection for involuntary termination required different treatment of officers based on their race or gender,thereby violating the equal protection guarantee of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution.
at issue is a portion of the air force secretary memorandum of instruction moi or instruction to the board charged with selecting officers for involuntary termination.the challenged instruction mandated that a certain process be followed in the board evaluation of minority and women officers 
your evaluation of minority and women officers must clearly afford them fair and equitable consideration.equal opportunity for all officers is an essential element of our selection system.in your evaluation of the records of minority and women officers,you should be particularly sensitive to the possibility that past individual and societal attitudes,and in some instances utilization of policies or practices,may have placed these officers at a disadvantage from a total career perspective.the board shall prepare for review by the secretary and the chief of staff,a report of minority and female officer selections as compared to the selection rates for all officers considered by the board.

the united states court of federal claims granted summary judgment in favor of the government,concluding that the moi did not include a racial or classification bestowing a benefit or burden that would require heightened scrutiny by the court.therefore,applying a rational basis rather than a strict scrutiny analysis,the court concluded that the appellants had not been denied equal protection under the law.
we disagree.in adarand constructors,pena,d,the supreme court held that any person,of whatever race,has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny.id.at.because we conclude that the moi requires differential treatment of officers based on their race or gender,it must be evaluated under a strict scrutiny analysis.in order to determine whether there has been an equal protection violation under the strict scrutiny standard,further inquiry is required to ascertain whether the racial classification serves a compelling government interest and whether it is narrowly tailored to the achievement of that goal id.at.we therefore reverse the judgment of the court of federal claims and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
in july,in response to congressionally mandated reductions in the armed forces,the secretary of the air force established a rif board to select officers in the air force for involuntary separation in fiscal year see berkley.at.the secretary provided the board with written instructions regarding the procedures it was required to follow in evaluating officer files to determine which of those officers would be involuntarily terminated.the section of the instruction that set forth the criteria to be applied in evaluating minority and women officers read 
in your evaluation of the records of minority and women officers,you should be particularly sensitive to the possibility that past individual and societal attitudes,and in some instances utilization of policies or practices,may have placed these officers at a disadvantage from a total career perspective.
id.at.further,immediately following this special process to be applied in evaluating minority and women officers,the instruction ordered the board to prepare for review by the secretary of the air force and the chief of staff,a report of minority and female officer selections as compared to the selection rates for all officers considered by the board.id.
the appellants are members of a certified class.see berkley united states.class members were considered and selected for involuntary separation from the united states air force by the rif board pursuant to the instruction cited above.berkley.at.as a result,they filed suit against the government alleging that the rif board process was conducted in violation of their equal protection rights under the constitution.specifically,appellants alleged that the secretary imposition of mandatory written instructions expressly establishing specific criteria applicable only to the evaluation of the records of minority and female officers constituted a racial or classification.see id.at.the government defended by arguing that the instruction was neutral on its face and did not constitute racial or classifications.id.both parties filed for summary judgment.id.at.
the court of federal claims found that the plain meaning of the secretary instruction was to guarantee equal treatment and opportunity to all those subject to review by the rif board,including white male,minority and women officers.id.at.the moi,the court concluded,did not include a racial or classification bestowing a benefit or burden that would require the imposition of heightened scrutiny of governmental action by the court.see id.at.thus,applying a rational basis test rather than a strict scrutiny analysis,the court held that the appellants equal protection rights had not been violated and granted the government motion for summary judgment.
berkley filed this timely appeal challenging the court of federal claims grant of the government motion for summary judgment.we have jurisdiction over this appeal under a.
discussion 
this court reviews the court of federal claims grant of summary judgment de novo.cook united states.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.therefore,after drawing all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,this court will affirm the court of federal claims grant of summary judgment if no reasonable factfinder could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.ez dock,schafer,quoting anderson liberty lobby,d.
the appellants claim a violation of the equal protection guarantee of the fifth amendment to the constitution.at the heart of the constitution guarantee of equal protection lies the simple command that the government must treat citizens as individuals,not as simply components of a racial,religious,sexual or national class.metro broad,d,dissenting see also adarand,at.w henever the government treats any person unequally because of his or her race,that person has suffered an injury that falls squarely within the language and spirit of the constitution guarantee of equal protection.richmond croson,d classifications based on race carry a danger of stigmatic harm.the supreme court has unambiguously expressed its adherence to the basic principle that a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality,should tolerate no retreat from the principle that government may treat people differently because of their race only for the most compelling reasons.adarand,at.quoting hirabayashi united states.
it is also well established that t o state a claim for an equal protection violation,appellants must allege that a government actor intentionally discriminated against them on the basis of race,national origin or gender.hayden nassau,cir.intentional discrimination,however,can be demonstrated in any one of three different ways.the first involves a facially neutral statute that violates equal protection if it was motivated by discriminatory animus and its application results in discriminatory effect.id.citing arlington heights metro.hous.dev,d.the second involves a facially neutral law that violates equal protection if it is applied in a discriminatory fashion.id.citing yick wo hopkins.finally,a law or policy is discriminatory on its face if it expressly classifies persons on the basis of race or gender.id.citing adarand,at.
this case involves the third category of intentional discrimination,presenting the issue of whether the rif process,and namely the moi used by the board,expressly classified persons on the basis of race and gender,treat ed any person unequally because of his or her race,adarand,at,or placed persons on an unequal footing because of their race.northeastern.chapter of the associated contractors of am.jacksonville,d.if we conclude that it did,a strict scrutiny analysis is required under which the government,in order to prevail,must demonstrate both a compelling governmental interest for that classification and that the instruction was narrowly tailored to meet that interest.see adarand,at.
the appellee argues that the moi is a facially neutral order that does not direct the use of racial or classifications and thus does not require heightened judicial scrutiny by this court.see berkley.at.the appellants,in contrast,contend that the moi,on its face,clearly established a racial and classification.id.at.
the court of federal claims concluded that the instruction did not classify persons based on race and gender,and that strict scrutiny was thus not applicable.it held,rather,that t he memorandum does not require board members to artificially raise or lower an officer score based on race or gender,and therefore did not pressure the rif board into making race or retention decisions.id.at.further,the court found that the moi neither gave minority or women officers an artificial benefit,nor burdened white male officers.id.at.the mention of possible past lack of opportunity does not rise to the level of an improper classification,the court held,until it is combined with a direction to impose a benefit or burden based on that discrimination.id.
in our view,the court of federal claims reading and characterization of the moi misses the mark.the instruction at issue did not simply refer in passing to the possibility of past discrimination against minorities and women.rather,it provided explicit orders that when the board members reviewed the records of minority and women officers,it should be particularly sensitive to the possibility that past individual and societal attitudes,and in some instances utilization of policies or practices,may have placed these officers at a disadvantage from a total career perspective.id.at.we conclude that the instruction did require different treatment of officers under review based on their race and gender,it and without white male officers be treated differently from minority and female officers 
the trial court was evidently persuaded of the secretary commitment to equality for all officers in other portions of the moi,including its dictate that y our evaluation of minority and women officers must clearly afford them fair and equitable consideration.id.appellants,on the other hand,find this provision objectionable in that this mandate for fair and equitable consideration referred only to evaluations of minority and women rather than all officers.in our view,the different standards and procedures required for the evaluation of minority and women,but not white male officers,do not avoid the application of strict scrutiny by the fact that they are preceded by a phrase calling for fair and equitable consideration,where what is meant by such consideration is defined by the different required standards.moreover,the court of federal claims discounted the significant fact that the instruction dictate of special consideration for minorities and women was immediately followed by the requirement that the board prepare a report for review by its superiors.the report,the board was told,was to consist of a comparison of the selection rates of minority and women officers to the rates of all officers.see id.the court of federal claims described this requirement simply as a report regarding all officers considered by the board,and concluded that the report had no effect on the selection process because it required only the gathering of information.berkley.at.
such observations and conclusions with regard to the report,however,ignore its plain language and its context.first,the report requirement immediately followed the order outlining what special consideration was to be given minority and female candidates.second,the report was to be prepared for review by organizational superiors.third,the instruction did not simply ask for a report of general numbers of persons selected for termination.rather,it required a comparison between the selection rates of minority and female officers and those of all officers.thus,the appropriate and unavoidable reading of the reporting requirement is that it advised board members,as they conducted their reviews pursuant to the instruction,that their selections regarding minorities and women would be monitored for specific results.those results involved a comparison between the selection rates for women and minorities on the one hand,and all officers on the other.in sum,the reporting requirement confirms and reinforces that the board charge to give minority and female officers a different type of review from that given white male officers was a serious and specific order,the application of which would be reviewed for compliance.
in order to establish the existence of a suspect racial classification,appellants are not required to demonstrate that the moi,as interpreted or applied,was the actual but for cause of their selection for involuntary termination.as the supreme court noted in northeastern florida contractors 
when the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult for members of one group to obtain a benefit than it is for members of another group,a member of the former group seeking to challenge the barrier need not allege that he would have obtained the benefit but for the barrier in order to establish standing.the injury in fact in an equal protection case of this variety is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of a barrier,not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit.
at.the government,in fact,during oral argument,conceded that if the instruction established a racial classification on its face,no further evidence or inquiry would be required as to how it may have been interpreted or applied in order to trigger strict scrutiny analysis.as it stated,how the moi was interpreted within the military did not matter because 
if you go to strict scrutiny,which is what appellants are asking for,you do ask how it was applied.you have to assume it was applied in a discriminatory fashion at that point.and then you ask whether the government can satisfy strict scrutiny by showing that its interest in discriminating was compelling and that process was narrowly tailored.
the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit confirmed this view in lutheran synod fcc,reh g denied,reh g en banc denied,edwards,dissenting,by its rejection of the notion that record evidence regarding how a racial classification was actually interpreted or applied was a prerequisite to strict scrutiny analysis in lutheran,the court specifically rejected what it termed the 
logical flaw in the federal communications commission argument,adopted in judge tatel dissent to the denial of the suggestions of rehearing en banc,concern ing the claim that the record includes no evidence that the church has ever employed a racial preference in its hiring decisions.judge tatel argues that absent such evidence strict scrutiny is inappropriate.yet the commission and presumably judge tatel concedes that if the regulation explicitly imposed quotas or goals strict scrutiny should apply.
id.at as the court in lutheran church noted,however,one would not know at the time the quota or goal was imposed whether it would necessarily cause a preferential hiring decision.id.
it could be contended that a goal or even a quota merely reflected a nondiscriminatory hiring pattern and therefore that an employer who met the goal or quota never actually discriminated.therefore,if evidence of actual discrimination would not be required before applying strict scrutiny in the explicit cases,there is no logical reason why it should be required here.in truth,such an evidentiary obligation would turn equal protection analysis inside out.once a governmental program is shown to call for racial classifications,the heavy burden to justify it shifts to the government.
moreover,the court in lutheran church pointed to the fact that such an evidentiary obligation is flatly inconsistent with the supreme court standing analysis in affirmative action caselaw.id.at.as the district of columbia circuit aptly observed,given that it is clearly sufficient for standing purposes to show that a regulation caused a litigant to be treated differently from minorities,we can not understand how a litigant would be required,in order to trigger strict scrutiny,to make a showing that one made use of a racial preference in a particular hiring decision.id.what,if any,specific concrete injury the victim may have suffered,of course,would be the subject of further analysis and would be relevant in the damages phase of such a proceeding.
on the question of whether the moi in this case established a racial classification,it is clearly not necessary that an explicit numeric quota or goal has been dictated.nor,in order to qualify as a racial classification,must a challenged regulation or instruction require or oblige someone to exercise a racial preference.as the district of columbia circuit stated in lutheran church 
t he degree to which the regulations require,oblige,pressure,induce,or even encourage the hiring of particular races is not the logical determinant of whether the regulation calls for a racial classification.in adarand,the challenged regulations did not require or oblige to grant a preference to minority subcontractors.rather,the regulations provided a financial incentive to bidding contractors to grant such a incentive that contractors were free at their economic peril to disregard.nonetheless,the supreme court treated the regulations as a racial classification,and did not even pause to consider the suggestion that the absence of a compelled racial preference makes strict scrutiny inapposite.because the regulations at issue here indisputably if they do not explicitly direct or to make hiring decisions,under the logic of adarand,they too must be subjected to strict scrutiny.
at citations omitted.although an analysis of the degree of government pressure to grant a racial preference would no doubt be significant in evaluating whether a regulation survives strict scrutiny,it is the fact of fact that no one makes this a racial classification.id.at.
the ninth circuit has also rejected the notion that rigid requirements,quotas,goals,are a prerequisite to the finding of a racial classification or the triggering of strict scrutiny.in monterey mech.wilson,cir,the court addressed the constitutionality of requiring general contractors to subcontract percentages of work to minority or female owned subcontractors,but also provided that those requirements could be met by merely showing good faith effort to comply with the goals.it concluded that t hough worded in terms of goals and good faith,the statute imposes mandatory requirements with concreteness.id.at.thus,the court held 
w e can find no authority,and appellees have cited none,for a de minimis exception to the equal protection clause.the supreme court has held that any person,of whatever race,has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny.we conclude that there is no de minimis exception to the equal protection clause.race discrimination is never a trifle.
id.at quoting adarand,at.citations omitted.
applying a similar analysis to the moi at issue leads us to conclude that the instruction clearly required,on its face,that female and minority officers were to be evaluated under a different standard than white male officers.the records of the former were to be reviewed with particular sensitivity to the possibility that past attitudes and policies may have at some point in the officers careers placed them at a disadvantage.moreover,while neither formal quotas nor actual numerical goals were set forth in the moi,persons charged with applying this sensitivity were advised that their actions would be reviewed by their superiors with regard to how the selection rates of minorities and females compared to the selection rates for all officers.
we are not alone in our reading of,or our concerns with,this particular instruction.in baker united states,a panel of this court confronted with an air force moi regarding early retirement with the same cited language as the moi in this case rejected the court of federal claims evaluation of the charge as nothing more than a hortative comment,advice,or reminder id.instead,this court characterized the moi as a charge that on its face permitted,and even encouraged,if not actually commanded such leveling through discounting id.similarly,in alvin united states,the court of federal claims evaluated language identical to that challenged here and in baker,and held that such language means nothing unless it intends for certain individuals to be evaluated more favorably than their records would otherwise permit.id.at.
rather than giving any weight to the cited language from baker the court of federal claims sought to minimize its significance by citing more recent decisions from other courts of appeals to suggest that this court view,as espoused in baker,may have been different if it had the benefit of those subsequent opinions by other circuits.see berkley.at the baker panel did not have the benefit of other circuit court decisions before it wrote the dicta concerning the effect of the language in the secretary memorandum.the cases that the court speculated would have helped the baker panel in its analysis are hayden nassau,cir allen.state bd.of,cir,vacated by joint mot.of the parties,cir raso lago,cir lutheran synod fcc,and monterey mech.wilson,with the benefit of that suggestion,review of the cited cases leads us to a different conclusion.
two of the five cases cited,hayden and allen,do not involve express race or measures used in the allocation of governmental benefits or burdens.instead,both deal with consent decree provisions regarding the adequacy of testing instruments.the tests themselves and their grading,as the courts in those cases made clear,were conducted without any regard to race.for example,in allen,the decree provided that any future certification examination would be fashioned by using a system designed to avoid an unjustifiable discriminatory impact on teacher candidates allen,at.under the consent decree,the board was permitted to develop a test for making teacher certification decisions for and white candidates alike.id.at.accordingly,the court held that where the government does not exclude persons from the benefits based on race,but chooses to undertake outreach efforts to persons of one race,broadening the pool of applicants,but disadvantaging no one,strict scrutiny is generally inapplicable.id.citing peightal metro.dade county,cir.similarly,raso did not involve an express race or governmental measure.instead,the challenge in raso was to department of housing and urban development policies requiring unbiased access to housing.see raso,at.in sum,we do not view these decisions by other circuits as calling into question the baker court expressed views with regard to the moi language.
the government also places a great deal of emphasis on united states salerno,d.it argues that because this case presents a facial challenge to the moi,salerno dictates that the separated officers must prove that there is no set of circumstances under which the memorandum,on its face,could be applied without imposing a racial or classification.in salerno,the respondents argued that the bail reform act of was unconstitutional on its face.id.at.the supreme court rejected their claim,stating that a facial challenge to a legislative act is,of course,the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid.id.at.
with regard to the government salerno argument,the court of federal claims observed that the government had failed to note that the language of salerno upon which it relied was criticized by a plurality in city of chicago morales,d and that the salerno test was not discussed by the supreme court in key equal protection cases such as adarand.berkley.at.in the end,the court declined to decide the viability of salerno,having concluded that the moi was facially neutral.id.at.although we too question the government reliance on salerno in this case we nonetheless conclude that it is unnecessary to reach the question of its applicability at this time in light of our remand to the court of federal claims.
finally,the government argues that courts must give special deference to the military when adjudicating matters involving decisions upon composition,and constitutional rights must be viewed in light of the military special circumstances and need.in urging such deference,the government relies on woodward united states.in woodward,this court held that s pecial deference must be given by a court to the military when adjudicating matters involving their decisions on discipline,morale,composition and the like,and a court should not substitute its views for the considered professional judgment of the military.id.at quoting goldman weinberger,d.therefore,according to the government,the trial court correctly held that deference to the military applies in this case.
we adhere to the policy of giving deference to the military for matters involving discipline,morale,composition and the like.id.such deference,however,does not prevent or preclude our review of the instruction in this case in light of constitutional equal protection claims raised.see holley united states.in light of our disposition here,however,and our decision to remand to the court of federal claims to apply a strict scrutiny analysis,we do not reach the question of what effect,if any,deference to the military would have on the judicial application of strict scrutiny.
conclusion 
because we find that the challenged instruction included a racial and gender based classification,we conclude that the court of federal claims incorrectly applied a rational basis rather than a strict scrutiny analysis to the challenged moi.therefore,for the reasons stated above,we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand the case to the court of federal claims for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
reversed and remanded.
in endorsing a facial challenge to a memorandum,and in holding that the memorandum must be assumed to dictate racial and gender discrimination without a factual hearing,the majority acts contrary to supreme court precedent and our own decision in baker united states.the majority approach is unsupported by any decision of the supreme court or any other court of appeals,and,in my view,will cause enormous mischief by potentially invalidating virtually any governmental directive that cautions against the perpetuation of racial discrimination against minorities and gender discrimination against women.i respectfully dissent.
the crucial question here is whether the government selection board actions are to be tested by strict scrutiny the rule established by adarand constructors,pena was succinctly stated by the supreme court a ny person,of whatever race,has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny,d emphasis added.the question here is whether the memorandum requires equal treatment or unequal treatment.the government argues,and the court of federal claims agreed,that the memorandum on its face merely guarantees equal treatment,and that the government actions are subject to rational basis review.the plaintiffs argue,and the majority agrees,that the memorandum on its face subjects the white male officers to unequal treatment and must be judged by heightened scrutiny.i disagree with both positions because i conclude that the effect of the memorandum can not be judged on its face.
at the outset,i confess being unfamiliar with the concept of a facial challenge to a memorandum.although we know how a statute or regulation is perceived,there is much greater uncertainty with respect to the perception of a memorandum.the supreme court has expressed some concern about even facial challenges to statutes because of the inevitable tendency to render sweeping decisions without an adequate factual record.united states raines,d.there is no support for taking this facial challenge approach to a mere memorandum where the risks of abstract adjudication are even greater.
the issue here must be considered against the backdrop of undisputed and indisputable discrimination within the military against racial minorities.for years the military has had policies and procedures in place designed to prevent such discrimination.see part initially published in the federal register on november,department of defense directive,department of defense military equal opportunity program.notably,since at least the military has collected data on the rates of promotion for minority and female officers to judge the effectiveness of the military efforts to combat discrimination.see united states general accounting office,military equal opportunity certain trends in racial and gender data may warrant further analysis,gao report to help ensure equal opportunity in the services,a dod directive and related instruction require that the services prepare annual reports.for almost a decade,congress itself has required that the secretary of defense shall carry out an annual survey to measure the state of racial,ethnic,and gender issues and discrimination among members of the armed forces serving on active duty.more recently there have been allegations of reverse discrimination within the military.see baker,at saunders white.the critical question here is whether the memorandum involved was designed to prevent further discrimination against minorities or to require unequal treatment of.
that question can not be answered on the face of the memorandum.it does not explicitly require or direct unequal treatment.the majority conclusion that it unequivocally and without exception,ante at,dictates unequal treatment is highly speculative 
there are three principal aspects of the memorandum that the majority addresses the mandate for fair and equitable consideration for minorities and women the requirement that the board continue to be particularly sensitive to past discrimination against minorities and women and the reporting requirement.first,the overall purpose of the mandate appears to be fair and equitable consideration.this refrain is repeated multiple times throughout the memorandum.while this language may be code for preferential treatment,it could also be intended to prevent discrimination against these groups.only a factual hearing can provide the evidence necessary to determine the purpose of the language.
second,the memorandum stated that the board members should be particularly sensitive to the possibility that past individual and societal attitudes,and in some instances utilization of policies or practices,may have placed these officers at a disadvantage from a total career perspective.memorandum of instructions,board,at july.in my view,this language which our earlier baker decision found below at could have at least two different a that substandard performance in the military should be discounted or b that the board members should be careful not to let these societal attitudes and discriminatory policies continue to influence their own evaluations.again,a factual hearing is necessary to determine the design and effect.
third,the majority places great weight on the role of the reporting requirement.the report was to be prepared after the selection of the officers for retirement by the board.the face of the memorandum does not suggest or establish that the report was intended to influence the choices of board members.there is no evidence that the report results were reviewed on a or basis,much less that the board members were evaluated or thought they would be evaluated on the basis of those statistics the reporting requirement is not clearly a form of pressure on the board to give unequal treatment it could just as well be a measure of possible discriminatory action.the use of reports as a mechanism to check on the existence of discrimination and to prevent discrimination is well established,even in the military.see,gao report.
where such possible innocent explanations exist,the supreme court has almost never invalidated a statute on its face.instead,the court will invalidate a neutral statute on its face when the only explanation for the law is unequal treatment based on race.for example,the court has concluded that no inquiry into legislative purpose is necessary when the racial classification appears on the face of the statute or in those rare circumstances when statutes that,although race neutral,are,on their face,unexplainable on grounds other than race.shaw reno,d quotation omitted see also gomillion lightfoot,d.thus,i f a law is racially neutral on its face,the persons challenging the law as being a racial classification must show that the law was created or maintained for a racially discriminatory purpose.ronald rotunda john nowak,treatise on constitutional law substance and procedure,at ed emphasis added.
a factual hearing is exactly what our own prior decision in baker required when confronted with a memorandum containing identical language.in baker,retired male,united states air force colonels challenged their selection for retirement by a selective early retirement board,urging that the memorandum given to the board violated their equal protection rights.baker,at.baker came to this court on a developed factual record.the government had submitted affidavits averring that the memorandum in that case was designed to ensure equal opportunity.on appeal the government was forced to withdraw the affidavits.although we concluded that the memorandum on its face permitted,and even encouraged,if not actually commanded,leveling through discounting which involves artificially enhancing or downgrading the records of employees,id.at,a further factual hearing was necessary to determine the purpose and effect of the memorandum.this court identified the importance of additional to determine the effect of the memorandum on the members of the board,stating whether the voting members of the board applied the memorandum to work favoritism to women and minority colonels,because of their status as such,is at the heart of the case.id.at.we then acknowledged that w e are not the forum for a hearing to ascertain what information the government now has which may explain whether the board acted within the law,and remanded for further proceedings in the court of federal claims.we should do the same here.
none of the cases relied on by the majority remotely supports dispensing with a factual hearing to determine the existence of discrimination.most of these cases explicitly provided unequal treatment.for example,the law in monterey mechanical wilson was a state statute that require d general contractors to subcontract percentages of the work to minority,women,and disabled veteran owned subcontractors,or demonstrate good faith efforts to do so,cir emphases added.in city of richmond croson,richmond adopted an ordinance requir ing prime contractors to whom the city awarded construction contracts to subcontract at least of the dollar amount of the contract to one or more minority business enterprises mbe.the did not apply to city contracts awarded to prime contractors,d citations omitted.
as the majority notes,adarand itself involved provisions that provided an explicit financial incentive to bidding contractors to provide a preference to minority subcontractors.ante at adarand,at.the small business act set the goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals at not less than percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year.adarand,at.quoting g.to receive these benefits,the small business was required to be at least owned by individuals who qualified as socially and economically disadvantaged.id.at.the accompanying regulations,in turn,provide a presumption that blacks,hispanics,and other members of minority groups are socially disadvantaged.id.at.the government conceded that the presumptions used in determining eligibility for the program benefits triggered a heightened level of scrutiny.id.at.the parties disagreed merely about the appropriate level of scrutiny.id.the court held that federal racial classifications are subject to strict scrutiny.id.at.but there is nothing in adarand that changes the rules for facial challenges or the standard of proof for discrimination.indeed,the court,responding to the argument that the provisions for favorable treatment of the disadvantaged were subject to the most relaxed judicial scrutiny,id.at,stated t o the extent that the statutes and regulations involved in this case are race neutral,we agree.id.at.in other words,the court declined to assume that the provisions for favorable treatment of the disadvantaged necessarily imposed a racial preference.
the majority places its primary reliance on the district of columbia circuit decision in lutheran synod fcc,reh g denied,a case not binding on this court,and plainly distinguishable on its facts.lutheran church involved an equal employment opportunity eeo regulation of the federal communications commission fcc.in lutheran church,the district of columbia circuit held that a regulation was subject to strict scrutiny even though it did not explicitly require unequal treatment because it pressured broadcasters to engage in unequal treatment.the conclusion as to the effect of the regulation was not,however,the result of an abstract consideration of the regulation on its face.rather,the court carefully reviewed the context and impact of the regulation before concluding that pressure existed.the fcc regulatory scheme was complex,but it can be simply summarized.the fcc required that broadcasters determine whether women and minorities were underrepresent ed in the station workforce when compared to the geographical area in which the station was located.if so,the station was required to undertake a variety of outreach programs.more significantly,the station was required to submit these statistics to the fcc,and such underrepresentation was one factor that might trigger intense review of the station renewal application,increased penalties for eeo violations,or fcc letters recommending necessary improvements.lutheran church,at.based on this careful and comprehensive review,the court concluded that these regulations indisputably pressure d stations to make hiring decisions that favored racial minorities,lutheran church,at,and inevitably cause d licensees to grant racial preferences id.at opinion on denial of rehearing.on this basis,the district of columbia circuit concluded that strict scrutiny applied to the regulations accord broadcasters ass fcc.there is no similar record here.
when the lutheran church precedent is understood in context,that precedent contradicts the result reached by the majority here.ample evidence of record not only permitted,but also compelled,the conclusion that the exhortations in fact pressured the relevant to evaluate some individuals more favorably than others,based on race or gender.in sum,lutheran church does not support the court holding in this case.instead,that precedent argues directly against the court holding.the majority opinion is completely without support in relevant precedent 
i am not suggesting that a litigant needs to make a showing that the board made use of a racial or gender preference in each particular retirement decision,as the majority seems to believe,and lutheran church expressly rejects,at.to the contrary,i am seeking the answer to more fundamental questions.what was the impact of the memorandum in actual practice did it effectively pressure the board to make retirement decisions on the basis of race or gender 
after a factual hearing,the memorandum
