five named plaintiffs,members of indian tribes and present or past beneficiaries of individual indian money iim accounts,filed a class action in district court in,alleging that the secretaries of the interior and the treasury,and the assistant secretary of the interior for indian grossly mismanaged those accounts.the bulk of the funds in the accounts are the proceeds of various transactions in land allotted to individual indians under the general allotment act of,known as the dawes act,ch,stat.codified as amended at et repealed.the transactions in question evidently involved such matters as sales of timber and leases of rights to grazing,farming,or extraction of oil,gas,or other minerals.complaint.see also cobell babbitt,d,cobell v.the accounts also contain funds from a variety of other sources,see,but the allotment land transactions apparently predominate.
plaintiffs suit draws significantly on congress findings of hopelessly inept management of the iim accounts and its action to remedy the resulting chaos.a congressional report,misplaced trust the bureau of indian affairs mismanagement of the indian trust fund,catalogued interior dismal history of inaction and incompetence,id.at,and concluded that the agency had repeatedly failed to take resolute corrective action to reform its longstanding financial management problems,id.at.in congress moved from findings to legislation,passing the indian trust fund management reform act,pub,stat.codified as amended at et et the act.the act imposed a variety of duties on the secretary of the interior,most of them relating directly to trust funds such as the iim accounts.see,d.
even apart from the act,the iim funds have quite a different legal status from the allotment land itself.section of the dawes act nominally made the united states trustee of those lands,but did so solely in order to limit alienation by indians and to assure immunity of the lands from state taxation.see united states mitchell,d mitchell i.it gave the indian beneficiaries the right to possess and manage the lands except insofar as alienation was involved.id.at.at.see also united states navajo nation,d describing mitchell i and applying its principles to certain unallotted lands.accordingly,the supreme court held in mitchell i that the dawes act did not,alone,establish a fiduciary duty on the part of the united states to manage the allotted lands.at.at.in contrast,the iim funds are by statute under the full control of the united states,to be invested for the benefit of individual indians in public debt of the united states or deposited in banks.see b,a.
as the label cobell v suggests,this litigation has generated many legal opinions,including three of this court.in cobell norton,cobell vi,we affirmed the district court holding that the officials had breached their fiduciary duties and remanded for further proceedings.in cobell norton,cobell viii,we vacated a contempt citation of successor defendants interior secretary gale norton and assistant secretary of indian affairs neal mccaleb,and reversed the district court appointment of a court monitor.and finally,in cobell norton,we vacated an order of the district court directing interior to disconnect its computers from the internet pending a security determination,excepting only certain essential systems and ones that would not provide access to indian trust data.those opinions,as well as the many opinions of the district court,provide an array of background data.
here we address a district court injunction issued september.cobell norton,d cobell x.the decree,see id.at,imposes obligations on the defendants in two main categories.duties related to historical accounting are intended to unravel the tangle resulting from past accounting failures,see id.at those related to fixing the system are intended to compel the issuance of a plan for future trust administration as a whole,see id.at.to assure fulfillment of both sets of duties,the court appointed a court monitor to oversee compliance and said it would retain jurisdiction until december.these two different sets of commands raise quite different issues.
historical accounting,we find,is governed by pub,a provision adopted after the district court opinion issued,which radically changes the underlying substantive law and removes the legal basis for the historical accounting elements of the injunction.we therefore vacate those elements.
the core of fixing the system,by contrast,requires the interior defendants to produce a plan that would fix the iim trust management system,and requires the interior defendants to explain how the department will comply with various constraints or objectives identified by the court,such as sixteen specific common law trust duties and tribal law.although we agree that interior is subject to many of the common law trust duties identified by the court,we find that much of the fixing the system injunction exceeds the court remedial discretion because the court failed to ground it in the defendants statutory trust duties and in specific findings that interior breached those duties.aside from the requirement that interior complete its plan,as promised in its comprehensive plan,we thus vacate the district court injunction and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
historical accounting 
in cobell vi we ruled that the act,a,conferred a right on iim beneficiaries to a complete historical accounting of trust fund assets,explaining that a ll funds as used in that provision means all funds,irrespective of when they were deposited or at least so long as they were deposited after the act of june.at.in cobell x the district court ruled that interior must account for all funds deposited since and issued rules permitting some accounting methods and prohibiting,rejecting any use of statistical sampling.cobell x,d at.
defendants raise a variety of objections to the district court historical accounting order,but the objection based on.trumps the others.adopted november,less than two months after the issuance of cobell x.appropriates funds and provides as follows 
for the operation of trust programs for indians by direct expenditure,contracts,cooperative agreements,compacts,and grants,to remain available until expended provided,that of the amounts available under this heading not to exceed shall be available for records collection and indexing,imaging and coding,accounting for per capita and judgment accounts,accounting for tribal accounts,reviewing and distributing funds from special deposit accounts,and program management of the office of historical trust accounting,including litigation support provided further,that nothing in the american indian trust management reform act of,public law,or in any other statute,and no principle of common law,shall be construed or applied to require the department of the interior to commence or continue historical accounting activities with respect to the individual indian money trust until the earlier of the following shall have occurred a congress shall have amended the american indian trust management reform act of to delineate the specific historical accounting obligations of the department of the interior with respect to the individual indian money trust or b december.
pub.a later sentence of the same section provides that the statute of limitations will not begin to run on any claim for losses or mismanagement of trust funds until the affected tribe or individual indian has been furnished with an accounting of such funds from which the beneficiary can determine whether there has been a loss.id.
thus pub.appears to give interior temporary relief from any common law or statutory duty to engage in historical accounting for the iim accounts.the provision legislative history makes clear that congress passed it in response to cobell x,to clarify congress determination that interior should not be obliged to perform the kind of historical accounting the district court required.the conference committee explained that i nitial estimates indicate that the accounting ordered by the court would cost between billion and billion conf,at.the committee reject ed the notion that in passing the american indian trust management reform act of congress had any intention of ordering an accounting on the scale of that which has now been ordered by the court.such an expansive and expensive undertaking would certainly have been judged to be a poor use of federal and trust resources.id.at.indian country would be better served by a settlement of this litigation than the expenditure of billions of dollars on an accounting.id.at.congress thus gave itself until the end of to come up with a legislative solution.see id.at.
in addition,individual legislators said in effect that the disparity between the costs of the judicially ordered accounting,and the value of the funds to be accounted for,rendered the ordered accounting,as one senator put it,nuts if this is a billion fund,or somewhere in the neighborhood of billion,would the native americans want us to begin a process in which we spend up to billion to hire accountants and financial folks and others to sift through these accounts i think that is just nuts.that does make any sense at all to anybody.cong.rec.at statement of dorgan.see also id.at statement of burns if there is one thing with which everybody involved in this issue seems to agree,it is that we should not spend that kind of money on an incredibly cumbersome accounting that will do almost nothing to benefit the indian people.
plaintiffs make a vague claim that we should simply disregard pub,allowing the district court to address its effect in the first instance.but apart from an allusion to the possibility of considering it in conjunction with developments,they offer no reason overcoming the usual principle that a court is to apply the law in effect at the time the court rules.see landgraf usi film products,d.as the provision deprives the decree historical accounting mandates of any legal basis,it is hard to see how developments could affect the matter.as a fallback position,plaintiffs argue that the law violates separation of powers principles and the takings and due process provisions of the fifth amendment.we reject both claims.
first,plaintiffs assert that pub.amounts to a legislative stay of a final judicial judgment.they cite language in hayburn case,dall,to the effect that article iii judicial decisions can not be liable to a revision,or even suspension,by the legislature.id.at emphasis added quoting decision of the circuit court for the district of north carolina,consisting of iredell,justice,and sitgreaves,district judge.in plaut spendthrift farm,d,the court explained that hayburn case stands for the principle that congress can not vest review of the decisions of article iii courts in officials of the executive branch,id.at.at,and held that congress could not require a federal court to reopen a completed case for money damages,id.at.at.but the court also said that an appellate court must apply any law enacted after the judgment under review and clearly intended to have retroactive effect.see id.at.at.
even more critical is the distinction between statutes that in effect reverse final judgments in suits for money damages,as in plaut,and ones that alter the substantive obligations of parties subject to ongoing duties under an injunction,as in pennsylvania wheeling belmont bridge,how.indeed,plaut explicitly distinguished the latter.see at.at.in wheeling bridge a court had entered a decree requiring removal of a bridge pursuant to a statute rendering it unlawful.congress then amended the law to legalize the bridge.the court held that because the act of congress modified the law so that the bridge is no longer an unlawful obstruction,it is quite plain the decree of the court can not be enforced.at.for purposes of the rule limiting congressional reversal of final judgments,an injunction is not final.as we said in national coalition to save our mall norton,applying wheeling bridge,a lthough an injunction may be a final judgment for purposes of appeal,it is not the last word of the judicial department because any provision of prospective relief is subject to the continuing supervisory jurisdiction of the court,and therefore may be altered according to subsequent changes in the law.id.at quoting miller french,d internal quotation marks omitted.
at oral argument plaintiffs seemed more to stress the idea that pub,rather than changing the substantive law,directed the courts how to interpret or apply law.in save our mall we assumed that under united states klein,wall,such an interpretive direction would invade the powers of the judicial branch.at.here as there,however,we do not read the statutory language as such a directive.some of the the statement that nothing in the act or any statute or the common law shall be construed or applied to require the department of the interior to commence or continue historical accounting activities emphasis added might be said to support such a reading.but as between two possible interpretations of a statute,by one of which it would be unconstitutional and by the other valid,our plain duty is to adopt that which will save the act.nlrb jones laughlin steel.
we believe pub.is most plausibly read simply to say that the department of interior shall not,under any statute or common law principle,be required to engage in historical accounting in the specified period,all statutes and common law rules requiring any such accounting are temporarily and partially repealed or modified.compare robertson seattle audubon,d rejecting claim that statute should be construed as mandate of judicial findings under unchanged substantive law rather than as a change in the law.indeed,the supreme court has interpreted very similar nothing shall be construed to simply repealing prior legislation to the contrary.see carroll united states,d see also total tv palmer communications,cir.
finding neither an effort to mandate a particular interpretation of the substantive law nor an impermissible legislative modification of a final judgment,we reject plaintiffs separation of powers theories.
second,plaintiffs say that pub.is an unconstitutional deprivation of property,in violation of the due process and takings clauses of the fifth amendment.the claim is obscure,as plaintiffs do not explicitly identify the property right that they believe enforcement of pub.would take.they do,however,mention the right to interest earned on trust accounts,if only in a parenthetical to a case citation.plaintiffs brief at.
but we see no reason to think pub.will affect plaintiffs entitlement to interest.as trust income beneficiaries are typically entitled to income from trust assets for the entire period of their entitlement to income,and for imputed yields for any period of delay in paying over income or principal,see bogert bogert,law of trusts and trustees,ed,we do not plaintiffs make no effort to the accounting delay allowed by pub.could deprive them of interest or any comparable returns.
plaintiffs references to temporary takings suggest that they regard a delay in the accounting itself as a taking.but the accounting is a purely instrumental way of finding out the size of their claims.if the moratorium imposed by pub.actually delays conclusion of the accounting which it may not,as congress may provide a simpler scheme than the district court,while nonetheless assuring that each individual receives his due or more,the ordinary trust principles referred to above will automatically give the plaintiffs compensation for the delay.
accordingly we find no constitutional obstacle to enforcement of pub.as written.
in pub.congress in effect gave itself until december,to develop a comprehensive legislative solution to what has become an intractable problem.conf,at.absent congressional action by that date,obviously pub.will cease to bar the historical accounting provisions of the injunction.we do not address the issues that would be relevant if the district court then reissued those provisions.at the present time,however,they are without legal basis.
fixing the system 
although the defendants argue that pub.deprives the injunction of any arguable legal basis defendants br.at,the statute suspends only historical accounting activities.because certain portions of the district court injunction are at least conceptually separable from the historical accounting duty,we must address these aspects of the order on the merits.
what we will call part iii iv of the injunction mislabeled part iii by the district court because there is already a part iii,compliance with fiduciary obligations,is primarily an order that interior complete its plan within days.cobell x,d at.the plan,which interior sketched out broadly in its comprehensive plan,is intended to provide a comprehensive statement of the manner in which trust management will be conducted after interior proposed internal changes.id.at.given that the comprehensive plan only described interior intention to create the plan,the court said that the comprehensive plan was really only a plan to make a plan.id.at.part iii iv also orders the interior defendants to implement the comprehensive plan including the plan.id.at.
part iii iv of the injunction goes on to direct that interior plan identify any portions of the plan that might be deemed inconsistent with the common law trust duties previously identified by the district court,and explain why the identified portion or portions should not be considered inconsistent with these duties.id.at.
additionally,the court injunction required interior to file with the court,within days,a list of tribal laws and ordinances that the interior defendants deem applicable to the administration of the trust,including a full statement of the manner in which the interior defendants consider these laws and ordinances to affect such administration.id.the court also ordered interior to file within days a detailed plan of measures it will take to correct certain problems with the leasing,title,and accounting systems of the trust,and a plan identifying how interior will distinguish principal from income during its historical accounting of the trust.id.
in part iv v the court set forth a detailed timetable for implementing its order.the timetable not only covers requirements set forth elsewhere in the injunction,but also imposes several additional requirements on interior,including several steps outlined in interior fiduciary obligations compliance plan of january.id.at.the compliance plan was an early version of interior plan to fulfill its fiduciary obligations and was subsequently replaced by the comprehensive plan.see id.at.the court ordered that all of these requirements be completed within roughly three to six months.id.at.
in part v vi the court appointed a judicial monitor,endowed with all authority bestowed on special masters pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,to report on the interior defendants compliance with the provisions of this order.id.at.according to the court,the monitor must have unlimited access to the interior defendants facilities and to all information relevant to the implementation of this order.id.finally,in part vi vii the district court retained jurisdiction over the case until december.id.at.
the government offers a number of reasons why we should vacate these provisions in their entirety even to the extent that they are completely separate from historical accounting,as well as targeted arguments for vacating individual elements.we first reject two government arguments that,if sound,would call for vacating all fixing the system aspects of the injunction.we then address the government argument that those elements violate the supreme court holdings in lujan national wildlife federation,d,and norton southern utah wilderness alliance,d,which read the administrative procedure act as limiting apa review to attacks on specific agency action s or the unlawful withholding of such an action,and precluding its use for claims of broad programmatic failure.in light of this last argument,we reverse and remand for further action consistent with this opinion.
government contentions applying to all elements of the injunction apart from historical accounting.against the fixing the system elements of the injunction,the government argues that any consideration of trust deficiencies outside the realm of historical accounting represents an improper expansion of the lawsuit and under mitchell i the government is not subject to any trust duties other than the statutorily created duty to account.we reject both contentions.
expansion of the lawsuit.interior claims that the district court can not expand its jurisdiction to include the entire field of trust management because our decision in cobell vi held that the only actionable duty was the duty to perform an accounting.defendants brief at.we made no such ruling.
first,we are puzzled by the idea that the fixing issues represent an expansion of the lawsuit.the complaint prayer for relief asked for an order construing the trust obligations of defendants to the members of the class,declaring that defendants have breached,and are in continuing breach of,their trust obligations to such class members,and directing the institution of accounting and other practices in conformity with the defendants trust obligations.complaint at.it also claimed a wide range of past trust violations independent of accounting failures,that the government f ailed to exercise prudence and observe the requirements of law with respect to investment and deposit of iim funds,and to maximize the return on investments within the constraints of law and prudence,and e ngag ed in and benefiting from the management of the trust funds.complaint at.and at an early stage the district court responded to this range of attacks by bifurcating the case into the parts now before us fixing the system and correcting the accounts.scheduling order at may.
interior misconstrues cobell vi in arguing that our holding there limited the issue in this case to the provision of a historical accounting.we held that the duties identified by the district court,such as the duty to create specific written policies and procedures pursuant to the act,d,were subsidiary to the duty to account,cobell vi,at,not that the duty to account was the only fiduciary obligation in this case.the act did not create those obligations any more than it created the iim accounts the act recognized and reaffirmed what should be beyond the government has longstanding and substantial trust obligations to indians,particularly to iim trust beneficiaries,not the least of which is a duty to account.id.at emphasis added.
statutory basis for fiduciary obligations.the government quotes united states navajo nation,d,for the proposition that a purported trust beneficiary must identify a substantive source of law that establishes specific fiduciary or other duties.id.at.at.the difficulty facing the government,however,is that,for the iim accounts,such a duty is not far to seek.
in two matched pairs of cases the supreme court has stated what is needed to infer creation of conventional fiduciary duties with respect to indian interests,sufficient to sustain claims for monetary damages under the indian tucker act.the modifier conventional is critical,to distinguish such duties from the concept that a trust relationship between the government and the indians requires that statutory ambiguities be resolved in favor of indians.see,montana blackfeet tribe of indians,d.we described at the outset how in mitchell i the court found no enforceable fiduciary duty in the trust established for allotment lands themselves,given the limited purposes of the authority retained by the government.conversely,in united states mitchell,d mitchell ii,the court found that where allotment land was subject to elaborate government control over property belonging to indians,a fiduciary relationship necessarily arises.id.at.at.instead of the bare trust arising from the operation of the dawes act alone,id.at.at,the land involved in mitchell ii was subject to statutes and regulations asserting government control and responsibility,and compelling the inference of a genuine trust over the resources so controlled.a similar pair of cases applies the same principle to land see navajo nation,at.at rejecting inference of enforceable fiduciary relationship because the statutes and regulations failed to give the government full responsibility to manage the resources in question for the benefit of the indians,and united states white mountain apache tribe,d finding such a responsibility in the government.
the iim accounts fall emphatically on the full responsibility side.section b directs that a ll funds held in trust by the united states and carried in principal accounts on the books of the united states treasury to the credit of individual indians shall be invested by the secretary of the treasury,at the request of the secretary of the interior,in public debt securities with maturities suitable to the needs of the fund b.the statutory mandate,added in the act,appears in large part to codify interior prior practice,which involved the exercise of complete control over the iim funds.see,at.thus the statute assumes a set of funds held by the united states and directs its officials investment of these funds.
another provision,a,authorizes an alternative investment for funds held in trust for the benefit of individual,deposits in banks selected by the secretary of the interior.and at the request of an individual indian for whom funds are held,investments may also be made in obligations unconditionally guaranteed by the united states,or in mutual funds holding only such obligations.c.although this extremely narrow band of permissible investments takes off the table many potential disputes over prudent investment,it plainly assigns the government full managerial responsibility.
under the four cases just discussed,these statutory mandates compel an inference of enforceable fiduciary duties.indeed,the district court so held early in this litigation,see cobell babbitt,d,cobell iii the basic contours of defendants fiduciary duties under this trust are established by the statutes applicable to the iim trust and,as in mitchell ii,construed in light of the common law of trusts.thus the trust duties that in cobell vi we said the act reaffirmed,at,see also id.at,are the fully enforceable variety found in mitchell ii and white mountain apache tribe.
that does not mean,however,that the district court may simply copy a list of common law trust duties from the restatement and then order interior to explain how it will satisfy them.putting aside the litigation innovation requiring defendants to explain how they will cure a long list of defaults as to which the court has made no finding,the court has abstracted the common law duties from any statutory basis.though the district court cites white mountain apache tribe to support this incorporation of common law trust duties,see cobell x,d at,it ignores the supreme court actual approach,which was to look to trust law to find that a particular common law duty to preserve and maintain trust assets was implied in a statute that,by permitting government occupation,made property expressly subject to a trust,white mountain apache tribe,at.at.thus,once a statutory obligation is identified,the court may look to common law trust principles to particularize that obligation.
the district court itself so held in cobell v,d at,finding that it could not grant plaintiffs prayer for a declaration of all trust duties arising from the iim trust solely on the basis of plaintiffs common law trust claims.the court subsequently reversed itself on the point,saying that our decision in cobell vi supercedes the district court prior observation that plaintiffs were wrong to think that once a trust relationship was established they could automatically invoke all the rights that a common law trust entails.cobell x,d at.insofar as plaintiffs may have said that,they were wrong.in cobell vi we actually held that the government duties must be rooted in and outlined by the relevant statutes and treaties,at,although those obligations may then be defined in traditional equitable terms,id.
programmatic review under the apa.plaintiffs invoke the apa as the basis for securing review of defendants conduct.complaint at plaintiffs are entitled to review of defendants various breaches of trust under.defendants argue that the district court fixing the system orders exceed the court jurisdiction because they are insufficiently pinned to discrete agency action or inaction.
as southern utah notes,and of the apa all insist upon an agency action.at.this of course includes provision of authority to compel agency action unreasonably delayed.see id.at.because of the requirement of specific agency action,the court held initially in lujan and again in southern utah that apa review was not in the face of allegations of rampant violations of claims seeking wholesale improvement of a program by court decree,rather than in the offices of the department or the halls of congress,where programmatic improvements are normally made.lujan,at.at see also southern utah.at.the apa requirement of discrete agency action,southern utah explained,was 
to protect agencies from undue judicial interference with their lawful discretion,and to avoid judicial entanglement in abstract policy disagreements which courts lack both expertise and information to resolve.if courts were empowered to enter general orders compelling compliance with broad statutory mandates,they would necessarily be empowered,as well,to determine whether compliance was would mean that it would ultimately become the task of the supervising court,rather than the agency,to work out compliance with the broad statutory mandate,injecting the judge into agency management the prospect of pervasive oversight by federal courts over the manner and pace of agency compliance with such broad congressional directives is not contemplated by the apa.
the district court itself,earlier in this litigation,acknowledged the risk of taking on what were really legislative or executive functions the court has no present intention to entertain a request to sit as a oversight body that tells defendants everything that they must do to meet their obligations programmatically.that is a role that only congress can fulfill.cobell iii,d at.
the application of lujan and southern utah is complicated here by the availability of common law trust precepts to flesh out the statutory mandates,and,indeed,as we said in cobell vi,at least partially to limit the deference that we would normally owe the defendants as interpreters of the statutes they are charged with administering.see cobell vi,at.see also id.at noting defendants obligation to pass scrutiny under the more stringent standards demanded of a fiduciary internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
the government accepts and even endorses our observation that interpretation of statutory terms is informed by common law trust principles,see defendants reply brief at citing cobell vi,at,but makes two key points as to why those precepts do not eliminate the risks that lujan and southern utah saw in broad programmatic remedies.first,it notes that while the expenditures that plaintiffs seek are to be made out of appropriated funds,trust expenses for private trusts are normally met out of the trust funds themselves.defendants reply brief at.thus plaintiffs here are free of private beneficiaries incentive not to urge judicial compulsion of wasteful expenditures.second,private trustees,even though held to high fiduciary standards,are generally free of direct judicial control over their methods of implementing these duties,and trustee choices of methods are reviewable only to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his discretion.id.at citing restatement second of trusts.
while a court might certainly act to prevent or remedy a trustee wrongful intermingling of trust accounts,this does not imply that the normal remedy would be an order specifying how the trustee should program its computers to avoid intermingling,as opposed to,for example,barring the use of a program that had caused forbidden intermingling or was clearly likely to do so.see bogert bogert,law of trusts and trustees,if the trustee has been given discretion with respect to the act in question,the court will not interfere by ordering him to take a certain line of conduct unless there is proof of an abuse of the discretion.a court o
