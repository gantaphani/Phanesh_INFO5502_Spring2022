facts and procedural background 
pursuant to a,states are permitted to make determinations of eligibility for social security benefits,on behalf and under the supervision of the social security administration ssa.the state of oregon has undertaken that responsibility.an oregon agency,disability determination services dds,administers the program,and two other state agencies,the vocational rehabilitation division vrd and the department of human services dhs,oversee dds operations.
in,plaintiffs filed this class action on behalf of oregon residents whose claims for disability benefits had been or would be denied by dds.they named as defendants the administrators of dds,vrd,and dhs collectively the state defendants and the federal defendant.plaintiffs complaint alleged that the state defendants had engaged in a uniform pattern of procedural practices by which initial applications and requests for reconsideration of disability benefits are wrongfully denied.plaintiffs also alleged that the federal defendant had failed to monitor adequately the state defendants administration of the disability program.they sought declaratory and injunctive relief,as well as costs and attorney fees.plaintiffs brought their claims against the state defendants under,and their claims against the federal defendant under g.
the state defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs claims,arguing that they did not act under color of state law in administering the ssa benefits program.the district court denied that motion in a published opinion.sorenson concannon.
after extensive discovery and an unsuccessful mediation,the parties settled on the eve of trial,in october.in the parties settlement agreement,all defendants agreed to a series of conditions,which fell under six general headings enhanced quality assurance additional disability examiners training and observation systemic measures and related actions plaintiffs representation on the advisory council of the oregon dds open door policy for dds and ssa and case review to ascertain possible systemic problems.
additionally,the federal defendant agreed to pay plaintiffs costs and attorney fees.the relevant section of the settlement agreement provides 
plaintiffs counsel are entitled to payment of reasonable attorneys fees,reasonable expenses in prosecuting this action,and costs for efforts that materially advance this litigation,consistent with applicable legal standards.in the event that the parties can not agree to the amount of reasonable attorneys fees,expenses and costs as defined above,plaintiffs shall file a fee application to the court within ninety days of the effective date of this agreement.
the parties were unable to agree on the amount of attorney fees.plaintiffs therefore filed a fee petition in district court,requesting a total of for hours of work by lawyers,legal assistants,and law clerks.in support of their request,plaintiffs attached affidavits,billing sheets,and other documents.they sought hourly fees of for three junior lawyers,for five more experienced lawyers,and for one senior lawyer.
the federal defendant opposed plaintiffs request for attorney fees,asserting that the hours that plaintiffs lawyers had claimed were excessive,duplicative,and inadequately documented.the federal defendant contended that plaintiffs were entitled to no more than in attorney fees.plaintiffs then filed a response memorandum,to which they attached additional documentation and billing records.
after a hearing,the district court issued an order on may.in its order,the court first stated that plaintiffs had accomplished their mission in this action,which was to improve the disability determination system in oregon.the court then noted that defendants also claimed to have expended more than hours of lawyer,law clerk,and paralegal services on the action.after deducting undocumented hours that plaintiffs had attributed to a law clerk,the court allowed the remaining hours that plaintiffs had claimed.
the court then set an hourly rate.the court first noted that the hours that were attributable to plaintiffs claim against the federal defendant were capped at per hour.however,the court did not make a finding as to how many hours were related to plaintiffs claim against the federal defendant.the court then concluded that,although the proposed hourly rates vary widely among plaintiffs counsel,this was a joint effort and all counsel would be compensated at a uniform rate of per hour.the court explained its conclusion as follows 
i consider this to be a fair and reasonable approach in view of the rate of inflation over the past eight years,the fact that at least part of the attorney fee claim against the federal defendant is restricted to per hour by the equal access to justice act,and the fact that portions of the fee request are documented inadequately and reflect duplicative efforts and excessive staffing.
emphasis added.
the federal defendant appeals,arguing that the district court should have deducted from its calculation hours that were undocumented,excessive,or duplicative.it also argues that the hourly rate was too high for the hours that were attributable to the claim against it.

discussion 
background 
the parties settlement agreement provides that plaintiffs will receive reasonable attorneys fees consistent with applicable legal standards.the parties agree on appeal that those applicable legal standards are found,as the district court concluded,in two statutes the eaja which applies to fees attributable to the claim against the federal defendant and which applies to fees attributable to the claims against the state defendants.
under both statutes,a district court award of attorney fees must be reasonable.the most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.hensley eckerhart,d 
for purposes of this appeal,the main difference between an award of fees under the eaja and an award of fees under is the calculation of the reasonable hourly rate.under,a reasonable hourly rate is calculated according to the prevailing market rates in the relevant community,regardless of whether plaintiff is represented by private or nonprofit counsel.blum stenson,d.the burden is on the plaintiff to produce evidence that the requested rates are in line with those prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill,experience,and reputation.id.at.the defendant may introduce rebuttal evidence in support of a lower hourly rate.
under the eaja,on the other hand,attorney fees are capped by congress.until march,the statute provided that attorney fees shall not be awarded in excess of per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a speci
