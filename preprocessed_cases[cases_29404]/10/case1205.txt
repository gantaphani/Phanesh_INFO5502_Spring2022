we must decide whether a credit reporting agency is liable for a disputed credit report under california consumer credit reporting agencies act.
in october,noemia carvalho received medical treatment from bayside medical group,bayside,in pleasanton,california.prior to receiving her treatment,carvalho signed the following agreement agreement 
bayside medical group,will bill your insurance as a courtesy to you.if your insurance does not pay the claim within days of the date of service,the balance of your account will be your responsibility i hereby authorize my insurance company to pay benefits directly to bayside medical group,and i am financially responsible for services.
as a result of her treatment,carvalho incurred charges amounting to.
for reasons that remain unclear bayside received no payment from her insurance company within the ninety days provided in the agreement.bayside sent carvalho a bill for in january,as well as a final notice in march.neither carvalho nor any insurer paid the bill.
thereafter,bayside assigned the debt to credit consulting services ccs,a collection agency.ccs sent carvalho a series of dunning letters threatening to report the debt to three major credit reporting information services,llc equifax,experian information solutions,experian,and transunion llc transunion collectively,cras if she did not pay the bill.despite these warnings,carvalho still did not pay the bill or arrange for payment by her insurer.accordingly,ccs reported the debt to the cras.
after carvalho noticed the debt on her credit report her attorney sent ccs a letter in september explaining that the debt arose from a bill her insurance company wrongfully refused to pay and requesting that ccs immediately investigate and correct the information that is erroneously appearing on her credit report.ccs responded that bayside bills insurance as a courtesy only and the individual is responsible for non covered services,and that carvalho insurance was billed and coverage denied.ccs concluded that it reported this account correctly and that any problem should be resolved between carvalho and her insurance company.
that same month,carvalho also sent letters to the three cras requesting that they,in industry parlance,reinvestigate the ccs debt on her credit report.the letters stated i dispute the above item on my enclosed credit report.these bills arose out of the medical treatment i was covered for by blue cross of california.for some reason that is unknown to me,they did not pay these medical bills.the letters requested that the passage be added to carvalho credit report.
pursuant to their standard procedures,the cras each sent an electronic consumer dispute verification cdv form to ccs with a cursory description of the dispute and a request that ccs verify the account information.ccs responded by reporting that the information was accurate,and the cras each updated carvalho credit report to indicate that the information about the ccs debt had been verified but was disputed by carvalho.in addition,equifax added carvalho statement to her report.the cras each sent carvalho notices explaining that they had verified the information as correct and describing further steps she could take if unsatisfied with the outcome of the reinvestigation.
in april,carvalho sent the cras new letters requesting a description of how the ccs item was verified.in addition,she requested that the cras include a statement on her credit report similar to the one she had sent in her prior letter.equifax mailed carvalho a boilerplate description of its procedures for verifying disputed items.experian and construed carvalho letter as a request for another reinvestigation,which also resulted in ccs verification of the item.although experian and transunion added carvalho statement to her credit report,neither complied with her request for a description of how they had verified the debt.
in june,carvalho submitted another round of letters to the cras renewing her dispute over the ccs item.according to the letters,she learned that the bayside bill may have been paid if bayside had timely and properly submitted my bill to blue shield.both equifax and experian launched new reinvestigations,with the same outcome as before.transunion informed carvalho that it considered her dispute frivolous and would not conduct any further reinvestigation absent court papers or a recent,authentic letter from the creditor s that explains what information should be updated.
in february,carvalho attorney sent letters to the cras explaining that there was clear evidence that the ccs item was wrong because bayside failed to timely and properly request payment from blue cross of california,instead improperly seeking payment from blue shield.according to the letters,carvalho credit score has suffered due to this entry and caused her home to be refinanced at a rate higher than necessary due to its inclusion.the letters demanded that the entry be removed from carvalho credit report and that she be paid plus attorney fees.moreover,the letters demanded yet another reinvestigation.the cras once again contacted ccs,which verified the information as accurate,and updated carvalho credit report accordingly.
on july,carvalho filed a class action complaint against ccs and the three cras in the monterey county superior court.the complaint alleged various violations of the california consumer credit reporting agencies act ccraa,cal.et,including the cras failure to conduct a proper reinvestigation of carvalho dispute the cras failure to provide a sufficient response to her request for a description of the procedures they used to verify the ccs item ccs failure to cooperate in the reinvestigation and ccs reporting of a debt it knew or should have known to be illegitimate.the complaint sought to certify two classes 
california consumers seeking injunctive relief against consumer credit reporting agencies reinvestigation procedures which,as presently constituted,fail to comply with the ccraa in that they fail to meet the requirements of that statute,including,but not limited to,the fact that they fail to allow for review and consideration of all relevant information provided by the consumer in the reinvestigation process and 
california consumers seeking injunctive relief against the consumer credit reporting agencies,who pursuant to the ccraa requested,but did not receive,an adequate description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the disputed information.
the prayer for relief sought class certification,an injunction,damages including punitive damages,attorney fees,and costs.however,the complaint did not plead a specific amount of damages.
the superior court granted ccs demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend on grounds that the federal fair credit reporting act fcra,b f,preempted carvalho ccraa claims against ccs.
on march,equifax filed a notice of removal in the district court for the northern district of california alleging that the case met the million requirement under the class action fairness act of cafa,d.equifax maintained that its notice of removal was timely because it did not become aware that the case met the requirement until carvalho revealed in her depositions on february and march,that the amount in controversy was at least million,times potential plaintiffs.carvalho moved to remand,arguing that cafa requirement was not met and that the notice of removal was untimely.the district court denied the motion.
carvalho moved for class certification as well as for leave to amend her complaint to add causes of action for negligent violation of the ccraa reinvestigation provision and willful violation of the fcra reinvestigation provision.the three cras each filed a motion for summary judgment.the district court granted the motions for summary judgment,denied as moot carvalho motion for class certification,and denied as futile her motion to amend her complaint.see carvalho equifax info,llc,d.this appeal timely followed.
carvalho first urges that this case was untimely removed from state court and claims that the district court erroneously denied her motion to remand 
cafa at d,vests district courts with original jurisdiction of any civil action in which,inter alia,the amount in controversy exceeds the sum or value of,exclusive of interest and costs,and in which the aggregate number of proposed plaintiffs is or greater,and any member of the plaintiff class is a citizen of a state different from any defendant.lowdermilk bank ass n,cir internal quotation marks omitted.such actions may be removed from state court pursuant to b.the timeliness of removals pursuant to cafa is governed by b,which provides 
the notice of removal of a civil action or proceeding shall be filed within thirty days after the receipt by the defendant,through service or otherwise,of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief upon which such action or proceeding is based,or within thirty days after the service of summons upon the defendant if such initial pleading has then been filed in court and is not required to be served on the defendant,whichever period is shorter.
if the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable,a notice of removal may be filed within thirty days after receipt by the defendant,through service or otherwise,of a copy of an amended pleading,motion,order or other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable 
to summarize,section b identifies two periods for removing a case.the first removal period is triggered if the case stated by the initial pleading is removable on its face.harris bankers life cas,cir.the second removal period is triggered if the initial pleading does not indicate that the case is removable,and the defendant receives a copy of an amended pleading,motion,order or other paper from which removability may first be ascertained.b.
if the notice of removal was untimely,a plaintiff may move to remand the case back to state court.see id.c,c kelton arms condo.owners ass homestead ins,cir.
carvalho argues that by the time equifax received her complaint in october,it should have been aware that the case was removable based on the settlement demand she made in february,as well as a civil case cover served with the complaint indicating unlimited jurisdiction,an amount demanded exceeding.see cal.civ.proc.according to carvalho,equifax should have been able do the math to determine that the aggregate amount in controversy exceeded million per plaintiff x potential plaintiffs million.consequently,carvalho contends that the march removal was untimely under section b.
because the face of the initial superior court any indication of the amount in controversy,it did not trigger this first removal period.hence,we consider only whether the demand letter or civil cover sheet triggered the second removal period.
carvalho argues that the settlement demand she made in february put equifax on notice of the amount in controversy.we have held that a demand letter sent during the course of the state court action can constitute other paper within the meaning of section b if it reflects a reasonable estimate of the plaintiff claim.see babasa,cir.here,however,the demand letter was sent to equifax several months before carvalho even filed her complaint.
it is axiomatic that a case can not be removed before its inception.if the second paragraph of section b were meant to include as other paper a document received by the defendant months before receipt of the initial pleading,the requirement that the notice of removal be filed within thirty days after receipt by the defendant of the other paper would be nonsensical.moreover,that the second paragraph lists an amended pleading,motion,order all documents which logically can not predate the initial or other paper leads us to conclude that other paper does not include any document received prior to receipt of the initial pleading.see united states williams,noting that the commonsense canon of noscitur a sociis counsels that a word is given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.accordingly,we conclude that any document received prior to receipt of the initial pleading can not trigger the second removal period.
we also reject carvalho suggestion that a document containing a jurisdictional clue can operate in tandem with an indeterminate initial pleading to trigger some kind of hybrid of the first and second removal periods.in harris,we held that the first removal period comes into play only if removability is ascertainable from examination of the four corners of the applicable pleadings,not through subjective knowledge or a duty to make further inquiry.at.we adopted this approach to avoid the spectre of inevitable collateral litigation over whether defendant had subjective knowledge,or whether defendant conducted sufficient inquiry.id.at.we would eviscerate our holding in harris if we required defendants to rely on documents to ascertain whether a case stated by an indeterminate initial pleading is actually removable.
consequently,the february demand letter did not trigger a removal period under section b.
carvalho also argues that equifax could have ascertained the aggregate amount in controversy from the civil cover sheet invocation of unlimited jurisdiction.assuming without deciding that a civil cover sheet can constitute other paper within the meaning of section b,we are unpersuaded that this particular cover sheet affirmatively revealed that the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds million.the checked unlimited box on the cover sheet merely indicates that the a mount demanded exceeds.nothing in the cover sheet indicates that the amount demanded by each putative class member exceeds.abrego abrego dow chem,cir.
had equifax removed the case based on this indeterminate cover sheet alone,it may well have subjected itself to fees and costs,and potentially rule sanctions,for filing a baseless notice of removal.durham lockheed martin,cir.because we neither require nor encourage defendants to remove prematurely based on such indeterminate papers,see harris,at,we conclude that the civil cover sheet did not trigger the second removal period.
the cras note that removal was timely because it was carvalho deposition testimony which provided the first indication in this case that the amount in controversy exceeds million,and equifax removed within thirty days of the deposition.in her opening brief,carvalho did not contest that the deposition revealed that her case satisfies cafa requirement.therefore,she has waived any argument to the contrary.see miller fairchild,cir.
in any event,we agree with the district court that carvalho deposition testimony triggered the second removal period.like a response to interrogatories,see durham,at,a plaintiff response to deposition questions can constitute other paper within the meaning of section b,see,peters lincoln,cir collecting cases.in her deposition,when asked whether apiece would be insufficient to resolve the damages on behalf of the persons that are similarly situated,carvalho answered,that correct.from this testimony,equifax could reasonably determine for the first time that the amount in controversy was at least per class member,or million total.
because the notice of removal was filed within thirty days of carvalho deposition testimony,which was other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is removable,b,we conclude that the denial of carvalho motion to remand was proper 
carvalho next contends that the state superior court erred in granting ccs general demurrer without leave to amend.
although ccs was served with the notice of appeal as well as carvalho briefs in this appeal,ccs did not file an answering brief or join the cras answering brief nevertheless,the cras argue on ccs behalf that we lack jurisdiction over this part of the appeal because carvalho opportunity to appeal the superior court dismissal has long since expired under the california rules of court.
after removal,the federal court takes the case up where the state court left it off.granny goose foods,teamsters,internal quotation marks omitted.the federal court treats everything that occurred in the state court as if it had taken place in federal court.butner neustadter,cir.consequently,an order entered by a state court should be treated as though it had been validly rendered in the federal proceeding.id.at.f ederal rather than state law governs the future course of proceedings.granny goose foods,at.
we treat the superior court order sustaining the demurrer as a validly rendered dismissal pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.see gardner uici,cir under california practice,a general demurrer to a complaint is the equivalent of a motion to dismiss under.b in federal practice.under federal law,such a dismissal as to only one of several defendants is appealable when,as here,it has merged into the final judgment.see.b am.ironworks erectors,am.constr,cir.therefore,we reject the contention that we lack jurisdiction over this part of the appeal.see reilly waukesha,cir now that the case is before us,we may examine all of the antecedent interlocutory rulings,including those rendered by the state judge and absorbed into the district court final judgment.
on the merits,carvalho contends that the superior court erred in concluding that the fcra preempts all state law causes of action against furnisher s of information such as ccs.
the fcra provides that n o requirement or prohibition may be imposed under the laws of any state relating to the responsibilities of persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies.b f.nevertheless,it expressly saves from preemption section a of the california civil code.id.b f ii.section a,in turn,provides that a person shall not furnish information on a specific transaction or experience to any consumer credit reporting agency if the person knows or should know the information is incomplete or inaccurate.
because the private right of action to enforce section a is found in sections g and,which are not expressly saved from preemption under the fcra,some courts have held that fcra preempts private consumer actions against furnishers under california law.see,lin universal card servs,d.however,we recently rejected this view in gorman wolpoff abramson,llp,cir.there,we concluded that the provisions creating a private right of action do not constitute a requirement or prohibition within the meaning of b f because they merely provide a vehicle for enforcing actual requirements or prohibitions.id.at.moreover,we concluded that it was highly unlikely that congress explicitly retained the portions of the california statutory scheme that create obligations,without leaving in place any enforcement mechanism.id.at.therefore,we held that the private right of action to enforce california civil code section a is not preempted by the fcra.id.at.
relying primarily on gorman,carvalho argues that her ccraa claims against ccs should be reinstated.her complaint made two allegations against ccs first,that ccs failed to cooperate with and complete an investigation in response to a reinvestigation inquiry from a consumer credit reporting agency,and second,that ccs willfully violated the ccraa by reporting a debt it knew to be illegitimate.
in her opposition to ccs demurrer,carvalho defended only her claim that ccs had failed to assist in the reinvestigation.nowhere did she mention her claim that ccs had knowingly reported inaccurate information,which is a violation of section a.a plaintiff who makes a claim in his complaint,but fails to raise the issue in response to a defendant motion to dismiss,has effectively abandoned his claim,and can not raise it on appeal.walsh.dep t of human,cir.because carvalho failed to raise her section a inaccuracy claim in response to the demurrer,we conclude that she has abandoned it.
we are left with carvalho claim of inadequate investigation.california civil code f requires furnishers who receive notice of a dispute to complete an investigation and to review relevant information section f,however,is not expressly saved from preemption by the fcra.gorman holds only that the fcra does not preempt section a claims against furnishers.see at.because section a is the only substantive ccraa furnisher provision specifically saved by the fcra,carvalho section f claim is preempted.therefore,we discern no reason to disturb the order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.
carvalho next claims that the cras violated the ccraa reinvestigation provision,cal,which provides in relevant part 
if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in his or her file is disputed by a consumer,and the dispute is conveyed directly to the consumer credit reporting agency by the consumer or user on behalf of the consumer,the consumer credit reporting agency shall within a reasonable period of time and without charge,reinvestigate and record the current status of the disputed information before the end of the period beginning on the date the agency receives notice of the dispute from the consumer or user,unless the consumer credit reporting agency has reasonable grounds to believe and determines that the dispute by the consumer is frivolous or irrelevant,including by reason of a failure of the consumer to provide sufficient information,as requested by the consumer credit reporting agency,to investigate the dispute.
id.a.after completing a reinvestigation,the cra must provide the consumer with written notice of any results,including a notice that,if requested by the consumer,a description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the information shall be provided.id.d.the cra must send such description not later than days after receiving a request from the consumer.id.
the district court held that b ecause there is no genuine dispute that plaintiff credit report was factually accurate,defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.carvalho,d at.carvalho contends that inaccuracy is not a required element of a reinvestigation claim under the ccraa.she also argues that the item on her credit reports referencing the ccs collection account was inaccurate.
our duty as a federal court in this case is to ascertain and apply the existing california law.munson del taco,cir per curiam internal quotation marks omitted.we are bound by pronouncements of the california supreme court on applicable state law,but in the absence of such pronouncements,we follow decisions of the california court of appeal unless there is convincing evidence that the california supreme court would hold otherwise.id.
the california courts have yet to consider whether a plaintiff must demonstrate that a disputed item is inaccurate to obtain relief for a violation of the ccraa reinvestigation provisions.however,because the ccraa is substantially based on the federal fair credit reporting act,judicial interpretation of the federal provisions is persuasive authority and entitled to substantial weight when interpreting the california provisions.olson six rivers bank,d,internal citations omitted 
although the fcra reinvestigation provision,does not on its face require that an actual inaccuracy exist for a plaintiff to state a claim,many courts,including our own,have imposed such a requirement.see deandrade trans union llc,cir collecting cases.in dennis,llc,cir,we held that a plaintiff filing suit under section must make a prima facie showing of inaccurate reporting.id.at.the inaccuracy requirement comports with the purpose of the fcra,which is to protect consumers from the transmission of inaccurate information about them.gorman,at internal quotation marks omitted.because we believe california courts would find dennis persuasive,we conclude that unless carvalho has raised a genuine issue as to whether the disputed item was inaccurate,her ccraa section claims fail as a matter of law.
in dennis,we did not define what constitutes an inaccurate report.later,in gorman,we explained that an item on a credit report can be incomplete or inaccurate within the meaning of the fcra furnisher investigation provision,b d because it is patently incorrect,or because it is misleading in such a way and to such an extent that it can be expected to adversely affect credit decisions.at internal quotation marks omitted.the california court of appeal has expounded a very simil
