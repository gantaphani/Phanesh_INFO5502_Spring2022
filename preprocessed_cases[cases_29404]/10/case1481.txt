appellants ramona two shields and mary louise defender wilson brought this action against the united states,seeking redress for themselves and other native americans in connection with the government alleged mismanagement of leases on indian allotment land.the united states court of federal claims found in favor of the government,granting summary judgment on count i and dismissing counts ii and iii.we affirm.
pursuant to the general allotment act of and the indian reorganization act of,the united states is the trustee of millions of acres of indian allotment land.the bureau of indian affairs bia,under the secretary of the interior,is the federal bureau responsible for managing the trust lands.
much of this case turns on events from a prior case,commonly referred to as the cobell litigation.we therefore begin with a discussion of the facts and circumstances surrounding that case.
in,the cobell class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of more than native americans.the plaintiffs alleged that the government had mismanaged their individual indian money iim accounts by failing to account for billions of dollars relating to leases of allotment land for oil extractions and logging.the litigation was complex and,and eventually settled in.see cobell salazar,wl july.it is the details of the cobell settlement that are relevant here.
the cobell settlement provided that,following the enactment of legislation to carry it out,an amended complaint would be filed.the amended complaint set forth several different categories of claims.one was historical accounting claims asserted by members of the historical accounting class these claims were closely tied to the government mismanagement of iim accounts that was the focus of the original complaint.another category of claims was much broader it included any land administration claims held by the trust administration class,a class defined as including those individuals that held,as of the record date of september,a recorded or other demonstrable ownership interest in land held in trust or restricted status.the land administration claims were broadly defined as any known and unknown claims that have been or could have been asserted through the record date of september,for interior defendants alleged breach of trust and fiduciary mismanagement of land,oil,natural gas,mineral,timber,grazing,water and other resources and rights.
importantly,the settlement agreement included an provision.members of the trust administration class who failed to opt out of the settlement would be deemed to have released,waived,and forever discharged the government from any claims falling within the scope of the settlement,including any land administration claims.
in december of,congress passed the claims resolution act of,which ratified the settlement and funded it with billion.see,stat.the amended complaint was duly filed with the district court,the settlement approved,and judgment entered in.cobell,wl.in accordance with the settlement terms,the district court provided notice of the settlement,including class members right.the fairness of the process was challenged in court including alleged violations of fifth amendment due process and the notice provisions of fed.civ.pro,but those challenges were ultimately rejected.see,aff,cert denied,d.
appellants in this case,two shields and defender wilson,are indian allotees who hold interests in allotment land located on the fort berthold indian reservation in north dakota.appellants allotments are located on part of the bakken oil shale one of the country largest contiguous deposits of oil and natural gas.
pursuant to legislation enacted in,fort berthold allotees can not lease their interests unless the secretary approves the lease as in the best interest of the indian owners of the indian land,stat.fort berthold act amending.this approval step is intended to ensure that indian mineral owners desiring to have their resources developed are assured that they will be developed in a manner that maximizes the indian owners best economic interests and minimizes any adverse environmental impacts or cultural impacts resulting from such development.a.
in,appellants sued the government for violating its obligations relating to approval of leases on fort berthold allotment lands.appellants alleged that,between and late,a company called dakota obtained leases on thousands of acres of fort berthold allotment land at rates,then turned around and sold those leases to the williams companies in november of for a profit of nearly million.appellants alleged that the bia knew the rates were not in the indian owners best interests,but nonetheless every dakota lease.
the complaint contained three counts.the primary one,count i,alleged that the bia breached its fiduciary duty under to ensure leases are in the best interests of the indian owners.the government sought summary judgment on this count,arguing that appellants were barred from asserting it by the cobell settlement.it is undisputed that two shields and defender wilson are members of the trust administration class and that they failed to opt out of the settlement the government therefore argued that it was entitled to summary judgment because count i was a land administration claim released by appellants failure to opt out of the cobell settlement.the court of federal claims agreed,granting summary judgment for the government.
the complaint counts ii and iii were made in the alternative.in count ii,appellants alleged that the government breached a wholly separate fiduciary duty a duty to have disclosed to appellants,during the cobell settlement proceedings,information relating to the fort berthold claims appellants assert in this case.the court of federal claims dismissed this count for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,agreeing with the government that there was no source of federal law that set forth the specific fiduciary duty alleged to be breached.in count iii,appellants alleged that the claims resolution act of was a legislative taking of counts i and ii,in violation of the fifth amendment.the court of federal claims dismissed this count as well,finding that counts i and ii did not amount to a cognizable property interest that could be the subject of a takings claim because they lacked a final judgment that appellants could not show an unjust taking occurred and that,in any event,count iii appeared to be a due process claim masquerading as a takings claim,and therefore outside the court of federal claims jurisdiction.
appellants now appeal to us.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
we review a summary judgment determination by the court of federal claims completely and independently,construing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.am.airlines,united states.we review de novo the court of federal claims dismissals based on lack of jurisdiction,holmes united states,and failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted,hartford fire insurance united states.
we begin with what both parties agree is the primary question in this case whether the cobell settlement bars appellants from now asserting count i against the government.we treat the cobell settlement as a contract,vandesande united states,the proper interpretation of which is a question of law,landmark land fdic.appellants offer four reasons why the cobell settlement should not be interpreted as releasing their claims.we take each in turn.
first,appellants argue that count i does not fall within the definition of land administration claims,which is limited to only those claims that could have been asserted by the record date of september.appellants contend that the crucial event in this case was the november sale of leases from dakota to the williams companies,at a profit that appellants claims did not accrue until that time and thus do not meet the september,date for land administration claims.
appellants are correct that a claim does not accrue until all events necessary to fix the liability of the defendant have occurred.catawba indian tribe united states.but the november sale to the williams companies was not an event necessary to fix the government purported lia
