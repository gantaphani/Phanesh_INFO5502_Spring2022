defendants,the director of the california department of health services dhs and the director of the california department of social services dss,appeal from the district court grant of a preliminary injunction ordering them to screen members of a statewide class of foster children and,where medically necessary,provide the children with the forms of mental health care known as wraparound services and therapeutic foster care.the district court found that the early and periodic screening,diagnostic,and treatment services epsdt provisions of the medicaid act obligate the state of california state to provide wraparound services and therapeutic foster care to children under,and that the state does not currently provide those forms of assistance,as such.
on appeal,defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction against them and in denying their motion for reconsideration.specifically,they contend that the court failed to make findings of fact and conclusions of law,as required by federal rule of civil procedure a committed clear error in its factual findings applied the wrong legal standard both as to the standard for issuance of a mandatory preliminary injunction against a state agency and as to the underlying legal questions and failed to comply with federal rule of civil procedure d requirement that an injunction be specific in its terms.we have jurisdiction to review the district court order granting the preliminary injunction and the court denial of the motion for reconsideration under a.
because the district court applied an erroneous interpretation of the medicaid act,we reverse and remand.we reject defendants remaining contentions of error regarding the factual findings and legal standard relied on by the district court.
background 
i.the katie class action 
in july,a class of children who were in los angeles county foster care or at risk of being placed into foster care katie,et filed a complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the director of dhs and the director of dss as well as los angeles county,the los angeles county department of children and family services dcfs,and the director of dcfs la county defendants.the complaint alleged that the class was entitled to and had not received medically necessary mental health services in a setting.separate claims were alleged under,based on violations of the children rights under the medicaid act,et,and the due process clause of the federal constitution under the americans with disabilities act and the rehabilitation act under the due process clause of the california constitution and under california statutory law.
the complaint was later amended to include a class of children in foster care or at risk of being placed in foster care.the district court certified the class under federal rule of civil procedure b and approved a settlement agreement between the plaintiff class and la county defendants.
plaintiffs then moved for a preliminary injunction to require the director of dhs and the director of dss defendants to provide wraparound services wraparound and therapeutic foster care tfc to members of the class.plaintiffs described wraparound and tfc as highly effective integrated interventions for children with emotional,behavioral,and mental health disorders.plaintiffs argued that the epsdt provisions obligate the state to provide wraparound and tfc to them.in particular,they alleged that medical policies impeding access to wraparound services or tfc violated the medicaid statute.they alleged that medical covered only some components of wraparound and tfc,and that state policies made it difficult to access either type of care.
defendants argued that the medicaid statute does not require them to provide services in the wraparound or tfc forms demanded by plaintiffs and that medical provides all required services.they characterized wraparound and tfc as processes or approaches,rather than services,and argued that the medicaid act does not create obligations to provide either.defendants also disputed plaintiffs contention that all of the components of wraparound and tfc are health care services properly covered by medicaid.
on march,the district court entered an order granting a mandatory preliminary injunction against defendants,ordering them to provide medically necessary wraparound services and tfc to class members on a consistent,statewide basis within days of the order entry.stating that defendants did not dispute that they did not provide wraparound and tfc as such,the court found that wraparound services and therapeutic foster care fall within the epsdt obligations of states.the court also cited what it described as plaintiffs undisputed evidence that wraparound and tfc are medically necessary for children with serious mental health needs.on this basis,the court concluded that plaintiffs had shown a strong likelihood of succeeding on the merits of their medicaid act claim.the court also described the potential for irreparable harm to plaintiffs in the form of unnecessary institutionalization and unmet mental health needs,if the injunction were not issued.
the court denied defendants motions for clarification and reconsideration,but subsequently issued an addendum to the order,which contained short answers to defendants questions from their motion for clarification.the addendum also contained appendices appendices a and b listing the components of wraparound and tfc for purposes of compliance with the order.
ii.the medicaid framework and the epsdt obligation 
medicaid is a cooperative program that directs federal funding to states to assist them in providing medical assistance to individuals.states choose whether to participate in medicaid.once a state enters the program,the state must comply with the medicaid act and its implementing regulations.alexander choate,d see generally et.california has chosen to participate in medicaid.
to participate in medicaid,a state must submit and have approved by the secretary of health and human resources a state plan for medical assistance.the medicaid act requires that each state plan provide for making medical assistance available,including at least the care and services listed in paragraphs through,and of section a of this title,to all individuals listed under certain statutory provisions.a.e arly and periodic screening,diagnostic,and treatment services for individuals who are eligible under the plan and are under the age of are among the mandatory categories of medical assistance.a b 
thus,california,like all other states participating in medicaid,is required to provide epsdt care to eligible children under the age of epsdt services are defined in r.the epsdt services at issue in this case,wraparound and tfc,are claimed to fall under subsection r as s uch other necessary health care,diagnostic services,treatment,and other measures described in subsection a of this section to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services,whether or not such services are covered under the state plan.r.
under r,states must cover every type of health care or service necessary for epsdt corrective or ameliorative purposes that is allowable under a.ex rel.dickson hood,cir citing collins hamilton,cir pediatric specialty care.dep t of human,cir pittman sec y.dep t of health,cir pereira kozlowski,cir although states have the option of not providing certain optional services listed in a to other populations,they must provide all of the services listed in a to eligible children when such services are found to be medically necessary.section a contains a list of categories of care or services these categories are fairly general,including descriptions such as inpatient hospital services and private duty nursing services.a.
the epsdt obligation is thus extremely broad.the federal agency charged with administering the medicaid act,the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms,has described epsdt as a comprehensive child health program of prevention and treatment.cms,dep t of health human,pub,state medicaid manual b hereinafter state medicaid manual

discussion 
i.the district court factual findings 
defendants argue that the district court clearly erred in a number of its findings of fact.we review a district court factual findings for clear error,and this court will not reverse if the district court findings are plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety even if it is convinced it would have found differently.husain olympic airways,cir,aff,d.
first,defendants argue that the court erred in stating that defendants do not dispute that currently they are not providing these forms of assistance wraparound and tfc,as such,to members of the plaintiff class.however,defendants immediately follow this contention with this statement wraparound services and therapeutic foster care are not services as such and are therefore not covered as such under the program.emphasis added.this statement coincides almost exactly with the district court description of defendants position.it is therefore difficult to see how defendants can argue that the court finding was clearly erroneous,while essentially reiterating that finding as their position in their next sentence 
defendants also argue that the court overlooked or several of their legal arguments whether they disputed plaintiffs categorization of which statutory provisions encompass the components of wraparound and tfc,and the nature of their contentions regarding the coverage of a.the district court characterizations of the parties legal arguments,however,are not factual findings because we do not rely on or defer to them,we need not review them for clear error 
defendants further argue that the court erred in finding that other states fund wraparound and tfc programs under medicaid.the district court cited those states practices as support for its conclusion that wraparound and tfc are services.evidence in the record supports the court findings,and defendants have not presented any strong evidence to the contrary.for example,evidence that some states programs use blended funding is not inconsistent with the fact that such programs use medicaid funding.nor did defendants point to any specific evidence that other states are only able to fund wraparound and tfc through waivers allowing them to offer services not otherwise covered by medicaid.
ii.the mandatory preliminary injunction 
defendants contend that the district court failed to apply the appropriate legal standard for issuance of a mandatory preliminary injunction.we disagree.first,the district court correctly described the applicable test for the granting of a preliminary injunction,see rodde,at describing test,as well as the heightened standard that applies to mandatory injunctive relief,see stanley,at stating that,when issuing a mandatory preliminary injunction,the court must find that the facts and law clearly favor plaintiffs.
second,in concluding that plaintiffs were entitled to a mandatory preliminary injunction,the district court correctly applied these tests.the court found that plaintiffs had a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their medicaid act claims.it also discussed the possibility that plaintiffs would face unnecessary institutionalization without the preliminary injunction,recognized that such harms were grave,and rejected defendants arguments that plaintiffs failed to show that they faced irreparable harm.it is evident that the court concluded that plaintiffs faced the potential for irreparable injury without the injunction.this is sufficient to meet the general requirement of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury for preliminary injunctive relief.rodde,at.the court finding of a strong likelihood that plaintiffs would succeed on the merits of their claims also evidences a conclusion that the law and facts clearly favor plaintiffs,meeting the requirement for issuance of a mandatory preliminary injunction.stanley,at.
defendants also argue that the district court did not make any explicit findings showing that it considered the federalism principles that require federal courts to grant each state the widest latitude in the dispatch of its own internal affairs and to find a threat of immediate and irreparable harm before enjoining a state agency operations.see rizzo,at.gomez vernon,cir de la vina,cir.the district court,however,did describe plaintiffs vulnerability,complex needs,and ongoing unmet mental health needs and the harms of unnecessary institutionalization.that description suffices to show that the court found a threat of immediate and irreparable harm to plaintiffs.as for the deference accorded to state agencies in their internal affairs,the court appropriately allowed defendants an opportunity jointly to develop the remedial plan needed to implement the injunction.no further deference was required the order itself required only that defendants supply the services that the court found to be required under federal law.it did not mandate detailed or burdensome procedures for compliance.see clark,at.
iii.the medicaid act 
the district court determination that the epsdt provisions of the medicaid act require the state to provide wraparound and tfc was the foundation for its ruling that plaintiffs have a strong likelihood of success on the merits.whether the district court correctly interpreted the epsdt provisions of the medicaid act is a question of statutory interpretation that we review de novo.bay area addiction research treatment,city of antioch,cir.
defendants contend that the district court erred in determining that the epsdt provisions of the medicaid act require the state to provide wraparound and tfc.they argue that,even assuming all the components are covered under a,federal law does not require the state to offer the components as a bundle of services.they also dispute the court conclusion that all the component services included within wraparound and tfc fall under a.
we conclude that the district court applied an erroneous legal standard in concluding that the epsdt provisions require the state to provide wraparound and tfc.the district court mistakenly assumed that if all the components of wraparound and tfc fall within categories listed in a,and that wraparound and tfc can be deemed health care services in themselves,then the package of components must be offered in the form of wraparound or tfc.this assumption was flawed,for reasons that we explain below.
in general,the epsdt provisions require only that the individual services listed in a be provided,without specifying that they be provided in any particular form 
a.the district court approach 
the district court first determined that wraparound and tfc are mental health services,rather than simply processes,approaches,or philosophies.the court then noted that a service may fall under one of the categories of a without being expressly listed as one of those categories.relying on plaintiffs breakdown of wraparound and tfc into component services,and their listing of specific provisions of a which would cover each component,the court concluded that each component likely falls under one or more of the a categories listed by plaintiffs.for example,the court found that one component of wraparound,engagement of the child and family,likely falls under a as case management.after stating that all the components of both wraparound and tfc would fall under the state epsdt obligations,the court concluded that,as a result,wraparound and tfc are themselves within the state epsdt obligations.
the court did not explore the possibility that the state might only have an obligation to fund the component services of wraparound and tfc,rather than to offer the coordinated complex of services in a single package.this is clear from the way that the court addressed whether the state was violating its epsdt is to say that the court did not address the question beyond stating that defendants did not dispute that they were not providing wraparound and tfc as such to members of the plaintiff class.
but defendants had stated in their opposition to plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction that already covers the services that plaintiffs are entitled to under medicaid and that plaintiffs were seeking a bundled rate.there was also evidence in the record that medical currently reimburses providers for at least some components of wraparound and tfc.therefore,the court should have examined whether all required component services under a were already being supplied.if all mandated services under a are being supplied effectively,the state is not obliged to go further and package the services as wraparound and tfc.
b.the epsdt provisions require that a specified set of health services be provided in an effective manner to eligible children 
as stated above,under the epsdt provisions,states have an obligation to cover every type of health care or service necessary for epsdt corrective or ameliorative purposes that is allowable under a.the states also have an obligation to see that the services are provided when screening reveals that they are medically necessary for a child.this obligation is created by a c,which states that a state plan must provide for arranging,directly or through referral,necessary corrective treatment under the epsdt obligation.see a c clark richman,d,state obligations with respect to epsdt services require more proactive steps,such as actual provision of services chisholm hood,d,states are further obligated to actively arrange for corrective treatment under a c salazar dist.of columbia,finding that district of columbia failure to ensure that children receive diagnosis and treatment for health problems detected during screening violated a c state medicaid manual states must d esign and employ methods to assure that children receive treatment for all conditions identified as a result of examination or diagnosis.even if a state delegates the responsibility to provide treatment to other entities such as local agencies or managed care organizations,the ultimate responsibility to ensure treatment remains with the state.see,john menke,d,state can not disclaim responsibility for the ultimate provision of services by a provider.
states also must ensure that the epsdt services provided are reasonably effective.thus,the state medicaid manual states at several points that epsdt services must be sufficient to achieve their purpose.see state medicaid manual services provided under epsdt must be sufficient in amount,duration,or scope to reasonably achieve their purpose.id.while allows states to establish the amount,duration and scope of services provided under the epsdt benefit services must be sufficient to achieve their purpose within the context of serving the needs of individuals under age.other statutory provisions and regulations under the medicaid act reinforce this obligation.see,a stating that all medical assistance,including epsdt,must be furnished with reasonable promptness b providing that state must make available a variety of qualified providers willing to provide epsdt.
federal courts have scrutinized state medicaid systems to be sure that those systems are adequately designed to provide epsdt services.see,chisholm hood chisholm ii,d,stating that in not allowing psychologists directly to enroll as medicaid providers and not providing alternative avenues of care,system foreclosed access to necessary psychological services for children john,d at,finding that the structure of the tennessee medicaid managed care system makes it impossible to fully comply with federal mandates including epsdt.
c.as long as a state provides all epsdt services in an effective manner,the medicaid statute does not dictate that services must be bundled 
while the states must live up to their obligations to provide all epsdt services,the statute and regulations afford them discretion as to how to do so.there is nothing in the epsdt statutory provisions or regulations that indicates that the state must generally design its medicaid system to fund packages of epsdt services the legislative history of the epsdt provisions simply indicates a congressional purpose to provide a broad program of health care to poor children,one that would include all the forms of care listed in a 
in a number of cases,courts have held that particular types of health services must be provided to children under a state epsdt obligations.those cases,however,did not require a state to fund distinct services covered under separate categories of a as a single package of services.see ex rel.dickson,at incontinence underwear falls under a as home health care services collins,at care at psychiatric residential treatment facility falls under a as inpatient psychiatric hospital services pediatric specialty care,at early intervention day treatment services fall under a as other diagnostic,screening,preventive,and rehabilitative services chisholm ii,d at behavioral and psychological services for the autistic fall under both a as any other type of remedial care recognized under state law and a as other preventive,and rehabilitative services.
the issue of whether the state must provide bundled epsdt services was raised in a recent case quite similar to this one in massachusetts,in which a class of children with serious emotional disturbances claimed a right under the epsdt provisions to intensive services,which would have included components falling under various categories of a.the district court avoided ruling on the question of whether epsdt required the state to provide intensive services to the children.instead it looked behind the phrase to the array of actual clinical interventions that constitute,in the terms of the medicaid statute,medically necessary services for class members.rosie romney,d,on that basis,the court concluded that comprehensive assessment of the children clinical needs,ongoing case management and monitoring,and adequate behavioral support services were each required epsdt services which the state had failed to provide.id.at.we believe that that analytic approach was correct,insofar as it required the state to supply the substantive epsdt services described in a without curtailing the state administrative discretion as to how to do so.
the conclusion that as a general rule,states may fund or provide medically necessary epsdt services as separate components is consistent with the overall structure and principles of the medicaid program.medicaid is a cooperative program.wilder.hosp.ass n,d.while the states must meet the substantive obligations of the medicaid act,they nonetheless retain the discretion to design and administer their medicaid systems as they wish.frew hawkins,d noting that consent decree at issue represented one choice among various ways that a state could implement the medicaid act to comply with the general epsdt statute john,d at the state has discretion with respect to the provision of epsdt services,so long as the plan complies satisfactorily with federal law.citing chisholm i chisholm i,d at exactly how and in what fashion the state provides epsdt services is left up to the state,as long as the state plan to provide epsdt services complies satisfactorily with the requirements of federal law.citing mitchell johnston,cir see also blumer,at.stating that the leeway for state choices urged by both wisconsin and the united states is characteristic of medicaid alaska dep t of health soc.
