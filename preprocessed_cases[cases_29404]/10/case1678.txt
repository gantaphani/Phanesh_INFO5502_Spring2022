factual background and procedural history 
i.the underlying class action 
on november,class counsel filed a class action suit against allstate on behalf of all current and former claims adjusters,seeking overtime pay and related penalties under the california labor code sekly allstate insurance company,los angeles county superior court case no.the sekly action.after several years of litigation,the parties in the sekly action agreed to a class action settlement totaling million.as a senior claims adjuster for allstate,martorana was a member of the class and was entitled to receive approximately as his portion of the settlement provided that he submit a timely claim form.
on september,the trial court in the sekly action granted preliminary approval of the settlement.in so doing,the court approved the parties proposed settlement notice,which the claims administrator was required to send,along with a claim form and a request for exclusion form,to each class member at his or her last known address by first class mail.the settlement notice provided that class members had days in which to submit claim forms or exclusion requests,and days in which to file and serve written objections.any claim submitted by december,was to be deemed timely,and any claim submitted between december,and february,could be approved for payment in the discretion of a referee selected by the parties.however,any claim submitted after february,was to be rejected as untimely regardless of the reason for the late filing.on november,following a fairness hearing,the trial court in the sekly action granted final approval of the class action settlement,finding that the settlement was fair and adequate and the result of arms length negotiations between the parties.
in accordance with the settlement agreement,the claims administrator mailed the settlement notice to all class members,including martorana.martorana does not allege that he failed to receive the settlement notice,or the accompanying claim form,within the claim filing period.rather,he alleges that he did not submit a claim form until some time after february,because he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and was experiencing the physical effects of his diagnosis and treatment.because martorana did not timely submit a claim,he did not receive any portion of the sekly action settlement.
ii.the negligence and malpractice action 
on october,martorana filed the instant action against allstate and class counsel.his original complaint alleged a negligence claim against both allstate and class counsel and a legal malpractice claim solely against class counsel.in his original complaint,martorana asserted that allstate and class counsel owed a duty to the class as a whole to establish a settlement notice procedure whereby class members who had not responded to the notice would be contacted prior to the claim filing deadline to ascertain the reason why they had not submitted a timely claim form.martorana further asserted that class counsel owed a duty to martorana individually to take reasonable steps to contact him about his failure to file a claim and to make sure that his claim form was timely submitted.
allstate and class counsel demurred to martorana original complaint.in its demurrer,which was both filed and served on february,allstate also sought monetary sanctions against martorana and his attorney pursuant to section.in support of the request for sanctions,allstate attorney,andrew paley paley,submitted a declaration attaching his prior correspondence with martorana counsel.in a january,letter to martorana attorney,paley stated that the action against allstate was frivolous because allstate owed no duty of care and that allstate would seek sanctions against both martorana and his counsel under section unless they dismissed the complaint with prejudice.on january,martorana attorney responded via email,summarily rejecting allstate request for a dismissal.
on march,the trial court sustained allstate demurrer to the original complaint without leave to amend and granted its request for sanctions in the amount of.in awarding sanctions against both martorana and his attorney,the trial court noted that the complaint against allstate,who had been an adverse party in the prior class action,was so completely devoid of merit that the court finds it was filed to harass,annoy,or vex allstate.the trial court also sustained class counsel demurrers to the original complaint,but granted martorana leave to amend the cause of action for legal malpractice.the court rejected class counsel argument that judicial approval of a class action settlement automatically absolved attorneys for the class of any malpractice liability.the court reasoned that class counsel conceivably could be liable if they had an active role in martorana failure to timely file a claim.because it was unclear to what extent counsel may have been responsible,if at all,for martorana failure,the court concluded that martorana must allege more facts on this issue.
on april,martorana filed a first amended complaint,asserting a single cause of action against class counsel for legal malpractice.in his amended complaint,martorana alleged that class counsel owed him a duty of care because they knew he was a class member and how to contact him,knew that he had not responded to the settlement notice by filing either a claim form or an exclusion request,and knew that his overtime claim against allstate would be released if he did not timely submit a response.martorana further alleged that class counsel breached its duty by failing to negotiate a procedural mechanism in the settlement agreement whereby class counsel would be notified before the claim filing deadline as to which class members had not yet responded,and failing to contact martorana directly about his need to timely file a claim form.martorana also asserted that he would have submitted a claim form before the filing deadline had he been contacted by class counsel and made aware of the need to do so.
class counsel also demurred to martorana first amended complaint,and on may,the trial court heard the demurrers.after oral argument by counsel,martorana sought leave to address the court directly,which was granted.martorana advised the court that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer around the time that the settlement notices were sent and that he had been distraught by the diagnosis.martorana also stated that he did pay the close attention that he should have,and that his failure to timely submit a claim form was a clerical error and inadvertence.
on may,the trial court sustained class counsel demurrers without leave to amend.the court concluded that class counsel owed martorana a duty of care because there was an relationship between the parties,but that class counsel did not breach their duty.with respect to class counsel role in crafting the settlement agreement,the court stated that the settlement notice procedure had been judicially approved and complied with due process,and thus,the allegation that class counsel drafted the procedures,without more,can not form the basis of a breach of the duty.with the respect to class counsel failure to contact martorana to make sure he submitted a claim form,the court noted that there was no allegation that class counsel knew that martorana could not timely file a claim due to his illness and failed to help him.the court further found that it would defeat the purpose of mass notification to a large number of class members if,after written notice,class counsel were required to follow up with every class member who neglected to file a timely claim.absent an allegation that class counsel played a role in plaintiff failure to submit a timely claim,the fac must fail.the trial court thereafter entered a judgment of dismissal as to all respondents.
on july,martorana filed a timely notice of appeal.in his appeal,martorana challenges the trial court order sustaining class counsel demurrers to his first amended complaint,and the order granting allstate request for monetary sanctions.

in this case,the parties do not dispute that class counsel owed a duty of care to the class as a whole to represent all class members in the sekly action with such skill,prudence,and diligence as attorneys of ordinary skill and capacity commonly possess and exercise in the performance of their tasks.janik rudy,exelrod zieff th,d janik see also owners for fair franchising southland th,d class counsel has duty to adequately represent the class as a whole cal pak delivery,united parcel service,th,d relationship between class counsel and class members is created by certification of the class.the issue before this court is whether martorana can state a cause of action against class counsel for a breach of that duty of care based on the allegations in the first amended complaint.martorana contends that he has pleaded an actionable malpractice claim under two possible theories.first,he asserts that class counsel can be liable for failing to negotiate a settlement notice procedure whereby counsel would be notified before the claim filing deadline as to which class members had not yet responded,so that they could then contact those members to determine why they had not filed claims.second,martorana claims that class counsel can be liable for failing to contact him specifically once counsel knew or should have known that he had not submitted a timely claim form.as set forth below,however,we conclude that martorana has failed to state a cause of action under either theory.
failure to negotiate a different settlement notice procedure 
martorana first theory of liability fails because he is collaterally estopped from arguing that class counsel breached their duty of care to the class by failing to negotiate a different settlement notice procedure than that approved by the trial court in the sekly action.the doctrine of collateral estoppel provides that a party to an action,or one in privity with a party,is barred from subsequently relitigating issues actually litigated and finally decided in a prior proceeding.united states golf arroyo software th,d.traditionally,collateral estoppel has been found to bar relitigation of an issue decided at a previous proceeding if the issue necessarily decided at the previous proceeding is identical to the one which is sought to be relitigated the previous proceeding resulted in a final judgment on the merits and the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party or in privity with a party at the prior proceeding.citations.people carter cal th,d.apart from these threshold requirements,a court must consider the public policies underlying the collateral estoppel doctrine to determine if the facts of the case merit its application.lucido superior court cal d.
in asserting that class counsel should have negotiated a different settlement notice procedure,martorana is attempting to challenge the notice procedure in the sekly action,and thus,to relitigate an issue that was actually decided in the prior class action proceeding.before the trial court in the sekly action could grant final approval of the settlement,it was required to review the settlement notice to class members for compliance with due process.phillips petroleum shutts,d.this included evaluating the content of the notice to ensure,among other things,that it was reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.citations.id.at.however,provided that the settlement notice satisfied due process,the trial court had broad discretion to determine the specific form and content of the notice and to decide whether notice by first class mail,without any further follow up by class counsel,was legally sufficient.indeed,a trial court in a class action has virtually complete discretion as to the manner of giving notice to class members.citation.owners for fair franchising southland,supra,th at,d see also wershba apple computer th,d trial court has broad discretion in approving class action notice.
when the trial court granted final approval of the settlement in the sekly action,it necessarily found that the notice procedure agreed upon by the parties complied with the requirements of due process and that the settlement itself was fair,adequate,and reasonable.to the extent that martorana had any objection to either the settlement or the notice procedure,he had an opportunity to file a written objection with the trial court and to appear at the fairness hearing.while martorana asserts on appeal that he was unaware that a final approval hearing was to be held,he never
