kwesi jones,on behalf of himself and others similarly situated collectively plaintiffs,filed a class action complaint against farmers insurance exchange farmers alleging wage and hour violations.plaintiffs appeal the denial of their motion for class certification and the striking of their amended class certification motion.they contend the trial court erred in concluding that common issues of law or fact do not predominate over individual issues,that class certification would not provide substantial benefits to litigants and the courts,and that jones can not adequately represent the class.
we conclude that common issues do predominate and class certification would provide substantial benefits to litigants and the courts.we also conclude that substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that jones can not adequately represent the class,and plaintiffs have shown no prejudicial error in the striking of their amended class certification motion.we therefore will reverse the order denying the class certification motion and remand with directions to allow plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint naming a suitable class representative,and grant the motion for class certification if the court approves a class representative.we also will affirm the order striking plaintiffs amended class certification motion.
factual and procedural background 
factual background 
farmers employs claims representatives to adjust insurance claims for physical damage to automobiles.auto physical damage apd claims representatives spend most of their time in the field inspecting damaged vehicles at auto body shops or other locations,meeting with claimants,negotiating the settlement of claims,and accessing and entering information onto farmers database using laptop computers.they obtain their assignments using a computer program known as servicepower,which they access using laptop computers.claims representatives travel to their first assignment of the day from their homes rather than from an office,and their travel time to their first assignment is uncompensated unless it exceeds their normal travel time.
farmers issued a personalized memorandum with the subject line work profile to each apd claims representative shortly after the servicepower program was first implemented in.the memorandum stated the normal work hours for each claims representative and stated that each claims representative was required to be present at the location of his or her first assignment at the beginning of the workday.it stated that driving time from the employee home to the first assignment of the day and from the last assignment of the day back home was not compensable unless the time exceeded the employee normal commute time or the employee,with the approval of a supervisor,was performing compensable administrative work at home.
the work profile memorandum also stated that claims representatives might be required to perform work tasks at home for which they would not be compensated.it described compensable and noncompensable work tasks as follows 
computer sync time which ordinarily takes minimal time to perform and is not compensable.for example,taking a few minutes to sync your computer,obtaining directions before getting in your car and driving to your first appointment.your work day does not begin until you arrive at your first assignment,unless your commute was longer than their normal commute.
administrative,which is defined as principle work and is compensable.for example,you take minutes to perform required administrative duties,with supervisor approval before getting in your car and driving to your first assignment.because the administrative work is considered principle work you will be compensated for this time,plus all drive time to your first assignment.the same would be true for the drive home if administrative work needs to be completed at home to end the day.
jones worked for farmers as a claims representative from march until september,when farmers discharged him for an alleged pattern of reporting that he was working in the field when he was actually at home.jones filed a complaint against farmers regarding his discharge.that action has been settled and dismissed.
trial court proceedings 
plaintiffs filed their complaint against farmers in the present action in april and filed a first amended complaint in may alleging that farmers failed to compensate its apd claims representatives for work performed before the beginning of their scheduled shifts.plaintiffs allege that such unpaid work includes starting up their computer each day,accessing the servicepower program,obtaining their first assignment,downloading property damage estimate forms,contacting auto body shops to confirm the location of damaged vehicles,contacting the insured,and driving to the auto body shop or other location of their first assignment.
plaintiffs allege counts for unpaid overtime failure to provide itemized wage statements failure to pay minimum wages civil penalties under labor code section and unfair competition.they seek damages,statutory penalties and restitution.each count is alleged both by jones individually and on behalf of a class of current or former farmers employees who are not exempt from california overtime laws and who worked as apd claims representative and used the servicepower program to obtain their work assignments.
plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification in march seeking to certify the same class described in the complaint the motion was supported by the declarations of putative class members.the declarants stated,generally,that they were required to perform various tasks in the morning before arriving at the location of their first assignment,as alleged in the complaint,but were not compensated for the time spent performing those tasks.they stated that their work shifts generally began upon their arrival at the location of their first assignment or at and that they spent,on average,hours per week performing unpaid work before the beginning of their shifts.plaintiffs argued that farmers had a policy of requiring apd claims representatives to work at home without compensation and that the work profile memorandum was evidence of this policy.
farmers filed an ex parte application to continue the hearing on the motion to august.the trial court granted the application on march,continuing the hearing to august.plaintiffs filed an amended class certification motion in may seeking to modify the class definition to include all of the previously described employees who used either servicepower or the pathways program to obtain their work assignments.the court continued the hearing on the class certification motion to october.
farmers opposed the class certification motion arguing that it had no uniform policy requiring unpaid preshift work and,absent such a policy,individual issues predominated and class treatment was inappropriate.farmers argued that its claims representatives were not required to work and were prohibited from doing so,and argued that the work profile memorandum did not show otherwise.it also argued that jones was not an adequate class representative and that his claims were not typical of those of the class.
farmers filed declarations by current or former apd field claims supervisors or managers,five claims representatives,and the director of the los angeles claims service division.the declarations stated,generally,that claims representatives regularly received their first assignment of the day on the afternoon of the previous workday and made initial contact with the claimant at that time.they stated that if the claims representatives needed additional time to prepare for an early morning appointment,they requested and regularly received approval to work overtime and that they were prohibited from working outside of their scheduled shifts without prior authorization.
farmers filed a motion in september to strike plaintiffs amended motion for class certification.it argued that the amended motion was an attempt to amend the complaint to expand the class definition without filing a motion for leave to amend the complaint.it argued that the motion therefore was procedurally improper and should be stricken under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a as irrelevant,false,or improper ibid.matter.farmers also argued that its employees did not obtain assignments through the pathways program and that farmers would be prejudiced by an expansion of the class definition after two years of litigation.plaintiffs opposed the motion to strike.
the trial court heard the class certification motion and the motion to strike on october.in a minute order filed on november,the court concluded that the class was sufficiently numerous and ascertainable and that jones claims were typical of those of the class.the court found,however,that jones was not an adequate class representative because he failed to file a declaration in support of the motion and therefore failed to show that he understood his fiduciary obligation owed to the class,and he was terminated for manipulating service power to indicate that he was working when,in fact he was not,showing a lack of credibility.
the trial court also found that common issues did not predominate.it stated that the parties disputed what tasks were required to be performed before the beginning of the shift,that farmers evidence showed that it did not always deny requests for overtime to complete some tasks and that plaintiffs therefore had not demonstrated that defendant has a classwide policy of refusing to pay overtime.the court stated,whether a particular class member would be approved for overtime to complete first contact tasks creates individualized questions that must be addressed before it can be determined that defendant did not compensate the class member for work.
the trial court stated further that whether the putative class members had time to complete the required tasks before the first appointment of the day also involved individualized inquiries and numerous variables including,when a particular assignment was posted to service power how busy the class member was on the day the assignment was posted whether the amount of time spent on first assignment tasks was de minimus whether the class member requested overtime to perform first contact tasks the first appointment time assigned to a class member as compared to the start of their shift and commute time.it stated that these individualized inquiries compelled the conclusion that common questions did not predominate.the court also stated that the lack of commonality meant that a class action was not a superior method for resolving the dispute.
the trial court stated with respect to the motion to strike the amended motion for class certification that code of civil procedure section was inapplicable because the motion was not a pleading.the court concluded,however,that there was no legal basis for the proposed amendment because the addition of employees who used the pathways program was outside the scope of the pleadings.the court therefore granted the motion to strike.
plaintiffs timely appealed the order denying the motion for class certification and the striking of their amended class certification motion 
contentions 
plaintiffs contend common issues of law and fact predominate,primarily with respect to the existence of a uniform policy denying compensation for legally compensable work performed prior to the beginning of the shift a class action is a superior means to conduct this litigation jones is an adequate class representative and the striking of their amended class certification motion was error.
discussion 
class certification requirements 
a party moving for class certification must show a sufficiently numerous,ascertainable class,a community of interest,and that certification will provide substantial benefits to litigants and the courts,that proceeding as a class is superior to other methods.citations.in turn,the community of interest requirement embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.citation.fireside bank superior court cal th,d,fireside bank.
the certification question is essentially a procedural one that does not ask whether an action is legally or factually meritorious.citation.a trial court ruling on a certification motion determines whether the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.citations.sav on drug stores,superior court cal th,d,sav on.the focus in a certification dispute is on whether common or individual questions are likely to arise in the action,rather than on the merits of the case.id.at,d.
the california supreme court in brinker restaurant superior court cal th,d,brinker stated the ultimate question the element of predominance presents is whether the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.citations.the answer hinges on whether the theory of recovery advanced by the proponents of certification is,as an analytical matter,likely to prove amenable to class treatment.citation.a court must examine the allegations of the complaint and supporting declarations citation and consider whether the legal and factual issues they present are such that their resolution in a single class proceeding would be both desirable and feasible.as a general rule if the defendant liability can be determined by facts common to all members of the class,a class will be certified even if the members must individually prove their damages.citations.id.at,d.
sav on,supra,cal th at pages,d,similarly stated we long ago recognized that each class member might be required ultimately to justify an individual claim does not necessarily preclude maintenance of a class action.citation.predominance is a comparative concept,and the necessity for class members to individually establish eligibility and damages does not mean individual fact questions predominate.citations.individual issues do not render class certification inappropriate so long as such issues may effectively be managed.citations.nor is it a bar to certification that individual class members may ultimately need to itemize their damages.we have recognized that the need for individualized proof of damages is not per se an obstacle to class treatment citations.
standard of review 
we review an order granting or denying class certification for abuse of discretion.sav on,supra,cal th at,d.a trial court is afforded great discretion in ruling on class certification.such a ruling generally will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is not supported by substantial evidence,based on improper criteria,or based on erroneous legal assumptions.fireside bank,supra,cal th at,d.
under this standard,an order based upon improper criteria or incorrect assumptions calls for reversal even though there may be substantial evidence to support the court order.citations.accordingly,we must examine the trial court reasons for denying class certification.any valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.citation.linder thrifty oil cal th,d.in other words,we must reverse an order on class certification if the trial court engaged in an incorrect legal analysis,even though there may be substantial evidence to support the order.weinstat dentsply,th,d.
predominance is a factual question accordingly,the trial court finding that common issues predominate generally is reviewed for substantial evidence.citation.we must presum e in favor of the order the existence of every fact the trial court could reasonably deduce from the record citation.brinker,supra,cal th at,d.
