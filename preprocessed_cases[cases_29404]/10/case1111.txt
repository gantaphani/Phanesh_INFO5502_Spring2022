in this appeal,we address whether defendants appellants defendants properly removed a plaintiff action from state court to federal court under the class action fairness act of cafa,stat.we also consider whether plaintiffs appellees plaintiffs are misjoined under federal rule of civil procedure a.we answer both questions in the affirmative.accordingly,we reverse the order of the district court,and remand with instructions to dismiss without prejudice the claims of all plaintiffs but the first named plaintiff,carla visendi.
factual and procedural background 
on august,named plaintiffs sued financial institutions in the sacramento county superior court.plaintiffs alleged,among other things,that the institutions deceptive mortgage lending and securitization practices decreased the value of their homes,impaired their credit scores,and compromised their privacy.they asserted eight state law causes of action rescission,fraudulent concealment,intentional and negligent misrepresentation,invasion of privacy,and violation of california civil code,and.
on september,bank of america corporation and bank of america,together,bank of america removed this case to the united states district court for the eastern district of california.relying on cafa,bank of america argued that this action was a removable mass action because it was a civil action in which monetary relief claims of or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs claims involve common questions of law or fact d b i.
after removal,plaintiffs obtained leave from the district court to file a first amended complaint the first amended complaint added and dropped multiple parties,resulting in a total of named plaintiffs asserting claims against defendants.further,plaintiffs abandoned their original causes of action and asserted three new claims invalid assignment,mistake,and negligence.in the first amended complaint,plaintiffs alleged that defendants engaged in deceptive and unscrupulous mortgage lending and securitization practices,and that bank of america mismanaged their applications for loan modifications.as was true of the allegations in the original complaint,the named plaintiffs resided in or owned many unrelated properties throughout the country,and obtained loans from many different financial institutions.
defendants moved to dismiss the first amended complaint,asserting misjoinder and failure to state a claim.plaintiffs opposed the motion,arguing that defendants waived their right to contest joinder when they removed the case to federal court under cafa.plaintiffs argued in the alternative that the district court should remand this case to state court because jurisdiction is doubtful.
on october,the district court directed defendants to explain to the court what common question of law or fact existed when the case was removed from state court pursuant to cafa,and why,according to defendants,there is no longer a common question of law or fact such that the parties are now improperly joined under rule.
by memorandum and order dated december,the district court remanded this case to state court,and denied defendants motion to dismiss as moot.according to the district court,defendants conceded that this action was not removable when they argued that it did not present common questions of law or fact under rule a.concluding that the case did not present such common questions,the district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction under cafa.

discussion 
applicability of cafa 
congress passed cafa primarily to curb perceived abuses of the class action device which,in the view of cafa proponents,had often been used to litigate or even national class actions in state courts.united steel,at quoting tanoh dow chem,cir.in furtherance of this objective,cafa wrought several changes to the judicial code,including amending the federal diversity statute,d,and liberalizing the requirements governing removal from state court.westwood apex contreras,cir.cafa also covers more than traditional class actions by providing for removal of mass actions.united steel,at citing tanoh,at.this appeal concerns such a mass action.
subject to certain other requirements,cafa confers jurisdiction on federal courts over civil actions in which monetary relief claims of or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs claims involve common questions of law or fact d b i emphasis added.because more than named plaintiffs proposed a joint trial here,and because cafa other prerequisites were satisfied,this action was properly removed.
proposal for a joint trial 
plaintiffs acknowledge that their initial complaint proposed a joint trial in state court.nevertheless,the district court concluded that because plaintiffs claims did not present common questions of law or fact,defendants removal under the cafa mass action provision was improper.because defendants filed a motion to dismiss for misjoinder,the district court accused them of gamesmanship and bad faith.
the district court misinterpreted cafa.in construing the provisions of a statute,our inquiry begins with the statutory text,and ends there as well if the text is unambiguous.in re hp inkjet printer,cir quoting satterfield simon schuster,cir.cafa text is unambiguous in this respect.b y its plain language,cafa mass action provisions apply only to civil actions in which monetary relief claims of or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly.tanoh,at quoting d b i emphasis added.because plaintiffs proposed a joint trial in state court,defendants properly removed this case.
whether plaintiffs claims ultimately proceed to a joint trial is irrelevant.it is well settled that developments do not defeat jurisdiction if jurisdiction was properly invoked as of the time of filing.united steel,at.when,for example,a defendant properly remove s a putative class action at the,a district court subsequent denial of rule class certification does not divest the court of jurisdiction,and it should not remand the case to state court.id.at.similarly here,the district court conclusion that plaintiffs claims were improperly joined does not affect the court jurisdiction,because at the time of removal plaintiffs proposed ajoint trial.the district court conclusion to the contrary was erroneous 
our recent decision in romo teva pharmaceuticals usa,wl cir,does not suggest otherwise.in romo,we held that plaintiffs did not propose a joint trial when they moved to coordinate several cases,each with fewer than plaintiffs,for pretrial purposes.id.at.in so holding,we reaffirmed that plaintiffs are the masters of their complaint,and do not propose a joint trial simply by structuring their complaints so as to avoid the one threshold.id.citing tanoh,at.
here,unlike in romo,plaintiffs filed a single complaint that named well over plaintiffs.on its face,the complaint provides that plaintiffs,and each of them,demand a jury trial plaintiffs further alleged that they were victims of a common plan and scheme,and they specifically sought damages in excess of each,the specific amount to be determined at trial.accordingly,plaintiffs initial complaint presented monetary relief claims of or more persons proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs claims involve common questions of law or fact d b i.
numerosity 
this action also satisfies cafa numerosity requirement.to be a removable mass action,a action must involve claims of or more persons d b i.because the initial co
