purchasers of possibly defective dvd players communicated with the seller,expressing their discontent and relating their identifying information names,addresses.we consider here the extent to which california right to privacy provision cal,art.i,protects these purchasers from having their identifying information disclosed to the plaintiff during civil discovery proceedings in a consumers rights class action against the seller.the named plaintiff in the action assertedly needs this information from the seller to facilitate communication with potential class members.we focus on the requisite notice and opportunity to assert a privacy right that should accompany a precertification communication to members of the putative class before such disclosure may occur.
the court of appeal ruled that trial courts in such cases must assure not only that all prospective or potential class members receive actual notice of their right to grant or withhold consent to the release of their personal identifying information,but also that such consent must be exhibited by each potential class member own positive act of agreeing to disclosure,rather than by the mere passive failure to object.because this ruling is overprotective of the purchasers privacy rights,inconsistent with established privacy principles,and likely to cause adverse consequences in future cases,we will reverse.
the following uncontradicted facts were taken largely from the court of appeal opinion in this case.patrick olmstead purchased a dvd player from pioneer electronics usa,pioneer.claiming it was defective,he brought suit against pioneer on his own behalf and on behalf of a putative class of persons who purchased the same model of allegedly defective dvd player.responding to a discovery request by olmstead see code civ,pioneer produced redacted documents relating to complaints it received from approximately to consumers regarding the dvd players.olmstead,seeking further identifying information about these persons,moved to compel pioneer to provide unredacted copies of any consumer complaints it had received about the allegedly defective dvd players.the motion also asked pioneer to disclose the names and contact information addresses and telephone numbers of each complainant.pioneer refused to comply,citing the state privacy provision cal,art.i,and asserting a right of privacy on behalf of these persons.
at a march hearing,the trial court acknowledged that disclosure of the information sought was indeed affected by the privacy provision,stating that the names are probably protected unless there a colonial life letter that goes out.the court was referring to this court decision in colonial life accident ins.superior court cal d,upholding a trial court order allowing disclosure by an insurer of the names and addresses of certain previously insured claimants to plaintiff in a bad faith settlement action,if those earlier claimants specifically authorized disclosure by signing and dating an enclosed form so stating.the court in the present case ordered pioneer to write a colonial life letter and then reveal the names of those consumers who do not object.
the court decision was refined in an order drafted later that month.in it,the court stated that it is in receipt of two versions of a colonial life letter to customers and that t he major difference is whether or not an affirmative response should be required.in order for the letter to have any meaning,it should require an affirmative response,as did the letter in the colonial life case.the court then authorized the following text 
dear consumer in august,litigation was filed in california in which the plaintiff alleges that pioneer dvd players are not compatible with the dvd video standard and as such,are incapable of playing all dvd discs.as part of the litigation,pioneer was required to provide the plaintiff counsel with a copy of the record that it made of information or complaints you provided some time ago when you contacted pioneer customer service department about your pioneer dvd player.before doing so,however,pioneer removed all identifying information regarding your name,address and telephone number.the court has now directed that pioneer send you this notice so that you can decide whether to authorize pioneer to disclose your personal information to the plaintiff counsel so they may contact you.
if you agree to the disclosure of this information to the plaintiff counsel,please check the box on the enclosed form and return it to the address shown on the form.not responding to this letter will be treated as declining contact from plaintiff counsel.italics added.in other words,the trial court initial order,as refined above,contemplated that disclosure of the identifying information would be improper in the absence of an affirmative response by the pioneer customer affected.plaintiff olmstead,believing this order too restrictive,moved for reconsideration and clarification.in april,the court vacated its march order and adopted plaintiff new proposed language for the letter to pioneer customers.
this new letter stated that,if you do not agree to the disclosure of this information to the plaintiff counsel,please check the box on the enclosed form and return it to the address shown on the form.not responding to this letter will be treated as agreeing to contact by plaintiff counsel.italics added.the effect of these changes was to state that customer identifying information would be released unless the addressed consumer objected.as the trial court stated,i t seems to me that this information,just the names,addresses and contact information is not particularly sensitive.it not medical information.it not personal finances.it merely the name,and if the people do want to be contacted,they can say so.
the trial court stayed its april order pending writ review by the court of appeal,which granted pioneer petition for writ of mandate,and issued the writ vacating the trial court order.we will reverse.
ii.discussion 
does a complaining purchaser possess a right to privacy protecting him or her from unsolicited contact by a class action plaintiff seeking relief from the vendor to whom the purchaser complaint was sent as noted,in the order now under review,the trial court ordered defendant pioneer to inform the approximately to complaining pioneer customers,by letter,about the lawsuit,plaintiff olmstead request for identifying information in order to contact them,and their right to object to release of that information.the letter also would have informed them that their failure to respond would be treated as consent to release of the information.
pioneer argues,and the court of appeal held,that the court should have gone further and ordered that pioneer make no such disclosure of the identifying information to plaintiff without the affirmative consent of pioneer former customers.as noted,the court of appeal concluded that protecting disclosure of an individual name and other identifying information is a matter embraced within the state constitution privacy provision cal,art.i,that adequate steps to assure actual notice is a prerequisite to an assumed waiver of a customer right of privacy,and that the measures ordered in this case were inadequate.as will appear,we believe that under the circumstances in this case,the trial court order was sufficient and involved no serious breach of privacy.
initially,we note that we are dealing with a proposed precertification notice to prospective class members.although the consumers legal remedies act,et expressly authorizes postcertification notices in class actions see,subds.d e,no comparable provision exists for precertification notices.in atari,superior court d,the court found no persuasive objection to use of this kind of precertification communication by plaintiffs to potential class members where,as here,the trial court has been given the opportunity in advance to assure itself that there is no specific impropriety.id.at.see also,howard gunty profit sharing plan superior court th,d parris superior court th,d.
court of appeal decision 
the court of appeal in this case assumed that pioneer former customers had a constitutional privacy right to object to pioneer disclosing their identifying information to plaintiff olmstead,and further ruled that without an affirmative letter of consent,no waiver of that right would occur.the court of appeal reasoned,a consumer can not be deemed to have intended to waive his or her right of privacy unless and until the consumer has notice of the need and opportunity to assert it.here,the challenged order does not adequately assure that the consumer will receive actual notice.absent notice,the consumer is unaware of the need to assert his or her privacy interest and is thereby deprived of a meaningful opportunity to do so.absent an affirmative response from the consumer,there is no adequate basis to infer that the consumer has consented to the release of personal information.we shall order,on remand,that the trial court fashion an order that provides reasonable assurance that the consumers receive actual notice of the right to grant or withhold consent to release of personal information,and that such information not be released as to any consumer unless that consumer affirmatively agrees to such release.
on the other hand,plaintiff olmstead reasons that consumers who initially contacted pioneer to express dissatisfaction with its product have a reduced expectation of privacy or confidentiality in the contact information they freely offered to pioneer for the purpose,presumably,of allowing further communication regarding their complaints.plaintiff contends that,after balancing all the interests involved,the trial court order requiring notice to pioneer customers and giving them the opportunity to object to transmission of their identifying information adequately protected their privacy interests.as will appear,we agree.
in reaching its decision,the court of appeal relied in part on ballot arguments leading to the adoption of the privacy provision of the state constitution in.these arguments explained that the right of privacy could be defined as the right to be left alone,and observed that the right to be left alone is a fundamental and compelling interest it prevents government and business interests from collecting and stockpiling unnecessary information about us and from misusing information gathered for one purpose in order to serve other purposes or to embarrass us.ballot,proposed stats.and amends.to cal.const.with arguments to voters,argument in favor of,see hill colorado,d privacy right to be free in one home from unwanted communication see also hill national collegiate athletic hill cal th,d,dis.opn.of mosk.
the court of appeal also cited the information practices act of,et,an act that contains legislative findings that a the right to privacy is being threatened by the indiscriminate collection,maintenance,and dissemination of personal information and the lack of effective laws and legal remedies b the increasing use of computers and other sophisticated information technology has greatly magnified the potential risk to individual privacy that can occur from the maintenance of personal information and c in order to protect the privacy of individuals,it is necessary that the maintenance and dissemination of personal information be subject to strict limits.
the court of appeal relied in part on a case upholding the right of householders not to receive advertising and solicitations by mail rowan post office,d,but that case held that a householder may circumscribe the right of a mailer to communicate with him by an affirmative act of giving notice that he wishes no further mailings from that mailer.id.at.see planned parenthood golden gate superior court th,d,disclosure of names,addresses,and telephone numbers of association members for contact purposes implicates privacy interest in sanctity of home.in other words,in rowan the supposed privacy infringement would continue unless the householder requested otherwise.this is consistent with the trial court order in the present case,which required the consumer to notify pioneer of his or her objection to disclosure.
as the court of appeal observed,pioneer,as custodian of the relevant documents,has standing to assert the privacy interests of its customers in the identifying information they gave to pioneer.see valley bank of nevada superior court cal d,valley bank.but valley bank also supports the trial court order here,placing the burden of making a privacy objection on the customer.
in that case,a bank sued the real parties in interest for the balance due on a promissory note.real parties asserted a fraud defense and sought discovery of certain banking records of various bank customers.the bank requested a protective order on behalf of these known individuals and entities.code civ,subd.b.the trial court ordered disclosure of the information subject to limitations as to time and particular financial transactions.valley bank,supra,cal d at.
we pointed out in valley bank that,unlike the or privilege,there is no privilege,and that under existing law,when bank customer information is sought,the bank has no obligation to notify the customer of the proceedings,and disclosure freely takes place unless the bank chooses to protect the customer interests and elects to seek a protective order on his behalf.valley bank,supra,cal d at.nonetheless,we concluded the state privacy provision extends to one confidential financial affairs as well as to the details of one personal life id.at,and we stated that a bank customer reasonable expectation is that,absent compulsion by legal process,the matters he reveals to the bank will be utilized by the bank only for internal banking purposes.id.at,quoting burrows superior court cal d.
to protect a bank customer privacy rights,we employed a balancing test,s triking a balance between the competing considerations,before confidential customer information may be disclosed in the course of civil discovery proceedings,the bank must take reasonable steps to notify its customer of the pendency and nature of the proceedings and to afford the customer a fair opportunity to assert his or her interests by objecting to disclosure,by seeking an appropriate protective order,or by instituting other legal proceedings to limit the scope or nature of the matters sought to be discovered.valley bank,supra,cal d at,italics added see also olympic club superior court d.applying valley bank approach to associational privacy interests.
thus,although valley bank acknowledged the bank obligation to notify bank customers of their option to seek legal relief before the bank released confidential customer information,we did not require the bank to obtain an affirmative consent from those customers before allowing such information to be released.the court of appeal below deemed the valley bank approach inadequate when applied to a mass mailing to persons whose identities are not known by the party seeking discovery.the proposed mailing in this case would be to some to consumers.unless reasonable measures are taken to assure actual notice to these consumers,they will not be afforded a reasonable opportunity to object.
the court of appeal thus preferred an approach which would place the burden on the discovery proponent to obtain written authorization from each person whose privacy was to be invaded.in support,the court cited colonial life accident ins.superior court,supra,cal d,which allowed disclosure to plaintiff in a bad faith insurance action of the names and addresses of third parties filing similar claims against that insurer only if those parties specifically authorized the release of such information by signing and dating an enclosed form that so stated.the colonial life approach,however,was mandated by the express provisions of the insurance information and privacy protection act,et,preventing an insurer from disclosing personal information obtained about a person during an insurance transaction without the person written authorization.
the court of appeal in the present case opined that because no ongoing business relationship existed between pioneer and its complaining dvd player customers,it was unlikely they could be expected to open a letter from pioneer
