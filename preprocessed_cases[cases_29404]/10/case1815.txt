this is a class action in which the class was conditionally certified,subject to responses to questionnaires approved by the court and sent to the tentatively certified class.some potential members did not respond at all,others provided inadequate responses,and all of those people were dismissed from this action.meanwhile,the named plaintiffs and those who did respond to the questionnaires proceeded to trial,established liability,and are now in the midst of the damages phase of their bifurcated trial.at the same time,the named plaintiffs,purportedly acting on behalf of the dismissed class members,have appealed from the dismissal orders.there are two ways to view the dismissal orders pertaining to class certification,or as discovery sanction orders.if they are class certification orders,the named plaintiffs have standing to appeal but the orders are not appealable if the dismissals are discovery sanctions,the orders are appealable but the named plaintiffs have no standing.because we view all of the dismissal orders as part and parcel of the certification process,we conclude the named plaintiffs have standing to appeal but the orders are not appealable.we therefore dismiss these consolidated appeals as premature.
anthony estrada,a former driver for rps,sued rps for alleged unfair business practices bus,et,behalf of himself and all persons who worked as contractors for rps under the terms of the company and delivery contractor operating agreement that rps unlawfully classified its and delivery drivers as independent contractors rather than employees and,as a result,failed to reimburse them for expenses estrada sought reimbursement,restitution,an accounting,and injunctive and declaratory relief.
in november,the trial court commissioner bruce mitchell tentatively and conditionally granted estrada motion for class certification,but further briefing and several hearings occurred before the class was defined and the notice to class members approved.
in may,the class was tentatively defined to include contractors who actually drove a truck in a single service area during the class period.when rps explained that it had a list of contractors but no records confirming which contractors actually drove a truck as opposed to those who hired others to drive,class counsel proposed that notice be sent to an admittedly group of contractors who worked a single service area during the class period.the court accepted that approach,subject to the use of a questionnaire or other discovery mechanism to determine the identity of the contractors who also drove.
in july,the court added an additional the contractors drove excluding time off for vacations and illness.in response to rps request for a more specific definition of,the court reiterated its ruling that this certification is going to be conditional,that discovery would be used to winnow out contractors who were not full time drivers,and that rps could move to decertify the class or dismiss those who did not qualify.on august,using rps list of contractors who worked a single service area during the class period,class counsel while admitting this group would be overly inclusive,and conceding there would have to be some winnowing by the use of a questionnaire insisted the list would provide a reasonably accurate rough cut list of class members.
on august,the trial court certified estrada labor code reimbursement claim for class treatment,finding there were common issues whether class members were rps employees,and whether various expenses were necessarily incurred,and that class certification was not rendered inappropriate simply because each class member would ultimately have to prove the amount of his or her own expenses.
on the same day the class was certified,the trial court signed and filed the notice to be given to the plaintiff class of pendency of class action and exclusion rights.the notice included the class definition as stated in the certification order fn,ante and then advised the potential class members of their three choices if they wanted to protect their legal rights 
a.you may do nothing if you do nothing,you will automatically be included in the class action.you will not be entitled to bring a separate lawsuit and you will be bound by the final judgment in this class action whether favorable or unfavorable.if judgment is entered in favor of the plaintiff class and reimbursement ordered,you will be entitled to share in the proceeds of that judgment less attorneys fees and costs as explained elsewhere in the notice.you will be represented by the attorneys representing the class.you will be asked to document any expenses for which you claim reimbursement.california law prohibits retaliation by an employer against any person who participates in or assists in these kinds of lawsuits.
b.you may hire your own attorney you may retain your own lawyer at your own expense and seek to intervene in the action as a named plaintiff to assert your own claims.
c.you may opt out of the class action if you do not want to participate in this class action,you may opt out of the class.if you opt out,you will not be bound by the judgment in this lawsuit,and you will keep,to the extent allowed by law,whatever claims you may have against rps its successors.to opt out,you must sign the request for exclusion from class form that is enclosed with this notice and return it to a stated address no later than a specified date.italics added.
rps gave class counsel a list of the contractors names,addresses,telephone numbers,and social security numbers and class counsel sent the approved notice to everyone on that list plus some additional contractors included on a supplemental list provided by rps.after the period expired,the trial court accepted a certified list of about class members.
because of the undefined qualifier,the parties were unable to agree on a final class list and procedures for further class management,and rps sought approval of a proposed questionnaire to be sent to the class members to determine how often each contractor hired others to drive as opposed to driving personally,and to inquire and request documents about the amount of each contractor actual expenses.at a hearing held in february,the trial court divided the proposed questions into two sets,questionnaire one and questionnaire two.although class counsel did not acquiesce in the decision to send the questionnaires,they were active participants in drafting and refining the questions into a more format as the trial court described the ultimate questions.everyone understood the questionnaires were,in substance if not form,interrogatories.
during march,april and may,class counsel sent to all class members.a cover letter from class counsel explained the questionnaire this way
