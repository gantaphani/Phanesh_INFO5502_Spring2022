allstate appeals from the district court grant of class certification to jack jimenez and about other allstate employees in california who allege that allstate has a practice or unofficial policy of requiring its claims adjusters to work unpaid overtime in violation of california law.we have jurisdiction under e,and we affirm.
allstate has local offices in california,which are individually managed but under centralized leadership at those offices,allstate employs five categories of claims adjusters auto,liability determination,casualty,property,and a special investigation unit.some adjusters spend most of their work day in a particular office inside adjusters,while others,although they are officially assigned to a particular office,spend most of their time in the field outside adjusters.the amount and type of work,as well as the level and quality of claims adjusters interaction with managers,varies between offices,between categories of adjusters,and between inside and outside adjusters.
in,allstate shifted all of its claims adjusters to hourly status from exempt,or salaried,positions.before that reclassification,claims adjusters often worked more than hours per day or hours per week.since the reclassification,claims adjusters workload has been substantially the same as it was before the reclassification,their compensation is still referred to as an annual salary,and hourly payment rates are not shared with current or prospective employees.
claims adjusters do not keep time records.rather,the manager of each local office has the power to file a timekeeping exception or deviation from the default expectation of hours per day and hours per week.this adjustment takes place when a claims adjuster request for overtime or early leave is approved.managers do not adjust time cards based on either their own observations of work habits or on the technological records contained in computer and telephone systems.each local office has a compensation budget,which creates a functional limit on the amount of overtime a manager may approve.
jimenez filed a class action suit alleging that allstate had not paid overtime to current and former claims adjusters in violation of california labor code and and had not paid adjusters for missed meal breaks in violation of california labor code and a.the complaint also made derivative claims that allstate had not timely paid wages upon termination in violation of california labor code and,had issued noncompliant wage statements in violation of california labor code a,and had engaged in unfair competition in violation of california business and professions code.
the district court certified the class with respect to the unpaid overtime,timely payment,and unfair competition claims it found that jimenez had presented sufficient evidence to establish the following common questions under federal rule of civil procedure a 
i whether class members generally worked overtime without receiving compensation as a result of defendant unofficial policy of discouraging reporting of such overtime,defendant failure to reduce class members workload after the reclassification,and defendant policy of treating their pay as salaries for which overtime was an exception ii whether defendant knew or should have known that class members did so and iii whether defendant stood idly by without compensating class members for such overtime.
under rule b,the district court held that the common question of whether allstate had an unofficial policy of denying overtime payments while requiring overtime work predominated over any individualized issues regarding the specific amount of damages a particular class member may be able to prove.finally,it held that class treatment was a superior method of adjudication because statistical sampling of class members could accurately and efficiently resolve the question of liability,while leaving the potentially difficult issue of individualized damage assessments for a later day.
we granted permission for an interlocutory appeal under federal rule of civil procedure f.see chamberlan ford motor,cir.allstate timely perfected its appeal,and this proceeding followed.
we review a district court class certification order for abuse of discretion.berger,at.a class certification order is an abuse of discretion if the district court applied an incorrect legal rule or if its application of the correct legal rule was based on a factual finding that was illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.leyva medline indus,cir quoting united states hinkson,cir en banc.
allstate raises two substantial legal challenges to the district court class certification order.first,it argues that the order does not comply with rule because the common questions it identified will not resolve liability issues.second,it argues that the district court approval of statistical modeling violates allstate due process rights and conflicts with wal mart stores,dukes.for the reasons given below,we affirm the ruling of the district court.
allstate first argument is that the district court class certification order misapplied rule a commonality requirement the supreme court has recently emphasized that commonality requires that the class members claims depend upon a common contention such that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each claim in one stroke.mazza am.honda motor,cir quoting dukes,at internal alteration omitted.these common questions may center on shared legal issues with divergent factual predicates or a common core of salient facts coupled with disparate legal remedies.hanlon chrysler,cir.we agree with the district court determination that the three common questions identified in this case have that capacity because of their close relationship with the three prongs of the underlying substantive legal test.
this analysis does not turn on the number of common questions,but on their relevance to the factual and legal issues at the core of the purported class claims.compare dukes.at we quite agree that for purposes of rule a,even a single common question will do.internal quotation marks omitted,wang chinese daily news,cir plaintiffs need not show that every question in the case,or even a preponderance of questions,is capable of classwide resolution,mazza,at c ommonality only requires a single significant question of law or fact,with dukes.at what matters to class certification is not the raising of common questions even in droves.quoting nagareda,class certification in the age of aggregate proof,alteration omitted.as dukes and all of our subsequent caselaw have made clear,a class meets rule a commonality requirement when the common questions it has raised are apt to drive the resolution of the litigation,no matter their number.abdullah,at quoting dukes.at.
whether a question will drive the resolution of the litigation necessarily depends on the nature of the underlying legal claims that the class members have raised.parsons ryan,cir commonality can not be determined without a precise understanding of the nature of the underlying claims.see also abdullah,at comparing a common question to the elements of california nature of the work standard in an employment classification class action.under california law,there are three elements of an claim of the type raised by the class here a plaintiff may establish liability for an claim by proving that he performed work for which he did not receive compensation that defendants knew or should have known that plaintiff did so but that the defendants stood idly by.adoma of phoenix,inc,internal quotation marks omitted.
each of the three common questions recognized by the district court will drive the answer to the plaintiffs claims on one of these three elements of their claim.first,the district court found that the plaintiffs arguments had raised the common question of whether the class had worked unpaid overtime as a result of defendant unofficial policy of discouraging reporting of such overtime,defendant failure to reduce class members workload after the reclassification,and defendant policy
