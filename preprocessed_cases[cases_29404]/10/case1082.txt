the hawaii attorney general filed complaints in state court against six credit card providers,alleging that each violated state law by deceptively marketing and improperly enrolling cardholders in credit card products.the card providers removed the cases to federal court,and the attorney general moved to remand.the district court concluded that the class action fairness act of cafa,d,did not afford a basis for federal jurisdiction.the court,however,found at least one of the attorney general claims against each provider completely preempted by section of the national bank act of.the court thus held that it had jurisdiction over the completely preempted claims under the federal question statute,and elected to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining claims under the supplemental jurisdiction statute.
we hold that neither the federal question statute nor cafa provides the district court with subject matter jurisdiction.we therefore reverse with instructions to remand the actions to state court.
background 
in april,the hawaii attorney general filed complaints in state court against six financial institutions jp morgan chase and chase bank usa,collectively,the chase defendants hsbc bank nevada,and hsbc card services,collectively,the hsbc defendants capital one bank usa,and capital one services,llc collectively,the capital one defendants discover financial services,discover bank,dfs services,and american bankers management company,collectively,the discover defendants bank of america corporation and fia card services,collectively,the bank of america defendants and citigroup,citibank,and department stores national bank collectively,the citigroup defendants.discover bank is a federally insured,bank the other defendant banks are nationally chartered.
the complaints,identical as relevant to this appeal,alleged that the defendants deceptively marketed and enrolled hawaii cardholders in various debt protection products.these products include payment protection plans,extended warranties for purchased items,identity theft protection plans,stolen card protection,credit score tracking,and payment warranties.
the complaints primarily targeted the payment protection plans.these plans suspend or cancel all or part of a cardholder obligation to repay an outstanding credit card balance,limit interest charges,or waive late fees upon a qualifying event,such as disability,death,or unemployment.a cardholder purchases a payment protection plan by paying the provider a percentage of the outstanding monthly card balance.
the complaints alleged that the providers enrolled cardholders in protection plans without their consent enrolled cardholders who do not qualify for protection plan benefits confused plan purchasers with deceptive marketing,contract language,and billing and targeted vulnerable populations,including subprime borrowers and the elderly.
the complaints asserted three state law causes of action.count i alleged that the credit card providers violated sections et of the hawaii revised statutes.although not limited to violations of the uniform deceptive trade practices act.ch,the complaints specifically averred that defendants engaged in deceptive trade practices forbidden by that statute.see.declaring unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.unlawful id.a,listing deceptive trade practices.count ii contended that the card providers violated section of the hawaii revised statutes,which imposes a penalty of up to for each deceptive act that is directed toward,targets,or injures an elderly person.count iii alleged unjust enrichment because hawaii consumers unknowingly pa id unauthorized or otherwise improper charges to defendants.
the complaints requested declaratory and injunctive relief,civil penalties,disgorgement,restitution,attorneys fees,interest,and other relief as provided by law.the actions were brought by the state of hawaii in its sovereign capacity on behalf of the state and its citizens,as authorized by sections d and of the hawaii revised statutes,and also under the state parens patriae authority.in each complaint,the attorney general explicitly disavowed that he filed a class action and disclaimed any such claims that would support removal on the basis of diversity,class action fairness act of d,federal question jurisdiction,or any other basis.
the defendants filed notices of removal in the district court,invoking,d,and as the bases for federal jurisdiction.the attorney general moved to remand each case.
the district court denied the motions to remand.the court first held that cafa did not afford it jurisdiction.the district court acknowledged that in order to recover damages on behalf of consumers,subsection b of the hawaii revised statues likely requires the attorney general to bring a class action hawaii ex rel.louie jp morgan chase,d.relying on washington chimei innolux,cir,however,the district judge held that cafa requires that a plaintiff actually invoke a class action rule or otherwise label the case a class action.louie,d at.because the complaints expressly disclaimed class status,invoking instead only common law parens patriae and section civil enforcement authority,the district court concluded that it lacked cafa jurisdiction.id.at.
but,the district court held that it had jurisdiction over at least one of the claims in each complaint under the complete preemption doctrine.the district court reasoned that by alleging the card providers had charged significant fees for minimal benefits and had increased profits by substantial sums,the attorney general implicitly challenged the rate of interest on outstanding credit card balances.id.at.because the national bank act completely preempts state laws regulating the interest rates charged by nationally chartered banks,beneficial bank anderson,the district court held that it had jurisdiction over at least some of the claims against the national defendants,and elected to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims.louie,d at.
the attorney general sought leave to file an interlocutory appeal pursuant to b,raising two questions do the fees charged for the payment protection plans and other ancillary services constitute interest under the national bank act can the attorney general allegations only be characterized as a usury claim challenging the rate or amount of interest the district court certified both questions,hawaii ex rel.louie jp morgan chase,d,we granted permission to appeal,and the attorney general timely perfected the appeal 
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo a district court denial of a motion to remand to state court for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction.chapman deutsche bank trust,cir per curiam.removal and subject matter jurisdiction statutes are strictly construed,and a defendant seeking removal has the burden to establish that removal is proper and any doubt is resolved against removability.luther countrywide home loans servicing lp,cir.
iii.complete preemption 
the general removal statute,a,grants district courts jurisdiction over state court actions that originally could have been brought in federal court.section provides district courts original jurisdiction over civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.
under the canonical complaint rule,a suit arises under federal law for purposes only when the plaintiff statement of his own cause of action shows that it is based upon federal law.vaden discover bank,alteration omitted quoting louisville nashville mottley.notwithstanding this rule,when a federal statute wholly displaces state law and provides the exclusive cause of action for a plaintiff requested relief,we must recharacterize a state law complaint as an action arising under federal law.metro.life ins.taylor.in such cases,federal law completely preempts the state law claims.franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust.
two provisions in the national bank act,completely preempt state law claims challenging interest rates charged by national banks.beneficial,at.section allows a national bank to impose interest at the rate authorized by the state in which the bank is located or at a rate of per centum in excess of the discount rate on commercial paper in effect at the federal reserve bank in the federal reserve district where the bank is located,whichever may be the greater.if a national bank knowingly charges a rate that exceeds this limit,section authorizes the borrower to recover double damages on the excess interest paid,and the lender forfeits any right to outstanding interest payments.
the attorney general first contends that in finding complete preemption,the district court erred by relying on declarations submitted by the card providers describing their payment protection plans we disagree.
federal courts typically may only look to the plaintiff complaint to determine federal question jurisdiction.see coleman estes express lines,cir.however,when a defendant asserts that a claim is completely preempted,examination of material is permitted.see aetna health davila,reading the complaint and various plan documents to determine if a claim was completely preempted schroeder trans world airlines,cir reviewing additional facts in the petition for removal to find a claim completely preempted,overruled on other grounds by moore thomas alaska airlines,cir.this makes doctrinal sense the complete preemption doctrine is an exception to the complaint rule.davila,at.
in any event,the supposed error was harmless the declarations restated facts already recited in the complaints.supermarket kizer,cir considering material is harmless if dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure b would be proper when reviewing the complaint alone.
the attorney general next argues that payment protection plan fees are not interest on a loan under,but rather charges for an independent service.this argument has somewhat more purchase.
the office of the comptroller of the currency occ has defined interest in as 
any payment compensating a creditor or prospective creditor for an extension of credit,making available of a line of credit,or any default or breach by a borrower of a condition upon which credit was extended.it includes,among other things,the following fees connected with credit extension or availability numerical periodic rates,late fees,not sufficient funds nsf fees charged when a borrower tenders payment on a debt with a check drawn on insufficient funds,overlimit fees,annual fees,cash advance fees,and membership fees.it does not ordinarily include appraisal fees,premiums and commissions attributable to insurance guaranteeing repayment of any extension of credit,finders fees,fees for document preparation or notarization,or fees incurred to obtain credit reports.
a.the supreme court approved this definition in smiley citibank south dakota,holding that the examples in a drew a reasonable distinction between a expenses that are assessed for simply making the loan,or for the borrower default,and b fees specifically assigned to services incidental to the loan,such as reimbursements for processing an application,premiums tied to loan insurance,and appraisal costs.
like the fifth circuit and the occ,we doubt that payment protection plan fees are interest.see hood ex rel.mississippi jp morgan chase,cir per curiam suggesting that payment protection plan fees are not interest debt cancellation contracts and debt suspension agreements,the occ regulations reflect the fact that national banks may set payment protection plan fees section of our rules authorizes national banks to establish charges and fees according to sound banking judgment and safe and sound banking principles.emphasis added quoting.but we leave this question for another day.even assuming that protection plan fees are interest,the complaints here did not allege that the card providers charged excessive interest rates.
for the complete preemption doctrine to apply,one of the attorney general state law claims must be governed by and.beneficial,at.the attorney general argues this is not the case here,because those sections only preempt claims that explicitly invoke a state usury law.
at first glance,this argument has some attraction.in beneficial national,the plaintiffs expressly charged that a national bank violated state usury laws.at.the supreme court held that and supersede both the substantive and the remedial provisions of state usury laws and create a federal remedy for overcharges that is exclusive,even when a state complainant,as here,relies entirely on state law.id.at.
but,on close analysis,the attorney general argument founders.section,without using the word usury,sets the rate of interest that a national bank may charge.section uses the word usurious to define a limitations period,but creates a right of action for plaintiffs charged a rate of interest greater than is allowed by section.congress enacted these provisions so that a national bank could charge its customers an interest rate on unpaid balances allowed by its home state,when that rate is greater than that permitted by the state of the bank nonresident customers.marquette bank of first of omaha serv.thus,when a plaintiff alleges that a national bank charged a rate of interest greater than is allowed,the claim falls within the scope of and,regardless of the state law term invoked.
that the plaintiffs in beneficial national happened to invoke expressly alabama usury statute does not mean that the national bank act only preempts complaints that cite a state usury law.federal courts are not bound by the labels that litigants attach to completely preempted claims.in davila,for example,plaintiffs attempted to evade complete preemption under section a of the employee retirement income security act erisa,a,by insisting that their actions sounded in tort.at.the supreme court declined the gambit,holding that distinguishing between and claims based on the particular label affixed to them would elevate form over substance and allow parties to evade the scope of erisa simply by relabeling their contract claims.id.at quoting allis chalmers lueck,see also dishman unum life ins.of,cir holding that claimants can not escape complete preemption by dressing up their claims.
we,therefore,must decide whether the complaints challenged the rate of interest that the card providers charged,regardless of the state law monikers affixed to the attorney general claims.we conclude that they did not.
counts i and ii alleged that the card providers violated sections d,and of the hawaii revised statutes,which govern business disclosure,contractual terms,and trade practices.none of these provisions proscribes the interest that a financial institution may charge.
nor did the third count the unjust enrichment claim challenge the card providers interest rates.this count merely alleged that hawaii residents unjustly enriched their card providers by unknowingly paying unauthorized or otherwise improper charges.indeed,the attorney general could not,under hawaii law,assert that the card providers unjustly charged excessive interest rates.see caraang pnc,d,holding that under hawaii law,express contracts preclude an unjust enrichment claim when plaintiffs alleged that banks charged excessive interest rates porter hu,a n action for unjust enrichment can not lie in the face of an express contract.
the monetary remedies requested for these violations civil penalties and restitution may well require the card providers to disgorge any financial gain from the fees.but if a plaintiff asserts a usury claim simply by virtue of requesting damages,the states settled authority to regulate national banks in areas such as contracts,debt collection,acquisition and transfer of property,and taxation,zoning,criminal,and tort law would be rendered meaningless.bank of am.city cnty.of,cir.
the defendants nevertheless insist that the complaints implied that hawaii consumers were charged excessive interest rates.they note the complaints alleged that card holders received virtually no benefit from the card providers debt protection products,that the providers purposefully marketed these products to make substantial sums of money,and that the providers charged fees.
read in context,however,these allegations are most consistent with a uniform deceptive trade prac
