in this class action for unpaid overtime,farmers insurance exchange fie has filed separate notices of appeal from a judgment awarding the plaintiffs class for unpaid overtime compensation,plus prejudgment interest of and from a series of postjudgment orders that inter alia adopted a plan of distribution and awarded common fund attorney fees and costs.we reverse the portion of the judgment for unpaid hours worked,and remand the order re plan of distribution.in all other respects the judgment and postjudgment orders are affirmed.
procedural background 
early procedural history 
the plaintiffs are former or current claims representatives working for fie in california who brought this action on behalf of themselves and other claims representatives employed in a similar capacity.their complaint filed october,and amended two months later alleges that fie followed the practice of refusing to pay overtime compensation to claims representatives on the ground that they were employed in an administrative capacity and therefore exempt from the overtime pay regulations of the california industrial welfare commission.the plaintiffs sought unpaid overtime compensation under labor code section for a period beginning on october,and continuing until trial,as well as injunctive relief to assure future compliance with state overtime regulations.
after extensive discovery,plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification supported by depositions of prospective class members and other evidence.granting the motion in an order filed may,the trial court found that the class was so numerous as to make it impracticable to join all members,there were questions of law and fact common to the class,plaintiffs were representative of the class,and a class action was superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.the order defined the class as consisting of claims representatives working for fie personal lines division in california during the relevant period,who were assigned to handle property,automobile physical damage,and liability claims.
fie sought review of the order certifying the class in an earlier appeal,which we dismissed as procedurally improper.
plaintiffs effectively sought an adjudication of fie liability in a motion for summary adjudication of the exempt or nonexempt status of the class members.in an order filed april,the trial court rejected fie claim that the claims representatives were employed in an exempt administrative capacity and ruled that the class was subject to the overtime regulations of the industrial welfare commission.the court found that claims adjusting was a product or service which fie operation exists to provide and that claims representatives devote their time to carrying out this as opposed to its administrative functions.
the trial court subsequently awarded the plaintiffs interim attorney fees on a finding that they had prevailed on liability issues.appealing from this award,fie challenged the adjudication of nonexempt status as a predicate for the attorney fee award and questioned the trial court statutory authority to award interim attorney fees.in our decision in bell farmers ins.exchange th,d hereafter bell ii,we upheld the trial court ruling that plaintiffs were nonexempt employees but reversed the interim award of attorney fees on separate statutory grounds.
contested class certification 
on september,approximately six months after the summary adjudication of nonexempt status,fie moved for an order granting declaratory judgment as requested by plaintiffs,decertifying the class and issuing an injunction requiring individual class members to commence administrative proceedings before the labor commissioner for a determination of individual damage claims.fie argued that damages could best be litigated on an individual basis in an administrative proceedings pursuant to labor code section.opposing the motion,plaintiffs relied in part on the rule that class decertification must be based on a showing of changed circumstances.the trial court denied the motion on this basis,finding no changed circumstances rendering class certification no longer proper.
fie next moved for the court to issue a second notice of pendency of action,both to employees who received the original notice mailed in july and those who were hired thereafter,which would give employees an opportunity to opt out of the class.the trial court ordered the notice,with a request for exclusion from the class,to be sent only to new employees who had not received the first notice.approximately percent of the class ultimately chose to opt out of the class action.
on may,less than a month before trial,fie moved again to decertify the class on the ground that the recently completed depositions of the statistical sample of class members revealed that percent of the class members did not claim unpaid overtime compensation.the trial court denied the motion on the ground that the inclusion of these employees in the class did not prejudice fie and judicial economy is served by denying the motion.
trial management rulings 
following the adjudication of the plaintiffs nonexempt status,the parties submitted to the court a series of proposals and counterproposals for management of the trial,which led to an initial ruling entered april,that set the context for later pretrial rulings.in status conference statements filed in,plaintiffs proposed to prove aggregate damages by statistical sampling.fie took the position that damages recoverable by each class member must be tried on an individual basis and announced an intention to take an initial depositions of an estimated individuals in the class.
by february,both parties were assisted by retained richard drogin and fie retained roy weinstein.plaintiffs submitted a proposed trial management plan for a scheduled hearing on april,supported by a declaration of richard drogin,which proposed statistical sampling to achieve a margin of error with a confidence interval of percent.he calculated that a sample of employees would be necessary to achieve this level of accuracy.in response,fie called for individual,but,if they were not allowed,it proposed a sampling plan based on the same percent confidence interval but designed to achieve a margin of error.its statistician,roy weinstein,calculated that a sample of employees would be required.
in reply,plaintiffs noted that the wide variation in estimated class size reflected different assumptions about the variability of the data.they proposed a plan.the parties would first conduct a pilot random sample of class members to refine their assumptions as to the variability of the data,and then seek rulings on the appropriate margin of error and the size of the employee sample.generally accepting this methodology,weinstein filed a supplemental declaration shortly before the hearing on april,that characterized the plaintiffs proposal as reasonable.at the hearing itself,the parties announced an agreement on the initial step of taking depositions of a randomly chosen sample of individuals.
the order following the hearing filed april,provided that t he trial would determine classwide aggregate damages by extrapolating from a representative sampling of class members.the order directed depositions of an initial pilot sample of randomly selected class members and appointed a special master to resolve any disputes concerning these depositions.the court directed a target date for completion of these depositions and asked for the submission of a joint report of their experts.the order further directed the parties to regularly following the depositions in an attempt to reach agreement on the number of weekly overtime hours worked the number of hours worked per week by each of the deposed class members.
both parties filed status conference statements for a hearing on august.plaintiffs proposed a margin of error of overtime hours per week and fie proposed a margin of error of hours per week.in a joint declaration submitted for the hearing,the experts,drogin and weinstein,announced that they had identified a range of sample sizes associated with different margins of error.a decision as to the appropriate margin of error for purposes of this litigation is left for the court discretion.the margins of error ranged from hour per week to two hours.thus,a margin of error of hours would call for a sample size of and a margin of error of hours would require a sample of.in either case,the results of the depositions in the pilot sample could be deducted from the total number of individuals examined.
the experts calculations were made possible by the parties success in reaching agreement on work calendars reflecting the deposition testimony regarding work patterns of the employees in the pilot sample.in addition,the parties agreed upon a method of determining an appropriate measure for overtime hours worked and calculated total overtime hours for each deponent.they then divided total overtime hours of all deponents by total weeks worked to arrive at an estimate of average weekly overtime hours worked.
at the august hearing,the trial court suggested that the parties consider a weekly margin of error,which,according to the experts joint declaration,would require a total of depositions.with the apparent agreement of the parties see,post,the court provisionally ordered additional depositions to be taken,with this number to be reviewed after completion of depositions.
later in the year,drogin and weinstein filed a second joint declaration stating that they had reviewed the results of an additional depositions one transcript was not available and calculated that a margin of error could be achieved with a sample size of only.relying on the declaration,the trial court ordered an additional depositions.
the parties ultimately exceeded this goal and deposed a total of individuals.remarkably,they reached agreement on work calendars reflecting the testimony of all deponents.see,post.the two experts both calculated that the average or mean weekly overtime recorded in the work calendars was hours per week and they calculated the margin of error to be hours per week,slightly better than originally contemplated.
fie nevertheless argued that the sample was subject to varying interpretations.these differences in interpretation between plaintiffs and fie framed the issues at trial.
in a brief jury trial,the plaintiffs presented only two expert witnesses,statistician richard drogin,and a certified public accountant,paul regan.fie relied on a single witness,statistician roy weinstein.
drogin recounted that,in early,he began working with fie expert,weinstein,to develop a random sample for a statistical estimate of average overtime.he related the process of developing agreed work calendars for a sample of employees and calculating overtime hours under california law.the parties reached virtually identical calculations of the total overtime hours in the sample,and the total number of weeks the deponents worked within the class of claims representatives.by simply dividing total overtime hours by total weeks,it could be calculated that the average weekly overtime was figure that included hours per week of work entitled to compensation.because the sample was representative of the population,drogin testified that it was statistically appropriate to extrapolate the average number of overtime hours to the entire class.the margin of error for this extrapolation was plus or minus of an hour per week,with a percent level of confidence 
regan testified that he secured fie payroll records for all class members for the period beginning october,and ending june.in a printout,he calculated overtime on a basis using the average overtime figure of hours per week and aggregated the individual calculations into a classwide total.he separately calculated unpaid overtime compensation reflecting of base salary,overtime on bonus pay,and overtime reflecting a rate of pay.the totals were,for overtime,for overtime on bonus pay,and for double time.when weinstein later offered a somewhat different interpretation of fie payroll records in his trial testimony,regan presented on rebuttal a revised calculation of for overtime on base salary,which gave effect to fie interpretation of its records.
through its expert witness,weinstein,fie presented a case for determining aggregate overtime on the basis of median weekly overtime of hours.weinstein offered two reasons for using the median figure rather than the mean which was used by drogin first,he maintained that the mean may be misleading when a sample includes extreme values,or outliers,deviating widely from other data.he stressed the variation in weekly overtime reported by the deponents,including employees who reported working an average of hours or more of overtime.secondly,he argued that the sample results were distorted upward by response bias.some claims representatives did not respond to deposition notices and subpoenas,forcing the parties to depose another group of randomly selected class members.he inferred that those who responded to the notices felt more positively about the plaintiffs claims than those who failed to respond and therefore the substitution affected the integrity of the original sample by introducing an upward bias.
the case was submitted to the jury on the afternoon of july.the next day,the jury unanimously returned a special verdict finding that unpaid overtime compensation owed to the class as a whole was and unpaid overtime compensation was.the former figure corresponded closely to regan revised calculation of overtime on base salary but excluded overtime on bonus pay the latter figure accepted regan calculation of unpaid compensation.
posttrial proceedings 
shortly after the jury verdict,plaintiffs proposed three options for a plan of distribution a distribution attributing the average weekly overtime hours to all employees and calculating individual payments solely on the basis of employment tenure and salary,a distribution preceded by the mailing of claim forms requiring class members to say if they claimed some damages or none,and a detailed claim form with an administrative procedure.plaintiffs argued that fie had no standing to intervene in the plan of distribution.for its part,fie called for the third option of an administrative procedure.
without directly ruling on fie right to object,the trial court stated at a hearing on august,that it would allow fie to comment on the plan of distribution as a matter of courtesy and directed the parties to meet and confer to resolve issues presented by the third option.in two later hearings,the plaintiffs developed a revised version of the third option reflecting fie written objections and arguments.
on september,the court entered an order adopting plaintiffs revised plan of distribution,subject to certain further modifications.the plan provided for the distribution of a damages fund consisting of the award for unpaid overtime,plus prejudgment interest less costs and fees payable to class counsel as a percentage of the common fund and service payments to the five named plaintiffs compensating them for their efforts in bringing the action.any statutory attorney fees and costs awarded under labor code section would be offset against attorney fees and costs payable from the common fund the court entrusted administration of the plan of distribution to a claims administrator and retained jurisdiction to oversee its administration.
the plan provided that payments to the employees in the random sample,as well as additional employees deposed during the damages phase of the litigation,would be based on their deposition testimony of overtime hours worked.other payments would be made only to those employees submitting forms with statements of average weekly overtime hours worked.the payments would be based on these statements of overtime worked,as well as the wages and tenure of the employees as class members.the information regarding employees wages and tenure would be drawn from the fie database and preprinted on the claim forms mailed to class members,who would be given an opportunity to challenge it.any unresolved disputes would be referred to a special master.
in the event claims should exceed the net damages fund,the claims administrator would distribute to each class member a percentage of the fund equivalent to that class member claim share as a proportion of all class members claim shares.if claims should be less than the net damages fund,the judgment gave fie a right to recover undistributed prejudgment interest but deferred a decision on any unpaid residue of the damages fund itself to a later proceeding under code of civil procedure section.
a judgment filed on september,adopted by reference the plan of distribution.two subsequent postjudgment orders addressed important aspects of the plan of distribution.first,on november,the court awarded to plaintiffs counsel attorney fees in the amount of percent of the total damages fund recovered for the class,consisting of back pay and interest,plus expenses in the sum of.secondly,on april,the court appointed a claims administrator and approved a claim form,with an accompanying background statement and claim form instruction.
the background statement accompanying the claim form explained that the employees were entitled to money under the terms of a judgment awarding damages for unpaid overtime compensation to claims representatives working for fie in california.the amount of the damage fund was determined by deposing a representative sample of employees regarding their overtime hours.the statement informed employees that the deposed employees worked an average of overtime hours per week and set forth in a chart the precise numbers of employees reporting at intervals between zero to hours of overtime,employees worked between and hours of overtime,between and hours.
the instructions gave precise directions on how to calculate overtime hours worked.the estimate of weekly overtime hours worked was to be based on the employee best recollection,but it need not be precise if the employee did not have precise records or recollections.by signing the claim form,the employee was declaring under penalty of perjury that the information provided was correct to the best of his or her knowledge.
discussion 
law of the case 
in its first assignment of error,fie urges that we reconsider our decision in the prior appeal in light of r ecent developments in federal law.as fie recognizes,the reconsideration of a prior appeal is ordinarily precluded by the doctrine.under this doctrine,the decision of an appellate court,stating a rule of law necessary to the decision of the case,conclusively establishes that rule and makes it determinative of the rights of the same parties in any subsequent retrial or appeal in the same case.citation.nally grace community church cal d,see also adams pacific bell directory th,d.the law of the case,however,is a procedural rule that is subject to certain exceptions.george arakelian farms,agricultural labor relations bd.cal d.
the principal ground for making an exception to the doctrine of law of the case is an intervening or contemporaneous change in the law.clemente state of california cal d.the exception is limited to changes in the controlling rules of law.salazar eastin cal th,d,italics added digenova state board of education cal d.as explained in gore bingaman cal d,the rule should never be made the instrument of injustice.thus,where the controlling rules of law have been altered or clarified in the interval between the first and second appeal and adherence to the previous decision would result in defeating a just cause,it has been held that the court will not hesitate to reconsider its prior determination.see also davidson superior court th,d building industry city of oceanside th,d.
fie predicates its claim of an intervening change in the controlling rules of law on an opinion letter of the administrator of the department of labor wage and hour division,two appellate court decisions and one district court decision arising from the ninth circuit bothell phase metrics,cir webster public school employees of washington cir palacio progressive ins.d,and two other federal district court decisions jastremski safeco ins.companies d schaefer indiana michigan power d.to assess the significance of these authorities,we must first review our prior decision.
in bell ii,we upheld the trial court summary adjudication that claims representatives working for fie personal lines division in california were not exempt from the overtime pay requirements of the industrial welfare commission wage order,codified in california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision a.our analysis proceeded in four steps.first,we construed the exemption as requiring an employer to prove both that an employee is employed in an administrative capacity and that the employee is engaged in work which is primarily intellectual,managerial,or creative,and which requires exercise of discretion and independent judgment.bell ii,supra,th,d.secondly,we concluded that federal authorities construing parallel provisions of the fair labor standards act of et.flsa were relevant to construing the exemption provision of wage order.bell ii,supra,at,d.thirdly,we found that a core concept appearing in the federal interpretative regulations and decisional worker a useful approach to determining whether an employee worked in an administrative capacity as required by the exemption provision of wage order.bell ii,supra,at,d.fourthly,we found that the evidence submitted on the motion for summary adjudication compelled the conclusion that the plaintiff employees were production workers within the meaning of the worker dichotomy and,on that ground,we held that they were not employed in an administrative capacity within the meaning of the exemption of title,section,subdivision a.bell ii,supra,at,d.
in this appeal,fie primarily directs its argument at the third and fourth parts of the opinion.the analysis in the third section of the opinion evolved from our prior conclusions that the industrial welfare commission iwc intended the term administrative capacity to have an independent meaning and that the parallel provisions of federal law could provide guidance in determining that intended meaning.we noted that federal interpretative regulations relating to the term administrative capacity could be grouped into those relating to the role of administrative employees in a business enterprise,the actual duties of the employees,and the employees level of remuneration.bell ii,supra,th,d.of these three approaches,it was the body of federal interpretative law dealing with the employee role in the business enterprise that served to give the term administrative capacity a meaning independent of other language in title,section,subdivision a.a central concept in this body of interpretative law is the worker dichotomy.
the worker dichotomy draws on code of federal regulations hereafter part,which defines the statutory phrase administrative capacity as referring to an employee whose primary duty consists of work directly related to management policies or general business operations of his employer see also a.as elucidated in part a,this language calls for a distinction between those types of activities relating to the administrative operations of a business as distinguished from production or,in a retail or service establishment,sales work.
this dichotomy suggested by part a has become a generally accepted framework of analysis in the decisional law construing the statutory term administrative capacity in the flsa.the cases distinguish between those employees whose primary duty is administering the business affairs of the enterprise from those whose primary duty is producing the commodity or commodities,whether goods or services,that the enterprise exists to produce and market.bell ii,supra,th,d,citing dalheim cir,fn.omitted.thus,in reich chicago title ins,the court examined the duties of the plaintiff escrow closers to determine whether they carry out chicago title operations as production workers or whether they administer the business affairs of the company as administrative workers.see bell ii,supra,at,d.
the fourth section of our opinion in bell ii reviewed the evidence concerning the work of claims representatives in the california branch claims offices of fie personal lines division.we concluded the undisputed evidence places the work of the claims representatives squarely on the production side of the worker dichotomy.the undisputed evidence establishes that claims adjusting is the sole mission of the branch claims offices where plaintiffs worked.the claims representatives are fully engaged in performing the activities of that important component of the business.bell ii,supra,th,d.
turning to the propriety of the summary adjudication,we noted that the worker dichotomy is a somewhat gross distinction that may not be dispositive in many cases.bell ii,supra,th,d.while federal interpretative regulations served to elucidate and qualify the distinction,there are no comparable interpretative regulations governing iwc work orders.accordingly,we stressed that california courts must use great caution in granting summary judgment or summary adjudication on the basis of such a broad distinction as the worker dichotomy,at,d.nevertheless,we found that the evidence in the record before us was sufficiently clear to justify the trial court summary adjudication.our opinion in bell ii was based on the restricted record before us and can not be read out of that context.
the record showed that the claims representatives processed a large number of small claims and,according to fie own characterization,their duties were restricted to the routine and unimportant.bell ii,supra,th,d.we concluded that these work activities place d plaintiffs in the sphere of rank and file production workers in this part of the fie business organization.bell ii,supra,at,d.our conclusion obviated the need to inquire whether the employees duties came within the criteria of subdivision a of wage order,that is,whether the plaintiffs are engaged in work which is primarily intellectual,managerial,or creative,and which requires exercise of discretion and independent judgment bell ii,supra,at,d.
we find nothing in webster public school employees of washington,supra,and bothell phase metrics,supra,that is inconsistent with our decision.the decisions both pursued the worker dichotomy as a generally accepted framework of analysis,but the factual situations in the two cases did not easily lend themselves to this customary analysis.
in webster,the plaintiff was a field representative for a public employees union.seeking to put himself on the production side of the dichotomy,he argued that he assisted in performing the primary service goal of the negotiation of collective bargaining units.the court observed that the purpose of the dichotomy is to clarify the meaning of work directly related to the management policies or general business operations as found in part.webster public school employees of washington,supra.the dichotomy would defeat the purpose of the administrative exemption if it were applied to work units carrying out management functions.following bratt county of los angeles cir,the court found that the plaintiff was an exempt administrative employee because his primary duty involved advising the bargaining units how to conduct their business.webster public school employees of washington,supra,at.
in bothell,the plaintiff was a field service engineer for one of his employer largest customers.he claimed to be a repairman his employer characterized him as an account executive.applying the worker dichotomy,the district court granted summary judgment on the ground that the job was ancillary to his employer main activities and therefore did not fall on the production side of the dichotomy.the appellate court observed that the dichotomy is useful only to the extent that it helps clarify the phrase work directly related to the management policies or general business operations.citation.bothell phase metrics,supra.but o nly when work falls squarely on the production side of the line,has the dichotomy been determinative.id.at,fn.omitted.remanding the case to the district court for trial,the court held that the plaintiff status called for a inquiry into the plaintiff work activities.id.at.
webster and bothell underscore our observations in bell ii that the worker dichotomy is a somewhat gross distinction that may not be dispositive in many cases.bell ii,supra,th,d.but the decisions do not draw into question our use of the dichotomy under the specific facts of the present case.the work at issue here falls squarely on the production side of the line bothell phase metrics,supra,it places the plaintiffs in a broad category of rank and file workers carrying out the service that an important component of the fie business organization exists to provide.
in palacio progressive ins,supra,d,the federal district court reached a result different from bell ii,but pursued the same mode of analysis and distinguished the facts of the case from those in bell ii.the plaintiff,a claims adjuster for an automobile insurance company,brought actions for unpaid overtime compensation under the flsa and wage order of the california industrial welfare commission.the court granted summary judgment for the employer under the flsa,but denied the motion for summary judgment under wage order,relying on the authority of bell ii.
in deciding the flsa claim for the employer,the court analyzed the case in terms of the worker dichotomy but found that plaintiff job came within the employer administrative operations as defined in part b the administrative operations of the business include the work performed by employees engaged in servicing a business as,for example,advising the management,negotiating,representing the company.
turning to the state claim,the court noted that,in applying the worker methodology,bell ii reached an opposite conclusion upon considering somewhat similar circumstances.palacio progressive ins,supra,d.but the court did not question the authority of bell ii under state law and observed that it presented distinguishable facts.in particular,claims handling in bell ii constituted the insurance company business id.at,d and the employer restricted the claims representatives to routine and unimportant duties.ibid.in the court view,the similarity and differences between the cases revealed a triable issue of fact under state law.
fie relies on another federal district court decision,schaefer indiana michigan power,supra,d,which has no factual similarity to the present case.the plaintiff was an environmental specialist at a nuclear power plant and was engaged in supervisory and work,analogous to the kind of work that bell ii expressly notes that plaintiffs did not perform.bell ii,supra,th,d.the schaefer holding that the plaintiff was an exempt employee is entirely consistent with bell ii.
lastly,fie cites jastremski safeco ins.companies,supra,d,a federal district court decision that is in fact irreconcilable with bell ii.the decision is notable chiefly because it relies on the opinion letter dated november,by the administrator of the wage and hour division of the department of labor hereafter dol opinion letter in denying the claim of an insurance adjuster for unpaid overtime under the flsa.
the dol opinion letter is based on a request by an association of insurance companies for an opinion confirming that insurance claims adjusters are exempt from the overtime requirements of the fair labor standards act and is premised on a description of the claims adjusters work provided by the insurance companies.the letter describes the adjusters as being primarily responsible for resolving a claim.they weigh the factual information and evaluate whether there is coverage for the claim under the policy.they have full authority to settle claims within their established authority,which ranges from a minimum of to more than.on claims above their personal limits,they make recommendations to supervisors,which are generally approved,pursue negotiations,and advise the company on whether to settle the claim or to pursue litigation.
the dol opinion letter concludes that the claims adjusters duties are administrative in nature on the basis of an analysis of part.it characterizes the adjusters as being engaged in servicing a business within the meaning of part b and states that the wage and hour division has long recognized that claims adjusters typically perform work that is administrative in nature.the opinion then proceeds to find that the adjusters work is of substantial importance to the company within the terms of part a.while the opinion notes that part a distinguishes the administrative operations of a business from production work,it does not mention the body of federal law applying the worker dichotomy derived from that provision and,in fact,it cites only one judicial progressive ins,supra,d.
the deference to be given to dol opinion letters is governed by christensen harris county,d,which follows an earlier decision,skidmore swift.distinguishing opinion letters from formal adjudication or rulemaking,the decision explains that interpretations contained in the letters lack the force of law,but are entitled to respect to the extent that those interpretations have the power to persuade christensen,supra,at,citation omitted.in a more complete statement of this point,the skidmore decision states the opinions do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.the weight of such a judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.skidmore,supra,at.
since dol opinion letters lack the force of law,they may be rejected categorically as a source of an intervening change of law under the doctrine.moreover,in our view,the dol opinion letter here does not offer persuasive reasons to reconsider our decision in bell ii first,the letter is based on distinguishable facts.the evidence in bell ii disclosed that the claims adjusters in the personal lines division were ordinarily occupied in the routine of processing a large number of small claims.bell ii,supra,th,d.with few exceptions,their settlement authority was set at or lower and often was or lower.id.at,d.for the most part,their work consisted of gathering facts,filling out appropriate forms,and communicating with policy holders and third party claimants about the indemnity value of the claim id.at,d.on matters of relatively greater importance,they acted as conduits of information to supervisors or as in conveying information to an attorney.id.at,d.
secondly,the persuasive power of the dol opinion letter is undermined by its failure to review the body of federal decisions applying the worker dichotomy derived from part a.in this respect,it appears to represent a departure from past opinion letters of the dol wage and hour division that have repeatedly employed this analysis the worker dichotomy,as bell ii notes,offers a common frame of reference for federal decisions in this area and has led to summary judgment for the employees in a line of decisions 
thirdly,the statement that the dol has long recognized the work of claims adjusters to be typically administrative in nature is overly simplified.in bell ii,we noted a dol report stating that the term claim agent may cover a great variety of employees.bell ii,supra,th,d,citation omitted.as indicated in part c,the job category includes exempt employees employed in the capacity of advisory specialists and consultants.but the duties of the claims representatives in bell ii closely resembled an inspector for an insurance company,listed as a nonexempt employee in part c.moreover,part lists insurance adjusters as an example of those nonexempt employees with irregular hours who may enter into contracts guaranteeing constant pay for varying workweeks under section f of the flsa.
much of the argumentation of fie and amici curiae seeks to demonstrate that our decision in bell ii was in error.these arguments can not easily be reconciled with the doctrine.our high court has stated that the doctrine demands that the court adhere to a principle or rule of law enunciated in an earlier appeal of the same case even though it may be clearly of the opinion that the former decision is erroneous in that particular.tally ganahl cal.but,stretching the limits of the exception to the doctrine,fie argues that the five recent federal decisions and the dol opinion letter provide further clarification of the applicable state law,revealing errors in our analysis,and that a reconsideration of the decision is required to avoid injustice to california employers.we think that we have adequately answered this argument by showing that the federal appellate decisions in webster and bothell,as well as the district court decision in schaefer,are entirely consistent with our analysis in bell ii.the palacio decision also is basically compatible with our opinion because it applies the same analytical methodology on distinguishable facts.fie arguments rest on the questionable relevance of the dol opinion letter to interpretation of wage order and on the single federal district court decision jastremski that has cited the dol opinion letter as authority 
nevertheless,we will reply to fie arguments on the merits.fie and amici curiae pursue four lines of argument the bell ii opinion treat s employees job duties as irrelevant,it causes relief to turn on fie organizational structure and the geographic location of the plaintiffs jobs,it misconstrues the product of an insurance company,and it fails to recognize the ancillary nature of the plaintiffs services.
the first argument is based on an apparent misreading of the opinion.in bell ii we held that wage order required proof both of employment in an administrative capacity and of job duties meeting certain criteria work which is primarily intellectual,managerial,or creative,and which requires exercise of discretion and independent judgment.concluding that plaintiffs were not employed in an administrative capacity,we did not reach the criteria relating to job duties in the second prong of the exemption or explore the corresponding body of federal interpretative law.we did not,however,treat the plaintiffs job duties as irrelevant.to the contrary,we examined the plaintiffs jobs using the expression duties,as well as equivalent terms such as activities,work,mission,and function,to describe the jobs in the context of the employer business.
the second argument similarly reflects a misunderstanding of the opinion.we see nothing in bell ii that would suggest it turn s on the happenstance of geographic structure.the decision engages in a review of the undisputed facts relevant to an adjudication of the plaintiffs administrative capacity.holding that plaintiffs were not employed in an administrative capacity,we carefully phrased our opinion in terms of these facts,that is,on an analysis of the peculiar nature of fie business and the claims representatives role in that business bell ii,supra,th,d.but the opinion does not assign to particular facts,such as those concerning corporate structure or the plaintiffs work location,a significance exceeding their actual relevance to the issue of administrative capacity.
indeed,the opinion never went beyond the strictly factual observation that the plaintiff claims representatives worked in branch offices,which performed none of the activities constituting the administrative or executive functions of the corporation.these activities were delegated to other corporate entities or performed elsewhere.the work performed by the plaintiff claims representatives in branch offices was devoted entirely to carrying out one important component of the was limited to the routine aspects of performing that function.we see nothing in our discussion of the undisputed facts to suggest that the determination of administrative capacity turns on the location or departmental organization of the place of employment.
the third argument is based on an abstract characterization of the product of an insurance company and deduces from this characterization that plaintiffs were not production workers.it is argued,for example,that the product of an insurance company is its policies,not claims adjusting,and therefore claims adjusters can not be production workers amici curiae construe the decision in reich john alden life ins.cir,as supporting their reasoning.but as we read the john alden decision,it explores the significance of a stipulation of facts we decline to follow two federal district court decisions that have relied on the john alden dicta to deny overtime claims.wilshin allstate ins.d,hogan allstate ins.d.
the relevant issue concerns the propriety of the worker dichotomy as an analytic tool.we recognized in bell ii that the dichotomy may lose its utility as it is applied to small or specialized segments of a business.bell ii,supra,th,d see also bothell phase metrics,supra.but the federal decisions applying the dichotomy to grant relief to particular employee groups do not tie its use to a global characterization of the employer business in bell ii,we found reich chicago title ins,supra,to be especially instructive.bell ii,supra,at,d.applying the dichotomy to grant summary judgment to escrow closers,the court observed that the employer status as a title insurer does not alter the fact that escrow closings are a very real product which it markets and sells separate from its overall title insurance operations.citation.id.at,d.we consider that,under the facts of the present case,the worker dichotomy may similarly be applied to the work of claims adjusting in an important component of fie business organization notwithstanding the existence of other business activities in the organization.id.at,d.
in a related argument,amici curiae argue that claims adjusting is ancillary to the business function of an insurance company and therefore administrative in nature.the argument relies on a short line of decisions stemming from a comment in martin cooper supply,supra.affirming a lower court finding that salespersons did not come within part b,administrative employees servicing a business,the court observed,servicing a business within the meaning of b denotes employment activity ancillary to an employer principal production activity it follows that inside salespersons do not service cooper business by making wholesale sales is cooper business.martin cooper supply,supra,at.in other words,the employees did not perform ancillary activities and hence did not come within this subcategory of administrative employees.
a later case,reich john alden life ins,supra,applied this language to the converse fact situation it found that the employees did perform an ancillary function and hence could be regarded as engaged in administrative servicing within the meaning of section b.reich john alden life ins,supra,at see also haywood north american van lines,cir.the federal district court decision in palacio progressive ins,supra,d,contains language that can be regarded as taking the concept of ancillary services still further to limit the application of the dichotomy in part a.palacio progressive ins,supra,at.
in bothell phase metrics,supra,the court recognized that the concept of ancillary services arises as a gloss on part b,though s ome cases do use the term ancillary as a description of administrative activities.like the bothell court,we think the concept of ancillary services should be confined to its original context as an explication of part b.with this limited reference,it has no bearing on our finding that the plaintiffs belong in the sphere of rank and file production workers.bell ii,supra,th,d.
amendment to wage order 
lastly,fie argues that the judgment should be set aside with respect to any damages or injunctive relief applying after the amendment of wage order on october.we note that fie never raised this argument in the trial court and therefore has waived any assignment of error on appeal.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.
we conclude that reconsideration of our decision in bell ii is precluded by the doctrine.fie has failed to show an intervening change in the controlling rules of law that would justify a departure from this procedural rule.
class certification 
legal background 
fie next contends that the trial court abused its discretion in initially certifying the class of claims representatives on may,and later denying the motions for decertification filed on september,and may.the contention requires us to briefly review the principles governing the certification of class actions in california.
the class action in california evolved from the equitable doctrine of virtual representation which rests upon considerations of necessity and paramount convenience,and was adopted to prevent a failure of justice.citations.daar yellow cab cal d.the only statutory authorization for the class action consists of a phrase at the end of a statute dealing with compulsory joinder.code of civil procedure section states and when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court,one or more may sue or defend for the benefit of all.reflecting a general support of class actions city of san jose superior court cal d,the california supreme court has urged trial courts to be procedurally innovative in determining whether to allow class suits,encouraging them to incorporate procedures from outside sources,in particular rule of the federal rules of civil procedure city of san jose superior court,supra,at,fn.omitted.
california courts have long held that two requirements must be met in order to sustain any class action there must be an ascertainable class citations and there must be a well defined community of interest in the questions of law and fact involved affecting the parties to be represented.daar yellow cab,supra,cal d,linder thrifty oil cal th,d,richmond dart industries,cal d,vasquez superior court cal d.while the requirement of an ascertainable class normally requires little elaboration the community of interest requirement has been held to embody three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.richmond dart industries,supra,at,linder thrifty oil,supra,at,d,bartold glendale federal bank,supra,th,d,subd.b.
the certification of a class is a discretionary decision that demands the weighing of many relevant considerations.linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th,d.in collins rocha cal d,our high court observed,the ultimate question in every case of this type is whether,given an ascertainable class,the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.following this language,numerous later cases have admonished trial courts to carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts.city of san jose superior court,supra,cal d,see also lockheed martin superior court cal th,d,washington mutual bank superior court cal th,d,blue chip stamps superior court cal d,caro procter gamble th,d.
by preventing a failure of justice in our judicial system linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th,d,the class action not only benefits the individual litigant but serves the public interest in the enforcement of legal rights and statutory sanctions.bartold glendale federal bank,supra,th,d.thus,in upholding a consumer class action,the court in vasquez superior court,supra,cal d,quoted with approval an argument for stockholder class action suits modern society seems increasingly to expose men to group injuries for which individually they are in a poor position to seek legal redress,either because they do not know enough or because such redress is disproportionately expensive.if each is left to assert his rights alone if and when he can,there will at best be a random and fragmentary enforcement,if there is any at all.
in a proper case,the judicial system substantially benefits by the efficient use of its resources afforded by class certifications.richmond dart industries,supra,cal d.class actions offer a means of avoiding repetitious litigation linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th,d,and a multiplicity of legal actions dealing with identical basic issues vasquez superior court,supra,cal d.nevertheless,by greatly expediting the resolution of claims,class actions can create possibilities for injustice in an individual case.city of san jose superior court,supra,cal d.a line of california cases follows the principle of rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,which provides that,for a class action to be maintained,it must be superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.this superiority criterion has been held to be manifest in the requirement that the class mechanism confer substantial benefits.dean witter reynolds,superior court d.caro procter gamble,supra,th,d schneider vennard d.lazar hertz d.
because trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action,they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th,d,or motions for decertification.occidental land,superior court cal d.i n the absence of other error,this court will not disturb a trial court ruling on class certification which is supported by substantial evidence unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous legal assumptions were made citation.richmond dart industries,supra,cal d.
legal challenge 
claiming that the trial court abused its discretion in initially certifying the class of claims representatives on may,fie and amici curiae advance an array of arguments with little actual citation to the record.this failure to address the record defeats their challenge to the trial court finding of a community of interest among class members.the trial court found that the class was composed of hundreds of similarly situated employees employed as claims representatives and that there were common questions of law and fact common to the class with respect to such class members claims for overtime pay.the finding was based on plaintiffs extensive evidentiary showing in support of the motion for certification.in opposing the motion and moving twice for decertification,fie never claimed that there were differences among the various duties performed by class members that would bar class certification and in this appeal,it does not offer any reasoned argument,based on actual citations to the record,to this effect.the trial court findings of fact with respect to a community of interest remain unchallenged.
arguing that questions specific to each individual claims representative predominated over common legal issues,fie points only to matters,such as overtime hours worked,pertaining to the determination of individual damages.it is well established that the necessity for an individual determination of damages does not weigh against class certification.the community of interest requirement recognizes that ultimately each class member will be required in some manner to establish his individual damages vasquez superior court,supra,cal d,collins rocha,supra,cal d,acree general motors acceptance th,d hicks kaufman broad home th,d.as explained in employment development superior court cal d,a class action is not inappropriate simply because each member of the class may at some point be required to make an individual showing as to his or her eligibility for recovery or as to the amount of his or her damages.in custom kitchen,d,the court quoted a comment from a federal decision in almost every class action,factual determinations of damages to individual class members must be made.citations.still we know of no case where this has prevented a court from aiding the class to obtain its just restitution.indeed,to decertify a class on the issue of damages or restitution may well be effectively to sound the of the class action device.citations.
relying on language in ramirez yosemite water cal th,d,amici curiae call for an individualized,assessment of the exemption standards,involving a inquiry into the duties actually performed by employees.but close attention to the facts may require an individual adjudication of exempt status in certain cases while permitting a group adjudication in others.we do not need to pursue amici curiae suggestion that other cases may call for individual adjudication of exempt status.our decision here must be based on the record in this appeal,which amici curiae do not discuss.amici curiae offer no reason to disturb the trial court finding that class members here were similarly situated,under circumstances presenting common issues of law and fact,which permitted an adjudication of whether they were employed in an administrative capacity within the meaning of wage order.
in its second motion for decertification,fie opposed class certification on the ground that percent of the employees in the random sample did not claim compensation for unpaid overtime.in this appeal,it urges that the discovery of this fact constituted a changed circumstance that justified its second motion for decertification.the record discloses,however,that most of the employees not claiming overtime had worked as claims representatives for very short periods of measured in a few weeks.the nonclaimants accounted for only percent of total weeks worked in the class.moreover,a segment of the nonclaimants were currently employed as claims representatives and thus had an interest in the injunctive relief sought by the class representatives.if these employees are excluded from the total,only percent of the employees in the random sample lacked an interest in the objectives of the litigation.
the presence of this marginal element of nonclaimants did not make the class less ascertainable or significantly reduce the required community of interest.class members were identifiable by their employment in pertinent job categories.the small number of nonclaimants did not deprive plaintiffs of their representative status.the record contains nothing to suggest that nonclaimants constituted an employee segment with distinct interests conflicting with other class members.finally,it did not affect the common issues of law and fact.the case called for individual adjudications only of the damages resulting from unpaid overtime.the question of an employee eligibility for recovery did not present a distinct issue of liability,as fie argues,but rather depended on the same factual overtime hours the question of the amount of the employee damages.see employment development superior court,supra,cal d.
fie notes that proof of the fact of damages is required in individual actions for unpaid overtime hernandez mendoza d.and argues that the presence of nonclaimants demonstrated that plaintiffs could not establish this element of their cause of action for all class members.but if proof of individual damages were required by all potentially affected parties as a condition for class certification,it would go far toward barring all class actions.as noted in custom kitchen,supra,d,most class actions contemplate individual proof of damages,which necessarily entails the possibility that some class members will fail to prove damages.fie cites no authority that class certification should be ordered only under circumstances promising universal recovery within the class.
considerations of the efficient use of judicial resources supported the class action,despite the discovery of a marginal element of nonclaimants.on its facts,the present case is remarkably close to richmond dart industries,supra,cal d.the plaintiffs there filed a class action for fraud and violation of the subdivided lands act against a developer of a recreational home subdivision.in the class certification hearing,the developer introduced the results of a survey in which it had asked homeowners to express their view of the subdivision by checking one of three boxes.approximately percent of the class returned the survey with a check in the box indicating satisfaction with the developer performance.the trial court relied on the survey to deny class certification.reversing the order on appeal,the california supreme court observed,since the judicial system substantially benefits by the efficient use of its resources,class certifications should not be denied so long as the absent class members rights are adequately protected.richmond dart industries,supra,at.the results of the flyer questionnaire show no more than approximately percent of the class of some persons antagonistic to the class action suit.this small number should not be sufficient to defeat the motion for certification.id.at.
lastly,fie argues that the large size of the employees average claim is class certification.but,addressing a similar argument in collins rocha,supra,cal d,our high court observed that while the impracticability of bringing an individual action for comparatively small potential recovery is a consideration in favor of permitting a class action,the converse is not necessarily controlling,the possibility of a potential recovery for each class member larger than a nominal sum does not militate against the maintenance of such an action.
we note,first,that the size of individual claims does not necessarily have a bearing on the consideration of judicial efficiency favoring class actions.whatever the size of the claims,a class action may be required when the parties are numerous,and it is impractical to bring them all before the court,as provided by code of civil procedure section.fie advocates the alternative of individual,but this vaguely described concept would still involve a multiplicity of legal actions dealing with identical basic issues vasquez superior court,supra,cal d,which would burden litigants and the courts with repetitious litigation.linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th,d.
moreover,class actions may be needed to assure the effective enforcement of statutory policies even though some claims are large enough to provide an incentive for individual action.while employees may succeed under favorable circumstances in recovering unpaid overtime through a lawsuit or a wage claim filed with the labor commissioner,a class action may still be justified if these alternatives offer no more than the prospect of random and fragmentary enforcement of the employer legal obligation to pay overtime.vasquez superior court,supra,cal d.
fie maintains that where claims are as large as,the right to recover attorney fees,costs,and interest provides ample incentive for an individual lawsuit.but the size of the average claim in part reflects the accrual of unpaid overtime over the duration of this lawsuit prior to trial.when the complaint was first filed in october,the average claim would have been smaller and a large portion of the claims may not have been reasonably adequate to fund the expense of individual litigation.the length of this litigation in fact underscores the practical difficulties vindicating claims to unpaid overtime.employees will seldom have detailed personal records of hours worked.their case ordinarily rests on the credibility of vague recollections and requires them to litigate complex overtime formulas and exemption standards.for current employees,a lawsuit means challenging an employer in a context that may be perceived as jeopardizing job security and prospects for promotion.if the employee files after termination of employment,the costs of litigation may still involve travel expenses and time off from work to pursue the case,and the value of any ultimate recovery may be reduced by legal expenses.
in its second motion for decertification fie argued that employees may seek administrative relief through what is commonly known as the berman hearing procedure codified in labor code sections to.stats,ch.this procedure is designed to provide a speedy,informal,and affordable method of resolving wage claims,but it has several disadvantages for the employee.cuadra millan cal th,d,lolley campbell cal th,d.injunctive relief is not available.the employer is typically represented by counsel and if employees choose also to retain counsel,they can not recover attorney fees.moreover,a losing employer has a right to a trial de novo in superior court where the ruling of the hearing officer is entitled to no deference,subds.b c post associates cal th,d.opposing the first motion for decertification,plaintiffs submitted a declaration by a former chief counsel of the department of labor standards enforcement dlse,who cautioned,requiring two thousand or so class members to go through individual berman hearings would obviously be extremely inefficient as compared to a single class action.also,a deluge of claims would simply outstrip the resources of the dlse impacting not only these claimants but others unrelated to this suit.
if the costs to the courts of repetitious litigation and the public interest in effective enforcement of overtime laws are taken into account,the trial court clearly acted within its discretion in finding that a class action was a superior means of adjudicating the present controversy.hence,on the present record,we conclude that fie has not demonstrated that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the motion for class certification and later denying the two motions for decertification.our decision is based solely on the issues raised by these motions 
trial management 
trial court discretion 
fie next challenges the use of the statistical methodology of random sampling and extrapolation for the determination of aggregate classwide damages.the issue is a novel one in california.it is true that california courts have relied on expert testimony on statistical methods to resolve certain issues in damage calculations and daar yellow cab,supra,cal d,offers a precedent for determining aggregate classwide damages through a process of logical inference but we must look to federal law for closer precedents.in discussing these federal precedents,we are mindful that class actions in the past have sometimes also called for judicial innovations guided by the experience of the federal courts.city of san jose superior court,supra,cal d.in this area of litigation,the california supreme court has in fact challenged the trial courts to develop pragmatic procedural devices to simplify the potentially complex litigation while at the same time protecting the rights of all the parties.citations.state of california levi strauss cal d.
the record does not present the evidentiary issues that sometimes accompany the use of statistics in litigation.fie did not challenge the scientific methodology employed by the plaintiffs expert witness or question his qualifications.our analysis will be confined to two inquiries was adoption of the trial management plan within the scope of the trial court discretion and did the use of statistical inference violate fie due process rights while our inquiries may draw on the use of statistical methodology in disparate fields we recognize claims for unpaid overtime compensation present certain unique and distinguishing characteristics.in the area of federal flsa litigation,the touchstone is the seminal decision in anderson clemens pottery.hereafter clemens.
in the clemens case,the plaintiff employees complained that the employer failed to compensate them for time spent walking to their work stations and completing certain necessary activities before and after their scheduled shifts,but they could not accurately prove the amount of uncompensated work.the supreme court noted that an employee who brings suit under the flsa has the burden of proving that he performed work for which he was not properly compensated.the remedial nature of this statute and the great public policy which it embodies,however,militate against making that burden an impossible hurdle for the employee.clemens,supra.where the employer fails to keep proper records,the courts should not penalize the employee by denying him any recovery on the ground that he is unable to prove the precise extent of uncompensated work.such a result would place a premium on an employer failure to keep proper records in conformity with his statutory duty id.at.instead,the court held an employee has carried out his burden if he proves that he has in fact performed work for which he was improperly compensated and if he produces sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of that work as a matter of just and reasonable inference.the burden then shifts to the employer to come forward with evidence of the precise amount of work performed if the employer fails to produce such evidence,the court may then award damages to the employee,even though the result be only approximate.id.at,emphasis added.
following clemens,the federal courts have consistently granted back wages to nontestifying employees on the basis of a pattern or practice adduced from the testimony of other employees within their job category as stated in donovan diner,cir,t here is no requirement that to establish a clemens pattern or practice,testimony must refer to all employees courts have frequently granted back wages under the flsa to employees based upon the representative testimony of a small percentage of the employees.citation.the requirement is only that the testimony be fairly representational.fn.omitted.
in some cases,the courts have relied on statistical analyses of evidence to infer wages owed to nontestifying employees within the same group as testifying claimants.in donovan hudson stations,wage hour cas.bna,wl,the secretary of labor deposed employees out of a group of employees,but only of this number were randomly selected.the deposition data was used to calculate the average amounts of shortages paid and time worked off the clock by employees.at trial,the secretary asked that these averages be applied to calculate the back pay award for all defendants employees.id.at.while recognizing that the survey was not conducted in a scientific manner,the court found that it was sufficient to establish uncompensated work as a matter of just and reasonable inference.ibid.
again,in reich waldbaum,a computer specialist for the labor department calculated actual hours worked by nontestifying employees by a process of averaging or averaging.noting that j ust as some employees are overcompensated by the calculations,others are under compensated,the court concluded that the method was reasonable,though not ideal.id.at.similarly,in mclaughlin dialamerica marketing,a compliance specialist developed a computerized summary of all of the available data and devised formulas to reconstruct actual hours worked from the record of units of production.the court awarded back wages to both testifying and nontestifying employees based on these calculations of the average relation of units of production to hours worked.id.at.
the present case differs from these precedents only in the size of the employee group and the use of a scientific methodology to infer aggregate classwide damages.if hours worked by nontestifying employees may be inferred from the testimony of other employees within a small employee group,we see no reason why it should not be allowed for a larger employee group.and if rough approximations and statistical estimates pass scrutiny for smaller groups,a scientific methodology based on a random sampling should also qualify as a just and reasonable inference of uncompensated hours worked in the case at bar.
fie vigorously argues that the use of statistical inference improperly relieved class members of their initial burden of showing they worked overtime,a burden recognized both by the clemens decision and by california law applying to the recovery of damages in individual wage claims.hernandez mendoza,supra,d.clemens,supra.collins safeway stores,d.fie notes,and we agree,that substantive rules of law may not be altered in the interests of efficient litigation.cimino raymark industries,cir,granberry islay investments cal th,d.however,statistical sampling does not dispense with proof of damages but rather offers a different method of proof,substituting inference from membership in a class for an individual employee testimony of hours worked for inadequate compensation.it calls for a particular form of expert testimony to carry the initial burden of proof,not a change in substantive law.we note that the use of statistical sampling in the present case is analogous to flsa precedents that allow back pay to nontestifying claimants.by basing relief on evidence of a pattern or practice,these decisions have also relieved some employees of the procedural necessity of making individual proof.
fie appears to complain that the determination of aggregate damages on the basis of statistical inference entails the possibility of awarding back wages to particular employees who are not entitled to them.but this possibility also exists in flsa cases see,reich chez robert,supra,and is not a unique problem of statistical sampling it is inherent in many class action decisions.fie argument for individualized proof of damages,if accepted,would challenge all class action judgments adopting reasonably expeditious means of distributing the recovery among class members.state of california levi strauss,supra,cal d,bruno superior court,supra,d.we decline to adopt this point of view,preferring the more pragmatic approach characterizing federal decisions.see generally wright,miller kane,fed.practice and procedure,supra,conte newberg,newberg on class actions,supra.
nevertheless,from the perspective of the administration of justice,we see an important negative consequence of the use of statistical sampling to calculate damages it necessarily yields an average figure that will overestimate or underestimate the right to relief of individual employees.as professor robert bone writes,sampling can yield an extremely accurate average damage figure and thus an accurate total damage figure for the whole aggregation when the sample average is multiplied by the total number of plaintiffs.h owever,sampling imperfectly distributes this total relative to the expected outcome of an individual trial,giving some plaintiffs more and some less than their individual entitlements.as we will see,the plan of distribution in this case is designed to ameliorate this problem,but it still offers an imperfect method of distributing damages in comparison to individual adjudication.
weighing against this disadvantage is the consideration that statistical inference offers a means of vindicating the policy underlying the industrial welfare commission wage orders without clogging the courts or deterring small claimants with the cost of litigation in a particular case,the alternative to the award of classwide aggregate damages may be the sort of random and fragmentary enforcement of the overtime laws that will fail to effectively assure compliance on a classwide basis.in clemens,the court held that the remedial nature of this statute and the great public policy which it embodies justified a reduced standard of proof of damages.clemens,supra.the same consideration militates in favor of a reasonably expeditious means of calculating and distributing classwide aggregate damages if individual adjudication of the entitlements of all class members,or a substantial portion of the members,would impose impossible burdens on the courts and litigants.
in our view,it was within the discretion of the trial court to weigh the disadvantage of statistical calculation of average damages imperfectly tailored to the facts of particular the opportunity it afforded to vindicate an important statutory policy without unduly burdening the courts.as stated in in re chevron,cir,o ur review of a trial court plan for proceeding in a complex case is a deferential one that recognizes the fact that the trial judge is in a much better position than an appellate court to formulate an appropriate methodology for a trial.
due process 
fie maintains,however,that the use of statistical sampling and extrapolation violated its right to due process in the determination of damages.under connecticut doehr,d doehr,the question whether a procedural device used in judicial proceedings to deprive a defendant of property comports with due process is determined by a balancing of interests f irst,consideration of the private interest that will be affected by the procedure second,an examination of the risk of erroneous deprivation through the procedures under attack and the probable value of additional or alternative safeguards and third,principal attention to the interest of the party seeking the procedure,with,nonetheless,due regard for any ancillary interest the government may have in providing the procedure or forgoing the added burden of providing greater protections.see also mathews eldridge,d hilao estate of marcos cir,in re simon ii litigation,supra.
in this case,the interest of fie that was affected by the use of statistical sampling is its total or aggregate liability to the plaintiff class for unpaid overtime compensation.fie may object to statistical sampling on due process grounds only to the extent that the procedure affected its overall liability for damages.sanders city of los angeles cal d,defendant lacked standing to object to a common fund attorney fee award hilao estate of marcos,supra,the defendant interest is only in the total amount of damages for which it will be liable in re agent orange product liability litigation,defendant has no valid objection so long as it is liable for no more than the aggregate loss fairly attributable to its tortious conduct.
fie aggregate liability was not affected by the method of determining individual entitlements to members of the plaintiff class.this issue pertains only to the exercise of the trial court discretion in ordering a trial management plan.similarly,the presence of nonclaimants in the class,which may be relevant to the trial court discretion in certifying the class,has no relevance to fie due process claim so long as the inclusion of these class members did not increase the total amount of damages.the record shows that the damage award was in fact calculated on the basis of an average weekly overtime figure that factored in the presence of nonclaimants.
turning to the third interest in the doehr analysis,the interest of the plaintiffs in using statistical inference as a basis for an aggregate classwide recovery is enormous,since adversarial resolution of each class member claim would pose insurmountable practical hurdles.hilao estate of marcos,supra.relatively few class members have a realistic capability of assuming the costs and personal risks involved in judicial and administrative remedies.the ancillary interest of the government,the industrial welfare commission and the courts in using statistical inference for the award of damages lies in the means it affords to enforce the objectives of the industrial welfare commission wage orders,advance the judicial policy of giving small claimants access to the courts,and avoid imposing unreasonable burdens on the judicial system in the enforcement of the law.
the second part of the doehr risk of erroneous to the complex body of law and scholarship dealing with the use of statistical inference in adjudication,but in the end it reveals a serious constitutional issue only with respect to the plaintiffs claim for compensation we will discuss,first,the due process issue pertaining to the award for overtime compensation.
a compensation 
fie argues that the statistical methods used to determine its aggregate liability for compensation involved a risk of erroneous deprivation of property because t he extrapolation process produced a range of overtime compensation figures between million and arbitrary swing of million.more accurately,the record discloses that the statistical methodology employed by the plaintiffs expert,richard drogin,with the apparent concurrence of fie expert,roy weinstein,not only estimated the average weekly unpaid overtime of the class on the basis of random sampling of employees,but provided a measure of the possible inaccuracy of the estimate.this measure of possible inaccuracy consisted of a confidence interval,based on a percent degree of confidence.the term interval can be expressed in more familiar language in terms of a margin of error,which is of the interval.drogin calculated that,with a percent degree of confidence,the average weekly hours of unpaid overtime of the sample of employees,hours,reflected the true average overtime hours of the entire class of employees,subject to a margin of error of hours 
we note,first,that,by a process of rounding upward to the nearest,fie overstates the possibility of error.the margin of error of weekly hours in fact yields a range of million,or million above or below the estimated aggregate classwide damages secondly,fie argument that repetition of the sampling would result in an arbitrary swing between the limits of the margin of error implicitly assumes that there would be an even distribution of outcomes within this range.but there is no basis for such an assumption,or,for that matter,for the contrary assumption that repetition would result in a clustering of outcomes close to the value of the initial sample.the confidence interval provides a quantitative measure only of the limits of the possible inaccuracy of the estimated average value.it does not convey any information regarding the probable distribution of outcomes within the margin of error,and the record contains no testimony on this point 
a due process critique of the accuracy of statistical inference implicitly assumes that it is a less reliable method of reaching a correct verdict than individual adjudication.but the proof of damages in an individual claimant trial may also involve estimates,inferences and other sources of error the proof of damages by statistical inference chiefly differs in that it openly acknowledges the possibility of error and offers a quantitative measure of possible inaccuracy.in other words,it is overtly probabilistic 
by attacking the statistical proof of damages as arbitrary and speculative,fie takes a position at odds with the growing acceptance of scientific statistical methodology in judicial decisions and scholarship.forty years ago,the courts indeed displayed some reluctance to admit survey data but today s tatistical assessments are prominent in many kinds of cases,ranging from antitrust to voting rights.citing varied uses of statistics,the court in in re chevron,supra,observes,the applicability of inferential statistics have long been recognized by the courts.underlying the contemporary reliance on the methodology of inferential statistics is a recognition that e xperts have developed appropriate modeling techniques for reaching statistically significant and reliable conclusions.in re simon ii litigation,supra,see also ratanasen california of health services cir,michigan of educ.of educ.cir,pfizer,lord cir blue cross blue shield of philip morris,supra,d,long trans world airlines,in re antibiotic antitrust actions,mandamus denied sub avery state farm mut.auto.ins.d,tomlin department of social services.we find little basis in the decisional law for a skepticism regarding the appropriateness of the scientific methodology of inferential statistics as a technique for determining damages in an appropriate case.
in the hearings on the trial management plan on august,fie made representations to the court that appeared to concede that a margin of error satisfied its due process concerns.in a memorandum proposing a margin of error,fie noted,case law that supports the position that statistical sampling is appropriate and does not violate fie due process rights only when the appropriate margin of error is used and concluded that a margin of error of hours helps ensure that the aggregate damages fie is required to pay do not exceed fie actual liability in this action.at the hearing on august,when the trial court suggested a margin of error as a compromise,fie counsel responded,we would be agreeable to a number.the sampling ultimately achieved a slightly better margin of error.
at trial,the plaintiffs statistical methodology withstood fie challenges.the evidence revealed that over percent of the employees randomly selected for depositions were actually deposed,a response rate regarded as producing a reliable and accurate sample drogin testified that the depositions of the second half of the sample did not vary much from the figures yielded by the first depositions.moreover,the elimination of the largest claimants,asserting claims for unpaid hours worked over hours per week,would have a negligible impact on the average weekly figure.
we conclude that the proof of aggregate damages for overtime by statistical inference reflected a level of accuracy consistent with due process under the doehr balancing test.this conclusion is supported by persuasive authority.in re chevron,supra,hilao estate of marcos,supra,yorktown medical laboratory,perales cir,blue cross blue shield of philip morris,supra,d,long trans world airlines,supra,in re sugar industry antitrust litigation,in re bailey ohio app d,see generally conte newberg,newberg on class actions,supra.
b compensation 
the average weekly figure of hours of unpaid overtime work included hours of work qualifying for compensation.the calculation of this figure was based on deposition testimony of the sample group regarding hours worked over hours in a day or over hours on the seventh day of a work week.the judgment awarded plaintiffs as compensation for unpaid hours.
fie expert,roy weinstein,calculated that the use of the sample average of hours of unpaid compensation to determine unpaid double time for the entire class was subject to a margin of error of hours or about percent.moreover,the distribution of employees claiming unpaid double time was highly skewed.some employees claimed some amount of unpaid compensation,but only employees claimed hours or more,and a group of only employees accounted for half of the award.
in our view,the possible inaccuracy of the estimate of unpaid compensation presents an issue of constitutional dimension.we do not mean to suggest that the margin of error alone may afford a constitutional distinction.the reliability of an estimate subject to a large margin of error might conceivably be bolstered by evidence of a high response rate,probable distribution within the margin of error,absence of measurement error,or other matters.we have been unable to find in the present record,however,anything that addresses the issues of reliability involved in the calculation of damages.the estimate of unpaid pay appears as a kind of afterthought in the trial management plan.the parties experts did not offer foundational calculations for the determination of or propose an appropriate class size,margin of error,or sampling methodology.
we recognize that there are circumstances when a rough approximation of damages is preferable to a failure of justice resulting from no award at all.the record,however,reveals no consideration of possible alternatives or refinements to the statistical methodology and trial procedures used for calculation of the element of damages.under the doehr analysis,the absence of evidence regarding possible alternatives is relevant not only to the risk of error but also to the ancillary government interest in the procedure.the government can not have an interest in a procedure if superior alternative procedures are available.
employing the balancing test mandated by doehr,we conclude that the award of compensation does not withstand due process challenge.we therefore reverse the portion of the judgment awarding unpaid compensation of.
c implementation of trial management plan 
without any actual citation to the record,fie makes a series of representations that it was barred from contesting the plaintiffs proof of damages.for example,it states allowing proof of damages by a statistical showing deprived fie of its right to contest plaintiffs evidence.we agree that the trial management plan would raise due process issues if it served to restrict fie right to present evidence against the claims mullane central hanover tr.people sandoval d.restitution,but we have searched the record without finding any indication that this occurred.
although fie originally proposed individual trials to establish damages,it appears that it acquiesced to statistical proof of damages at the hearing on april,which led to the initial order adopting a trial management plan this interpretation tends to be confirmed by the parties collaboration in preparation of joint declarations of their experts and their agreement on a margin of error of one hour at the hearing on august.there was no mention of individual adjudication of damages at either hearing.it was not until shortly before trial that fie raised the contention in a footnote to a status conference statement that it had not waived its demand for individual trials of damages.
following the depositions of the employees in the sample,fie and plaintiffs agreed to work calendars,tabulations of data,that reflected the content of each employee testimony.fie later waived the right to impeach the employees testimony at trial.under the guidance of the special master,the parties agreed to a series of deadlines by which fie was required to identify any deponent whom it wished to impeach.fie initially challenged the testimony of two deponents and then resolved differences with plaintiffs with respect to these two witnesses.in a pretrial hearing before the special master,fie reserved the right to introduce testimony of class members outside the sample,but we find no indication that it pursued this option.it never included individual employees in its witness list or sought to offer their testimony at trial 
we find only one pretrial ruling that significantly restricted fie right to contest plaintiffs proof of damages the order precluding its expert witness,roy weinstein,from testifying on probable measurement error in the deposition testimony of sample members.by measurement error,he meant a tendency for deponents to overstate average hours worked.after an extensive argument and offer of proof,the trial court excluded the testimony on the ground,among others,that it involved an asserted psychological phenomenon outside the scope of weinstein expertise as an economist and statistician.fie has not assigned error to this ruling on appeal.
in short,we find nothing in the record that substantiates fie claim that the trial management plan restricted its opportunities to contest the evidence of damages or to present rebuttal evidence relating to hours worked by individual employees.plaintiffs proved damages by a process of just and reasonable inference as in other wage claim actions,and fie was afforded the opportunity to come forward with evidence of the precise amount of work performed or with evidence to negative the reasonableness of the inference to be drawn from the employee evidence.clemens,supra.in doing so,fie appears to have chosen to rely on its own statistical evidence as a matter of trial tactics.to the extent that the use of statistical sampling led to rough or expedient justice,it was in the adjudication of the relative entitlements of individual claimants to share in the aggregate award.fie itself was not prejudiced by this process.
postjudgment plan of distribution 
in light of our discussion of fie due process objections to the trial management plan,we see little need to comment on its contention that the postjudgment claims procedure does not cure the due process violations.since we have found no due process violations in the award of aggregate classwide damages for overtime compensation,the judgment does not present any due process infirmity to be cured.a class action which affords due process of law to the defendant through the time when the amount of its liability is calculated can not suddenly deprive it of its constitutional rights because of the way the damages are distributed.bruno superior court,supra,d.
it is well established that the allocation of that aggregate sum of the judgment among class members is an internal class accounting question that does not directly concern the defendant conte newberg,newberg on class actions,supra.the trial court here followed the accepted practice of establishing a procedure.after the defendant total damage liability is paid over to a class fund,individual class members are afforded an opportunity to collect their individual shares by proving their particular damages,usually according to a lowered standard of proof.state of california levi strauss,supra,cal d,see also in re sugar industry antitrust litigation,supra,in re antibiotic antitrust actions,supra.the record does not show that the class members,who are directly affected by this procedure,have raised any complaint.fie may raise a due process objection only by showing that the procedure affected the total amount of its liability.see,ante.
we also note that fie has raised only two narrow issues concerning the specific provisions of the postjudgment orders adopting a plan of distribution and awarding common fund attorney fees and costs the application of code of civil procedure section to disposition of any residue in the damages fund and the need for a mechanism to question an apparently excessive claim.it has not assigned error to the award of common fund attorney fees.moreover,it does not question the timing of the postjudgment notice requiring class members to submit forms.indeed,fie did not request the mailing of such notices to class members prior to the damage phase of the trial but rather sought a second notice and pursued motions for class decertification.we thus have no occasion to consider the feasibility,or possible merit,of requiring submission of claim forms prior to the adjudication of aggregate classwide liability.see wright,miller kane,fed.practice and procedure,supra,in re antibiotic antitrust actions,supra.
fie raises a potentially difficult issue regarding the disposition of any residue in the damages fund,which turns on the interpretation and application of code of civil procedure section.the plan of distribution logically entails the possibility that the total sum of damage claims submitted by class members,plus prejudgment interest,will be less than the judgment for aggregate classwide damages and interest.the judgment expressly provides for this possibility with respect to prejudgment interest if the total amount of prejudgment interest paid to class members upon payment of their claims should be less than the actual award of prejudgment interest fie may seek to amend the judgment to allow it to recover the difference if any between the total amount awarded by the court and the total lesser amount payable to claiming class members the plan of distribution,however,deferred a ruling on the disposition of any unclaimed damages to a later proceeding under code of civil procedure section.it directs the plaintiffs or the claims administrator to submit a postdistribution report stating the total amount that was actually paid to class members after receiving class counsel recommendation on how any such residue should be distributed,the court is to determine how to distribute the residue consistent with b.
subdivision a of code of civil procedure section states the legislative intent to ensure that the unpaid residuals in class action litigation are distributed,to the extent possible,in a manner designed either to further the purposes of the underlying causes of action,or to promote justice for all californians.subdivision b contemplates a report to the court followed by an order paying the residue to a charity the court shall set a date when the parties shall report to the court the total amount that was actually paid to the class members.after the report is received,the court shall amend the judgment to direct the defendant to pay the sum of the unpaid residue to nonprofit organizations or foundations to support projects that will benefit the class or that promote the law consistent with the objectives and purposes of the underlying cause of action,to child advocacy programs,or to nonprofit organizations providing civil legal services to the indigent see kraus trinity management services,cal th,d.
fie acknowledges that the distribution of the unpaid residue of a class action judgment to a nonprofit organization may be appropriate where the judgment requires a defendant to disgorge money that was fraudulently or unjustly acquired.see kraus trinity management services,supra,cal th,d.such a distribution may be appropriate for tort damages that serve a broad remedial purpose and are incapable of precise measurement.but fie reasonably argues that the sole purpose of the judgment here is to provide for payment of overtime compensation that is due and payable and the amount of this unpaid compensation is subject to precise calculation.under these circumstances,fie maintains,it would constitute a taking in violation of due process to distribute any excess in the damage fund to a third party as authorized by code of civil procedure section.
fie constitutional objections,however,are directed at a contingency that has not yet occurred and indeed may be unlikely.by deferring a decision on the disposition of unpaid residue in the damage fund,the plan of distribution not only followed the procedure mandated by code of civil procedure section but also adopted a course of action consistent with the principle that we do not reach constitutional questions unless absolutely required to do so to dispose of the matter before us.people williams cal d,santa clara county local transportation authority guardino cal th,d,walker kiousis th,d.the application of section to the present case may require the trial court to consider constitutional issues bearing on the interpretation and enforceability of the statute.these issues can best be deferred to a later stage in the proceedings when it is known whether such a residue exists and the issues regarding its disposition can receive a full and adequate briefing.in so holding,we construe the plan of distribution as calling for a hearing before the trial court in which both parties will be given an opportunity to brief the full range of statutory and constitutional issues involved in the disposition of any residue in the damages fund.
fie next complains that the plan of distribution does not provide a mechanism for the claims administrator to question an apparently excessive claim.the plaintiffs question whether fie has standing to object to excessive claims,but we think it necessarily follows that,if fie can assert a claim on due process grounds for an undistributed residue in a postjudgment hearing,it has standing to question the procedure that may affect the amount of this residue,even though it may be unlikely that the residue will actually materialize.we do not reach the question whether fie interest in the morale of its employees is sufficient to give it standing to question the plan of distribution.
plaintiffs properly object that fie is attempting to inject at this late stage in the proceeding a costly and procedure that will undermine the advantages of a class action for aggregate damages.in in re agent orange product liability litigation,supra,the federal court observed,if the judicial and monetary economies of the class action are not to be lost through lengthy and expensive individual trials on damages,some mechanism must be devised to decide damage claims without the need for a trial for each plaintiff.the plaintiffs here proposed the simple mechanism of distributing damages to all class members based on average overtime hours for the class.at fie request,the trial court ordered a procedure that relies on the accuracy and honesty of individual employees to achieve its purposes and involves considerably more administrative complexity.we reject fie effort to transform this procedure into a proceeding that will cause the economies of the class action to be lost through lengthy and expensive trials on damages.ibid.
nevertheless,fie assignment of error embraces a much narrower concern relating to precautions against fraud.we may appropriately consider whether this narrower issue has been addressed,or is capable of being addressed,in ways that will not unduly burden the claims procedure.our high court discussion of the issue in state of california levi strauss,supra,cal d,is the only authority on point that we have found.
in levi strauss the court considered a plan to distribute million in damages to consumers who were entitled to an average individual recovery of to for each purchase of the defendant jeans.notices of the settlement were mailed to million households and other forms were made available at post offices.the trial court ordered that the top percent of claims would be treated as suspect and the claim forms would be returned with instructions to resubmit with a notarized statement confirming their veracity.state of california levi strauss,supra,cal d.over percent of these claims were not resubmitted.ibid.the intervener argued that the plan rewarded inflated or baseless claims and was afflicted with widespread fraud.id.at.the supreme court noted that there appears to be no reported decision in any jurisdiction approving a plan so lacking in safeguards against fraud id.at,but still affirmed the judgment d ue to practical considerations id.at.
though the court affirmed the plan of distribution,we read the levi strauss decision as saying that precautions against fraud are a legitimate concern in crafting a plan of distribution,and a failure to provide adequate precautions against fraud may constitute an abuse of discretion.the plan of distribution here includes four features that may be regarded as precautions against fraud the claims of the employees who were deposed percent of the total will be based on their deposition testimony other claims must be signed under penalty of perjury employees who claim to have worked an average of more than overtime hours per week will have their payments based on overtime hours per week if claim forms are not properly completed,the claims administrator or class counsel may contact class members and provide them with an opportunity to file amended claims,and,if necessary information is still lacking,submit a recommendation to the court concerning the appropriate distribution.
under this procedure,if an undeposed employee properly completes a form and reports less than hours per week of average overtime,the only procedural safeguard against fraud is the requirement of signing the form under penalty of perjury.we have no way of knowing whether the fear of perjury,as well as personal honesty and peer pressure,will prove sufficient to guarantee the integrity of the claims process.we are troubled,however,that the plan does not empower the claims administrator to take action if it receives a quantity of large claims that markedly exceeds the frequency of such claims reported in depositions of the random sample.the most obvious response would be to give the claims administrator or his designee discretionary authority to challenge a small and strictly limited number of claims presenting indicia of possible fraud.the challenge could be governed by the existing procedures applying to employee challenges to preprinted information on the claim form,which may lead ultimately to a decision by the special master if combined with a conspicuous notice informing employees that the claims administrator has authority to investigate claims for fraud and with a cap on allowable average overtime hours well below the unrealistic limit of hours per week,a strictly limited power of challenge might significantly reduce the possibility of fraud without unduly burdening the claims administration process.we remand the case to the trial court for a limited amendment of the plan of distribution and the order approving claim forms and instructions,which will authorize the claims administer to challenge suspect claims.
improper argument 
lastly,fie maintains that plaintiffs counsel improperly argued to the jury in his opening argument that their verdict would be an important message,which would be heard by fie corporate headquarters and by other employers fie waited until the end of counsel argument to object that the remark was an appeal to the jury passion and represented an attempt to impose the equivalent of punitive damages.the trial court asked plaintiffs counsel if he was willing to state to the jury that he did not request punitive damages.counsel agreed to do so,and the court concluded,i think that will clear it.fie again raised its objection in its motion for new trial.rejecting the claim of error,the trial court found that counsel remarks were not misconduct and in any event were cured by counsel other statements to the jury,and there is no indication that the jury was influenced by passion or prejudice 
we consider that any arguable claim of impropriety disappears if the argument is considered as a whole.nishihama city and county of san francisco th,d.plaintiffs counsel repeatedly stated that the jury should award plaintiffs what they were entitled to he explained,t he reason it so important is because the overtime laws embody a fundamental public policy of the state of california.and people are entitled to be paid overtime at premium rates.in this context,counsel simply appealed to the jury to vindicate the public policy underlying the overtime laws by holding fie accountable for the full amount of overtime compensation owing to plaintiffs.we do not view this argument as suggesting that the jury should inflate the damage award or award the equivalent of punitive damages.
on the present record,we do not need to invoke the rule giving counsel wide latitude in arguing to the jury tingley times mirror cal,menasco snyder d.or to rely on the deference to be given the trial court ruling on alleged misconduct.sabella southern pac.cal d,cope davison cal d.we do not consider that counsel exceeded the bounds of proper argument.moreover,we see no possibility of prejudice to fie.plaintiffs counsel dispelled any possible suggestion of impropriety by disclaiming a request for punitive damages in his later statement to the jury.the jury verdict was properly based on the quantitative calculations of plaintiffs expert witness,rather than any subjective measure of damages.
disposition 
the portion of the judgment filed september,based on the special verdict of for unpaid hours worked by the class is reversed and the judgment is otherwise affirmed.the order re plan of distribution filed september,and the order approving claim forms and instructions filed april,are reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.in all other respects,the postjudgment orders subject to appeal are affirmed the parties are to bear their own costs on appeal.
