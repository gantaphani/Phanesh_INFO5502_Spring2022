in march the city of san diego city publically announced that the rate structure it had been using to bill users of city wastewater system had resulted in excessive charges to several classes of users,including residential customers and some commercial and industrial customers.a residential customer,shames,timely filed a governmental claim seeking a refund on behalf of residential customers who were overcharged and,after the claim was denied,filed a proposed class action lawsuit on behalf of that class the shames action.
after the shames action was settled and dismissed,california restaurant management systems crms filed its own governmental claim and then filed the instant putative class action on behalf of restaurant owners.city moved for summary judgment,contending crms governmental claim was not timely filed and the failure to satisfy the jurisdictional prerequisite required dismissal of crms proposed class action lawsuit.crms opposed the summary judgment motion,arguing the pendency of the shames action tolled all limitations periods,including the period for filing a governmental claim.the trial court disagreed,and entered judgment in favor of city.
this appeal presents a question of first impression whether the equitable tolling principles outlined in american pipe construction utah american pipe and crown,cork seal,parker crown cork apply to extend the period within which a claim must be filed under the government claims act,et we conclude,on the facts presented here,crms time to file its governmental claim on behalf of restaurants was not tolled by the shames action,and therefore we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural backgrounda.city overcharges to certain customers 
city operates a regional wastewater treatment and disposal system.in late march city issued a report that its wastewater user rate charge system did not include any specific cost recovery component for organic materials.the report stated that,as a result of this omission,residential customers and certain commercial and industrial customers who discharged lower levels of organic materials into the sewer system were paying a disproportionately high percentage of the overall costs of the wastewater system than is appropriate.
b.the shames action 
on april,shames filed a governmental claim pursuant to sections and,on behalf of himself and a putative class composed of residential property owners who are,or have been,customers of the city water and sewer services the putative class.the claim asserted a demand for a refund for alleged overcharges paid by the putative class,alleging that certain commercial and industrial customers discharge wastewater with relatively higher concentration of organic matters than residential customers do,and that b ecause the wastewater rates charged by the city do not account for organics,residential customers have been charged disproportionately higher rates than commercial customers in violation of the california constitution.
the city denied the claim on may.shames promptly filed his class action seeking refunds for residential property owners.the shames action alleged that c ommercial and industrial customers discharge wastewater with relatively higher concentration of organic pollutants than residential customers,that r esidential property owners impact the city sewer system at lower rates than commercial users because they discharge less organic pollutants,and that city does not account for this disproportionate impact when charging sewer fees.shames,defining the class as a ll persons who own or have owned residential property during the class period and who have been charged sewer fees,alleged there were common issues of fact and law as to residential property owners rights and sought a refund on their behalf.the shames action alleged he had satisfied the governmental claim requirements because he had filed a claim on behalf of himself and all city of san diego residential property owners seeking a refund of sewer fee overcharges which met the requirements of government code sections and.
in mid the california restaurant association cra,a trade association that advocates on behalf of restaurants and related businesses,contacted shames attorney benink to ask whether benink could amend the shames action to include food establishments within the class action benink replied that it appeared that some segments of commercial customers may have been overcharged in the same manner as residential customers,and that benink had decided to amend the complaint to expand the class to include all customers who were overcharged,rather than limiting it to residential customers.benink observed that cra members may be part of that class,if and when it is certified,and may potentially participate in any benefit we achieve for the class through this lawsuit.however,benink cautioned his firm was not agreeing to specifically represent either cra or any of its members,and they should seek their own attorney if they wanted representation.
in september shames filed an amended complaint.he alleged that c ommercial and industrial customers discharge wastewater with relatively higher concentration of organic pollutants than residential and other commercial customers do,and that because the rates charged by city do not account for organic pollutants,some customers have been charged disproportionately higher rates than commercial and industrial customers with higher usage.the amended complaint proposed an expanded class definition to define the putative class as c ustomers who,based on their relative contributions to overall system handling and processing requirements,have paid or are paying,during the time period june,through october,a disproportionately higher percentage of the costs of the wastewater system.however,shames did not file an amended governmental claim seeking a refund on behalf of the newly defined class,and did not file a new governmental claim seeking a refund on behalf of the expanded class.
in april shames filed his motion for class certification.shames sought certification of a class defined only as single family residential sewer customers while the certification motion was pending,shames and city commenced and pursued a lengthy mediation process that in late resulted in a tentative settlement.shames filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement in december,and posted a notice to the class in february.
in the spring of,prior to the court ruling on the final approval of the class settlement,cra sought leave to amend the shames action to add cra as a class representative and have new attorneys appointed as class counsel.after the court denied that motion crms filed a motion for leave to amend the shames action to allow crms to be a class representative.crms along with cra also filed objections to the proposed settlement because it would prejudice the remaining putative members of the class not included in the settlement class.the court certified the class for residential customers,and then approved the settlement and dismissed the shames action.
c.the present action 
four days after dismissal of the shames action,crms filed a governmental claim for wastewater rate refunds alleging city overcharged food establishments for sewer services.the claim alleged that food establishments were required to use grease traps and were barred from using food disposals,but that wastewater loadings for food establishments were not adjusted to recognize these pretreatment measures,and therefore food establishments paid a disproportionately higher cost for sewer services.crms asserted that,as a member of the putative class in the shames action,its claim was included within the shames action and its cause of action was tolled during its pendency.it also asserted it had substantially complied with the administrative claim requirement via the claim asserted by shames,and that city had waived the administrative claim requirement or,in the alternative,that any administrative claim time requirement was tolled during the pendency of the shames action under principles of equitable estoppel.city denied the claim because it was not filed within one year of the accrual of crms cause of action.
crms filed the present action in august as a putative class action on behalf of itself and other food establishments.the action asserted any administrative claim requirement had been substantially complied with in the alternative,city waived was equitably estopped from asserting a defense based on failure to exhaust administrative remedies because city had not raised that argument when the shames complaint was amended to expand the class definition and in the alternative,any administrative claim requirement had been equitably tolled during the pendency of the shames action 
city moved for summary judgment,asserting that crms governmental claim for a refund was not filed within one year of the accrual of the cause of action as required under section.crms opposed the motion,arguing city was equitably estopped from asserting crms claim was untimely and that any administrative claim requirement had been equitably tolled during the pendency of the shames action the trial court found no triable issues of material fact were present and city was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

governmental claim presentation principles 
the government claims act et establishes certain conditions precedent to the filing of a lawsuit against a public entity.as relevant here,a plaintiff must timely file a claim for money or damages with the public entity.the failure to do so bars the plaintiff from bringing suit against that entity.state of california superior court cal th.t he claims presentation requirement applies to all forms of monetary demands,regardless of the theory of the action the failure to timely present a claim for money or damages to a public entity bars the plaintiff from bringing suit against that entity.sparks kern county bd.of supervisors th.the policy underlying the claims presentation requirements is to afford prompt notice to public entities.this permits early investigation and evaluation of the claim and informed fiscal planning in light of prospective liabilities.ibid.
claims for personal injury must be presented not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action,and claims relating to any other cause of action must be filed within one year of the accrual of the cause of action,subd.a.timely claim presentation is not merely a procedural requirement,but is a condition precedent to the claimant ability to maintain an action against the public entity.shirk vista unified school dist.cal th.only after the public entity board has acted upon or is deemed to have rejected the claim may the injured person bring a lawsuit alleging a cause of action in tort against the public entity.ibid.
the failure to timely present a claim to the public entity bars the claimant from filing a lawsuit against that public entity.city of san jose superior court cal d,san jose.moreover,because the purpose of the claims is not to prevent surprise but rather is to provide the public entity sufficient information to enable it to adequately investigate claims and to settle them,if appropriate,without the expense of litigation citations,i t is that claims statutes must be satisfied even in face of the public entity actual knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim.such knowledge standing alone constitutes neither substantial compliance nor basis for estoppel.id.at.
ordinarily,a claimant must file his or her own claim.courts have held that when one injured party timely files a claim with a government entity and another party also injured by the same transaction seeks to pursue a suit against the government entity without filing a separate claim,the second injured party may not rely on the claim filed by the original claimant if the injury suffered by the second injured party was distinct from the injury suffered by the claimant.see,nguyen los angeles county medical center th,claim filed for injured child does not permit parents to sue for negligent infliction of emotional distress pacific tel county of riverside d,pacific widow asserting wrongful death claim could not rely on claims filed by decedent employer or workers compensation carrier roberts state of california d,shelton superior court cal.app d,lewis city and county of san francisco d,wrongful death plaintiffs could not rely on decedent tort claim for her personal injuries.
however,in san jose,supra,cal d,the court concluded that,to satisfy the governmental claim requirements as a prerequisite to filing a putative class action lawsuit,a claim by the class representative for himself and others similarly situated can be found sufficient to support an action on behalf of the others in the class without the necessity for each individual to file a claim,provided the filed claim is sufficient to satisfy the statutory purposes.the court noted 
in determining the quantity of information required in a class claim to satisfy the provisions of section,we note the cases gauging sufficiency of claims must be divided into two groups.
the first treats claims where there has been some compliance with all the required elements but compliance has been defective.citations.in these cases the test of substantial compliance controls is there sufficient information disclosed on the face of the filed claim to reasonably enable the public entity to make an adequate investigation of the merits of the claim and to settle it without the expense of a lawsuit 
in the second group of cases the courts have been less lenient.here,claims were successfully challenged for failure to comply entirely with a particular statutory requirement.citations.in determining the sufficiency of such claims,the more liberal test of substantial compliance has not been applied the courts recognizing s ubstantial compliance can not be predicated upon no compliance.quoting hall city of los angeles cal d,citation.
from these two groups,we conclude that to gauge the sufficiency of a particular claim,two tests shall be applied is there some compliance with all of the statutory requirements and,if so,is this compliance sufficient to constitute substantial compliance san jose,supra,cal d at.
considering these authorities,the san jose court held that to satisfy the claims statutes,the class claim must provide the name,address,and other specified information concerning the representative plaintiff and then sufficient information to identify and make ascertainable the class itself.because that information would meet the statutory requirements of name and address,any effort to identify the class would satisfy the some compliance test.beyond this,the sufficiency of the identifying information must be measured by the substantial compliance test.san jose,supra,cal d at.
equitable tolling principles 
general principles 
equitable tolling is a judicially created,nonstatutory doctrine designed to prevent unjust and technical forfeitures of the right to a trial on the merits when the purpose of the statute of limitations timely notice to the defendant of the plaintiff claims has been satisfied.citation.where applicable,the doctrine will suspend or extend a statute of limitations as necessary to ensure fundamental practicality and fairness.mcdonald antelope valley community college dist.cal th,mcdonald.when equitable tolling is applied,the statute of limitations stops running during the tolling event,and begins to run again only when the tolling event has concluded,which extends the deadline for filing the new action for the length of time of the tolling event.lantzy centex homes cal th.
broadly speaking,the doctrine applies w hen an injured person has several legal remedies and,reasonably and in good faith,pursues one.mcdonald,supra,cal th at.it can apply when administrative remedies must be exhausted before suit may be filed id.at or where a plaintiff has in good faith filed an initial action on his or her claim that is later found to be defective and then,after the expiration of the limitations period,brings a second action arising on the same claim that would be time barred but for the application of equitable tolling collier city of pasadena d.application of the equitable tolling doctrine in cases where multiple remedies exist serves the need for harmony and the avoidance of chaos in the administration of justice.citation.tolling eases the pressure on parties concurrently to seek redress in two separate forums with the attendant danger of conflicting decisions on the same issue.citations.by alleviating the fear of claim forfeiture,it affords grievants the opportunity to pursue informal remedies,a process we have repeatedly encouraged.citations.the tolling doctrine does so without compromising defendants significant interest in being promptly apprised of claims against them in order that they may gather and preserve evidence because that notice interest is satisfied by the filing of the first proceeding that gives rise to tolling.citations.lastly,tolling benefits the court system by reducing the costs associated with a duplicative filing requirement,in many instances rendering later court proceedings either easier and cheaper to resolve or wholly unnecessary.mcdonald,supra,cal th at.
in assessing whether a statute of limitations will be equitably tolled in a particular situation,the courts examine the presence or absence of three factors timely notice to defendants in filing the first claim lack of prejudice to defendants in gathering evidence to defend against the second claim and good faith and reasonable conduct by plaintiffs in filing the second claim.downs department of water power th.the downs court,elaborating on these three factors,explained 
the timely notice requirement essentially means that the first claim must have been filed within the statutory period.furthermore,the filing of the first claim must alert the defendant in the second claim of the need to begin investigating the facts which form the basis for the second claim.generally this means that the defendant in the first claim is the same one being sued in the second.citation.the second prerequisite essentially translates to a requirement that the facts of the two claims be identical or at least so similar that the defendant investigation of the first claim will put him in a position to fairly defend the second.citation.the third prerequisite of good faith and reasonable conduct on the part of the plaintiff is less clearly defined in the cases.but in addison state of california cal d,the supreme court did stress that the plaintiff filed his second claim a short time after tolling ended.downs,at.
equitable tolling in class action context 
the doctrine of equitable tolling has been applied in the context of class action lawsuits to toll a statute of limitations.in american pipe,supra,and crown cork,supra,the united states supreme court concluded that,under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,the filing of the class action can toll the statute of limitations with respect to individual members of the putative class until the class is denied certification.american pipe,at crown cork,at holding the filing of a class action tolls the statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class citation,not just as to intervenors.the crown cork court explained that,absent tolling,t he principal purposes of the class action procedure promotion of efficiency and economy of litigation would thereby be frustrated.citation.to protect the policies behind the class action procedure,the american pipe court held that the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action.crown cork,supra,at.
in jolly eli lilly cal d,the court evaluated whether the american cork tolling rule would apply to class actions in california.the jolly court observed that u nderlying the tolling rule of american pipe were two major policy considerations.the first was the protection of the class action device.in cases where class certification is denied for what the high court characterized as subtle factors,unforeseeable by class members,a rule that failed to protect putative class members from the statute of limitations after denial of certification would induce potential class members to file protective motions to intervene or to join in the event that a class was later found unsuitable,depriving class actions of the efficiency and economy of litigation which is a principal purpose of the procedure.quoting american pipe,supra,u.at citation.
the second consideration involved the effectuation of the purposes of the statute of limitations.the policies of ensuring essential fairness to defendants and of barring a plaintiff who has slept on his rights,the high court stated,are satisfied when,as here,a named plaintiff who is found to be representative of a class commences a suit and thereby notifies the defendants not only of the substantive claims being brought against them,but also of the number and generic identities of the potential plaintiffs who may participate in the judgment.quoting american pipe,supra,at.in these circumstances,the court concluded,the purposes of the statute of limitations would not be violated by a decision to toll.jolly eli lilly,supra,cal d at.
however,after considering these two purposes,the jolly court ultimately held that equitable tolling would not be applied to the particular class action under consideration there,because it concluded the class action lawsuit neither sufficiently put defendants on notice of the substance and nature of plaintiff claims,nor served to further economy and efficiency of litigation jolly eli lilly,supra,cal d at.jolly noted that because the class action lawsuit never put defendants on notice that personal injury damages were being sought on a class basis,it would be unfair to defendants to toll the statute of limitations on such personal injury actions.id.at.
equitable tolling of governmental claims requirement 
although equitable tolling principles have been applied to toll statutes of limitations,the parties have cited no cases that have considered whether the pendency of a prior class action lawsuit can equitably toll the time for filing a governmental claim indeed,the parties have cited no cases addressing whether,as here,a prior class action lawsuit in which the class was ultimately certified and the claims of the certified class were resolved can toll either the statute of limitations or the governmental claims requirements for claims by persons not within the class.accordingly,we are presented with a question of first impression whether,on the facts presented here,equitable tolling principles apply to extend the period within which crms was required to file a governmental claim 
we conclude a prior class action does not equitably toll or satisfy the governmental claims requirement for claimants not within the class description contained in a governmental claim on which the prior class action was predicated.we further conclude that,because the shames claim did not include crms,the shames action can not satisfy or toll the governmental claims requirement for crms.
as previously discussed,a plaintiff must ordinarily file his or her own claim,and may not sue to recover for his or her own injury in reliance on a claim filed by another injured party,even if the plaintiff injury was caused by the same transaction that injured the other party.see nelson county of los angeles th,nguyen los angeles county medical center,supra,th at roberts state of california,supra,d at pacific,supra,d at shelton superior court,supra,d at.this requirement is grounded in the recognition that i t is not the purpose of the claims statutes to prevent surprise pacific,at,but instead the purpose of the claim requirements is to provide a public entity with sufficient information to enable it to investigate and evaluate the merits of claims,assess liability,and,where appropriate,to settle claims without the expense of litigation.nguyen,at.these authorities make clear that,if shames had fi
