this case involves our government treatment of its veterans who contracted serious ailments as a result of their exposure to agent orange in the course of the military use of that toxic chemical as a defoliant during the vietnam war.it is a disturbing story,and the performance of the united states department of veterans affairs va has contributed substantially to our sense of national shame 
the issue before us on this occasion is a technical one.but it is symbolic of the problems that have plagued a significant group of veterans who deserve to receive our foremost care and attention.the present question is whether the district court,in a clarification and enforcement order issued in,reasonably interpreted the earlier stipulation and order sometimes referred to as consent decree that settled a class action lawsuit brought by veterans of the vietnam war sometimes referred to as plaintiff class or class plaintiffs.
in,the veterans successfully challenged a regulation of the va that imposed an erroneous standard for determining which diseases were associated with dioxin.congress thereupon enacted new legislation,the agent orange act of,stat,under which veterans who served in vietnam and later suffer from such diseases receive a presumption that their ailments are connected to their exposure to agent orange in vietnam.the diseases are deemed to be,and the veterans qualify for disability benefits.the ensuing stipulation and order provides that as soon as the va issues new determinations designating particular diseases as,it must readjudicate the claims of veterans suffering from them if their previously filed claims were denied or are still pending,and must then pay them retroactive benefits.nehmer veterans,cir nehmer iii.
in,the va issued a regulation finding chronic lymphocytic leukemia to be a disease that was associated with dioxin and thus,but the va did not readjudicate the prior claims of vietnam veterans suffering from that ailment.nor did it pay them retroactive benefits.the reason it offered for its failure to follow the provisions of the consent decree was that in its view the decree does not apply to diseases that it determines to be after september,the original sunset date of the agent orange act of.in,the plaintiff class,disputing this interpretation,filed a motion that the district court construed as a motion for clarification and enforcement of the decree.in,the district court rejected the va interpretation and granted the veterans motion.because we conclude that the district court construction of the decree is not only reasonable but correct,and that our veterans are presently entitled to the benefits at issue,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
agent orange 
agent orange is a chemical defoliant used by the united states armed forces in vietnam to clear dense jungle land during the war.it contains the toxic substance dioxin.since its use,agent orange has been statistically linked with the occurrence of many diseases in those exposed,including prostate cancer.for more than fifteen years now,for more than twenty years,veterans suffering from diseases they believe to have been caused by agent orange have struggled with the united states for compensation.nehmer iii,at citing in re agent orange prod.liab,cir nehmer veterans.nehmer i nehmer veterans,d nehmer ii.
b.the dioxin act and the challenge to the va regulations limiting the number of diseases 
the class action of which these proceedings are a part was initially filed against the va in by vietnam veterans who challenged a va regulation,governing their eligibility for disability benefits based on diseases associated with exposure to agent orange.nehmer iii,at nehmer i.at.the veterans claimed that the regulation did not comply with the veterans dioxin and radiation exposure compensation standards act of,stat.dioxin act.nehmer i.at.
the dioxin act dramatically alter ed the process governing veterans agent orange disability claims.id.at.rather than have the va determine in individual adjudicatory proceedings whether a particular veteran claimed disease was caused by agent orange exposure,the act authorize d the administrator of the va to conduct rulemaking to determine which diseases will be deemed service connected for all diseases claimed to be caused by agent orange exposure.id.at.
the regulation implementing the dioxin act provided that any veteran who served in vietnam shall be presumed to have been exposed to a herbicide containing dioxin while in vietnam.a b.but it also stated that only a single is sufficient to establish for resulting disability.id.a c see also id.a d stating that there is not a cause and effect relationship between dioxin exposure and porphyria cutanea tarda,soft tissue sarcomas,and a ny other disease besides chloracne.the district court invalidated the regulation because,although congress intended the va to predicate service connection upon a finding of a significant statistical association between dioxin exposure and various diseases,the va had erroneously required proof that a causal relationship existed.nehmer i.at.the district court also voided all adverse va benefit decisions based on the invalid regulation.id.at.
c.the agent orange act of 
after the district court invalidated the va regulation,congress enacted the agent orange act of,stat.the agent orange act was originally codified at,but six months later congress renumbered of title as.see department of veterans affairs codification act of,a,stat.because the relevant portion of the consent decree at issue in this action refers to b,we will refer to and interchangeably.
the agent orange act requires the secretary of the va to conduct new rulemaking proceedings to determine which diseases are sufficiently associated with exposure to agent orange so that veterans with approved diseases receive a presumption of.section b states that 
whenever the secretary determines,on the basis of sound medical and scientific evidence,that a positive association exists between a the exposure of humans to an herbicide agent,and b the occurrence of a disease in humans,the secretary shall prescribe regulations providing that a presumption of service connection is warranted for that disease for the purposes of this section.
in making determinations for the purpose of this subsection,the secretary shall take into account a reports received by the secretary from the national academy of sciences under section of the agent orange act of,and b all other sound medical and scientific information and analyses available to the secretary.
to develop the scientific information upon which to base determinations,of the agent orange act directed the secretary to enter into an agreement with the national academy of sciences for the academy to perform the services covered by this section,and under that agreement the academy was to review and summarize the scientific evidence,and assess the strength thereof,concerning the association between exposure to dioxin and each disease suspected to be associated with such exposure.agent orange act,b c.moreover,the academy was to submit its first report no later than months after the enactment of the agent orange act,and,thereafter submit periodic written reports at least once every two years as measured from the date of the first report.id.g.
furthermore,under the agent orange act,when the secretary received a report from the academy,he was required to determine within days whether a presumption of service connection is warranted for each disease covered by the report,and if he determined that a presumption is warranted,he was required to issue proposed regulations within days setting forth his determination and to issue final regulations within days after proposing them.c a,c.
finally,a of the agent orange act,as originally enacted,set forth a sunset date for the operation of the provisions that required the secretary to issue regulations designating diseases in response to the scientists reports.e,e subsections b through d shall cease to be effective years after the first day of the fiscal year in which the academy transmits to the secretary the first report under section of the agent orange act of.because a,codified as e or e,provided that its sunset date would be years after the first day of the fiscal year in which the academy transmitted its first report to the secretary,and the first report was transmitted on july,the original effective sunset date was september.
d.the veterans education and benefits expansion act of 
ten years after the passage of the agent orange act,congress enacted the veterans education and benefits expansion act of,stat.benefits expansion act,which,inter alia,amended the sunset date contained in e and extended the secretary authority to issue regulations designating ailments for another thirteen years as a result,the provisions in b,c and d have remained in effect since,and will continue to be effective until september,or until such other time as congress shall establish,should it enact another extension.see e subsections b through d shall cease to be effective on september.
e.the final stipulation and order entered in 
shortly after congress enacted the agent orange act on february,the va and the plaintiff class signed a stipulation and order or consent decree.on may,the district court entered the decree,setting forth va ongoing responsibilities for further rulemaking and disability payments to class members.nehmer iii,at.
under paragraph of the decree,the veterans advisory committee on environmental the dioxin act had complete its analysis as to whether the scientific or medical evidence reveals a connection between exposure to dioxin and diabetes,lung cancer and peripheral neuropathy and convey its evaluations and any recommendations to the secretary.under paragraph,after reviewing the advisory committee analysis of these three diseases,the secretary was to initiate rulemaking in order to determine whether they were,or alternatively to defer rulemaking if the information was insufficient.
furthermore,paragraphs and established the va obligation to readjudicate veterans disability claims whenever the va in the future finds new diseases to be under the procedures set forth in b renumbered subsequently at b,and to pay retroactive benefits based on the date that a veteran filed his claim or became disabled,whichever is later.paragraph provides that 
as soon as a final rule is issued service connecting,based on dioxin exposure,any disease which may be service connected in the future pursuant to the agent orange act of,b,the va shall promptly thereafter readjudicate all claims for any such disease which were voided by the court order of may,as well as adjudicate all similar claims filed subsequent to the court may,order,without waiting for final rules to be issued on any other diseases.
nehmer iii,at.paragraph provides that 
for any disease which may be service connected in the future pursuant to paragraph above,as to any details of claims which were voided as a result of the court may,order,the effective date for disability compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation dic,if the claim is allowed upon readjudication pursuant to paragraphs and above,will be the date the claim giving rise to the voided decision was filed for any claim for any such disease which was not filed until after may,the effective date for beginning disability compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation dic will be the date the claim was filed or the date the claimant became disabled or death occurred,whichever is later.
stipulation order.as a result of the va rulemaking,the agency has found that a number of cancers are linked to agent orange using the appropriate standard,and,as a result,they have been accorded service connected status.nehmer ii,d at.
f.a prior appeal confirms the retroactive application of the consent decree 
for the past sixteen years since he entered the consent decree,judge thelton henderson has enforced compliance with the stip ulation order and adjudicated disputes concerning its interpretation.nehmer iii,at internal citations omitted.in,several disputes arose between the va and the veterans,which required judge henderson in the first instance and this court on appeal to interpret the language of the decree.nehmer ii,d at nehmer iii,at.in,the va determined prostate cancer to be,thus reaching the opposite conclusion from the one it had reached when it adopted its regulations.the va,however,contended that it wa s not required to pay retroactive prostate cancer benefits accruing,in most cases,back to the date of the veteran first claim for such benefits to any veteran suffering from prostate cancer whose earlier claim was denied under the valid regulations.nehmer iii,at.the district court rejected the va interpretation,holding that the consent decree requires the va to provide retroactive benefits to any class member who submitted a claim after may,based on a disease that is later determined to be service connected under the agent orange act.id.it then granted the veterans motion to enforce the consent decree.id.we affirmed,because we held the district court interpretation of the consent decree to be reasonable.id.
specifically,we concluded that t he plain language and remedial purpose of the consent decree indicate that va agreed to pay retroactive benefits to all claimants whose claims were filed after,if and when the disease from which they suffer is determined to be service connected under the agent orange act.id.at.accordingly,veterans who applied for benefits anytime after,and whose claims had been denied were to receive a readjudication of those claims and retroactive benefits,if the va subsequently determined the disease from which they suffered to be,even if such veterans claims were originally denied under valid regulations.id.at.
g.the va finds chronic lymphocytic leukemia to be in,but fails to readjudicate claims or pay retroactive benefits 
on january,the national academy of sciences transmitted to the secretary a report,veterans and agent orange update.the report evaluated the scientific evidence regarding the association between herbicide exposure and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll,and found sufficient evidence of an association.disease associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents chronic lymphocytic leukemia.in response to the academy report,on march,the va issued a proposed rule,which announced that the secretary has determined that there is a positive association between the exposure of humans to an herbicide agent and the occurrence of cll in humans and that the secretary has determined that a presumption of service connection for cll is warranted pursuant to b.id.at.
on october,the va issued a final rule determining chronic lymphocytic leukemia to be.disease associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents chronic lymphocytic leukemia.in that final rule,however,the va explained its view that the consent decree requirement that the va pay retroactive benefits when the va establishes that a disease is does not apply to benefits based on a disease for which the secretary of veterans affairs establishes a presumption of service connection after september,the original effective sunset date of the agent orange act,e.id.this part of the final rule echoed the va opinion expressed in a separate final rule issued earlier in.see effective dates of benefits for disability or death caused by herbicide exposure disposition of unpaid benefits after death of beneficiary,to be codified at stating that the va authority to issue regulatory presumptions of service connection expired on september,and specifically that the consent decree entered by judge henderson did not intend to incorporate subsequent changes in the law,namely the extension of the va authority to determine that diseases are under b,as set forth in the benefits expansion act of 
after the va determined that chronic lymphocytic leukemia was,it failed to take any action to readjudicate the claims of veterans with that affliction,or to pay them retroactive benefits.in response,on june,the class plaintiffs filed a motion for an order to show cause why the va should not be held in contempt of the court final stipulation and order due to its refusal to readjudicate the pertinent disability claims and to pay retroactive benefits.in a december,order,the district court converted the motion for an order to show cause into a motion for clarification and enforcement of the consent decree,because the essence of the current motion is a request that the court interpret,clarify,or construct particular terms of the stip ulation order.noting that the heading of plaintiffs argument is plaintiffs merely seek to enforce the stipulated order.in the same december,order,the district court rejected the va contention that because provides that the court of appeals for the federal circuit has exclusive jurisdiction to entertain direct challenges to va regulations,it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to interpret the consent decree.
after receiving additional briefing,on december,the district court granted the motion for clarification and enforcement,holding that the terms of the stipulation and order shall continue in effect until expiration of the agent orange act as extended.the district court concluded that the plain language of the consent decree supported the veterans view that the consent decree applies to diseases determined to be after,as well as before,september.it found compelling paragraph reference to b of the agent orange act,which requires the secretary to issue regulations establishing diseases after receiving reports from the academy,and its failure to refer to e,the sunset provision of that act.moreover,the district court explained that giving full effect to the consent decree retroactive benefits provision furthers the remedial purpose of the consent decree that we had recognized in nehmer iii.at.
the va filed a timely notice of appeal from the december,order,and subsequently sought a stay pending appeal.on april,the district court denied the va motion for a stay and also established a procedure for processing the claims of veterans with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in accordance with the consent decree.on june,the va filed a second notice of appeal from april,order,and subsequently filed a motion to consolidate the two appeals,which we granted on september.
ii.standard of review 
the existence of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law reviewed de novo.united states peninsula commc ns,cir.this court reviews de novo a district court interpretation of a consent decree but will give deference to the district court interpretation based on the court extensive oversight of the decree from the commencement of the litigation to the current appeal.a court of appeals will uphold a district court reasonable interpretation of a consent decree.nehmer iii,at quoting gates gomez,cir.
iii.jurisdiction 
before we consider whether the district court reasonably interpreted the consent decree,we must examine our own subject matter jurisdiction over the underlying motion for clarification and the instant appeal.the va contends that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff class motion,because the motion challenges a va regulation and provides that such challenges may be brought only in the federal circuit.if the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the motion for that reason,then neither do we,the va correctly argues.we reject the va contention that the district court lacked jurisdiction 
ordinarily,when a district court incorporates the terms of a settlement agreement or a stipulation into an order,it retains subject matter jurisdiction to interpret and enforce the contents of that order.flanagan arnaiz,cir stating that although the e nforcement of a settlement agreement requires its own basis for jurisdiction a basis for jurisdiction may be furnished by separate provision such as a provision retaining jurisdiction over the settlement agreement or by incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement in the order.quoting kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d see also sandpiper vill.condo.ass,cir citing flanagan,at.
because judge henderson incorporated the terms of the stipulation and order into the order that he entered on may,he concededly retained jurisdiction to interpret and enforce the terms of the stipulation and order,and,therefore,he ordinarily would plainly have jurisdiction to consider the plaintiff class motion for clarification and enforcement of the stipulation and order.see flanagan,at.
the va accepts this unexceptionable proposition and does not dispute that the district court retained jurisdiction to supervise implementation of the consent decree.the va,however,rests its argument regarding subject matter jurisdiction on its contention that in light of the federal circuit exclusive jurisdiction to entertain direct challenges to va regulations under the district court has been divested of its jurisdiction to interpret the consent decree,at least with respect to determinations made after september.its argument is as follows following the district court issuance of the consent decree,the va enacted a regulation which in effect declared that the decree did not intend to incorporate the terms of the benefits expansion act amending the sunset date of the pertinent provision of the agent orange act.at.any challenge to that regulation,must be brought in the federal circuit.
provides that a n action of the secretary to which section a or of title or both refers is subject to judicial review.such review shall be in accordance with chapter of title and may be sought only in the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit.on two prior occasions,we have addressed the scope of.see preminger principi,cir,and chinnock turnage,cir.in preminger,we explained that 
section gives the federal circuit exclusive jurisdiction to review challenges to most actions by the secretary of veterans affairs.in particular,applies to actions that require publication in the federal register,such as rules of procedure,substantive rules of general applicability,statements of general policy,and amendments,revisions,or repeals to those actions,under a and agency rulemaking,under.thus,congress explicitly has provided for judicial review of direct challenges to va rules and regulations only in the federal circuit accordingly,any direct challenge to a regulation validity must be brought in the federal circuit.
id.at.in preminger,we drew a distinction between facial challenges to va regulations,which are subject to exclusive judicial review in the federal circuit,and challenges,which are subject to appellate review in this court,and we exercised our appellate jurisdiction over an challenge brought in a district court to a va regulation that banned partisan activity on the va property.id.
the va contends that the veterans motion for clarification and enforcement is a facial challenge to,the regulation adopted by the va in a final rule on august.at,as well as to the va final rule that determined chronic lymphocytic leukemia to be.at.section purports to set forth the rules required by orders of judge henderson in this case,a,while the final rule determining chronic lymphocytic leukemia to be contains the va argument as to why it believes that the consent decree should not be interpreted to require the payment of retroactive benefit payments to veterans with that disease the determination was made after september,the original sunset date for the agent orange act provision.the va also argues that the motion is not an challenge to the regulations,a contention with which the plaintiff class agrees.
the plaintiff class argues in opposition that its motion for clarification and enforcement of the consent decree does not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of because the motion does not directly challenge either the merits of the va regulation or the va rulemaking authority.see preminger,at congress explicitly has provided for judicial review of direct challenges to va rules and regulations only in the federal circuit.emphasis added.nor,according to the veterans,does the motion urge the district this invalidate the regulations.instead,they assert that the motion challenges the actions of the va in failing to comply with the terms of the consent of the existence of the va that in october the va determined that chronic lymphocytic leukemia was but then failed to take the actions of readjudicating past claims and paying retroactive benefits,which are explicitly mandated by paragraphs and of the decree.
we agree with the veterans that their motion does not directly challenge the va regulations.as the district court concluded,in addressing the motion for clarification and enforcement,it is only the stip ulation order that must be interpreted to determine whether the plain language of paragraphs and applies to the claims of veterans suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia.because the district court was neither asked nor required to engage in judicial review of the va regulations in order to clarify the terms of the consent decree,does not divest it of subject matter jurisdiction.
notably,the plaintiff class motion that gave rise to this appeal solely challenged the va failure to act,and not the va regulations themselves.the motion stated that the va had failed to follow paragraph because i t has not identified and readjudicated cll claims that were denied between september,and may,the date of the district court order in nehmer i,or cll claims that were pending or filed between may,and the date of the cll regulation,and for cll claims that were pending on the date of the cll regulation and thereafter granted,the va has wrongfully assigned the publication date of the cll regulation as the effective date instead of the date the cll claim was filed,as required by paragraph of the consent decree.moreover,the veterans made clear in their brief in support of the motion that they merely seek to enforce the stipulated order and ask only for an order requiring the va to follow the terms of paragraphs and,and to permit discovery in order to identify which class members had been denied compensation under the decree.
in granting the motion,the district court confirmed that the veterans motion was based on the va refusal to pay retroactive benefits to veterans whose diseases have been deemed service connected after the original sunset date of the agent orange act in.as the district court had previously concluded in its jurisdictional order,the essence of the current motion is a request that the court interpret,clarify,or construct particular terms of the stip ulation and order,and not a request to review or invalidate a va regulation.moreover,when the va briefed the merits regarding the interpretation of the consent decree in the district court,the va did not argue that that any other be bound by the va own interpretation of the decree espoused in its regulations.instead,the va argument relied on the plain language of the decree and additional extrinsic evidence,again suggesting that the district court was not called upon to engage in judicial review of a va regulation.still,even if the va had raised the existence of the regulations as a defense to the veterans motion for clarification,the assertion of that defense would not convert the veterans motion to a direct facial challenge to va regulations.
furthermore,even if we were to construe the plaintiff class motion as a direct facial challenge to the va regulations,we still could not accept the va argument that divests the district court of its continuing jurisdiction to interpret and enforce its decree.as the district court correctly concluded,the statements in the va regulations expressing the va view of the meaning of the consent decree that it entered into many years earlier does not constitute an exercise of the agency rulemaking function referred to in,but rather of a function more akin to adjudication.indeed,to put it more accurately,the va expression of its position in a contested judicial matter is more like the function of advocacy,undertaken when the agency is a party to litigation,rather than of adjudication.under such circumstances,the va statement of its views does not fall within the scope of.lefevre sec y,dep t of veterans affairs,stating that under the federal circuit may review substantive rules of general applicability,statements of general policy and interpretations of general applicability because these are all actions to which section a refers,and that rule making is legislative in nature,is primarily concerned with policy considerations for the future rather than the evaluation of past conduct,and looks not to the evidentiary facts but to conclusions to be drawn from the facts.citations and internal quotations omitted griffin dep t of veterans affairs,d,quoting lefevre,at.
the gravamen of the va regulations is a legal argument that the consent its inception and based on its language and surrounding not intend to mandate readjudication or retroactive benefit payments for claims based on diseases that the va determines to be after the original sunset date of the agent orange act,e,september.the va analysis in the regulations almost entirely relies upon the application of generally applicable contract law principles to the consent decree,see.at effective dates of benefits for disability or death caused by herbicide exposure disposition of unpaid benefits after death of beneficiary,and,thus,the va engaged in the same exercise of interpretation of the court decree in which the court itself subsequently engaged when issuing the order from which the va now appeals.see.at stating that the stipulation and order must be interpreted in accordance with general principles of contract law,that unless the parties provide otherwise,a contract is presumed to incorporate the law that existed at the time the contract was made,and that any regulation diseases after september,are beyond the express scope of the nehmer stipulation and order emphasis added.this is a function for the court to perform,not the party appearing before it,even an administrative agency.the va retrospective evaluation of past conduct,including an analysis of evidentiary facts,does not constitute rulemaking,the review of which congress placed in the exclusive province of the federal circuit.see lefevre,at.in sum,even if the motion for clarification and enforcement constituted a direct challenge to the va regulations,we would hold that because the regulations do not contain substantive rules,statements or interpretations of general applicability,they fall outside the scope of.id.citing defining the term rule under the administrative procedure act 
finally,the va can not usurp the power of a district court to construe the provisions of an order it has issued or divest that court of its authority and transfer it to the federal circuit simply by issuing a regulation interpreting that order or declining to follow it.it is well established that the district court has the inherent authority to enforce compliance with a consent decree that it has entered in an order,to hold parties in contempt for violating the terms therein,and to modify a decree.see rufo inmates of the suffolk county jail,d spallone united states,d holland new jersey of,cir stone city and county of,cir keith volpe,cir see also.b frew ex rel.frew hawkins,d federal courts are not reduced to approving consent decrees and hoping for compliance.once entered,a consent decree may be enforced.that the district court preserves such inherent authority presupposes that it,and not a party before it,is the principal and proper arbiter with the responsibility to interpret the decree and oversee the litigation.although a party may ask the district court to issue an order clarifying,enforcing,or modifying a decree and suggest a favored interpretation,a a private or public dictate the meaning of the decree to the court or relieve itself of its obligations under the decree without the district court approval.furthermore,the importance of the district court role in interpreting a consent decree is further evidenced by the discretion that we afford district courts in reviewing their interpretations,particularly when the district court has overseen a remedial decree for many years.see nehmer iii,at quoting gates,at stone,at.
in this case,the va urges us to hold that an executive agency that has been ordered by a district court to take various actions in order to comply with the law can remove itself from that court authority and ignore its orders simply by enshrining its interpretation of a consent decree in a regulation which only an appeals court in another circuit may review.but the substantive effect of such a holding would be to give the va the right to unilaterally withdraw the jurisdiction of the district court and of this circuit.while congress has the power under article iii of the constitution to define the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts,magana northern mariana islands,cir,an executive agency does not have that same authority.we are unwilling to read as granting to the va the power to unilaterally eliminate jurisdiction of a district court,to forfeit that court right to supervise and implement its own equitable orders,and to redirect what is effectively a motion to vacate an injunction from a district court to a court of appeals in another circuit.finally,the va proffered interpretation of would raise a most troubling question of separation of powers under the constitution,a question that,because the va argument fails for so many other reasons,we need not definitively answer today.
iv.discussion 
on the merits,this appeal presents a single question regarding the interpretation of the consent decree whether paragraphs and require the va to readjudicate the previously filed claims of veterans who suffer from diseases that are determined to be,pursuant to b,and to make retroactive payments to those veterans,in instances in which the determination is made subsequent to september.the district court answered this question in the affirmative,on the basis of the plain language of the decree.in view of judge henderson longstanding,extensive and diligent oversight of the nehmer consent decree,we must affirm his interpretation of the decree so long as it is reasonable.nehmer iii,at citing gates gomez,cir.because we conclude that judge henderson interpretation is not only reasonable but correct,we affirm.
a consent decree,which has attributes of a contract and a judicial act,is construed with reference to ordinary contract principles.city of las vegas clark county,cir citing washington penwell,cir see also united states asarco,cir c ourts treat consent decrees as contracts for enforcement purposes.a consent decree,like a contract,must be discerned within its four corners,extrinsic evidence being relevant only to resolve ambiguity in the decree.asarco,at.therefore,if the plain language of a consent decree is clear,we need not evaluate any extrinsic evidence to ascertain the true intent of the parties.id.at discussing united states itt cont l baking,d,and united states armour,d molski gleich,cir gates rowland,cir naacp unified sch,cir.as we explained in molski,it is particularly appropriate in class action litigation to resolve the meaning of a consent decree based on its plain language,if possible,because a member of the class who was not present at any negotiations would be at a disadvantage in presenting extrinsic evidence of the meaning of the consent decree.at.
turning to the plain language of the stipulation and order,the language that bears on the question whether the va must readjudicate previously filed claims for diseases after is found in paragraph,which states that 
as soon as a final rule is issued service connecting,based on dioxin exposure,any disease which may be service connected in the future pursuant to the agent orange act of,b,the va shall promptly thereafter readjudicate all claims for any such disease 
nehmer iii,at emphasis added.as discussed above,b requires the secretary to issue regulations providing that a presumption of service connection is warranted for a particular disease whenever he determines that there is a positive association between exposure of humans to dioxin and the occurrence of that disease.b renumbered at b.there can be no doubt that b is still in effect and that the va is still required by that provision to make determinations of.
the va contends,however,that the reference to b in paragraph demonstrates the intent of the parties to place a temporal limit on the life of the consent decree,measured by the time period contained in e,and that even though b remains in effect,the requirements of the consent decree do not.at the time the decree was entered,the va asserts,the parties understood that b would expire in about or years,and the decree therefore does not contemplate incorporating future changes to,including any extension by congress of the period in which that provision remains in effect.
the district court,relying on the plain language of paragraph any disease which may be service connected in the future pursuant to the agent orange act of,b rejected the va argument.it explained that 
the stipulation and order contains no hard deadline.instead,it mandates retroactive payment for all diseases that may be service connected in the future.stip ulation order.the agreement contains no other provision regarding its temporal longevity it does not cite the year sunset provision of the aoa e,nor does it incorporate the provision by reference.
next,acknowledging that each party contends that its own position is the only possible one in light of the plain language,the district court concluded that 
t he court finds that plaintiffs are correct and defendants are wrong.the plain terms of paragraph of the stip ulation order obligate defendants to continue making retroactive payments for any and all diseases that are deemed service connected pursuant to the agent orange act aoa.defendants obligations are plainly tied to the life of section b of the aoa,as the explicit terms of the stip ulation order provide.as long as section b is in effect,the stip ulation order applies.due to the passage of the benefits and expansion act of,section b lives on,and so,therefore,does the stip ulation order.
the district court interpretation of the plain language of paragraph is not only reasonable,it is also the only correct interpretation.first,the phrase any disease which may be service connected in the future pursuant to the agent orange act of,b,plainly refers to the designation of any disease made by the va pursuant to the agent orange act,without any time limitation.the consent decree has no deadline and contains no temporal language other than the broad and phrase in the future.moreover,paragraph refers to the provisions of b of that act,not to the sunset language contained in subsection e.if paragraph had referred to generally,the va argument that the parties intended to limit the life of the decree to the period prescribed by the sunset provision in subsection e might have been colorable although we would not have agreed with it,but the consent decree made no such general reference.
most important,the terms of subsection b to which the consent decree refers have remained the same since the inception of the decree.the change to the sunset clause in subsection e,made in,resulted in no modification to the language of subsection b.the subsection b in force when the consent decree was issued,and the subsection b to which the decree refers,is the identical subsection b on which the va based its actions when it determined chronic lymphocytic leukemia to be in.the pertinent provision did not change,and the va obligations under paragraph remained the same in as they were on the day the decree first was entered.in sum,we agree with the district court that the consent decree is plain on its face the va must reconsider the previous denial of a claim of a veteran suffering from a disease determined by the va to be regardless of when the determination is made,so long as that determination is made pursuant to b 
because the district court interpretation is compelled by the clear language of the consent decree,we do not consider any extrinsic evidence.asarco,at molski,at gates,at.even if we were to do so,however,the extrinsic evidence would not cause us to reject the district court interpretation.in fact,the surrounding circumstances cut more in favor of the veterans position than the va.the va contention that the parties did not include an express deadline in the consent decree because they could not iden
