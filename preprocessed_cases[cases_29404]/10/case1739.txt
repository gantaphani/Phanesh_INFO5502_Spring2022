introduction 
the question before us is whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying a motion to certify a class under proposition.plaintiff augusto ticconi sued his health insurance provider defendant blue shield of california life and health insurance company blue shield life under the unfair competition law bus,the ucl.plaintiff alleged that blue shield life violated insurance code sections and by failing to attach his application to or endorse it on the insurance policy when issued,and later rescinding the policy on the ground he had made misrepresentations in that application.plaintiff also alleged that blue shield life engaged in postclaims underwriting prohibited by section.the trial court denied plaintiff motion for certification of a class of similarly situated insureds on the ground that blue shield life defenses of fraud and unclean hands raised individual issues that predominated over the common issues related to liability.plaintiff appeals.
we conclude that the trial court erred as a matter of law in ruling on the motion for class certification.the equitable defense of unclean hands is not available in a ucl action based on the violation of statutes such as sections and.also,sections and preclude an insurer from raising the defense of fraud based on statements that an insured made in an application for insurance if the application had not been attached to or endorsed on the policy when issued.therefore,the trial court relied on erroneous legal assumptions in ruling that the individual issues raised by the defenses of unclean hands and fraud predominated over the common issues pertaining to liability.accordingly,we reverse the order with instructions.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff alleged that he applied for a policy of health and accidental death insurance from blue shield life.blue shield life markets such policies as temporary,coverage to individuals,such as college students or those changing jobs,who need insurance while they are waiting for permanent coverage.
plaintiff alleged he answered truthfully all health questions posed on the policy application.blue shield life issued plaintiff a policy effective january,which had a duration of one year and was after days.the policy contained language that encouraged plaintiff to examine the policy during this period.his application was neither attached to the policy nor endorsed onto it when the policy was issued.once the period lapsed,plaintiff paid his monthly premiums.
during the policy period,plaintiff alleged,he required significant health care services which resulted in bills totaling well over.however,after he submitted the bills to blue shield life for payment,blue shield life rescinded his policy based on its view that plaintiff had made material misrepresentations in his application for insurance about the condition of his health.plaintiff denied that he made any material misrepresentations in the application and alleged that a reasonable investigation would have shown this.
in his ensuing complaint,plaintiff alleged that blue shield life issued his policy without attaching a copy of his application to,or endorsing a copy upon,the policy when issued in violation of section,which forbids the incorporation of an application by reference he alleged,although he did not make any misrepresentations in the application,that pursuant to section he was not bound by any statement made therein because that document had not been attached to or endorsed on the policy when issued.he also alleged that in the prior four years,blue shield life had rescinded a large number of policies that did not have the applications attached to or endorsed on the policies.the thrust of the complaint was that blue shield life rescission of the policy violated sections,and.hence,the rescission of the policy was an unfair and unlawful business practice under the ucl 
thereafter,plaintiff moved for certification of the class pursuant to business and professions code section plaintiff proposed that the class be defined as all california residents who were issued a policy of health insurance by blue shield life and who thereafter had the policy rescinded by blue shield life since march,based upon alleged misrepresentations contained in the policy application.this class specifically excludes any policyholders whose policy was issued in connection with an employee welfare benefit plan governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa.
in opposing the certification motion,blue shield life explained that policies are wholly underwritten through the questions on the application.applicants must be able to answer no truthfully to the application medical questions to qualify for coverage.an applicant who answers yes to any question is unqualified for coverage.of the health insurance policies blue shield life issued between january,and june,it rescinded for misrepresentation.
blue shield life argued that the class lacked the element required for certification.there existed no predominant question of law or fact that would make relief on a basis appropriate,it argued.blue shield life explained that the class that plaintiff sought to certify is of people who have had their policies rescinded because the insured defrauded blue shield life or otherwise misrepresented his or her health status when applying for coverage.blue shield life asserted that such a class is not easily ascertainable because it is comprised of people having varying degrees of unclean hands.moreover,the company contended,some members of the putative class may have been injured from blue shield life rescission,whereas others may not have any claim of damage,thus necessitating individual examination of the relative balance of equities in each case to determine whether equitable relief under the ucl would be appropriate.finally,blue shield life argued that plaintiff was neither a typical class member nor an adequate representative.
in connection with its opposition,blue shield life listed examples from individual cases in which it had rescinded policies,purportedly not to demonstrate the merits of its rescission decision but to demonstrate the range of individual issues that would arise in resolving the ucl claim for each class member.
the trial court denied plaintiff class certification motion.it ruled that the remedy each class member sought,voiding the rescission of their insurance policies,was of no benefit to each class member without a separate trial on the merits as to each plaintiff because each individual case would turn on its own unique circumstances.the court explained,equity under business and professions code section necessitates litigating individual issues of fraud and unclean hands before policies could be reinstated.hence,common questions of fact do not predominate.plaintiff timely appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
code of civil procedure section authorizes class actions when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court the party seeking certification has the burden to establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among class members.citations.drug stores,superior court cal th,d.
the certification question is essentially a procedural one that does not ask whether an action is legally or factually meritorious.citation.the community of interest requirement for class certification embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.citation.plaintiffs have the burden to establish the requisite community of interest and that the proponent of certification must show,inter alia,that questions of law or fact common to the class predominate over the questions affecting the individual members.citation.lockheed martin superior court cal th,d.
the ultimate question in every case of this type is whether the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.citations.lockheed martin superior court,supra,cal th at,d,accord drug stores,superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
because trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action,they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification.the denial of certification to an entire class is an appealable order citations,but in the absence of other error,a trial court ruling supported by substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous legal assumptions were made citation citation.under this standard,an order based upon improper criteria or incorrect assumptions calls for reversal even though there may be substantial evidence to support the court order.citations.accordingly,we must examine the trial court reasons for denying class certification.any valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.citation.linder thrifty oil cal th,d,citing richmond dart industries,cal d,accord,drug stores,superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
here,the trial court gave one chief reason for its ruling.the court observed that blue shield life defenses of fraud and unclean hands raised individual factual issues such that adjudication on a basis would not be beneficial.plaintiff contends that the trial court relied on an erroneous legal assumption about whether unclean hands constituted a defense to the particular ucl claim presented here.
the trial court made erroneous legal assumptions when it denied plaintiff class certification motion.
unfair competition under the ucl means any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising and any act prohibited by section,the false advertising law.bus.the ucl scope is broad.by defining unfair competition to include any unlawful business act or practice citation,the ucl permits violations of other laws to be treated as unfair competition that is independently actionable.citation.kasky nike,cal th,d.
an unlawful business activity includes anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.citation.citation.virtually any,state or serve as a predicate for an action under business and professions code section.citation.smith state farm mutual automobile ins.th,d.
the unfair standard,the second prong of business and professions code section,also provides an independent basis for relief.this standard is intentionally broad,thus allowing courts maximum discretion to prohibit new schemes to defraud.citation.the test of whether a business practice is unfair involves an examination of that practice impact on its alleged victim,balanced against the reasons,justifications and motives of the alleged wrongdoer.in brief,the court must weigh the utility of the defendant conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim citations.citation.a n unfair business practice occurs when that practice offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral,unethical,oppressive,unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.citation.citation.smith state farm mutual automobile ins,supra,th at,d.
b.the insurance code 
the unlawful conduct alleged here is postclaims underwriting by rescinding disability insurance policies based on alleged misrepresentations in the applications for insurance,which applications were incorporated by reference to,but not endorsed on or attached to,insured applications,in violation of sections and.
postclaims underwriting of disability insurance is prohibited by section particularly with low limits policies,insurers may choose not to incur the expense of investigating every application received before issuing the policy.instead,subject to the policy incontestability clause,insurers may wait until a claim arises to check the accuracy of the insured declarations and application this is often referred to as postclaims underwriting.no insurer issuing or providing disability insurance covering hospital,medical or surgical expenses may engage in postclaim underwriting.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group to,italics added.
as noted,section prohibits incorporating applications into a disability insurance policy by reference unless they are endorsed upon or attached to the policies when issued.see fn,supra.if a copy of an application for a policy is not attached to or endorsed on the policy when the policy is issued,then the insured is not bound by statements made in that application.
sections,and are not solely statements of insurance policy interpretation as blue shield life would have it.the practice of postclaims underwriting is categorically prohibited.accord croskey et,supra,to,italics added.and section is part of the law regulating and prescribing the standard provisions required to be included in disability policies in addition to the interpretation of such policies.summary from of justice to governor may,regarding assem.bill,stats,ch,italics added.section was designed to repeat a provision of section ibid.and separately establishes a consequence for the violation of section.accordingly,unless a copy of such application is attached to or endorsed on the policy when issued as a part thereof,the insured shall not be bound by any statement made in an application for a policy,italics added.
another consequence of violating sections and is that the insurer may not invoke the defense of misrepresentations in or omissions from the unattached and unendorsed application see,telford new york life ins.cal d.in telford,the defendant insurer had voided the plaintiff wife insurance policy on the ground the wife had made misrepresentations in her application for insurance and concealed information about her medical condition.id.at.acknowledging that false representations or concealments of material fact vitiate the policy id.at,the supreme court nonetheless held that the insured was not bound by certain of her statements contained in that portion of the application that had not been attached to the policy the written statement in that respect was not included in that portion of the application which was attached to the policy,and failure to make a full disclosure concerning the treatments and observation may not therefore afford a basis for a defense by the defendant.id.at,italics added.therefore,the following conduct is unlawful failing to attach applications to or endorse them on disability policies when issued and later engaging in postclaims underwriting by holding insureds to statements in those unattached and unendorsed applications as grounds for voiding or rescinding the policies.such unlawful conduct,if proven,would serve as a predicate unlawful practice to a ucl cause of action.
given that sections,and provide consequences for their violation,blue shield life reliance on samura kaiser foundation health plan,th,d,to argue that sections and are regulatory in nature and do not provide a basis for a ucl action because they do not proscribe any conduct is unavailing.samura involved certain regulatory provisions of the act health,that do not define an unlawful act that could be enjoined as unfair competition under the ucl relevant to that case.samura,supra,at,d.the regulatory power defined in the sections of the act at issue in samura was entrusted exclusively to the department of corporations,preempting the common law powers of the attorney general.id.at,d.
by comparison,as explained,section explicitly makes postclaims underwriting unlawful and thus provides a basis for an injunction under the ucl.samura kaiser foundation health plan,supra,th at,d.furthermore,failing to comply with section,as explained,has important consequences for the violator not only is the waiver of the prohibition against attachment by reference void,but the insurer who omits to attach the application to or endorse it on the policy when issued may not bind the insured to any statements made in that application.
common issues of law and fact dominate plaintiff liability claims.
plaintiff complaint alleges that blue shield life has been binding insureds to the statements they made in their applications by using those statements as justification for rescinding policies after claims were filed,even when blue shield life had not attached the applications to,or endorsed them on,the policies when issued.such conduct,if proven,violates the insurance code.if proven,this conduct is also,it seems to us,an unfair business practice.plaintiff has pled the violation of statutes,which statutes can serve as a basis for,and be enjoined under,business and professions code section.
to summarize,plaintiff has defined the class to include all california residents who were issued a policy of health insurance by blue shield life that is not governed by erisa and who thereafter had the policy rescinded by blue shield life since march,based upon alleged misrepresentations contained in the policy application.the factual and legal issues that go to liability are universal to all class members,with the result that common issues of law and fact would predominate.
d.the defenses of fraud and unclean hands are not available in this ucl cause of action,with the result that individual issues of law and fact concerning blue shield life defenses would not outweigh the common issues of liability.
turning to the rationale for denying plaintiff class certification motion,as explained,the trial court found that legal and factual issues concerning the defenses of fraud and unclean hands outweighed those related to liability rendering class treatment disadvantageous.however,the equitable defense of unclean hands is not available in this ucl action based on violation of statutes,namely,sections,and.courts have long held that the equitable defense of unclean hands is not a defense to an unfair trade or business practices claim based on violation of a statute.to allow such a defense would be to judicially sanction the defendant for engaging in an act declared by statute to be void or against public policy.see kofsky smart final iris d,holding unclean hands defense not available in an unfair practices act violation under bus,et.it has long been the law that t he equitable doctrine of the refusal of aid to anyone with unclean hands,does not,as such,apply to actions under the unfair practices act.page bakersfield uniform.d.kofsky points out that the doctrine of refusing to aid a party with unclean hands has no application where,as here the failure to restrain an act because the parties are in pari delicto would result in permitting an act declared by statute to be void or against public policy.citations.d at,see also stern,bus,practice,supra,to fletcher security pacific national bank cal d,holding court may order defendant bank to disgorge gains obtained from fraudulent business practice,even without individualized proof of deception to prevent bank from retaining benefits of its wrong and being insulated from any damages.
more recently,our supreme court explained that equitable defenses may not be asserted to wholly defeat a ucl claim under bus,since such claims arise out of unlawful conduct cortez purolator air filtration products cal th,d.in cortez,the plaintiff brought an action under the ucl seeking restitution of overtime wages withheld from her and other employees.the defendant argued that where the ucl sounded in equity,the trial court was obligated to consider equitable defenses.the supreme court held that the equities may be considered when the trial court exercises its discretion to fashion a remedy under business and professions code section.ibid.but,equitable defenses may not be used to defeat the cause of action under the ucl.as more fully explained by justice werdegar in her concurrence in cortez,in general,as between a person who is enriched as the result of his or her violation of the law,and a person intended to be protected by the law who is harmed by its violation,for the violator to retain the benefit would be unjust.cortez,supra,at,d,conc.opn.of werdegar,
accordingly,blue shield life should not be entitled to raise the equitable defense of unclean hands to defeat plaintiff motion for class certification.to allow an insurer to argue as a defense to the ucl claim that putative class plaintiffs have unclean hands because they misrepresented material medical information on unattached and unendorsed insurance applications,would be potentially to sanction the insurer unlawful and unfair conduct.cortez purolator air filtration products,supra,cal th at,d,conc.opn.of werdegar,page bakersfield uniform,supra,d at.kofsky smart final iris,supra,d at.of course,the trial court has the discretion to consider equitable defenses such as unclean hands in creating the remedies authorized by business and professions code section.cortez,supra,at,d.such defenses may not be used,however,to wholly defeat the ucl cause of action ibid,and so they may not be used to prevent class certification.
nor is fraud available as a defense to defeat plaintiff motion for class certification.insofar as blue shield life failed to attach its insureds applications to or endorse them on the policies,those insureds would not be bound by any statements made in those application s and a ny waiver of the provisions of this section would be void.to raise unclean hands and fraud based on statements in the application to defeat plaintiff motion for class certification,blue shield life would need to hold insureds to those statements.yet,not only would that violate section provision and the very sanction that section provides for failure to attach or endorse the applications to the policy,but blue shield life necessarily would have to rely on a defense that is specifically denied insurance companies by the supreme court.telford new york life ins,supra,cal d at.
blue shield life reliance on brasure optimum choice ins.d is unavailing.brasure is based on the delaware code which specifically makes an insurance application inadmissible in court if that application was not attached to or made part of the policy.id.at.brasure held that the insured risk assessment form was not admissible in evidence and the insurer could not use the misstatements and omissions in that form to deny coverage to the insured.ibid.nonetheless,judicial admissions to the effect that the insured made misstatements on the risk assessment form were admissible.id.at.brasure is not controlling here because unlike the delaware statute,according to telford,california precludes the insurer from relying on the application as a defense.also,blue shield life overstates its case when it contends,based on brasure and section that the alleged statutory violations here can not bar all defenses italics added.as explained,the insurer who violates these statutes is not left without any defenses the court may consider the insured nondisclosure or misrepresentations in fashioning the equitable remedies authorized by business and professions code section.cortez purolator air filtration products,supra,cal th at,d.
turning to plaintiff class certification motion,the trial court ruled that individual factual issues of fraud and unclean hands would predominate,with the result that class treatment would not be beneficial.but where equitable defenses may not be used to wholly defeat the ucl cause of action cortez purolator air filtration products,supra,cal th at,d,and where the insurer may not raise a defense based on misstatements made in unattached and unendorsed applications telford new york life ins,supra,cal d at,the diverse facts making up blue shield life fraud and unclean hands defenses are not to be factored in when determining whether the requirement is met.that is,where these defenses are not to be considered,legal and factual issues that go to these defenses simply can not outweigh the common issues related to liability.in short,the trial court relied on erroneous legal assumptions when it weighed the legal and factual issues of fraud and unclean hands in deciding to deny plaintiff motion for class certification.linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th at,d.
