these consolidated appeals raise two issues first,whether the district court abused its discretion when it denied plaintiffs motion to certify a putative class out of concern that practical obstacles could potentially develop if plaintiffs legal theory were ultimately rejected and second,whether the district court erred in remanding,in light of its certification decision,state law claims to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.we hold that the district court abused its discretion when it assumed,for the purpose of federal rule of civil procedure certification analysis and without any separate inquiry into the merits,that plaintiffs legal theory would fail.accordingly,we reverse and remand for reconsideration of plaintiffs certification motion and dismiss as moot the appeal of the remand order.
defendant conocophillips company is an international oil company that operates oil refineries in los angeles santa maria,and rodeo,california.united steel,paper forestry,rubber,manufacturing,energy,allied industrial service workers international union,clc usw is a labor union that represents many of the employees who work at conocophillips refineries.conocophillips and usw are parties to a collective bargaining agreement that sets forth wages,hours,and working conditions for employees at conocophillips california refineries.
on february,usw and representative plaintiffs david simmons,raudel covarrubias,and stephen filed a class action complaint against conocophillips and ten john doe defendants in los angeles superior court.the complaint sought relief under california law for defendants breaches of their legal obligation to provide employees with unpaid,meal periods,totally relieved of all duties,for every hours of work.the basic premise of plaintiffs complaint was that because operators can not leave their units during their meal breaks and are subject to interruptions to which they must respond,their meal periods are on duty within the meaning of california law plaintiffs sought both damages and injunctive relief.
on march,conocophillips removed the action to the united states district court for the central district of california,citing the class action fairness act of cafa,stat.codified at d,as the basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction.cafa vests a district court with original jurisdiction over a class action where there are or more putative class members at least one class member is a citizen of a state different from the state of any defendant and the aggregated amount in controversy exceeds million,exclusive of costs and interest.d,b.in its notice of removal,conocophillips stated that plaintiffs,at the time this action was commenced,were citizens and residents of the state of california,while conocophillips,as a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in texas,was not a citizen of california under c.plaintiffs did not contest removal.
after removal,the parties proceeded with discovery,and in early,plaintiffs moved for class certification under federal rule of civil procedure.the putative class encompassed 
all former,current,and future hourly employees of defendant conocophillips who,at any time since february,worked as an operator or in the laboratory on a shift schedule at a conocophillips refinery located in los angeles,santa maria,or rodeo,california.
on march,the district court denied class certification,but did so without prejudice.in this order,the district court held that although plaintiffs had demonstrated the existence of three of the four rule a prerequisites to class,commonality,and typicality,see.a plaintiffs failed to satisfy the adequate representation requirement under rule a.specifically,the district court held that due to counterclaims then pending against usw,usw interests we re not properly aligned with those of the class and that because counsel also represented usw,it could not adequately represent the interests of the class.
after the march order,the representative plaintiffs obtained new counsel unrelated to usw,usw successfully moved for rule b dismissal of all pending counterclaims against it,and plaintiffs renewed their motion for class certification under rule.in an order dated june,the district court again denied class certification.the district court held that plaintiffs had satisfied all four requirements of rule a,but failed to satisfy any of the three provisions in rule b the court held that although plaintiffs had relied on both rule b and rule b in support of class certification,plaintiffs had not carried their burden of satisfying either of these provisions.with respect to rule b,the predominance requirement,the district court reasoned that if plaintiffs on duty theory is rejected the court will be faced with a case requiring individualized trials on each class member meal period claims,and a class action w ould not be the superior method of resolving this suit.the court ultimately held that this problem is an insurmountable barrier to class certification,and therefore decline d to certify the class under rule b.
the same day it issued the order denying certification,the district court remanded this action to los angeles superior court.the district court explained that district courts are split on the issue of whether remand is required after denial of class certification and noted that t he ninth circuit has never addressed this question,before ultimately concluding 
in the instant case there is no reasonably foreseeable possibility that a class will be certified,given that plaintiffs have brought two unsuccessful certification motions and that insurmountable problems preclude certification under rule b.the court is persuaded by the reasoning of these authorities a determination that class certification is not a reasonably foreseeable possibility is not a postremoval change in jurisdictional facts,but rather is equivalent to a finding that jurisdiction never existed under cafa in the first place.accordingly,cafa does not provide a basis for jurisdiction over this action.
internal citations omitted.
having held that cafa did not provide subject matter jurisdiction,the district court then rejected any other possible bases for jurisdiction,including supplemental jurisdiction and diversity jurisdiction.finding no subject matter jurisdiction over this case,the district court remanded to los angeles superior court 
plaintiffs timely petitioned for permission to appeal the june order denying class certification,and conocophillips timely petitioned for permission to appeal the remand order.on september,this court granted both parties petitions to appeal.we reverse and remand in plaintiffs appeal of the order denying certification and dismiss as moot conocophillips appeal of the order remanding this case to state court 
federal rule of civil procedure,which governs class certification,contains two distinct sets of requirements.rule a outlines four requirements,all of which must be met for class certification the class must be so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable there must be questions of law or fact common to the class the claims or defenses of the class representatives must be typical of the claims or defenses of the class and the class representatives must fairly and adequately protect the interests of all members of the class.a.the four requirements of rule a are commonly referred to as numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation or just adequacy,respectively.see,rodriguez hayes,cir.where a putative class satisfies all four requirements of rule a,it still must meet at least one of three additional requirements outlined in rule b in order to be eligible for certification.rule b provides that 
a class action may be maintained if rule a is satisfied and if 
prosecuting separate actions by or against individual class members would create a risk of 
a inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual class members that would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class or 
b adjudications with respect to individual class members that,as a practical matter,would be dispositive of the inte
