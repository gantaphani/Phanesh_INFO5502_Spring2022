florencio pacleb filed a class action complaint against allstate insurance company,alleging he received unsolicited automated telephone calls to his cellular telephone,in violation of the telephone consumer protection act.taking a cue from a recent supreme court case,campbell ewald gomez,d campbell ewald,on appeal allstate deposited in full settlement of pacleb individual monetary claims in an escrow account pending entry of a final district court order or judgment directing the escrow agent to pay the tendered funds to pacleb,requiring allstate to stop sending telephone calls and short message service messages to pacleb in the future and dismissing this action as moot.on the basis of these actions,allstate argues we should reverse the denial of allstate motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and remand to the district court to order disbursement of the tendered funds to pacleb,the entry of judgment in favor of pacleb and the dismissal of this action as moot.we disagree.
first,even if the district court entered judgment affording pacleb complete relief on his individual claims for damages and injunctive relief,mooting those claims,pacleb would still be able to seek class certification under pitts terrible herbst,cir.although allstate argues pitts is no longer good law after genesis healthcare symczyk,d,we rejected that very argument in gomez campbell ewald,cir gomez,aff,d.pitts therefore remains the law of this circuit 
second,even if pitts were not binding,and allstate could moot the entire action by mooting pacleb individual claims for damages and injunctive relief,those individual claims are not now moot,and we will not direct the district court to moot them by entering judgment on them before pacleb has had a fair opportunity to move for class certification.under supreme court and ninth circuit case law,a claim becomes moot when a plaintiff actually receives complete relief on that claim,not merely when that relief is offered or tendered.where,as here,injunctive relief has been offered,and funds have been deposited in an escrow account,relief has been offered,but it has not been received.pacleb individual claims,therefore,are not now moot.nor will we direct the district court to moot them.assuming arguendo a district court could enter a judgment according complete relief on a plaintiff individual claims over the plaintiff objections,thereby mooting those claims,such action is not appropriate here.as the supreme court said in campbell ewald.at,w hile a class lacks independent status until certified,see sosna iowa,d,a class representative with a live claim of her own must be accorded a fair opportunity to show that certification is warranted.because pacleb has not yet had a fair opportunity to move for class certification,we will not direct the district court to enter judgment,over pacleb objections,on his individual claims.
for the above reasons,we affirm the order denying allstate motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
background 
in,richard chen and florencio pacleb filed a class action complaint against allstate insurance company,asserting violations of the telephone consumer protection act tcpa.the tcpa makes it unlawful,in part,to make any call other than a call made for emergency purposes or made with the prior express consent of the called party using any automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice to any telephone number assigned to a cellular telephone service,unless such call is made solely to collect a debt owed to or guaranteed by the united states.b a.an aggrieved person may bring an action to enjoin a violation of this provision or to seek actual or statutory damages.see id.b.statutory damages are per violation.see id.b b.if a violation is willful or knowing,a court may treble the award.see id.b.
chen alleged he received eight calls from allstate in violation of b a.pacleb alleged he received five such calls.in pacleb case,the automated calls asked for an individual named frank arnold.chen and pacleb brought their claims on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated,as members of a proposed class defined as 
all persons within the united states who received any telephone calls from defendant to said person cellular telephone made through the use of any automatic telephone dialing system and such person had not previously consented to receiving such calls within the four years prior to the filing of this complaint.
in their first cause of action,for negligent violations of the tcpa,chen and pacleb sought for themselves and the members of the proposed class in statutory damages for each violation and injunctive relief prohibiting such conduct in the future.in their second cause of action,for knowing or willful violations of the tcpa,they sought in statutory damages for each violation and similar injunctive relief.the plaintiffs subsequently abandoned their claims for knowing or willful violations of the tcpa.
in april,before any motion for class certification had been made,allstate made an offer of judgment to chen and pacleb under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.allstate offered to allow judgment to be taken against it by chen and pacleb on their individual claims in the amount of and,respectively,together with reasonable attorneys fees and costs that have been accrued to date.with respect to chen and pacleb demand for injunctive relief,allstate agreed to stop sending telephone calls and short message service messages to them in the future.the offer was made solely for the purposes specified in rule and provided chen and pacleb days to accept the offer in writing.the offer also directed chen and pacleb attention to the provision of rule that provides that i f the judgment finally obtain ed by plaintiffs is not more favorable than allstate offer,the plaintiffs must pay the costs incurred after the offer was made alterations in original quoting.d.
when chen and pacleb did not accept the offer within days,allstate sent plaintiffs counsel a letter purporting to extend the offer of judgment until such time as it is accepted by plaintiffs or allstate withdraws the offer in writing and,the next day,moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.allstate argued plaintiffs claims are moot because allstate without admitting liability made an offer of judgment under.in an amount that is more than sufficient to satisfy all of plaintiffs alleged individual damages and requests for relief.in allstate view,o nce the defendant offers to satisfy the plaintiff entire demand,there is no dispute to litigate,and a plaintiff who refuses to acknowledge this loses outright,under.b,because he has no remaining stake.the plaintiffs class claims should also be dismissed as moot because no class certification motion has been filed.allstate urged the court to enter judgment of dismissal in its favor and against plaintiffs with prejudice.while the motion to dismiss was pending,chen accepted allstate rule offer.pacleb did not.
the district court denied allstate motion to dismiss.the court did not squarely address whether allstate rule offer provided complete relief on pacleb individual claims for damages and injunctive relief.nor did the court determine whether such an offer,if unaccepted,would moot pacleb individual claims.instead,the court relied on this court decision in pitts terrible herbst,cir,to hold that,even if pacleb individual claims could be considered fully satisfied by the offer,the action as a whole continued to present a justiciable controversy affording pacleb an opportunity to move for class certification.in doing so,the court rejected allstate argument that pitts was no longer good law in light of the supreme court intervening decision in genesis healthcare.the district court subsequently granted allstate motion to certify the order for interlocutory appeal under b,stating the court would welcome the ninth circuit view as to whether its pitts decision remains good law in light of genesis healthcare.we granted permission to appeal.while the appeal was pending,we decided gomez,at,holding pitts remains the law of this circuit after genesis healthcare.
also while this appeal was pending,the supreme court decided campbell ewald.campbell ewald confirmed that an unaccepted settlement offer has no force.at.like other unaccepted contract offers,it creates no lasting right or obligation.id.with the offer off the table,and the defendant continuing denial of liability,adversity between the parties persists.id thus,an unaccepted offer to satisfy the named plaintiff individual claim is insufficient to render a case moot when the complaint seeks relief on behalf of the plaintiff and a class of persons similarly situated.id.the court also declined to decide whether the result would be different if a defendant deposits the full amount of the plaintiff individual claim in an account payable to the plaintiff,and the court then enters judgment for the plaintiff in that amount.id.at.the court expressly reserved this question for a case in which it is not hypothetical.id.
allstate seeks to take up that hypothetical here.shortly after the supreme court issued campbell ewald,allstate deposited in a bank escrow account pending entry of a final district court order or judgment directing the escrow agent to pay the tendered funds to pacleb,requiring allstate to stop sending telephone calls and short message service messages to pacleb in the future and dismissing this action as moot.allstate argues this action on the part of the district court would moot pacleb individual claims.it further contends that,because pitts no longer remains good law,the existence of pacleb class claims do not preserve a justiciable controversy.accordingly,allstate urges us to reverse the denial of allstate motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and remand to the district court to order disbursement of the tendered funds to pacleb,the entry of judgment in favor of pacleb and the dismissal of this action as moot.
standard of review 
we review de novo the denial of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see botosan paul mcnally realty,cir.
discussion 
allstate theory of mootness turns on three contentions that the judgment it has consented to would afford pacleb complete relief on his individual claims for damages and injunctive relief that the district court should be required to enter judgment on these terms,and that,once the court does so,pacleb individual claims will become moot and assuming pacleb individual claims become moot,the existence of his class allegations will be insufficient to preserve a live controversy.as explained below,we agree with allstate first contention,but reject its second and third arguments.
complete relief 
pacleb argues the judgment allstate has consented to would not afford him complete relief on his individual claims for damages and injunctive relief,because allstate has neither admitted liability nor offered sufficiently broad injunctive relief.we disagree.
admission of liability 
pacleb contends allstate has not agreed to complete relief because the judgment it has consented to would not include an admission of liability.because his complaint alleges allstate violated the tcpa,he maintains he has an interest in a finding of liability by a court,or an admission of liability from allstate,on those legal allegations.
pacleb,however,has not explained why,under the circumstances of this case,an admission of liability is necessary to afford him complete relief on his claims.pacleb complaint sought only statutory damages and injunctive relief,not an admission of liability or a declaration that allstate violated his rights.when a plaintiff has received all the relief he could win on the merits,an adjudication would have no consequences on remaining related disputes between the parties and nothing further would be ordered by the court,there is no point in proceeding to decide the merits.charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.see already,llc nike,d holding a covenant not to sue mooted a counterclaim of trademark invalidity,notwithstanding the lack of an admission or finding of liability mccauley trans union,llc,cir holding a plaintiff is not entitled to keep litigating his claim simply because the defendant has not admitted liability.
scope of injunctive relief 
pacleb alternatively contends allstate has not agreed to complete relief on his individual claims because the judgment to which it has consented would not provide the full scope of injunctive relief he seeks in his complaint.he argues,g iven the fact that he received calls from allstate looking for a arnold,errors in allstate phone records leave reason to doubt that a narrow injunction merely requiring allstate to refrain from calling him would be effective.according to pacleb,only a nationwide injunction enjoining allstate from all violations of b a will afford him effective relief.
pacleb is correct that he is not necessarily precluded from obtaining nationwide injunctive relief 
while injunctive relief generally should be limited to apply only to named plaintiffs where there is no class certification,an injunction is not necessarily made overbroad by extending benefit or protection to persons other than prevailing parties in the lawsuit even if it is not a class action if such breadth is necessary to give prevailing parties the relief to which they are entitled.
easyriders freedom hannigan,cir citation omitted quoting bresgal brock,cir.here,however,pacleb has given us no reason to believe the injunctive relief to which allstate has consented would be inadequate,or that he could obtain broader relief after a trial on the merits.allstate,therefore,has consented to all the injunctive relief to which pacleb individually is entitled.
continuing validity of pitts 
in allstate view,if it is able to fully satisfy pacleb individual claims,the action as a whole will also be moot.we disagree.even if,as allstate proposes,the district court were to enter judgment providing complete relief on pacleb individual claims for damages and injunctive relief before class certification,fully satisfying those individual claims,pacleb still would be entitled to seek certification.in pitts,at,we observed that a named plaintiff claim is transitory in nature and may otherwise evade review in light of a defendant tactic of picking off lead plaintiffs to avoid a class action.as a leading treatise explains,t o the extent that defendants may avoid a class action by picking off the named plaintiffs,the class claims are inherently transitory and evade review,making an exception to the mootness rule appropriate.james moore,moore federal practice b ed.accordingly,we held 
an unaccepted rule offer of judgment for the full amount of the named plaintiff individual claim and made before the named plaintiff files a motion for class certification does not moot a class action.if the named plaintiff can still file a timely motion for class certification,the named plaintiff may continue to represent the class until the district court decides the class certification issue.then,if the district court certifies the class,certification relates back to the filing of the complaint.once the class has been certified,the case may continue despite full satisfaction of the named plaintiff individual claim because an offer of judgment to the named plaintiff fails to satisfy the demands of the class.see sosna,at.conversely,if the district court denies class certification,under deposit guaranty national bank roper,d,and parole commission geraghty,d,the plaintiff may still pursue a limited appeal of the class certification issue.only once the denial of class certification is final does the defendant offer if still available moot the merits of the case because the plaintiff has been offered all that he can possibly recover through litigation.
pitts,at footnote omitted 
allstate argues pitts is no longer good law in light of the supreme court intervening decision in genesis healthcare,which questioned the application of the inherently transitory rationale to circumstances in which the transitory nature of the claim arises from the defendant litigation strategy rather than the fleeting nature of the challenged conduct giving rise to the claim.at.in gomez,at,however,we squarely rejected that very argument.because genesis healthcare concerned collective actions brought under the fair labor standards act flsa rather than class actions under federal rule of civil procedure,gomez held pitts was not clearly irreconcilable with genesis healthcare.see id.although genesis healthcare undermined some of the reasoning employed in pitts,courts have universally concluded that the genesis discussion does not apply to class actions.id.at.in fact,genesis itself emphasizes that rule class actions are fundamentally different from collective actions under the flsa.id.at alteration in original quoting genesis healthcare.at.
because gomez holding that pitts is not clearly irreconcilable with genesis healthcare is not itself clearly irreconcilable with intervening supreme court authority,we are bound by gomez.see miller gammie,cir en banc holding a panel may not reexamine normally controlling circuit precedent in the face of an intervening united states supreme court decision unless the reasoning or theory of our prior circuit authority is clearly irreconcilable with the reasoning or theory of intervening higher authority.accordingly,pitts remains the law of this circuit.under pitts,even assuming allstate could fully satisfy pacleb individual claims,pacleb still would be able to seek class certification.
effect of allstate actions 
furthermore,even if pitts were not controlling,we would reject allstate attempt to moot this action before pacleb has had a fair opportunity to seek certification.that is,even if allstate could moot the entire action by getting the district court to enter judgment in favor of pacleb on his individual claims before he has had a fair opportunity to move for certification,we would decline allstate invitation to direct the district court to take that action.
as noted,allstate recently deposited in escrow and proposed entry of judgment favorable to pacleb on his individual claims for damages and injunctive relief.allstate contends its actions invoke the hypothetical question reserved in campbell ewald whether a case becomes moot when a defendant deposits the full amount of the plaintiff individual claim in an account payable to the plaintiff,and the court then enters judgment for the plaintiff in that amount.at.allstate argues we must direct the district court to enter judgment and dismiss both pacleb individual claims and the action as a whole as moot.
allstate actions to date do not afford pacleb any actual relief and thus do not moot his individual claims for damages and injunctive relief 
as an initial matter,allstate does not dispute that its actions to date depositing in escrow on pacleb individual damages claim and agreeing to an injunction on his individual injunctive relief claim do not afford pacleb any actual relief,and thus do not moot his individual claims for damages and injunctive relief.
as we read campbell ewald,a lawsuit or an individual claim becomes moot when a plaintiff actually receives all of the relief he or she could receive on the claim through further litigation.campbell ewald cited a trio of railroad cases that reenforce this view.in san mateo county southern pacific railroad,the county sued the railroad for unpaid taxes and the railroad paid the county a sum exceeding the taxes,penalties,attorney fees and interest sought in the lawsuit.noting the debt for which the suit was brought has been unconditionally paid and satisfied,the supreme court dismissed the appeal,holding there is no longer an existing cause of action in favor of the county against the railroad company.id.at.in little bowers,the taxes in dispute again were fully paid while the appeal was pending.relying on san mateo county,the court dismissed the appeal due to the absence of an actual controversy,involving real and substantial rights,between the parties.id.at.in california san pablo tulare railroad,california sued the railroad to recover taxes.the railroad tendered to the state a sum of money equal to the taxes,penalties,interest and attorney fees at issue in the litigation.see id.at.although the state did not accept the tender,the railroad deposited the funds in a bank in accordance with a state law making such a deposit equivalent to actual payment.see id.at the supreme court dismissed the appeal 
t here can be no doubt that this writ of error must be dismissed,because the cause of action has ceased to exist.any obligation of the defendant to pay to the state the sums sued for in this case,together with interest,penalties and costs,has been extinguished by the offer to pay all these sums,and the deposit of the money in a bank,which by a statute of the state have the same effect as actual payment and receipt of the money.and the state has obtained everything that it could recover in this case by a judgment of this court in its favor.
our own decisions are consistent with this view a claim becomes moot once the plaintiff actually receives all of the relief to which he or she is entitled on the claim.see,back sebelius,cir because the secretary has already created the administrative appeals process that back seeks,no present controversy exists as to which we can grant effective relief.alteration in original quoting vegas diamond,llc fdic,cir 
under this line of cases,pacleb individual claims for damages and injunctive relief are not now moot.a case becomes moot only when it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party.knox serv.emps.int l union,local,d quoting erie pap,d.here,pacleb has not yet received any relief on his individual claims for damages or injunctive relief.his claims are wholly unsatisfied,and it remains entirely possible for a court to grant him effectual relief.see campbell ewald.at.at this moment,therefore,allstate actions plainly have not mooted pacleb individual claims.
under the common law doctrine of tender,there may have been occasions when the deposit of money in court could be treated as the equivalent of an actual payment to and acceptance by the plaintiff.robert bone,to encourage settlement rule,offers of judgment,and the history of the federal rules of civil procedure,nw.at most,however,that principle applied when the defendant unconditionally relinquished its entire interest in the deposited funds.see id.at the money became the plaintiff property as soon as it was deposited and remained the plaintiff property even if the defendant won at trial.as one commentator put it,the defendant bids his money an eternal farewell.quoting gerald chapin,code practice in new york.that has not occurred here.allstate has neither deposited the in the court nor unconditionally relinquished its interest in the to pacleb.on the contrary,allstate retains its interest in the funds unless and until the district court dismisses this entire action as moot.see def.appellant allstate ins.mot.suppl.appellate,ecf the tendered funds have been deposited in an escrow account at the bank of new york mellon the bank pending entry of a final district court order or judgment directing the escrow agent to pay the tendered funds to pacleb,requiring allstate to stop sending telephone calls and short message service messages to pacleb in the future and dismissing this action as moot.if,and only if,the district court or any final appellate court declines to issue such an order dismissing this action as moot,allstate will move the district court to order the escrowed funds to be returned to allstate.thus,even assuming this aspect of common law tender would apply here,pacleb has not actually or constructively received the.nor has he received relief on his individual injunctive relief claim 
in sum,pacleb individual claims are not now moot,because he has not actually received all of the relief to which he is entitled on those claims.
allstate suggestion that we should direct the district court to enter judgment on pacleb individual claims,as an attempt to moot the action,is contrary to campbell ewald,which affords a class representative with a live claim a fair opportunity to show certification is warranted 
the question rem
