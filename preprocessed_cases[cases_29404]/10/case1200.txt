in this fair and accurate credit transactions act facta case,michael bateman appeals the district court denial of class certification.bateman sued american,amc on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals,alleging that amc violated facta by printing more than the last five digits of consumers credit or debit card numbers on electronically printed receipts in december and january.see g.on behalf of himself and other consumers who received such receipts,bateman sought to recover statutory damages ranging from to for each willful violation of facta.the district court denied class certification under federal rule of civil procedure b rule b,finding that a class action was not the superior method of litigating the case because amc had made a good faith effort to comply with facta after this lawsuit was filed and the magnitude of amc potential liability million to enormous and out of proportion to any harm suffered by the class.see bateman am,order.bateman appeals,arguing that the district court abused its discretion in denying class certification.we agree that none of these three disproportionality between the potential liability and the actual harm suffered,the enormity of the potential damages,or amc good faith the denial of class certification on superiority grounds and that the district court abused its discretion in relying on them.we therefore reverse the denial of class certification and remand for further proceedings.
in,bateman filed a complaint against amc,on behalf of himself and those individuals similarly situated,alleging violations of facta.bateman alleged that from december to january,amc issued credit and debit card receipts from some of its automated box offices that included both the first four and the last four digits of the credit card,a violation of facta.to protect against identity theft,facta requires,in relevant part,that credit and debit card receipts issued to consumers not reflect the expiration date or more than the last five digits of the card number.see g.facta incorporates the fair credit reporting act fcra statutory damages provision,which allows a consumer to recover damages between and for each violation of facta without having to prove actual damages.see id.in the complaint,bateman did not allege any actual harm to his identity resulting from the claimed violations.
after conducting discovery,bateman filed a motion for class certification under rule b.bateman sought to certify a class of individuals who,between december,and january,had used a credit card or debit card to purchase a movie ticket from an automated box office at an amc theater and who received a receipt that included the first four and last four digits of the person card number.an amc internal review conducted after the lawsuit was filed revealed that more than receipts had been printed in violation of facta during the relevant period.
the district court denied bateman motion for class certification without prejudice,concluding that bateman had failed to demonstrate that a class action would be superior to other available methods of adjudicating his claim,as required under rule b.in particular,the district court denied certification because,in its opinion,class treatment could result in enormous liability completely out of proportion to any harm suffered by the plaintiff.the district court further concluded that class certification was not appropriate because amc demonstrated good faith by complying with facta within a few weeks of the filing of bateman complaint 
after denying bateman motion to certify,the district court approved the parties stipulation to stay the case pending the outcome of an appeal in a different case raising an issue identical to the one presented here.see soualian int l coffee tea,llc,no.cv jcx,wl.that case,however,settled while the appeal was pending.in the meantime,congress amended facta to address prevalent misunderstandings about facta requirements and to provide businesses some measure of protection from lawsuits resulting from those misunderstandings.see credit and debit card receipt clarification act of,stat.clarification act.the district court subsequently instructed the parties to file supplemental briefing on the appropriateness of class certification in light of that amendment.after considering the supplemental briefs,the district court denied with prejudice bateman renewed motion for class certification for largely the same reasons as before,although the court additionally noted that,because bateman had alleged no actual harm,class certification would not further the purpose and policy of facta.see bateman,at.pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f,bateman petitioned this court for permission to appeal the denial of class certification.we granted his request.
under federal rule of civil procedure,a class action may be maintained if two conditions are met the suit must satisfy the criteria set forth in subdivision a,numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation,and it also must fit into one of the three categories described in subdivision b.shady grove orthopedic,allstate ins,internal quotation marks omitted.subdivision b,at issue in this appeal,is satisfied if the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.b.
the decision to grant or deny class certification is within the trial court discretion.yamamoto omiya,cir.district courts are in the best position to consider the most fair and efficient procedure for conducting any given litigation,doniger pac.bell,cir,and so must be given wide discretion to evaluate superiority,lerwill inflight motion pictures,cir.we thus review for abuse of discretion a district court order denying a motion for class certification.zinser accufix research,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.yokoyama midland life ins,cir.additionally,in the context of class certification,a buse exists in three circumstances reliance on an improper factor,omission of a substantial factor,or a clear error of judgment in weighing the correct mix of factors.in re wells fargo home mortg.overtime pay,cir.
the district court refused to certify the class because it concluded that the proposed class failed to meet rule b superiority requirement.see bateman,at.at the heart of its ruling,the district court determined that class treatment would render the magnitude of the defendant potential liability enormous and completely out of proportion to any harm suffered by plaintiff.id.at.in its first order denying class certification without prejudice,the court also considered significant amc good faith efforts to bring its machines into compliance with facta shortly after the lawsuit was filed.we conclude that none of these three disproportionality between the potential liability and the actual harm suffered,the enormity of the potential damages,or amc good the denial of class certification and hold that the district court abused its discretion in relying on them.
proportionality between liability and actual harm 
the district court denied class certification in part because it concluded that amc liability would be completely out of proportion to any harm suffered by plaintiff.id.at.we therefore must consider whether rule b permits consideration of such a factor when deciding whether to certify a class in a facta case.we hold that it does not.
rule provides little,if any,guidance on this question the rule provides a list of factors relevant to the superiority inquiry 
a the class members interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions 
b the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members 
c the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum and 
d the likely difficulties in managing a class action.
b.none of these enumerated factors appear to authorize a court to consider whether certifying a class would result in disproportionate damages.a court may consider other,factors,however,and we have suggested that a broad inquiry is appropriate 
superiority must be looked at from the point of view of the judicial system,of the potential class members,of the present plaintiff,of the attorneys for the litigants,of the public at large and of the defendant.the listing is not necessarily in order of importance of the respective interests.superiority must also be looked at from the point of view of the issues.
kamm cal.city dev,cir quoting katz carte blanche,cir.that list,however,leaves two key questions unanswered what does it mean to look at superiority from the point of view of a defendant,and can that inquiry consider whether the defendant potential liability is proportional to the actual harm alleged 
nor do the advisory committee notes shed any light on the question.in its note to amended rule,the advisory committee explains 
subdivision b encompasses those cases in which a class action would achieve economies of time,effort,and expense,and promote uniformity of decision as to persons similarly situated,without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results.
emphasis added.amc contends that imposing potential enormous and disproportional liability would constitute just such undesirable results.the advisory committee,however,gives no further explanation of what constitutes an undesirable result,or of whether the term contemplates only procedurally undesirable results,prejudicing individual plaintiffs ability to seek redress or also refers to substantively undesirable results,potentially exposing a defendant to bankruptcy as a result of enormous liability.wolin jaguar land rover,llc,wl,at cir,rule b superiority test requires the court to determine whether maintenance of litigation as a class action is efficient and whether it is fair.
although neither the rule nor its legislative history clearly expresses whether the proportionality between the actual harm caused and the defendant potential liability is a proper superiority consideration,many courts have assumed as much.ratner chemical bank new york trust,was the first and seminal case to deny class certification for proportionality reasons.there,the district court denied class certification in a suit against chemical bank for disclosure violations under the truth in lending act tila.id.at.the plaintiff sought to certify a class of approximately cardholders,each of whom would have been entitled to at least a minimum statutory damages award of under the statute.id.at.in denying class certification,the district court concluded that a class action was not the superior method of adjudicating the claim because the plaintiff had alleged only technical violations,id.at and the allowance of thousands of minimum recoveries like plaintiff would carry to an absurd and stultifying extreme the specific and essentially inconsistent remedy congress prescribed as the means of private enforcement,id.at.
courts have heavily relied on ratner reasoning for the proposition that rule b superiority requirement authorizes consideration of the proportionality between the potential damages and the actual harm see,klay humana,f d,cir kline coldwell,banker,cir wilcox commerce bank of kansas city,cir.in the context of plaintiffs seeking to certify classes in facta cases,ratner reasoning has prevailed in the vast majority of district courts within this circuit.see,azoiani love travel stops and country stores,no.edcv odw opx,wl,vartanian estyle,no.cv dsf rcx,wl,saunders trattoria,no.cv sjo pjwx,wl,price lucky strike entm t,no.cv manx,wl,najarian avis rent a car,no.cv ex,wl cal.june.but see medrano wcg holdings,no.sacv jvs rnbx,wl,certifying a plaintiff class despite noting the potential for disproportionate and enormous liability.
by contrast,the one federal court of appeals to have addressed this issue in the context of the fcra rejected ratner reasoning.see murray gmac mort,cir.there,the seventh circuit reversed the district court denial of class certification,holding that considering a defendant potential enormous liability in the rule b superiority analysis was improper.id.at.although that case did not involve an alleged violation of facta,the seventh circuit analysis and conclusion are instructive because facta and other provisions of the fcra share the same statutory damages provision,see.accordingly,we discuss it in greater detail below.
amc relies heavily on our opinion in kline coldwell,banker to defend the district court denial of class certification.in kline,we considered an action brought against los angeles county real estate brokers who had allegedly conspired to fix brokerage commissions in violation of the sherman act.at.the plaintiffs in that case estimated that,on the basis of sales that occurred in los angeles county during the relevant class period,their collective injury potentially amounted to million.id.at.they therefore claimed that they were entitled to approximately million in damages under the treble damages provision of the sherman act.id.the district court certified both a class of plaintiffs and of defendants,and an interlocutory appeal followed.id.at.we reversed,holding that the action could not be maintained as a class action and that the district court abused its discretion in conducting its superiority analysis.id.at.
of the three justifications for our holding,one was our significant concern over the amount of damages that might be imposed jointly and severally on the individual defendants.id.at.specifically,we noted that,if the plaintiffs were successful,the defendants in the class would be jointly and severally liable for million.id.at.in reversing,we reasoned that,when defendant class members are joined in an action in which each is jointly and severally liable,the liability is increased in geometric progression.such an award against each of real estate broker defendants would shock the conscience and lead to an ad absurdum result.id.at.we further noted that the allowance of thousands of minimum recoveries like plaintiff would carry to an absurd and stultifying extreme the specific and essentially inconsistent remedy congress prescribed as the means of private enforcement.id.at quoting ratner,at.thus,we held that a class action was not the superior method of adjudicating the controversy.id.at.
kline,amc argues,created binding circuit precedent that rule b permits consideration of the proportionality of the potential liability.that is an overbroad reading of kline.the basis of kline conclusion was not simply that potential liability would be disproportional to the harm incurred,but rather that such liability would be inconsistent with congressional intent in enacting the statutory damages provision.as kline explains,the treble damages provisions in the clayton and sherman acts act as statutory punitive measures in which two thirds of the recovery is not remedial and inevitably presupposes a punitive purpose.id.quoting lyons westinghouse,cir.thus,we concluded 
the intent of congress under section of the clayton act,appears to have been to impose punishment upon the violator of section of the sherman act for his own malefactions,not to subject him to vicarious liability by the coincidence of a class action for the staggering damages of the multitude.
id.emphasis added.that conclusion about congressional intent was particularly sound given that the clayton and sherman acts were enacted before the supreme court created the presumption that class actions are available unless congress expressed its contrary intent.see califano yamasaki,in the absence of a direct expression by congress of its intent to depart from the usual course of trying all suits of civil nature under the rules established for that purpose,class relief is appropriate in civil actions brought in federal court.accordingly,congress would not necessarily have expected class actions to be available when it created the statutory damages provisions in the clayton and sherman acts,and,unlike here,the kline panel could not assume as much.
the court in ratner also focused on whether the potentially enormous liability would be consistent with congressional intent in creating the statutory damages provision.see at t he allowance of thousands of minimum recoveries like plaintiff would carry to an absurd and stultifying extreme the specific and essentially inconsistent remedy congress prescribed as the means of private enforcement.emphasis added.we think it clear that the rule b superiority analysis must be consistent with the congressional intent in enacting a particular statutory damages provision.while rule affords district courts wide discretion in deciding whether to certify a class,dukes stores,cir en banc,the district court was obliged to exercise that discretion in light of the objectives of facta.hecht bowles,holding that,in considering whether to impose an injunction under the emergency price control act,the district court discretion must be exercised in light of the objectives of the act thorne city of el segundo,cir although the district court has wide discretion in fashioning appropriate title vii remedies,that discretion must be exercised in light of the objectives of title vii see also albemarle paper moody,noting that a decision calling for the exercise of discretion hardly means that it is unfettered by meaningful standards or shielded from thorough appellate review watkins simmons clark,cir noting that while s tudents of rule have been led generally to recognize that its broad and terms call for the exercise of some considerable discretion of a pragmatic nature,that discretion must often be limited by considerations in addition to those set forth in the rule quoting ratner,at.
therefore,in accord with these principles and kline reasoning,we look to facta itself for evidence of congressional intent as to the appropriateness of class certification in such cases.specifically,we must examine facta to determine whether the denial of class certification is consistent with congressional intent and facta remedial scheme where a district court concludes that potential liability is disproportionate to any actual harm.
background on facta 
in an effort to combat identity theft,in congress enacted facta,which amended the fcra.see,stat.facta provides,in relevant part,that no person that accepts credit cards or debit cards for the transaction of business shall print more than the last digits of the card number or the expiration date upon any receipt provided to the cardholder at the point of the sale or transaction.g.congress imposed civil liability for willful noncompliance in the amount of any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or damages of not less than and not more than.id.a a.in addition,facta allows prevailing parties to recover attorneys fees and costs.id.a.
in response to misunderstandings about the truncation requirements,congress amended facta in with the clarification act.apparently,a significant number of merchants had erroneously concluded that merely truncating the account number down to the last five digits while leaving the expiration date displayed would satisfy facta requirements.see clarification act a,stat.at.after the deadline for compliance passed,hundreds of lawsuits were filed alleging that the companies failure to remove the expiration date constituted willful violations of facta.id.a,stat.at.in response,congress amended the willful noncompliance requirement of facta to insulate from liability any person who printed an expiration date on a receipt between december,and june,so long as they otherwise complied with facta requirements.id.a,stat.at codified at d.as expressly stated in the bill,the clarification act aimed to ensure that consumers suffering from any actual harm to their credit or identity are protected while simultaneously limiting abusive lawsuits that do not protect consumers but only result in increased cost to business and potentially increased prices to consumers.id.b,stat.at.
statutory analysis of facta 
unfortunately,neither facta nor the clarification act addresses the availability of class actions.where a statute is silent on the availability of class relief,the supreme court has instructed that we presume it to be available in all civil actions brought in federal court.califano,at.accordingly,as neither facta nor the clarification act contain a direct expression to the contrary,we must presume that congress intended class relief to be available.that,of course,does not mean that a court necessarily must allow a plaintiff to seek class relief.rather,it means that a court can not deny class certification where plaintiffs have otherwise met the requirements of rule.
we therefore must decide whether a plaintiff satisfies rule requirements where certification of a class would threaten to impose liability disproportionate to the harm caused.as we have explained,the touchstone of this determination is whether denying class certification on this ground is consistent with congressional intent.we conclude that it is not.
we begin,as always,with the plain language of the statute.see united states mohrbacher,cir.the express terms of the statute provide that upon proving a willful violation a plaintiff may recover any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or damages of not less than and not more than.a.importantly,the statute does not place a cap on these damages in the case of class actions,does not indicate any threshold at which courts are free to award less than the minimum statutory damages,and does not limit the number of individuals that can be certified in a class or the number of individual actions that can be brought against a single merchant.
although the congressional record is silent about why congress provided for statutory damages in these amounts we presume that the statutory damages serve a compensatory function.see news serv.reuters television int,cir noting that awards of statutory damages can serve compensatory,punitive deterrent purposes.that congress provided a consumer the option of recovering either actual or statutory damages,but not both,supports the presumption that they serve the same purpose.we further note that congress provided for punitive damages in addition to any actual or statutory damages,see a,which further suggests that the statutory damages provision has a compensatory,not punitive,purpose.see harris mexican specialty foods,cir concluding that,because facta provides separately for punitive damages,the statutory damages provision is not punitive.
the need for statutory damages to compensate victims is plain.the actual harm that a willful violation of facta will inflict on a consumer will often be small or difficult to prove.as the seventh circuit similarly noted in murray,under the fcra individual losses,if any,are likely to be modest concern about privacy,a slight chance that information would leak out and lead to identity theft.that actual loss is small and hard to quantify is why statutes such as the fair credit reporting act provide for modest damages without proof of injury.at.
in addition to that compensatory function,facta actual and statutory damages provisions also effectuate the act deterrent purpose.see news,at noting that statutory damages help sanction and vindicate the statutory policy of discouraging infringement internal quotation marks omitted.in fashioning facta,congress aimed to restrict the amount of information available to identity thieves.cong.rec.statement of shelby.allowing consumers to recover statutory damages furthers this purpose by deterring businesses from willfully making consumer financial data available,even where no actual harm results.
the factors that a court considers when assessing the superiority of a class action under rule b must be consistent with these dual purposes of facta statutory damages remedy.kline,at concluding that class certification would be inconsistent with congress intent to limit punitive damages to an amount only three times the harm an individual defendant caused.congress expressly created a statutory damages scheme that intended to compensate individuals for actual or potential damages resulting from facta violations,without requiring individuals to prove actual harm.thus,irrespective of whether bateman and all the potential class members can demonstrate actual harm resulting from a willful violation,they are entitled to statutory damages.there is no language in the statute,nor any indication in the legislative history,that congress provided for judicial discretion to depart from the to range where a district judge finds that damages are disproportionate to harm.further,we can not surmise a principled basis for determining when damages are and are not proportionate to actual harm.indeed,one might plausibly argue that a award,or even a award,for a single violation of facta,without any allegation of harm,is not proportionate.but the plain text of the statute makes absolutely clear that,in congress judgment,the to range is proportionate and appropriately compensates the consumer.that proportionality does not change as more plaintiffs seek relief indeed,the size of amc potential liability expands at exactly the same rate as the class size.in the absence of any showing that courts have the discretion to modify this remedial scheme,we agree with the seventh circuit that it is not appropriate to use procedural devices to undermine laws of which a judge disapproves.murray,at.
to the extent that statutory damages also serve a deterrent purpose,a court undermines that purpose in denying class certification on the basis of the proportionality of actual harm and statutory liability.congress,in its legislative judgment,specified the range of damages that it considered sufficient to have a deterrent effect.despite congress awareness of the availability of class actions,it set no cap on the total amount of aggregate damages,no limit on the size of a class,and no limit on the number of individual suits that could be brought against a merchant.allowing denial of class certification because of the sheer number of violations and amount of potential statutory damages would allow the largest violators of facta to escape the pressure of defending class actions and,in all likelihood,to escape liability for most violations.in other words,whatever risk of overdeterrence class certification poses,refusing to certify a class on these grounds poses the risk of significant underdeterrence.
to deny class certification based on the potential amount of damages as compared to the extent of harm presumes that congress left it to the courts to evaluate the relative amount of liability necessary to serve the statute compensatory and deterrent purposes.despite the absence of anything in the text or legislative history of the statute explicitly delegating such authority,amc suggests it can be inferred from language in the clarification act.specifically,amc points to the following language in the clarification act findings section 
almost immediately after the deadline for compliance with facta passed,hundreds of lawsuits were filed alleging that the failure to remove the expiration date was a willful violation of the fair credit reporting act even where the account number was properly truncated.
none of these lawsuits contained an allegation of harm to any consumer identity.
experts in the field agree that proper truncation of the card number,by itself as required by the amendment made by the fair and accurate credit transactions act,regardless of the inclusion of the expiration date,prevents a potential fraudster from perpetrating identity theft or credit card fraud.
despite repeatedly being denied class certification,the continued appealing and filing of these lawsuits represents a significant burden on the hundreds of companies that have been sued and could well raise prices to consumers without corresponding consumer protection benefit.
clarification act a stat.at emphasis added.according to amc,these findings evidence congress approval of court rulings that denied class certification on the ground that damages would be disproportionate to actual harm.we disagree.
while some courts had denied class certification under facta on superiority grounds at the time the clarification act was enacted in june,other courts had granted certification despite superiority arguments like amc.see,redmon uncle julio of,reynoso cnty.concepts,no.rcx,wl.because we must presume that congress is aware of past judicial interpretations and practices when it legislates,in re egebjerg,cir,we must presume congress was aware of this split among district courts as to whether these types of actions should be certified.in the midst of this disagreement,congress stepped in to amend facta,and yet did nothing to limit the availability of class relief or the amount of aggregate damages.had congress been sufficiently concerned about disproportionate damages as a result of class actions,it would have limited class availability or aggregate damages.yet congress did nothing of the sort and instead merely imposed a retroactive immunity for a of merchants who misunderstood facta requirements.
where congress in the past has been confronted with concerns over disproportionate,potentially enormous statutory damage awards,it has acted decisively to make its intent clear.responding to the problem identified in ratner,congress amended tila civil liability provision in.act of,a,stat.as evidenced by the report of the senate banking committee,congress was aware of the potentially enormous liability facing defendants where tila claims were pursued as class actions.in relevant part,that report stated 
a problem has arisen in applying minimum liability provisions in class action suits involving millions of consumers.if each member of the class is entitled to a minimum award of,a creditor liability can be enormous.
the purpose of the civil penalties section under truth in lending was to provide creditors with a meaningful incentive to comply with the law without relying upon an extensive new bureaucracy.however,the committee feels this objective can be achieved without subjecting creditors to enormous penalties for violations which do not involve actual damages and may be of a technical nature.putting a reasonable limit on a creditor maximum class action liability would seem to be in the best interests of both creditors and consumers.
at.accordingly,congress added a provision to tila limiting aggregate statutory damages.act of,a,stat.at codified as amended at a b capping class action damage awards at or one percent of the defendant net worth.congress has similarly capped class action awards under other statutes.see a b setting the same limit under fair debt collection practices act.yet here,faced with precisely the same issue,congress chose to remain silent and not to impose any limits on aggregate relief.
we therefore are not convinced that this passing reference to denial of class certification is sufficient to overcome the plain text of the statute and congressional silence on the issue of class relief,both of which strongly suggest that the proportionality of the damages is an irrelevant consideration in effectuating facta compensatory and deterrence purposes.
we also note an additional problem with amc position.amc would have us leave it to the discretion of district courts to decide whether a potential award would be so disproportionate to the actual harm that a class action would not be the superior method of adjudication.yet such unguided discretion results in decidedly decisions about class certification.for example,in price lucky strike entm t,wl,a district court refused to certify a class of approximately plaintiffs seeking damages under facta,none of whom had alleged any actual harm.meanwhile,a different district court in the same district certified a class of approximately individuals seeking statutory damages under facta who also had alleged no harm,concluding that the magnitude of the potential damage award does not affect the superiority of a class action for adjudication of this dispute.see medrano wcg holdings,no.sacv jvs rnbx,wl,at.we can not ascribe to congress an intent to allow facta deterrent and compensatory impact to vary according to the discretionary policy judgments of district judges.
we therefore hold that the district court
