harry davis,rita marie geary,patty poole,and roberta wallach plaintiffs brought this class action against nirav shah,commissioner of the new york state department of health the commissioner,challenging new york coverage restrictions on certain medical services provided under its medicaid plan.plaintiffs argue that new york plan amendments,which restrict coverage of orthopedic footwear and compression stockings to patients with certain enumerated medical conditions,violate the medicaid act reasonable standards,home health services,due process,and comparability provisions,as well as the provision and integration mandate of title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada and of the rehabilitation act.the united states district court for the western district of new york charles siragusa,judge granted summary judgment to defendant on plaintiffs home health services claim and the hearing aspect of their due process claim,and granted summary judgment to plaintiffs on all their remaining claims.the court subsequently entered a permanent injunction barring new york from enforcing its coverage restrictions against any beneficiaries under its plan.
we affirm in part and vacate in part.because neither the medicaid act nor the supremacy clause confers a private cause of action to enforce the reasonable standards provision,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment to plaintiffs on that claim.we also decline to reach plaintiffs unequal treatment claim under the ada and rehabilitation act as largely duplicative of their integration mandate claim.with respect to the remaining claims,however,we affirm the summary judgment rulings of the district court.because orthopedic footwear and compression stockings constitute optional prosthetics rather than mandatory home health services under the medicaid act,defendant is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs home health services claim.because the due process provision required new york to provide plaintiffs with written notice though not evidentiary hearings prior to terminating their benefits,defendant is entitled to summary judgment on the hearing element and plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on the notice element of plaintiffs due process claim.because new york coverage restrictions deny some categorically needy individuals access to the same scope of medically necessary services made available to others,plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on their comparability provision claim.because new york restrictions violate the integration mandate of the ada and rehabilitation act,plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on their claims under those statutes.
finally,because the injunction granted by the district court is broader than is warranted by our liability conclusions,we vacate that injunction and remand for further consideration of the appropriate relief.
background 
i.the federal medicaid program 
enacted in as title xix of the social security act,et,the medicaid act is a cooperative program designed to provide medical assistance to persons whose resources are insufficient to meet the costs of their necessary medical care.himes shalala,cir.on the federal level,the program is administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms,a division of the united states department of health and human services hhs.although no state is required to participate in medicaid,states that choose to do so must formulate a plan of administration that complies with both the medicaid act and regulations promulgated by hhs.lewis thompson,cir.once cms approves the state plan as complying with all statutory and regulatory requirements,the federal government will subsidize a significant portion of the state expenditures in administering the program.b,rodriguez city of new york,cir.
a state medicaid plan defines both the categories of individuals eligible for benefits and the categories of services that are covered for those different groups.see a pharm.research mfrs.of am.walsh,d.with regard to beneficiaries,the medicaid act requires any state participating in medicaid to provide medical assistance to the categorically needy.roach morse,cir.that group includes aged,blind,or disabled individuals who qualify for supplemental security income individuals eligible for the aid to families with dependent children program and other groups,such as pregnant women and children,entitled to benefits.see a a i walsh,at.a state may also,at its option,provide medical assistance to the medically needy.roach,at.that group includes individuals whose income or resources exceed the financial threshold for categorical coverage,but who otherwise meet the eligibility requirements that define the categorically needy.see a c walsh,at.unlike the categorically needy,who can cover the costs of neither their basic needs nor necessary medical care,the medically needy have sufficient resources to cover their basic needs but not their necessary medical care.roach,at.
with regard to services provided under a state plan,the medicaid act similarly specifies certain categories of mandatory and optional medical care.a a id.a rodriguez,at.a state is required to provide some benefits to all categorically needy individuals,including,among others,nursing facility services for persons over and home health care services.a a id.a.while a state need not provide either service to the medically needy,any state that elects to provide nursing facilities services to those beneficiaries must also provide home health services.id.a d a.furthermore,the medicaid act identifies a number of purely optional services that a state may provide to either the categorically needy or to both the categorically and medically needy.optional services include,among other things,prosthetic devices.a a id.a see also c id.
the medicaid act imposes several requirements on the administration of both required and optional services under a state plan.under the reasonable standards provision,the act provides that a participating state must include reasonable standards for determining eligibility for and the extent of medical assistance under the plan which are consistent with the objectives of the medicaid program.a.under the comparability provision,the act requires that the medical assistance available to any categorically needy individual shall not be less in amount,duration,or scope than the medical assistance made available to any other such individual,nor less in amount,duration,or scope than the medical assistance made available to needy individuals.a b see also rodriguez,at.finally,under the due process provision,a state plan participating in medicaid must provide for granting an opportunity for a fair hearing before the state agency to any individual whose claim for medical assistance under the plan is denied.a.that requirement entails both written notice of any intended actions affecting a beneficiary claim and an evidentiary hearing to contest denials of service.see b,c id.
ii.new york medicaid amendments 
the state of new york has participated in the federal medicaid program since.see soc.serv.law dejesus perales,cir.the terms of new york medicaid plan,which is administered by the new york state department of health nysdh,are set out in the new york social services law,see soc.serv.law et,and title of the new york codes,rules and regulations,see et.
new york has chosen to provide medicaid coverage to both the categorically needy and the medically needy.see soc.serv.law lewis,at.standard coverage for both types of beneficiaries under its plan is defined as the provision of 
medically necessary medical,dental and remedial care,services,and supplies which are necessary to prevent,diagnose,correct or cure conditions in the person that cause acute suffering,endanger life,result in illness or infirmity,interfere with such person capacity for normal activity,or threaten some significant handicap 
soc.serv.law a.such standard medical assistance includes both nursing facility services and home health services provided in a recipient home.id.a b,d.it also includes coverage of sickroom supplies,eyeglasses,prosthetic appliances and dental prosthetic appliances.id.a g.
until,new york medicaid program provided orthopedic footwear and compression stockings to all beneficiaries for whom such services were medically necessary.during that time,regulations promulgated by the nysdh defined orthopedic footwear as 
shoes,shoe modifications,or shoe additions which are used to correct,accommodate or prevent a physical deformity or range of motion malfunction in a diseased or injured part of the ankle or foot to support a weak or deformed structure of the ankle or foot,or to form an integral part of a brace.
a effective until.although the regulations did not define compression stockings,the acting director of operations at nysdh office of health insurance programs has described such items as hosiery that exerts pressure against the legs so as to comfort aching and tired legs,prevent varicose veins from stretching and hurting,improve blood and lymph circulation,and minimize swelling joint app x at.
in,new york found itself facing a fiscal crisis.in searching for ways to reduce its budget,new york discovered that orthopedic footwear and compression stocking were a source of significant waste in its medicaid program.in the fiscal year for,nearly half of state medicaid payments for orthopedic footwear went to the treatment of hammertoes and bunions,common medical conditions that can readily be treated through inexpensive products.similarly,numerous beneficiaries submitting claims for compression stockings had used such items to treat common and relatively mild complaints,such as varicose veins or aching legs.
to reduce spending,new york amended its medicaid plan to limit coverage for both orthopedic footwear and compression stockings to what it deemed to be the most frequently occurring serious conditions requiring their use.in the spring of,the new york legislature added a set of qualifications to soc.serv.law a g,which addresses new york provision of sickroom supplies,eyeglasses,prosthetic appliances and dental prosthetic appliances.the revised version of that provision now provided that 
iii prescription footwear and inserts are limited to coverage only when used as an integral part of a lower limb orthotic appliance,as part of a diabetic treatment plan,or to address growth and development problems in children and 
iv compression and support stockings are limited to coverage only for pregnancy or treatment of venous stasis ulcers 
soc.serv.law a g iii,iv effective.
to reflect the legislature changes,nysdh also amended the definitions section at a and added a new limiting provision at g.the regulatory definition of orthopedic footwear now described such items as 
shoes,shoe modifications,or shoe additions which are used in the treatment of children,to correct,accommodate or prevent a physical deformity or range of motion malfunction in a diseased or injured part of the ankle or foot in the treatment of children,to support a weak or deformed structure of the ankle or foot as a component of a comprehensive diabetic treatment plan to treat amputation,ulceration,calluses,peripheral neuropathy with evidence of callus formation,a foot deformity or poor circulation or to form an integral part of an orthotic brace.
a effective,emphases added.the new subsection at g listed several established defined benefit limits on medicaid services,including limitations on orthopedic footwear and compression stockings that tracked the language of the legislature new qualifications at a g.see id.g,the limitations provision warned that nysdh shall not allow exceptions to defined benefit limitations.id.g.
prior to implementing its changes,nysdh submitted a proposed plan amendment for review by cms,noting the new restrictions on new york coverage of orthopedic footwear and compression stockings.cms informally advised the department that it need not obtain cms approval for the new coverage restrictions because,as paraphrased by nysdh,such changes in medical necessity criteria were within the state purview.joint app x at.the record contains no written statement from cms embodying this advice.the advice is evidenced only by an affidavit from jonathan bick,the acting director of operations at new york office of health insurance programs,attesting to what he was told by cms.
nysdh subsequently adopted its new regulations on an emergency basis effective april,and as a permanent rule effective march.it communicated the new changes in service to medical suppliers by issuing a series of provider update s for pharmacy and dme providers.it did not notify individual beneficiaries of the changes.
by restricting coverage for orthopedic footwear and compression stockings,new york saved million during the fiscal year.
iii.the plaintiffs 
plaintiffs include both categorically needy and medically needy individuals who qualify for new york medicaid plan on the basis of their disabilities.they suffer from a variety of ailments,including multiple sclerosis,paraplegia,lymphedema,cellulitis,psoriatic arthritis,peripheral neuropathy,and amputation.plaintiffs doctors have prescribed them orthopedic footwear or compression stockings as medically necessary items to treat their afflictions.such products help plaintiffs to maintain mobility and to avoid more serious complications,including skin ruptures,infections,and further amputations,which may require extended hospital care or even institutionalization.the commissioner does not dispute that orthopedic footwear or compression stockings are in fact medically necessary to treat plaintiffs conditions.
prior to new york amendments,most plaintiffs had received medicaid coverage for their orthopedic footwear or compression stockings because none of plaintiffs diagnoses fall within new york list of qualifying conditions,however,plaintiffs lost funding for those services in april.they received no written notice of the new coverage restrictions,but instead learned of new york change in service when they attempted to fill or refill their orders and were denied by their medical providers.
iv.procedural history 
on march,plaintiffs commenced this suit as a putative class action against the commissioner in the united states district court for the western district of new york.they claimed that new york coverage restrictions violated the medicaid act reasonable standards provision,a,its home health services provision,id.a d,its due process provision,id.a,and its comparability provision,id.a b.they also claimed that the amendments discriminated against them on the basis of disability and put them at risk of institutionalization in violation of title ii of the ada,et,and of the rehabilitation act.plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting nysdh from implementing the service changes,as well as attorneys fees and costs and disbursements.
in october,plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on all counts of the complaint,and the commissioner for summary judgment on all counts.prior to considering those motions,the district court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification.echoing the broad certification request in plaintiffs complaint,the court certified a class that encompassed 
a ll current and future new york state medicaid recipients for whom defendant has directly or indirectly failed to provide coverage for medically necessary orthopedic footwear and compression stockings as a result of new york soc.serv.law a g iii and iv and regulations and policies promulgated thereto.
joint app x at 
on december,the district court issued an order granting in part and denying in part both parties motions for summary judgment.the district court granted judgment to defendant on plaintiffs home health services claim,holding that orthopedic footwear and compression stockings qualified as prosthetics rather than home health services,and consequently were optional services that failed to trigger that provision.with regard to the remaining claims,however,the district court ruled largely in favor of plaintiffs.judge siragusa found that new york restrictions violated the medicaid act reasonable standards provision by denying coverage of medically necessary services without any consideration of beneficiaries medical needs,and violated the comparability provision by discriminating among categorically needy beneficiaries on basis of their medical conditions.while concluding that the due process provision did not entitle plaintiffs to evidentiary hearings prior to the termination of their benefits,the judge held that new york had nevertheless violated that provision by implementing its restrictions without first providing written notice to individual beneficiaries.finally,the court held that new york plan amendments conflicted with both the ada and rehabilitation act by treating some disabled individuals more favorably than others,and by putting plaintiffs at risk of institutionalization in violation of the integration mandate.
the district court thus concluded that plaintiffs were entitled to permanent injunctive relief,and directed the parties to settle and submit a proposed order concerning such injunctive relief within fourteen days.sp.app x at.in light of the court decision,nysdh announced that it would cease enforcing its plan amendments,explaining that it would simply return to its previous coverage policy for orthopedic footwear and compression stockings.joint app x at.subsequently,the district court entered a final order of judgment that,among other things,permanently enjoined nysdh and its agents from enforcing the coverage restrictions against any beneficiaries under new york medicaid plan.
discussion 
we review a district court order granting summary judgment de novo,resolving all ambiguities and drawing all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party.doe ex rel.doe whelan,cir.we may affirm a grant of summary judgment only if the movant establishes that there is no genuine dispute as to any material facts and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see also.a.
we review a district court grant of a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion.shain ellison,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when its decision rests on an error of law or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or its decision though not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.acorn united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to prevail on a motion for a permanent injunction,a plaintiff must both succeed on the merits and demonstrate the absence of an adequate remedy at law and irreparable harm if the relief is not granted.roach,at internal quotation marks omitted.because the commissioner does not dispute either that plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if nysdh continues to enforce its coverage restrictions or that plaintiffs lack an adequate remedy at law,the only issues before us are the merits of plaintiffs statutory claims.
reasonable standards provision 
first,plaintiffs claim that new york coverage restrictions on orthopedic footwear and compression stockings violate the reasonable standards provision of the medicaid act by denying beneficiaries access to services on the basis of their diagnoses without regard to their medical needs.
the medicaid act provides that any state participating in the federal program must include reasonable standards for determining eligibility for and the extent of medical assistance under the plan which are consistent with the objectives of this subchapter.a.as interpreted by hhs,that provision requires that each service administered by a state be sufficient in amount,duration,and scope to reasonably achieve its purpose,b,though a state may place appropriate limits on its services based on such criteria as medical necessity or on utilization control procedures,id.d.
in,congress has created a cause of action whereby plaintiffs may sue a defendant who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state,subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the united states.see also giordano city of new york,cir.that language on its face might appear to permit plaintiffs to sue the commissioner to vindicate their claims that new york amendments violate the laws of the united states insofar as they are inconsistent with the reasonable standards provisions of a and b.
the supreme court,however,has interpreted to create a cause of action only for violations of federal laws that manifest an unambiguous intent to confer individual rights.gonzaga doe,d internal quotation marks omitted.federal laws that merely set standards on the basis of which states may receive federal funding,for example,but that do not create specific rights for individuals,are not enforceable by a civil action under.id.at.because the medicaid act reasonable standards provision addresses a state general administrative duties under the act,rather than defining individual beneficiaries entitlements under that program,it does not appear to contain the type of language necessary to confer a private cause of action.see armstrong exceptional child,d.unsurprisingly,our sister courts of appeals to have considered the issue have thus concluded that the reasonable standards provision creates no such individual right.see hobbs ex rel.hobbs zenderman,cir lankford sherman,cir watson weeks,cir.
plaintiffs,for their part,seem to concede that the reasonable standards provision creates no private right of action under.instead,plaintiffs argue that the supremacy clause of article vi of the united states constitution endows them with independent authority to bring their statutory claim 
this court has previously held that where a state law conflicts with a federal statute,the supremacy clause creates a private cause of action to enforce the federal statute superior requirements.in burgio campofelice,new york state department of labor,cir,for example,we affirmed that the supremacy clause creates an implied right of action for injunctive relief against state officers who are threatening to violate the federal constitution or laws.id.at internal quotation marks omitted see also loyal tire auto,town of woodbury,cir.
in its recent decision in armstrong,however,the supreme court rejected that interpretation of article vi.as the court noted,the ample discussion of the supremacy clause during the ratification debates included no mention of endowing individuals with private rights of action against the states despite the fact that the constitutional creation of such a cause of action would have significantly restricted congress power to establish mechanisms for the enforcement of its own laws.at.at.in context,the court found it apparent that the supremacy clause simply creates a rule of decision by which courts are to resolve conflicts between state and federal laws.id.but it is not the source of any federal rights,and certainly does not create a cause of action to enforce federal statutes that do not independently provide for private enforcement.id.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
after concluding that the supremacy clause does not create a private right of action,the supreme court further determined that the language of the provision of the medicaid act at issue in the case,a a,at least when coupled with the express provision of an administrative remedy,indicated that congress intended to foreclose a private equitable remedy for violation of that provision.armstrong.at.the provision at issue requires that state plans 
provide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of,and the payment for,care and services available under the plan as may be necessary to safeguard against unnecessary utilization of such care and services and to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough provides so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.
quoting a a.the court concluded that the broad,complex,and nature of the provision text made it judicially unadministrable.id.accordingly,the court held that the provision was not privately enforceable by invoking the federal courts equitable powers.
plaintiffs claim under the reasonable standards provision in this case rests entirely on an implied right of action arising out of the supremacy clause.because the court decision in armstrong denies the existence of any such right,armstrong would thus seem to preclude their claim.moreover,the language of the reasonable standards provision is similar to that of a a,requiring that states include reasonable standards for determining eligibility.a.indeed,a district court in our circuit recently noted that the provision consists of a broad grant of discretion to the states,and that,l ike subs ection a,the reasonable standards provision focuses on programmatic aspects of the state plan as a whole,rather than on the specific benefits that must be accorded to individuals.cruz zucker,cv jsr,d,wl,at july.the district court thus held that the reasonable standards provision is not privately enforceable under armstrong.id.we agree.
plaintiffs object,however,that the commissioner has waived his challenge to their right to enforce the reasonable standards provision under armstrong or otherwise because he did not raise that defense in opposition to plaintiffs motion for summary judgment before the district court.it is true that,as a general matter,a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below.baker dorfman,cir,quoting singleton wulff,d.yet because waiver rules are prudential and not jurisdictional,we may exercise discretion to address an issue not raised properly before the district court.paese hartford life accident ins,cir.we are most likely to exercise such discretion where consideration of the issue is necessary to avoid manifest injustice,or where the issue is purely legal and there is no need for additional.baker,at internal quotation marks omitted.a party assertion of a claim earlier in the proceedings,as well as a lack of prejudice to the opposing party,may also weigh in favor of considering new claims.see stichting ter behartiging van de belangen van oudaandeelhouders in het kapitaal van saybolt int l schreiber,cir subsequent history omitted.
although the commissioner did not raise his supremacy clause objection in his summary judgment papers before the district court,he included it in his initial answer to plaintiffs complaint and in his opposition to plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction.indeed,plaintiffs extensive briefing on this issue on appeal demonstrates that plaintiffs suffered no unfair surprise or prejudice from defendant failure to argue the matter in opposition to summary judgment.furthermore,the commissioner objection to plaintiffs assertion of a cause of action based on the supremacy clause raises a discrete question of law one recently clarified by and readily resolved in light of the supreme court decision in armstrong that is dispositive of plaintiffs reasonable standards claim.under these circumstances,we find it appropriate to exercise our discretion to resolve the commissioner objection on the merits.
because armstrong forecloses plaintiffs claim that the supremacy clause endows them with an implied right of action to enforce the reasonable standards provision,defendant is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs claim under a.
ii.home health services 
second,plaintiffs claim that new york coverage restrictions for orthopedic footwear and compression stockings based on a beneficiary medical condition violates the medicaid act home health services provision by denying beneficiaries access to obligatory medical equipment or supplies.we agree with the district court that this claim is unpersuasive 
under the home health services provision,a state participating in the federal medicaid program must provide home health services for any individual who,under the state plan,is entitled to nursing facility services.a d.the parties do not dispute that new york medicaid plan provides nursing facilities services to both the categorically needy and the medically needy,and that new york is consequently obligated to provide home health services to both groups.they dispute,however,whether orthopedic footwear or compression stockings qualify as home health services so as to trigger that requirement.
as a preliminary matter,the commissioner insists that cms implicitly found that orthopedic footwear and compression stockings qualify as prosthetics when it excused new york from seeking further agency approval of its proposed coverage restrictions permission cms could have given only if it deemed new york plan amendments consistent with the home health services provision.as a general principle,we owe a significant measure of deference to cms interpretation of the medicaid act,cmty.health ctr.wilson coker,cir,including to its implicit judgment that a state plan complies with federal law in approving that plan,id.at,as well as to relatively informal communications,such as letters from local administrators,id.at.in this case,however,cms has submitted an amicus brief explicitly disclaiming that its communications with nysdh reflected any measured consideration of new york plan amendments entitled to judicial deference.see cms amicus br.at because that representation certainly merits deference from this court,we proceed to address the merits of plaintiffs home health services claim de novo.
the medicaid act does not define the meaning of home health services.see a d.implementing regulations issued by hhs explain that such services include m edical supplies,equipment,and appliances suitable for use in any setting in which normal life activities take place,b effective july.in july,cms issued a proposed rule containing more specific definitions of both supplies and equipment.the final rule was issued on february.see medicaid program face to face requirements for home health services policy changes and clarifications related to home health,codified at.the rule defines medical supplies as health care related items that are consumable or disposable,or can not withstand repeated use by more than one individual,and medical equipment and appliances as items that are primarily and customarily used to serve a medical purpose,generally are not useful to an individual in the absence of a disability,illness or injury,can withstand repeated use,and can be reusable or removable.b i ii effective july.we owe cms definitions a significant measure of deference.cmty.health,at.as discussed in greater detail below,however,we find the definitions in the rule,which seem intended primarily to distinguish durable equipment from consumable supplies,less than helpful in answering the question before us.the definitions are so general that,if applied literally as a description of what items must be provided under the rubric of home health services,they would mandate the provision of any health care related items whatsover.
independent of its obligation to cover home health services,a state participating in medicaid may also elect to provide beneficiaries with a variety of optional benefits,including prosthetic devices.a.in contrast to its broad and general definition of home health services,equipment,and supplies,hhs has adopted a relatively specific definition of prosthetic devices.that term encompasses 
replacement,corrective,or supportive devices prescribed by a physician or other licensed practitioner of the healing arts to artificially replace a missing portion of the body prevent or correct physical deformity or malfunction or support a weak or deformed portion of the body.
c.as purely elective features in a state medicaid plan,prosthetic devices are exempt from the requirements of a d.see rodriguez,at.
under both new york statutory definitions and a understanding of the terms,both orthopedic footwear and compression stockings fall squarely within the federal definition of prosthetic devices.the new york regulations define orthopedic footwear as shoes or modifications used to correct,accommodate or prevent a physical deformity or range of motion malfunction to support a weak or deformed structure of the ankle or foot or to form an integral part of an orthotic brace.a.similarly,compression stockings are,by definition,designed to support weakened limbs,exerting pressure to comfort aching legs,alleviate pain from varicose veins,and minimize debilitating swelling.see joint app x at.these functions align neatly with the definition of prosthetic devices adopted by hhs at c.
furthermore,new york itself appears to classify orthopedic footwear and compression stockings within the category of prosthetics.when the new york legislature enacted its new coverage restrictions in,it codified those restrictions under a g of the new york social services law,which addresses new york provision of sickroom supplies,eyeglasses,prosthetic appliances,and dental prosthetic appliances.see soc.serv.law a g.orthopedic footwear and compression stockings certainly do not fall within the category of eyeglasses or dental prosthetic appliances.nor do they plausibly qualify as sickroom supplies,which,lacking any more specific guidance in the social services law or agency regulations,we must interpret per their meaning as supplies produced for and used during medical confinement.see merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed defining sickroom as a room in which a sick person stays or a room in which a person is confined by sickness oxford english dictionary ed defining sickroom as a room occupied by,and set apart for,the sick if only by process of elimination,new york codification of its coverage restrictions on orthopedic footwear and compression stockings in a g suggests that it classified such services as prosthetic appliances.
plaintiffs note that nysdh regulations define the term compression footwear separately from prosthetic appliances a distinction they claim establishes that new york does not view such services purely as prosthetics within the scheme of its medicaid program.see a.we do not assign that distinction as much significance as plaintiffs would attribute to it.while plaintiffs are correct that the definitions section of includes separate entries for o rthopedic footwear and p rosthetic appliances,see id.a,that section also includes separate entries for d urable medical equipment and m supplies,see id.a,the fact that new york regulations include an independent entry for orthopedic footwear thus does not prevent orthopedic footwear from qualifying as optional prosthetics any more than it prevents it from qualifying as mandatory equipment or supplies.nor does nysdh decision to define orthopedic footwear separately from prosthetics in a change the fact that nysdh actual definition of that term falls squarely within the federal understanding of prosthetic devices at c,or that the new york legislature listed both orthopedic footwear and compression stockings under the category of prosthetic appliances at a g.we accord more weight to those facts than to any inferences to be drawn from nysdh decision to list compression footwear separately from both prosthetic s and equipment or supplies in its definitions section.
plaintiffs also emphasize that new york coverage guidelines for medical providers list compression stockings under the categories of both prosthetics and supplies.see new york state medicaid program,durable medical equipment,orthotics,prosthetics,and supplies procedure codes and coverage guidelines,version,at listing gradient compression stockings under prosthetics id.at listing s urgical stockings under supplies.we find that fact even less compelling.new york provider manual does not create law,but simply provides guidance to medical suppliers in dispensing their products.to that end,nysdh asserts and plaintiffs do not dispute that the sole purpose of classifying surgical stockings as m supplies was to make those services available for distribution at local pharmacies,rather than through specialized dealers.furthermore,to the extent that the provider manual includes s urgical stockings in the category of supplies,it further specifies that this classification applies only to stockings used for treatment of severe varicosities and edema during pregnancy a definition consistent with new york coverage restrictions.id.at.the provider manual thus does not even clearly conflict with much less undermine new york classification of orthopedic footwear and compression stockings as prosthetics under a g.
plaintiffs argue that,even if orthopedic footwear and compression stockings qualify as prosthetics under new york plan,they may nevertheless be subject to the home health services requirements so long as they also qualify as medical equipment or supplies.to that end,plaintiffs insist that orthopedic footwear and compression stockings fit easily within cms definition of medical equipment,as items that primarily serve a medical purpose,are not useful to an individual in the absence of a disability,illness or injury,can withstand repeated use,and can be reusable or removable.see b ii effective july.
we have our reservations as a matter of law about plaintiffs suggestion that services falling squarely within the definition of optional prosthetics may nevertheless qualify as mandatory services under the medicaid act.regardless,we need not resolve whether or under what circumstances that theory of the medicaid act might prevail,because we conclude that plaintiffs approach is plainly inappropriate in the circumstances of this case.
as noted above,the federal definition of home health services is exceedingly broad.hhs states that such services include m edical supplies,equipment,and appliances suitable for use in any setting in which normal life activities take place,but it does not explain what sorts of items those supplies,equipment,and appliances might comprise.see b effective july.extended literally to encompass any item of equipment or medical appliance that an individual can use in a setting,hhs definition would necessarily encompass most if not all prosthetic appliances.such a broad reading would plainly contradict congress intent in identifying a separate category of prosthetic appliances as purely elective medicaid services.
cms elaborations of the terms supplies,equipment,and appliances do little to remedy this problem.the rule defines supplies as health care related items that are consumable or disposable,or can not withstand repeated use by more than one individual,and defines equipment and appliances as items that are primarily used to serve a medical purpose,generally are not useful to an individual in the absence of a disability,illness or injury,can withstand repeated use,and can be reusable or removable.b i ii effective july.whittled down to their essence,those definitions essentially characterize medical supplies and equipment as,respectively,items for medical use that can not withstand repeated use by an individual,and items for medical use that can withstand such use.applied with no room for exception,those definitions would absorb the entire universe of prosthetic appliances,and much else,under the umbrella of obligatory services.
in context,we must assume that hhs more specific definition of prosthetic devices in c carves out precisely such an exception,exempting any items described therein from mandatory coverage under the home health services provision.indeed,that reading is the necessary consequence of the familiar canon of statutory construction that a specific provision takes precedence over a more general one.united states torres echavarria,cir.as the supreme court has recently affirmed,that canon dictates that where a general permission or prohibition is contradicted by a specific prohibition or permission,the specific provision is construed as an exception to the general one.radlax gateway hotel,llc amalgamated bank,d emphasis added.that principle provides an apt guide to the interaction between optional prosthetics and mandatory home health services under the medicaid act.given the sheer breadth of hhs definition of home health services and its relative precision in defining prosthetic devices,the close overlap between orthopedic footwear and compression stockings and hhs definition of optional prosthetics suggests that those services fall within a statutory exception to the obligatory provisions of the home health services clause.
that conclusion,moreover,makes eminent sense.the coverage of home health services is made mandatory for states that also provide nursing facility services,and is intended to permit patients who would otherwise be confined to nursing home facilities to receive equivalent treatment more economically in their own homes.the items covered by the home health services provision are thus primarily the types of medical supplies and equipment available in nursing homes as a matter of course,but not typically available in ordinary residences or community settings.prosthetic devices such as artificial limbs are not aspects of that sort of care,but rather are permanent or substitutes or supports for missing,weak or deformed portion s of the body.c.such devices transcend the sickroom and may be used by individuals who have no need of ongoing care in a nursing facility or in the home.it thus makes sense that their availability should be determined by separate rules.
finally,in an amicus brief to the court,the united states suggests that even if the federal medicaid act definition of home health services is too vague to provide useful guidance,a state itself may define medical equipment or supplies so as to classify particular items as both prosthetics and mandatory home health services.that is to say,if new york defined medical equipment or supplies with sufficient generosity and specificity to clearly encompass orthopedic footwear and compression stockings,the united states insists that we would need to defer to that definition and treat those items as mandatory within new york medicaid plan.
that theory offers plaintiffs no solace in this case,however,where new york definitions of medical equipment and supplies flatly preclude the conclusion that orthopedic footwear and compression stockings or,indeed,any prosthetics under new york plan also qualify as home health services.section a of nysdh regulations define d urable medical equipment as medical devices and equipment,other than prosthetic or orthotic appliances,that can withstand protracted use and are not usually fitted or designed for any individual recipient.a emphasis added.similarly,a defines medical supplies as items for medical use other than prosthetic or orthotic appliances,durable medical equipment,or orthopedic footwear that are consumable and.id.a emphasis added.those definitions explicitly exclude from the new york understanding of equipment or supplies either orthopedic footwear or,more broadly,any items that also qualify as prosthetics a category that includes,per soc.serv.law a g,prescription footwear and compression stockings because new york definitions of medical supplies or equipment do not plausibly encompass either orthopedic footwear or compression stockings or,indeed,allow any overlap with the category of prosthetics within new york plan those definitions can not bring such services under the category of mandatory home health services.
we thus agree with the commissioner that orthopedic footwear and compression stockings qualify as optional prosthetics rather than obligatory equipment or supplies under new york medicaid plan.the district court thus properly entered summary judgment in favor of defendant on plaintiffs home health services claim.
iii.due process provision 
third,plaintiffs claim that new york violated the medicaid act due process provision by implementing its new coverage restrictions on orthopedic footwear and compression stockings without providing affected beneficiaries notice of the changes or an opportunity to request evidentiary hearings to contest them 
the medicaid act requires that any state participating in medicaid provide for granting an opportunity for a fair hearing before the state agency to any individual whose claim for medical assistance under the plan is denied.a.consistent with that requirement,hhs regulations specify that,a t the time of any action affecting a beneficiary claim,the state must inform every applicant or beneficiary in writing of his right to a hearing,the method by which he may obtain a hearing,and his right of representation at the proceedings.c,b.the notice required under c must contain five pieces of information a statement of the state intended action,its reasons for that action,the federal or state law that supports or requires that action,an explanation of whether and under what circumstances the beneficiary may obtain an evidentiary hearing,and an explanation of the circumstances under which the beneficiary coverage will be continued.id.
despite the general requirement of an evidentiary hearing,hhs has specified that no state is obliged to grant a beneficiary such a hearing where the sole issue is a federal or state law requiring an automatic change adversely affecting some or all beneficiaries.id.b.accordingly,where a state amends its medicaid plan so as to eliminate a certain branch of coverage,beneficiaries who contest that amendment as a matter of law but fail to raise a valid factual dispute about their eligibility for coverage under the new scheme are not entitled to a hearing.rosen goetz,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also id.at noting cms approval of that interpretation.no similar exception applies,however,to a state duty to provide notification of its intended plan changes under.
because plaintiffs raise no factual disputes about their right to coverage under new york medicaid plan,as modified by the amendments,b excuses nysdh from having to provide plaintiffs with evidentiary hearings prior to terminating their benefits.nevertheless,since and still oblige new york to provide written notice of any action affecting a beneficiary claim,id.c,nysdh violated the medicaid act due process provision by failing to inform plaintiffs of its upcoming changes in coverage prior to termination.
the commissioner challenges this latter conclusion on two grounds.first,he suggests that,per the supreme court decision in atkins parker,d,the legislative process surrounding new york adoption of its plan amendments provided sufficient inquiry notice to satisfy the medicaid act due process requirements.we disagree.
in atkins,the supreme court dismissed plaintiffs claim that they were entitled to individualized notice prior to benefit reductions under the food stamp act,alerting them not only to the general change in law but also its precise effects on each of their households.id.at.unlike the present case,there was no dispute in atkins that the statutory scheme required,and that the state had in fact provided,written notice to all beneficiaries of the general changes to the aid program the only right claimed by plaintiffs here.see id.at.in evaluating plaintiffs subsequent claim that such generalized notice violated their constitutional due process rights,the atkins court held as the commissioner now emphasizes that congress legislative determination to amend the food stamp act provide d all the process that wa s due.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.as a constitutional matter,that holding proceeds inevitably from the principle that a ll citizens are presumptively charged with knowledge of the law.id.yet that principle does nothing to relieve new york of its duty to comply with the medicaid act statutory requirements that a state provide written notice of any action affecting a beneficiary claim.c.
alternatively,the commissioner argues that,even if nysdh violated the medicaid act due process provision by failing to provide written notice of its coverage changes,that failure was harmless error.based on the record not least,the fact that plaintiffs brought this timely lawsuit challenging new york proposed restrictions the commissioner insists that the absence of written notice did not deprive plaintiffs of any meaningful opportunities to protect their statutory rights.
the commissioner argument is facile at best.where a statute explicitly prescribes procedures to be followed by a state agency prior to taking certain actions,the agency can not avoid an injunction demanding compliance with those requirements by assigning plaintiffs the burden of demonstrating why such procedural requirements enacted in a direct exercise of congress legislative judgment are worth respecting in any given instance.as we have repeatedly recognized,a and its accompanying regulations endow individual beneficiaries under the medicaid act with an enforceable right to receive due process prior to state actions affecting their claims including the right to receive written notice of policy changes.see shakhnes berlin,cir a creates a right enforceable under granato bane,cir state action terminating medicaid services trigger s the recipient right to notice,a hearing,and the continuation of services pending that hearing.the fact that a handful of named plaintiffs managed to bring a federal lawsuit challenging the legality of new york coverage restrictions despite having received no notice of those restrictions is hardly an adequate response to plaintiffs complaint that new york deprived them of the administrative process promised them by the medicaid act.
in any event,the record demonstrates that nysdh failure to provide written notice of its coverage restrictions in fact caused plaintiffs direct and practical harm.absent such advance notice,plaintiffs had to endure the cost,inconvenience,and distress of seeking to refill their prescriptions,only to have their requests rejected by their providers or pharmacists.they suffered the disadvantage of receiving no opportunity to ration their current items or to find novel means to obtain replacements in light of advance knowledge that their medicaid coverage was set to expire.and even once they learned from their providers that their benefits had been discontinued,they received no notification of their right to a hearing and renewed benefits should their factual circumstances change.see d,e.under such circumstances,nysdh failure to abide by the procedural requirements of the medicaid act due process provision was hardly harmless.
we thus agree with the district court that defendant is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs due process claim with respect to plaintiffs right to have received evidentiary hearings prior to the termination of their medicaid benefits,but that plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment with respect to their right to have received written notice of the coverage restrictions prior to termination.plaintiffs injunctive relief on this ground should be limited to an order barring implementation of nysdh restrictions pending the provision of written notice to affected beneficiaries.see eder beal,cir catanzano by catanzano dowling.
iv.comparability provision 
fourth,plaintiffs argue that new york coverage restrictions violate the medicaid act comparability provision by providing lesser medical services to some categorically needy individuals than to others with the same medical needs.
the comparability provision of the medicaid act seeks to ensure that the categorically needy receive maximum access to benefits provided under a state medicaid plan,guaranteeing that the primary concern of the states in providing financial assistance rests with those persons who lack sufficient income to meet their basic needs.camacho perales,cir.pursuant to that goal,the provision imposes two requirements on any state participating in the federal program.first,the medical assistance made available to any categorically needy individual shall not be less in amount,duration,or scope than the medical assistance made available to any other such individual.a b i rodriguez,at.second,such medical assistance shall not be less in amount,duration,or scope than the medical assistance made available to needy individuals.a b ii elaborating on both elements,hhs implementing regulations reiterate that the comparability provision demands that all state medicaid plans comply with two separate criteria both that the services available to any categorically needy beneficiary are not less in amount,duration,and scope than those services available to a medically needy beneficiary,a emphasis added,and that the services available to any individual in the categorically needy group are equal in amount,duration,and scope for all beneficiaries within the group,id.b emphasis added.those requirements apply equally to mandatory and optional medical services.lankford,at.
as a b i establishes and hhs regulations clarify,the comparability provision does not protect categorically needy beneficiaries simply by prohibiting states from treating them less favorably than the medically needy.it also prohibits states from discriminating among the categorically needy by provid ing benefits to some categorically needy individuals but not to others.rodriguez,at.that prohibition includes providing different amounts,durations,or levels of medical care to different individual beneficiaries within any one categorically needy group.white beal,cir a ll persons within a given category must be treated equally.becker toia,e ach person shall be eligible for the same amount,duration and scope of coverage as all the others in his or her group see also sobky smoley,listing cases 
the commissioner does not dispute that plaintiffs include categorically needy individuals,nor that all the plaintiffs,no matter their diagnoses,have a genuine medical need for orthopedic footwear or compression stockings.by denying plaintiffs access to such services purely on the basis of the nature of their medical conditions,new york restrictions thus provide some categorically needy individuals lesser medical assistance than is available to others with the same levels of medical need.by definition,such a selective distribution of medical assistance offers an unequal scope of benefits to individuals within the categorically needy class,violating the plain language of a b i and b.
in an amicus brief to this court,the united states suggests that our resolution of plaintiffs claim depends on the breadth with which new york defines the purpose of orthopedic footwear and compression stockings under its plan.if,for example,new york designated purpose in providing orthopedic footwear were to aid growth in children,or if its purpose in providing compression stockings were to reduce swelling during pregnancy,then new york could restrict coverage of those services to children and pregnant women while nevertheless providing equal access to such services for all categorically needy individuals.if,by contrast,new york defined the purpose of those services simply as relieving pain or enhancing mobility,then a b would require it to provide those benefits to all categorically needy individuals with an equivalent medical need for such services.the crucial distinction,the united states thus suggests,is between adopting a medical service with a broad purpose and then limiting access to that service only to some categorically needy beneficiaries,which would violate the comparability provision,and adopting a service tailored to treating only certain conditions,which a state may do without running afoul of a b.
portions of the record in fact suggest that new york restricted the purpose of orthopedic footwear though not compression stockings under its plan to treating limited medical conditions during the revisions to its regulations,nysdh also amended the definition of orthopedic footwear under a to comport with new york new coverage restrictions.where previous versions of had defined orthopedic footwear as shoes or inserts used to correct,accommodate or prevent a physical deformity or range of motion malfunction,support a weak or deformed structure of the ankle or foot,or form an integral part of a brace,a effective until,the new regulations defined that term as any shoe or insert used 
in the treatment of children,to correct,accommodate or prevent a physical deformity or range of motion malfunction in the treatment of children,to support a weak or deformed structure of the ankle or foot as a component of a comprehensive diabetic treatment plan to treat various conditions and deformities or to form an integral part of an orthotic brace.
a effective,emphases added.that definition,which provides the best record evidence of new york intended purpose in providing orthopedic footwear under its medicaid plan,would appear to exemplify the type of limited statutory definition that the united states suggests may excuse new york restrictions from violating the comparability provision.
nevertheless,we can not accept the united states proposition that the comparability provision defers to a state definition of the purpose of any given service a proposition it presents without citing any legal authority in support as a correct interpretation of the medicaid act.we do not question that a state may,within reason,define the scope and purpose of the services it provides under its medicaid plan,especially when those services are purely elective.yet allowing a state to deny medical benefits to some categorically needy individuals that it provides to others with the exact same medical needs simply by defining such services however arbitrarily as aimed at treating only some medical conditions would risk swallowing the comparability provision whole.if,for example,new york defined the purpose of an arm cast as supporting regrowth of broken bones in the right arm only,or defined the purpose of a prosthetic leg as enhancing mobility in disabled individuals born without limbs,surely it would violate the comparability requirement to deny equivalent services to categorically needy individuals who break their left arms,or who lose limbs through amputation,but who have the same indisputable medical needs for a cast or prosthetic.such a scenario would seem an archetypal instance of denying some categorically needy individuals the same scope of medical assistance available to others under a state plan.
medical services are always,by nature,and rarely are two diagnoses or medical histories exactly alike.once we accept the principle that the comparability provision prohibits discrimination among individuals as well as groups,see b,it follows that that provision prohibits discrimination among individuals with the same medical needs stemming from different medical conditions.see rolland cellucci,d,noting cases holding that the comparability provision is violated if there is a disparity of treatment among the categorically needy even when those individuals have differing disabilities parry by through parry crawford,holding that comparability provision prohibits denial of services to categorically needy individuals with different medical conditions but equivalent needs.to the extent that such a provision might be read simply as precluding discrimination among individuals with the very same medical conditions,indeed,it would simply govern the equitable administration of a state plan,not the formal terms of that plan,which are explicitly at issue in the prohibition.see a a state plan for medical assistance must provide b the plan must provide that.
accordingly,we reject the suggestion that a state definition of the purpose behind its medical services may,in and of itself,resolve a plaintiff challenge under the comparability provision.rather,any genuine enforcement of the medicaid act comparability requirements must entail some independent judicial assessment of whether a state has made its services available to all categorically needy individuals with equivalent medical needs.see white,at assessing validity of state judgment of comparative medical need.where a state purports to have made a medical determination that a particular service is not a necessary or appropriate treatment for a particular condition,our review of that judgment would presumably be highly deferential even then,however,our deference may be limited by the requirement that a state determination bear some genuine relation to beneficiaries medical needs.see pashby delia,cir holding that comparability provision allows states to provide different coverage to different categorically needy individuals so long as th at coverage bears a reasonable relation to the particular needs of the individual internal quotation marks omitted white,at holding that state broad discretion to define the medical conditions for which treatment is necessary is limited by nexus to medical need.
the record in this case exemplifies how easily a state can amend its definitions of its medical services without any regard to beneficiaries medical needs and the propriety of some judicial oversight over those definitions.the commissioner does not purport to have determined that orthopedic footwear or compression stockings are medically necessary to treat only the medical conditions to which he has restricted them,nor that individuals with those medical conditions have a more urgent medical need for those services.indeed,the commissioner concedes that such products may be equally necessary for plaintiffs as they are for covered beneficiaries.rather,he explains that,as a measure,new york has elected to provide those products only to the most common conditions for which they are medically necessary thus denying coverage of those services not only to some individuals who do not genuinely need them,but also to some,such as plaintiffs,who do.the state then simply amended the governing regulations to define the purpose of the treatments as coextensive with the coverage it had decided,for reasons,to provide.such an ipse dixit can not suffice to avoid the mandate of the comparability requirement.
new york coverage restrictions thus violate the plain text of a b i and b,denying categorically needy individuals comparable access to equally necessary medical services.the district court properly entered summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs on their claim under the comparability provision.
anti disability discrimination under the ada and rehabilitation act 
fifth,plaintiffs claim that new york restrictions on orthopedic footwear and compression stockings violate title ii of the ada and of the rehabilitation act by excluding disabled individuals from public medical services on the basis of their disabilities,and violate the integration mandate of those statutes by placing plaintiffs at a substantial risk of requiring institutionalized care 
both title ii of the ada and of the rehabilitation act protect the rights of disabled individuals to participate in or funded services.title ii provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.similarly,provides that n o otherwise qualified individual with a disability shall,solely by reason of her or his disability,be excluded from the participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.a.
because the standards imposed by title ii on public entities are generally equivalent to those of,we treat claims under the two statutes identically in most cases.henrietta bloomberg,cir.to state a prima facie claim under either provision,a plaintiff must establish that she is a qualified individual with a disability that she was excluded from participation in a public entity services,programs or activities or was otherwise discriminated against by a public entity and that such exclusion or discrimination was due to her disability.fulton goord,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted a plaintiff may base her discrimination claim on one of three theories of liability disparate treatment,disparate impact,or failure to make a reasonable accommodation.id.
the commissioner does not dispute that at least some plaintiffs qualify as disabled individuals for the purposes of title ii and.nor does he dispute that new york coverage restrictions on orthopedic footwear and compression stockings exclude those plaintiffs from access to public medical services on the basis of their medical conditions,effectively subjecting plaintiffs to disparate treatment within new york medicaid program accordingly,the sole question before us on appeal is whether new york denial of necessary medical services to some disabled individuals on the basis of their medical conditions constitutes discrimination due to disability so as to violate the ada and rehabilitation
