introduction 
this case presents the question whether a liability insurer providing coverage for advertising injury and property damage is required to defend its insured in an action charging the insured with sending unsolicited advertisements to fax machines in violation of the federal telephone consumer protection act of tcpa b c,and with invasion of privacy caused by those faxed advertisements.
because we hold that the advertising injury and property damage provisions of the insurance policy did not provide coverage for liability for violations of the tcpa or for invasion of privacy caused by the sending of unsolicited faxed advertisements,we conclude that no potential for coverage existed and no duty to defend arose.the trial court correctly sustained a demurrer without leave to amend and entered a judgment of dismissal,and we affirm.
ii.procedural and factual history 
this appeal involves commercial package policies issued by paul fire and marine insurance company and by paul mercury insurance company.these companies will be referred to as paul.the policies insured fidelity national title insurance company,acs systems,acs,and others.fidelity national title insurance company is the parent corporation of micro general corporation,the successor in interest through merger of acs.

paul denial of coverage for defense and indemnity on january,acs notified paul of the kaufman complaint.on april,stating that the policy did not cover the type of invasion of privacy alleged in the kaufman complaint,paul informed acs that it denied coverage for defense and indemnity.
the acs complaint against paul on november,acs filed a complaint for breach of contract,equitable subrogation,implied indemnity,and declaratory relief against paul.after the trial court sustained paul demurrers with leave to amend,acs filed a first amended complaint on august,which is the operative complaint.

in the underlying lawsuit,the kaufman plaintiffs alleged that acs,a software company,used the services of datamart information services corporation datamart to send unsolicited faxes to recipients in and.
the acs complaint alleges three breach of contract causes of action the first cause of action for breach of contract alleged that the kaufman complaint sued acs for property damages,seeking damages for actual losses incurred by recipients of unwanted faxes,which included use of recipients paper and loss of use of fax machines while they printed faxed advertisements.because the kaufman complaint alleged that acs was liable for property damages under the policy,the acs complaint alleged that paul breached its contracts with acs by refusing to defend acs in the kaufman litigation.
the first cause of action alleged that acs contracted with datamart,an advertising agency,to promote the services of acs,and that acs itself did not send the faxes that are the subject of the kaufman suit.the complaint alleged that acs did not authorize datamart to send faxes in violation of any law,and at most negligently failed to assure that datamart sent faxes only to persons giving express or implied permission to receive them.the complaint alleged that acs reasonably believed that recipients of faxes sent by datamart gave express or implied permission to receive them,and that whether the faxes caused damages depended on the perspective of those receiving them.the complaint also alleged that where the insured conduct resulted in accidental damages from the fax recipient perspective,it constituted an event for purposes of the accident requirements of liability policies.
a second breach of contract cause of action alleged that the kaufman complaint sued acs for damages for advertising injury.invasion of privacy causes of action in the kaufman complaint alleged that unsolicited faxes from acs invaded the kaufman plaintiffs solitude and violated their common law and california constitutional rights of privacy.the acs complaint also alleged that acs had an objectively reasonable expectation that coverage for advertising injury in the paul policies extended to all torts recognized as an invasion of privacy in california law.the acs complaint alleged that paul breached its contracts with acs by claiming that advertising injury offenses in the policies provided no coverage and by refusing to defend acs in the kaufman litigation.
the acs complaint alleged a third cause of action for breach of contract for advertising injury based on umbrella liability coverage,which included coverage for invasion of privacy torts alleged in the kaufman complaint.this cause of action alleged that paul refusal to defend acs in the kaufman litigation breached paul umbrella liability policies.
the acs complaint also brought causes of action for equitable subrogation and for indemnification,which alleged that paul should pay acs attorney fees incurred in defending the kaufman litigation,which attorney fees had been paid by micro general corporation and fidelity national information solutions.a declaratory relief cause of action sought a declaration of the obligations of acs,micro general corporation,and fidelity national information solutions,which contended that acs was entitled to a defense and indemnity in the kaufman litigation,and of paul,which denied those obligations.
paul demurrer paul demurred to the first amended complaint,arguing that intended conduct is not an accident,whether or not the resulting damage was intended sending unsolicited faxes could not be making known material that violates an individual right of privacy because the content of faxed advertisements did not include private material about recipients of the faxes and no insured could have an objectively reasonable expectation that it could shift the consequences of such illegal activity to its insurer.
acs opposition argued that acs had an objectively reasonable expectation of coverage for all types of invasion of privacy reasonably within the policies advertising injury provisions,which did not restrict coverage to fewer than all four invasion of privacy torts and acs had a reasonable expectation of coverage for property damage,because the policies insuring agreements for property damage liabilities,using event rather than occurrence,included an occurrence,incident,consequence or result,and was not limited to unexpected or unintended conduct or damages.
sustaining of the demurrer and appeal by acs the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.after the court filed a judgment of dismissal,acs timely filed a notice of appeal.
iii.issues 
in the published portion of this opinion,we address plaintiff claims that 
a duty to defend exists for advertising injury liabilities and 
a duty to defend exists for property damage liabilities.
iv.discussion 
a.the insurer owes a duty to defend only if the liability policy provides a potential for coverage 
by this action acs seeks to require paul,based on the duty to defend contained in the insurance policies,to defend acs against the kaufman plaintiffs claims.a n insurer has a duty to defend an insured if it becomes aware of,or if the third party lawsuit pleads,facts giving rise to the potential for coverage under the insuring agreement.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.the nature and kinds of risks covered by the insurance policy establish the scope of the duty to defend.ibid.it is the potential for coverage under a particular policy,and in light of the specific pleadings and known facts of the third party claim,which establishes the insurer obligation to defend.mez industries,pacific nat.ins.th,d.i f,as a matter of law,neither the complaint nor the known extrinsic facts indicate any basis for potential coverage,the duty to defend does not arise in the first instance.scottsdale ins.mv transportation cal th,d.the interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.palmer truck ins.exchange cal th,d.we therefore examine the advertising injury and property damage provisions to make a determination,as a question of law,whether the paul policy provided a potential for coverage of claims in the kaufman litigation against the insured,acs.
b.the interpretation of insurance policies 
the interpretation of an insurance policy corresponds to the interpretation of contracts generally.the parties mutual intention when they form the contract governs interpretation t he fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.bank of the west superior court cal th,d.if possible,we infer this intent solely from the written provisions of the insurance policy.citation.if the policy language is clear and explicit,it governs.citation.when interpreting a policy provision,we must give its terms their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage.citation.we must also interpret these terms in context citation,and give effect to every part of the policy with each clause helping to interpret the other.palmer truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.a policy provision will be considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions,both of which are reasonable.citation.but language in a contract must be interpreted as a whole,and in the circumstances of the case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.
on the other hand,i f the terms of a promise are in any respect ambiguous or uncertain,it must be interpreted in the sense in which the promisor believed,at the time of making it,that the promisee understood it.citations.this rule,as applied to a promise of coverage in an insurance policy,protects not the subjective beliefs of the insurer but,rather,the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.citation.only if this rule does not resolve the ambiguity do we then resolve it against the insurer.bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
thus in determining whether a policy provides coverage based on policy language that is claimed to be ambiguous,the court must first attempt to determine whether coverage is consistent with the insured objectively reasonable expectations.in so doing,the court must interpret the language in context,with regard to its intended function in the policy.citation.this is because language in a contract must be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole,and in the circumstances of that case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
c.the advertising injury provision of the paul policy does not provide liability coverage for tcpa violations or for invasion of privacy arising from unsolicited faxed advertisements 
acs claims that the kaufman action alleges a particular invasion of privacy,the unreasonable intrusion upon the seclusion of another,that this tort is included within the definition of advertising injury offense in the paul policy,and that the paul policy therefore covered this liability and paul owed acs a duty to defend.we disagree.
as we have seen,the advertising injury liability provision obligated paul to indemnify and to provide a defense for damages for covered advertising injury caused by an advertising injury offense committed while this agreement is in effect.the policies define four advertising injury offenses 
libel or slander.
making known to any person or organization written or spoken material that belittles the products,work or completed work of others.
making known to any person or organization written or spoken material that violates an individual right of privacy.
unauthorized taking or use of any advertising idea,material,slogan,style or title of others.italics added.
acs argues that the italicized advertising injury offense provided liability coverage for the allegations in the kauffman complaint.the kaufman complaint alleged that defendants acs and datamart faxed thousands of unsolicited advertisements for acs to facsimile machines of persons,businesses,and entities in california,which violated the tcpa and business and professions code section,negligently breached duties owed to persons who received their advertisements to advertise in a lawful manner that complies with these statutes,and invaded the plaintiffs privacy in violation of common law and rights of privacy under the california constitution.
the issue in this appeal is whether the conduct alleged in the kaufman suit constitutes the advertising injury offense of m aking known to any person or organization written or spoken material that violates an individual right of privacy in the paul policy.
we examine both the written advertising injury the paul insurance policy,and interpret this provision in context,giving effect to every part of the policy with each clause helping to interpret the others.palmer truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.by interpreting the text of the advertising injury offense m aking known to any person or organization written or spoken material that violates an individual right of privacy and by analyzing this provision in the context in which it appears in the paul policy,we conclude that the policy does not provide liability coverage for the conduct alleged in the kaufman suit.
the right of privacy seclusion and secrecy 
the courts have found it analytically helpful to identify two meanings for the right of privacy secrecy and seclusion.resource bankshares paul mercury ins.cir,resource bankshares american states ins.capital associates of jackson county cir,american states.a person who wants to conceal a criminal conviction,bankruptcy,or love affair from friends or business relations asserts a claim to privacy in the sense of secrecy.a person who wants to stop solicitors from ringing his doorbell and peddling vacuum cleaners at asserts a claim to privacy in the sense of seclusion.ibid.thus a person claiming the privacy right of seclusion asserts the right to be free,in a particular location,from disturbance by others.a person claiming the privacy right of secrecy asserts the right to prevent disclosure of personal information to others.invasion of the privacy right of seclusion involves the means,manner,and method of communication in a location or at a time which disturbs the recipient seclusion.by contrast,invasion of the privacy right of secrecy involves the content of communication that occurs when someone private,personal information is disclosed to a third person.id.at.
paul contends that its policy provision provides coverage for invasions of a person secrecy privacy,which the kaufman complaint did not allege against acs.acs contends that the paul policy provision provides coverage for the invasions of a person seclusion privacy which were alleged in the kaufman complaint.we must decide which of these two mutually exclusive interpretations is correct.
by alleging violations of the tcpa,the kaufman suit alleged the violation of seclusion privacy.resource bankshares,supra,at see also,congressional statement of findings,and american states,supra,at.our task,however,is not to identify which privacy right is enforced by united states code section b c of the tcpa.the issue is whether the advertising injury offense provision of the paul policy creates a potential for coverage of claims in the kaufman suit brought under this tcpa statute.see american states,at.we find that both the text of the advertising injury offense at issue and the context in which that advertising injury offense appears in the paul policy confirm that the policy did not provide liability coverage for claims in the kaufman suit.
analysis of the text 
the text of the advertising injury offense at issue is making known to any person or organization written or spoken material that violates an individual right of privacy.it is true that sending unsolicited faxed advertisements constitutes a making known of written material to the recipient.under the paul policy,however,making known written material is not enough to trigger coverage.coverage requires an additional element,the making known of material that violates a person right of privacy.that is,the content of the material violates someone right of privacy when that material is made known.m aking known implies telling,sharing or otherwise divulging,such that the injured party is the one whose private material is made known,not the one to whom the material is made known.resource bankshares,supra,at,italics in original.
thus the coverage applies to liability for injury caused by the disclosure of private content to a third the invasion of secrecy privacy caused by making known to a third party material that violates an individual right of privacy.the coverage does not apply to injury caused by receipt of an unauthorized advertising fax,because in that case no disclosure of private facts to a third party has occurred the recipient of an unauthorized advertising fax has no claim that material that violates an individual right of privacy has been made known to a third party.
the last antecedent rule underscores this interpretation.the last antecedent rule provides that qualifying words,phrases and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrases immediately preceding and are not to be construed as extending to or including others more remote.renee superior court cal th,d.ordinarily the last antecedent rule applies to statutory construction,but it has also been stated to apply to contracts people ex rel.lockyer reynolds tobacco th,d and has been used specifically to interpret insurance policy language.anderson state farm mut.auto.ins.d.state farm mut.auto.ins.eastman d.considered grammatically,the word that in m aking known to any person or organization written or spoken material that violates an individual right of privacy can reasonably be interpreted only to refer to material.we find that material is not only the last antecedent of that but is also its only antecedent.that does not refer to making known.thus this particular advertising offense only refers to material that violates an individual right of privacy,and does not refer to a making known that violates an individual right of privacy.
nothing in the content of the written or spoken material in unsolicited faxed advertisements violated the recipient secrecy right of privacy.the faxes contained no facts about the recipients,and did not disclose or make known any private information about the recipients to third parties.see paul fire and marine ins.brunswick d.analyzing the same paul policy language as that in this appeal,resource bankshares,supra,concluded it requires undue strain to believe that sending an unsolicited fax ad that has no private information or content but rather simply advertised fairly the sender wares can reasonably be said to mak e known material that violates a person right to privacy t he plainest and most common reading of the phrase indicates that making known implies telling,sharing or otherwise divulging,such that the injured party is the one whose private material is made known,not the one to whom the material is made known.id.at,fn.omitted.
therefore the faxes did not violate the recipient right of privacy so as to constitute an advertising injury offense,and this provision of the paul policy did not provide a potential for coverage.
analysis of the context 
we interpret an insurance policy provision by giving effect to every part of the policy,with each clause helping to interpret the other,so as to avoid finding ambiguity in the abstract and in order instead to construe language in the context of the contract as a whole.palmer truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.the paul policy definitions of advertising injury offenses provide a context that clarifies the meaning of the provision at issue in this appeal.
as stated,the paul policy defines four advertising injury offenses.the first,libel or slander,involves a publication of defamatory content about someone to a third person,live oak publishing cohagan d.smith maldonado th,d.the second,m aking known to any person or organization written or spoken material that belittles the products,work or completed work of others,likewise involves a publication to a third person of content that belittles someone products,work or completed work.the fourth advertising injury offense involves the unauthorized taking or use of someone else advertising idea,material,slogan,style or title.these three advertising injury offenses therefore all involve the insured making known or unauthorized taking or use of content which injures someone.interpreting m aking known to any person or organization written or spoken material that violates an individual right of privacy in the context of the other three advertising injury offenses leads to the conclusion that it likewise involves not the mere communication or making known of written or spoken material.the covered advertising injury offense involves communication or making known of written or spoken material whose content injures someone else.interpreting a paul insurance policy containing these same four definitions of advertising injury,resource bankshares,supra,stated t hese four offenses all share the common threat of assuming that the victim of the advertising injury offense is harmed by the sharing of the content of the ad,not the mere receipt of the advertisement.id.at,italics in original.
therefore the paul advertising injury offense before us provides coverage only if the harmful content violates the secrecy right of privacy,and does not provide coverage for a violation of the seclusion right of privacy.the tcpa prohibits the faxing of unsolicited advertising rather than prohibiting or regulating advertising content itself.by focusing on the means,manner,and the advertising,the tcpa protects the seclusion right of privacy.res
