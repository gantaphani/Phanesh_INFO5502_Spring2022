background 
named plaintiff james the only the first complaint in this action in the northern district of california,alleging that defendants microsoft and best buy had violated the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,c and d.odom alleged that in april defendants entered into an agreement under which microsoft invested million in best buy and agreed to promote best buy online store through its msn service.msn is a division of microsoft offering internet access services.in return,best buy agreed to promote msn service and other microsoft products in its stores and advertising.odom alleged that pursuant to their agreement,best buy employees distributed different microsoft compact discs trial cds depending on what the customer purchased.for example,a customer who purchased a computer would receive a trial cd providing a free subscription to msn.a customer who purchased a cell phone would receive a trial cd providing a free subscription.
odom alleged that if the customer was paying by debit or credit card the best buy employee would scan the trial cd.if asked why the trial cd had been scanned,the best buy employee would claim it was for inventory control or otherwise misrepresent the purpose of the scanning.odom alleged that what this scanning actually did was send the information to microsoft.microsoft would then,without the customer knowledge or permission,activate an msn account in the customer name.if the customer did not cancel the account before the expiration of the free trial period,microsoft would start billing the debit or credit card number.odom further alleged that when customers called to dispute these charges,microsoft directed some of them to seek relief from their debit or credit card issuers.
odom alleged that the policies and practices by best buy and its employees relating to distribution of the trial but not limited to the deliberate failure to make disclosures and making of been formulated and implemented by best buy jointly with microsoft,by agreement with microsoft,with microsoft knowledge and approval for the benefit of both best buy and microsoft.odom alleged that no affected customer had been fully compensated for his or her losses,defined as a full refund of the unauthorized charges a full refund of the accrued finance charges payment of interest on the money during the time it was held by microsoft and compensation for the time,effort,and expense incurred in cancelling msn accounts and seeking refunds.odom alleged that these losses resulted from defendants actions taken pursuant to their agreement.
odom alleged that he purchased a laptop computer by credit card from a best buy store in contra costa county,california,in may.he alleged that he told the best buy employee that he did not need the trial cd because he already had another internet service,and that the best buy employee did not tell him that an msn account with microsoft was being established in his name or that any financial obligation was being imposed on him.he further alleged that he never used the free service that came with his computer purchase.after the period,microsoft began charging his account.odom alleged that when he noticed the charges he called microsoft and cancelled the service.
odom alleged that defendants acts constituted violations of civil rico,c and d.odom alleged that best buy and microsoft,acting together pursuant to their agreement,constituted an enterprise under rico that their actions,involving thousands of consumers,constituted a pattern of racketeering activity under rico and that they committed the rico racketeering activity predicate act of wire fraud in violation of.
microsoft,joined by best buy,moved to dismiss under rule b for failure to allege an enterprise,and under rule b for failure to plead wire fraud with particularity.microsoft also moved to transfer the case from california to the western district of washington based on a forum selection clause contained in the msn subscriber agreement.the california district court transferred the case to washington without ruling on the motion to dismiss.after transfer,microsoft withdrew its motion to dismiss based on odom indication that he intended to amend the complaint.
an amended complaint was filed on november.odom continues as a plaintiff.he adds slightly more detail to the allegations made in the first complaint.he now specifies that the best buy store was in pleasant hill,california,rather than merely in contra costa county.he further alleges that microsoft billed his credit card account for two months after the expiration of the period,that he has paid these credit card charges,and that he has not received any refund or credit for these charges.
katherine was added as a second plaintiff.alleges that in september she purchased a cell phone and a cell phone service plan at a best buy store in reno,nevada,using a debit card.she alleges that a best buy employee scanned a trial cd and swiped her debit card,thereby sending the information to microsoft and establishing a trial subscription in her name.the employee did not tell that this was being done.did not know she had this service and never used it.after the thirty days elapsed,microsoft withdrew monthly msn charges from debit card account for seventeen months without her knowledge or authorization.in november,received a bill from microsoft for monthly msn charges for april,may,and june after microsoft was unable to continue withdrawing the charges from her debit card account.upon receiving this bill,and her husband immediately contacted microsoft and discovered that the msn account had been established in her name through best buy.upon reviewing her bank statements,she discovered the withdrawals microsoft had made for seventeen months.finally,alleges that she has not received any refund for any of the msn charges that microsoft withdrew from her debit card account,and microsoft continues to seek payment from her of msn charges for april,may,and june.
plaintiffs expanded the allegations in the first complaint by further describing the agreement between microsoft and best buy.the amended complaint contains the following addition 
in defendants own words in a joint press release,this agreement is a comprehensive strategic alliance that encompasses broadband,narrowband,and online efforts provides for significant joint marketing in best buy retail stores,online and through vehicles,profit sharing,the promotion of to the million users throughout microsoft properties,and technology assistance and pursuant to which msn internet access and microsoft full range of connectivity solutions will be demonstrated and sold at the more than best buy stores in the and through,and best buy and will receive prominent and preferred placement across microsoft properties,including msnbc,and the travel service,hotmail service,webtv network,and the newly launched msn eshop online shopping service.
microsoft and best buy again moved to dismiss the rico claims under rule b and rule b.the district court dismissed the amended complaint on both grounds without leave to amend.it held that an enterprise had not been alleged within the meaning of rico under rule b,and that wire fraud had not been pled with particularity under rule b.plaintiffs then voluntarily dismissed their claims in order to allow entry of final judgment.plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of their rico claims.

iii.discussion 
the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico act,passed in as title ix of the organized crime control act,provides for both criminal and civil liability,stat.codified at.civil rico provides for treble damages.c.there has been some judicial resistance to rico,manifested in narrow readings of its provisions by lower federal courts.in four notable cases,the supreme court has corrected these narrow readings.
the first case was united states turkette,d,which we discuss in detail later in this opinion.the first circuit had read rico to prohibit only the infiltration of legitimate businesses by organized crime.united states turkette,cir.in its view,rico did not prohibit criminal acts by purely criminal enterprises.id.the supreme court held that the court of appeals had clearly departed from and limited the statutory language.turkette,at.the court explained 
as a measure to deal with the infiltration of legitimate businesses by organized crime,rico was both preventive and remedial if congress had intended the more circumscribed approach espoused by the court of appeals,there would have been some positive sign that the law was not to reach organized criminal activities that give rise to the concerns about infiltration.the language of the statute,most reliable evidence of its that congress opted for a far broader definition of the word enterprise,and we are unconvinced by anything in the legislative history that this definition should be given less than its full effect.
the second case was sedima,imrex,d,in which the second circuit had read civil rico to impose liability only against defendants who had been criminally convicted,and only for what the court termed racketeering injury.the supreme court disagreed with both propositions.it noted that the court of appeals had narrowly construed rico in order to avoid what that court viewed as intolerable practical consequences.id.at.but the court insisted that a less restrictive reading was required by the text of the statute.it wrote 
rico is to be read broadly.this is the lesson not only of congress expansive language and overall approach,but also of its express admonition that rico is to be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes.
underlying the court of appeals holding was its distress at the extraordinary,if not outrageous,uses to which civil rico has been put.instead of being used against mobsters and organized criminals,it has become a tool for everyday fraud cases brought against respected and legitimate enterprises.yet congress wanted to reach both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises.the former enjoy neither an inherent incapacity for criminal activity nor immunity from its consequences 
it is true that private civil actions under the statute are being brought almost solely against such defendants,rather than against the archetypal,intimidating mobster.yet this defect it inherent in the statute as written,and its correction must lie with congress.
id.at.citations omitted.
the third case was national organization for women scheidler,d,in which the seventh circuit had read civil rico to provide liability only when acts of a rico enterprise had an economic motive.the supreme court refused to read such a limitation into the statute.it wrote,
in united states turkette,we faced the analogous question whether enterprise as used in should be confined to legitimate enterprises.looking to the statutory language,we found that t here is no restriction upon the associations embraced by the definition an enterprise includes any union or group of individuals associated in fact.
the parallel to the present case is apparent.congress has not,either in the definitional section or in the operative language,required that an enterprise in c have an economic motive.
id.at.citations omitted.
the fourth case was cedric kushner promotions king,d,a civil rico case in which the second circuit had held that the president and sole shareholder of a corporation could not be a person who conduct s or participate s in the conduct of the corporate enterprise affairs.id.at.quoting c ellipsis in original brackets added.in the view of the court of appeals,the president and sole shareholder was therefore not a person made liable under rico.id.at.the supreme court disagreed with this narrow construction.characterizing the question as whether the president and sole shareholder the person was legally distinct from the corporation the enterprise,the court wrote,the corporate,a natural person,is distinct from the corporation itself,a legally different entity with different rights and responsibilities due to its different legal status.and we can find nothing in the statute that requires more separateness than that.id.at.
we take from these cases the general instruction that we should not read the statutory terms of rico narrowly.rather,as the court wrote in sedima,rico is to be read broadly.at.as congress admonished and as the court repeated in sedima,rico should be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes.id.at.rico a.
plaintiffs suit 
plaintiffs allege that defendants have violated two provisions of rico.first,they allege violation of c,which provides 
it shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in,or the activities of which affect,interstate or foreign commerce,to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.
second,they allege violation of d,which provides 
it shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsection a,b,or c of this section.
in the posture of this appeal,the survival of plaintiffs claim under c will ensure the survival of their claim under d.see howard am.online,cir.we therefore address,in the remainder of this opinion,only plaintiffs claim under c.
to state a claim under c,a plaintiff must allege conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.sedima,at.footnote omitted.the only questions presented in this appeal concern requirements and.first,microsoft and best buy contend that plaintiffs have not alleged an associated in fact enterprise under rico.second,microsoft and best buy contend that while plaintiffs have properly identified wire fraud as a predicate act of racketeering activity,they have not pled fraud with particularity.we address these two contentions in turn.
enterprise 
the definition of enterprise in the text of rico is fairly straightforward.in its entirety,the definition is as follows enterprise includes any individual,partnership,corporation,association,or other legal entity,and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.as is evident from the text,this definition is not very demanding.a single individual is an enterprise under rico.similarly,a single partnership,a single corporation,a single association,and a single other legal entity are all enterprises.at issue in this case is the last kind of enterprise listed in the group of individuals associated in fact.it is undisputed that a corporation can be an individual for purposes of an enterprise.what is disputed is the manner in which a group must be associated.
united states turkette 
in united states turkette,d,the only supreme court case directly on point,defendants were alleged to have been an enterprise within the meaning of and c.in the words of the statute,they were alleged to have been a group of individuals associated in fact for the purpose of engaging in acts constituting a pattern of racketeering activity.the first circuit had agreed with defendants that rico was designed solely to protect legitimate business enterprises from infiltration by racketeers and that rico does not make criminal the participation in an association which performs only illegal acts and which has not infiltrated or attempted to infiltrate a legitimate enterprise.id.at.the supreme court reversed,holding that a group of individuals associated in fact was an enterprise under rico even if the purpose of the enterprise was exclusively criminal.id.at.
in the course of its analysis,the court refuted various analytic mistakes by the court of appeals.the first circuit conclusion that rico did not apply to wholly illegal enterprises depended in part on its reasoning that a contrary holding would render portions of the statute superfluous.the court of appeals had stated,
if a pattern of racketeering can itself be an enterprise for purposes of section c,then the two phrases employed by or associated with any enterprise and the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity add nothing to the meaning of the section.the words of the statute are coherent and logical only if they are read as applying to legitimate enterprises.
turkette,at.quoting united states turkette,cir alteration in original.
the supreme court was at pains to correct the court of appeals reading of the statute.it wrote 
the court of appeals conclusion is based on a faulty premise.that a wholly criminal enterprise comes within the ambit of the statute does not mean that a pattern of racketeering activity is an enterprise.in order to secure a conviction under rico,the government must prove both the existence of an enterprise and the connected pattern of racketeering activity.the enterprise is an entity,for present purposes a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.the pattern of racketeering activity is,on the other hand,a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute.the former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization,formal or informal,and by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.the latter is proved by evidence of the requisite number of acts of racketeering committed by the participants in the enterprise.while the proof used to establish these separate elements may in particular cases coalesce,proof of one does not necessarily establish the other.the enterprise is not the pattern of racketeering activity it is an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages.
id.at.citation omitted emphasis added.
in context,this passage from turkette is easy to understand.the court of appeals had mistakenly equated the term enterprise with the term pattern of racketeering activity.the supreme court pointed out that the terms refer to two concepts that are separate and apart from one another the enterprise is the actor,and the pattern of racketeering activity is an activity in which that actor engages.see id.these separate concepts can be expressed grammatically as used in the italicized passage in turkette,enterprise is the subject,and pattern of racketeering activity is part of the predicate.actions that form the pattern of racketeering activity are often referred to as predicate acts,though likely not in the grammatical sense.see,mendoza zirkle fruit,cir howard,at.in the words of the court,italicized above,the enterprise is not the pattern of racketeering activity it is an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages.turkette,at.
turkette further explained that proof of a pattern of racketeering activity is not,by itself,proof of an enterprise.id.enterprise and pattern of racketeering activity are separate elements that require separate proof.in the words of the court,t he existence of an enterprise at all times remains a separate element which must be proved by the government.id.stating that w hile the proof used to establish these separate elements of enterprise and pattern of racketeering activity may in particular cases coalesce,proof of one does not necessarily establish the other.
confusion in the lower courts 
the court explanation of the meaning of an enterprise in turkette has not been clearly understood in the lower courts,including our own.we have taken this case en banc to correct and clarify our case law.
four circuits have read the language in turkette to require that an enterprise have some kind of ascertainable separate structure.the formulations vary among these circuits,but they all require that there be an ascertainable organizational structure beyond whatever structure is required to engage in the pattern of illegal racketeering activity.see,adm investor,cir enterprise must have an ascertainable structure distinct from the pattern of racketeering united states sanders,cir enterprise requires evidence of an ascertainable structure that exist s apart from the commission of racketeering acts united states tillett,cir enterprise requires evidence to show that the organization had an existence beyond that which was necessary to commit the predicate crimes citations omitted united states riccobene,cir enterprise must have an existence beyond that which is necessary merely to commit each of the acts charged as predicate racketeering offenses united states bledsoe,cir proof of ascertainable structure might be demonstrated by proof that a group engaged in a diverse pattern of crimes or that it has an organizational pattern or system of authority beyond what was necessary to perpetrate the predicate crimes.
the seventh circuit requires that there be some kind of ascertainable structure,but it does not require that it be a separate structure.see,richmond nationwide cassel,cir requiring proof of an ongoing structure of persons associated through time,joined in purpose,and organized in a manner amenable to hierarchical or consensual internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also united states rogers,cir imposing some structural requirements,but concluding that it would be nonsensical to require proof that an enterprise had purposes or goals separate and apart from the pattern of racketeering activity.
by contrast,four circuits have rejected any requirement that there be an ascertainable structure,separate or otherwise,for an enterprise.see,united states patrick,cir since congress intended the term enterprise to include both legal and criminal enterprises,and because the latter may not observe the niceties of legitimate organizational structures,we refuse to import an ascertainable structure requirement into jury instructions.citation omitted united states perholtz,concluding that enterprise is established by common purpose among the participants,organization,and continuity united states cagnina,cir turkette did not suggest that the enterprise must have a distinct,formalized structure.united states bagaric,cir stating that it is logical to characterize any associative group in terms of what it does,rather than by abstract analysis of its structure emphasis in original,abrogated on other grounds by org.for women,scheidler,d.
our own circuit has equivocated on whether an enterprise must have an ascertainable separate structure and,if so,what functions that structure must serve.see,united states feldman,cir declining to decide whether proof of ascertainable structure is necessary for an enterprise because the legitimate corporations constituting the enterprise each had organizational structures river city,fleming foods,cir concluding that business relationship akin to a joint venture was sufficient to establish an rico enterprise chang chen,cir explaining that it is sufficient to show that the organization has an existence beyond that which is merely necessary to commit the predicate acts of racketeering and citing the third circuit decision in riccobene,at.the confusion in our precedents has caused difficulties for the district courts in this circuit.see,hansen ticket track,d,the court acknowledges that the ninth circuit case law defining an association in fact using the separate structure analysis is less than clear.
we take this opportunity to join the circuits that hold that an enterprise under rico does not require any particular organizational structure,separate or otherwise.see patrick,at cir perholtz,at cagnina,at cir bagaric,at cir.to the extent that our past precedent suggests the contrary,it is hereby overruled.see,wagh metris direct,cir simon value behavioral health,cir chang,at.
no requirement of separate or ascertainable structure 
as we explain above,the supreme court statement in turkette that an enterprise is an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages is not a statement that an enterprise must have some kind of separate structure.at.rather,it is merely a statement of the obvious the enterprise and its activity are two separate things.one is the enterprise.the other is its activity.
to read the court statement in turkette as requiring that an enterprise have a structure beyond that necessary to carry out its pattern of illegal racketeering activities is not only to misread the particular passage of turkette.it is also fundamentally to misunderstand turkette holding.the first circuit in turkette had read rico to impose liability only when a legitimate business was infiltrated by a criminal enterprise.in the view of the court of appeals,rico did not impose liability on purely criminal enterprises.the supreme court reversed.
to require that an enterprise have a structure beyond that necessary to carry out its racketeering activities would be to require precisely what the court in turkette held that rico does not require.such a requirement would necessitate that the enterprise have a structure to serve both illegal racketeering activities as well as legitimate activities.in other words,it would the first circuit sought to require in the enterprise have a structure serving both illegitimate and legitimate purposes.but the court in turkette held precisely the opposite.it held that a purely criminal enterprise can be an enterprise within the meaning of rico.see also cedric kushner promotions,at.stating that rico protects the public from those who would unlawfully use an enterprise whether legitimate or illegitimate as a vehicle through which unlawful activity is committed ellipsis in original citations omitted.
further,to require that an enterprise have an ascertainable structure whether that structure serves both legitimate and illegitimate activities,or only illegitimate also to misread turkette.as the first circuit stated in patrick,such a requirement improperly narrows the definition of an enterprise because criminal enterprises may not observe the niceties of legitimate organizational structures.at.there must,of course,be an enterprise,as required by the statute and as explained in turkette.but there is no additional requirement that the enterprise have an ascertainable structure.
criteria for an enterprise 
the supreme court in turkette articulated the criteria for an enterprise under rico.according to the court,an enterprise is a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.at.to establish the existence of such an enterprise,a plaintiff must provide both evidence of an ongoing organization,formal or informal,and evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.id.we consider these criteria in turn.
common purpose 
we first conclude that plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that defendants best buy and microsoft have associated for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.id.according to the complaint,defendants had the common purpose of increasing the number of people using microsoft internet service,and doing so by fraudulent means.best buy furthered this common purpose by distributing microsoft internet trial cd and conveying its customers debit and credit card information to microsoft.microsoft then used the information to activate customer accounts.these allegations are more than adequate to establish,if true,that microsoft and best buy had a common purpose of increasing the number of people using microsoft internet service through fraudulent means.
ii.ongoing organization 
we next conclude that plaintiffs sufficiently alleged an ongoing organization,either formal or informal.turkette,at.an ongoing organization is a vehicle for the commission of two or more predicate crimes.cagnina,at internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states elliott,cir.according to plaintiffs,microsoft and best buy formed a vehicle for the commission of at least two predicate acts of fraud.microsoft and best buy established mechanisms for transferring plaintiffs personal and financial information from best buy to microsoft.that information then allowed microsoft to activate plaintiffs internet accounts without their knowledge or permission.these mechanisms enabled microsoft to bill plaintiffs improperly for msn services in,and.see united states qaoud,cir stating that coordinated nature of defendant activity supported finding of rico enterprise.the alleged contract between microsoft and best buy provides additional evidence of an ongoing organization.plaintiffs allege that,in addition to the transfer of customers information from best buy to microsoft,best buy agreed to promote msn and other microsoft products in its stores and advertising.in exchange,plaintiffs allege,microsoft invested million in best buy and agreed to promote best buy online store through its msn service.
iii.continuing unit 
finally,we conclude that plaintiffs have alleged facts that,if proved,provide sufficient evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.turkette,at.the continuity requirement does not,in itself,require that every member be involved in each of the underlying acts of racketeering,or that the predicate acts be interrelated in any way.qaoud,at.instead,the continuity requirement focuses on whether the associates behavior was ongoing rather than isolated activity.patrick,at.
the allegations of plaintiffs odom and describe similar methods of fraudulently charging best buy customers for msn internet accounts.plaintiffs allegations cover almost two years of conduct by best buy and microsoft.an almost time span is far more than adequate to establish that best buy and microsoft functioned as a continuing unit.that several employees engaged in the activity at different times does not defeat the continuity requirement.cagnina,at holding that a growing membership and diversity of activities do not preclude a finding of continuity.
iv.conclusion 
several courts of appeals have concluded that a broad definition of an enterprise would produce undesirably expansive rico liability.for example,when the third circuit in riccobene required that an enterprise have a structure beyond that necessary merely to commit each of the acts charged as predicate racketeering offenses,at,it did so to avoid what it called the dangers of a broad definition.id.at.the third circuit stated that it was concerned that rico liability would extend to situations far removed from those actually contemplated by congress,and that federal prosecutors could use the law to invoke an additional penalty whenever they had a case involving the commission of two offenses that,coincidentally,were among those listed as racketeering activities.id.
the answer to concerns like those expressed by the third circuit in riccobene was given by the supreme court in sedima,when it rebuked the second circuit for having interpreted rico to avoid what the court of appeals had called the extraordinary,if not outrageous,uses to which civil rico had been put.at.the court response was to point to the text of the statute it is true that private civil actions under the statute are being brought almost solely against legitimate defendants,rather than against the archetypal,intimidating mobster.yet this defect it inherent in the statute as written,and its correction must lie with congress.id.footnote omitted.
in turkette,the supreme court carefully articulated the criteria for an enterprise under rico.we do not believe that we are at liberty to add to them.applying the criteria articulated in turkette,we conclude that plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged an enterprise.
pleading fraud with particularity 
federal rule of civil procedure b requires that fraud be pled
