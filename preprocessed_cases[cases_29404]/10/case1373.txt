we consider in this appeal whether the district court properly enjoined doctors health,doctors health from pursuing a breach of contract claim against nylcare health plans of the,nylcare that resulted in a judgment for doctors health in bankruptcy court.the district court determined that the claim had been released in a settlement agreement in shane humana,et,a federal class action lawsuit brought by medical providers against companies.we hold that the claim at issue was not released and vacate the district court order enjoining doctors health from pursuing that claim.
background and procedural history 
beginning in late,doctors health managed nylcare medicare hmo plan in maryland,virginia,and the district of columbia,pursuant to a contract between those parties.in july,nylcare became a subsidiary of aetna healthcare,aetna.shortly thereafter,nylcare determined that it would discontinue the medicare hmo plan in doctors health geographic region and informed the government that it would not renew its medicare contracts for that region as of december.nylcare then notified doctors health that,as of january,there would be no medicare hmo plan for doctors health to manage.
in november,doctors health filed,in maryland,a petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code.nylcare submitted a proof of claim in the bankruptcy case.doctors health did not pay the claim.instead,the trustee filed an adversary action against nylcare,alleging that nylcare had breached its medicare hmo management contract with doctors health and had caused doctors health damages in excess of nylcare claim in the bankruptcy case,ex.the adversary action was tried at the end of,and the bankruptcy court took the case under advisement.
in while the bankruptcy case was pending but before the adversary action was tried,numerous putative class action lawsuits were initiated in federal district courts against health insurance companies in the industry.those lawsuits were transferred by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation to the southern district of florida and consolidated for pretrial proceedings.the consolidated cases moved forward as in re managed care litigation,mdl,on two tracks the subscriber track cases brought on behalf of subscribers or members of health plans and the provider track cases brought on behalf of physicians and other providers of healthcare services.
in september,the claims asserted in the provider track cases were brought in a second amended consolidated class action complaint styled shane humana,et.doctors health was not a named party.the shane plaintiffs were certified as a nationwide class.
in may,aetna,and all its subsidiaries,including nylcare entered into a settlement with the shane plaintiff class.the terms of that settlement were memorialized in a settlement agreement dated may,the agreement,ex.the agreement defined the class as any and all physicians,physicians groups and physician organizations who provided covered services to any plan member or any individual enrolled in or covered by a plan offered or administered by any person named as a defendant in the complaint or by any of their respective current or former subsidiaries or affiliates,in each case from august,through may.id.at.physician organization was defined as any association,partnership,corporation or other form of organization including without limitation independent practice associations and physician hospital organizations that arranges for care to be provided by physicians organized under multiple taxpayer id numbers,to plan members,ex.b at.
under the agreement,potential members of the class were to be given notice of the proposed settlement and an opportunity to opt out of the class and the agreement.at.notice was to be given through the mail to the potential class members last known addresses and through publication.id.at.those class members who did not opt out released aetna and all its subsidiaries from all claims arising on or before the preliminary approval date,that are,were or could have been asserted against any of the released parties based on or arising from the factual allegations of the complaint,ex.b at,a.the district court granted final approval of the settlement,on the terms stated in the agreement,on october.on november,the district court clarified its october,order and enjoined class members who did not opt out from the settlement from pursuing any released claims against aetna and its subsidiaries.at.the court retained jurisdiction over all matters relating to the interpretation,administration,and consummation of the agreement and enforcement of the injunctions.id.at.
in april,the bankruptcy court issued its ruling in the adversary action.the court disallowed nylcare proof of claim in its entirety and awarded doctors health contract damages of million,ex.c at.now a subsidiary of aetna,nylcare took two courses of action as nylcare,it appealed to the district of maryland and as aetna,it filed a motion to show cause in the southern district of florida seeking an order enforcing the release in the agreement as a bar to the bankruptcy court judgment.doctors health responded with an emergency motion in the bankruptcy court,seeking an injunction requiring aetna to withdraw its motion in the southern district of florida.the bankruptcy court granted that motion,ex.but,the maryland district court vacated the bankruptcy court injunction and stayed the appeal of the bankruptcy court rulings on nylcare proof of claim and doctors health breach of contract judgment pending consideration by the southern district of florida as to whether the agreement operated to release the claim doctors health pursued against nylcare in the adversary action,ex.
in the southern district of florida,the judge who approved the settlement between the shane plaintiffs and aetna considered whether doctors health claims against nylcare were released by operation of the agreement.he concluded that doctors health was a member of the settlement class,that doctors health received adequate notice of the settlement,and that doctors health failed to timely opt out of the settlement.id.at.he further concluded that the claim doctors health had pursued against nylcare in the adversary action was released by the agreement.id.and,he enjoined doctors health from pursuing that claim.id.
ii.issues on appeal contentions of the parties 
doctors health appeals the southern district of florida injunction doctors health contends that the claim it prosecuted in the adversary action was not released because doctors health was not a member of the settlement class and therefore not a party to the agreement doctors health was not given adequate notice of the settlement or the agreement and the scope of the release of claims in the agreement does not include the claim doctors health pursued in the adversary action.in the alternative,doctors health contends that,in the interests of justice,it should be given the opportunity to opt out of the settlement.finally,doctors health contends that aetna should be estopped from asserting that doctors health claim against nylcare was released by the agreement because aetna did not make that argument until after the judgment in the adversary action.
aetna contends that the district court did not abuse its discretion by enjoining doctors health pursuit of the claim it prosecuted against nylcare in the adversary action because doctors health was a physician organization member of the class,received adequate notice of the settlement,and did not timely opt out of the agreement.aetna also contends that the release language of the agreement is sufficiently broad to cover the claim doctors health pursued in the adversary action.aetna opposes doctors health request for an opportunity to opt out after the deadline.
