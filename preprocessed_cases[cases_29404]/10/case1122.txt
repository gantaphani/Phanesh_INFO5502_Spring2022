plaintiff appellant stacie somers somers brought a putative class action against defendant appellee apple,apple,alleging federal and state antitrust claims.somers seeks to represent a class of indirect purchasers of the ipod,apple portable digital media player pdmp,and a class of direct purchasers of music downloaded from apple itunes music store its.she alleges that apple encoded its music files with its proprietary digital rights management drm,called fairplay,which rendered its music and the ipod compatible only with each other.she further claims that through certain software updates,apple excluded competitors and obtained a monopoly in the pdmp and music download markets,which inflated apple music prices and deflated the value of the ipod.somers requests damages and injunctive relief in the form of music files.
somers moved to certify a class of indirect purchasers of the ipod under federal rule of civil procedure b,which the district court denied.after giving somers two opportunities to amend her complaint,the district court also dismissed somers antitrust claims with prejudice under federal rule of civil procedure b.somers appeals both rulings.we hold somers waived review of the district court class certification order.we further hold that somers failed to allege sufficient facts to state antitrust claims for damages and injunctive relief.accordingly,we affirm.
facts and prior proceeding 
in january,apple introduced a software program called itunes for personal computers.itunes enables computer users to organize and play digital music files,and upload or sync the files to a pdmp.the itunes software is on apple computers,and is also available to computer users by free download.in october,apple introduced the ipod,its first pdmp,which at the time,was capable of playing only unprotected audio downloads in format.
in april,apple launched its,an online music store accessible only through itunes.its began selling digital music tracks from major record labels for cents each.its music files were encrypted with fairplay at the point of purchase through itunes.drm is designed to restrict a consumer use and reproduction of digital files.major record labels required that digital music files sold by apple through itunes be in a protected format,but did not require apple to restrict music files for use only with apple products.both itunes and the ipod were updated to be compatible with fairplay encryption.as a result,music purchased from its could only be played on the ipod,and the ipod could only play music downloaded from its.
in november,somers purchased a ipod from a target store,and thereafter,purchased music from its that was encoded with fairplay.
somers ipod overcharge claim and motion for class certification 
in december,somers filed her complaint against apple on behalf of a class of indirect purchasers of apple products indirect purchaser action.in her original complaint,somers asserted a claim for unlawful tying under section of the sherman act,and monopolization claims under section of the sherman act,along with related state law claims.somers alleged that apple fairplay and software updates rendered its music incompatible with digital media players,thereby increasing ipod demand and enabling apple to charge supracompetitive prices for the ipod.somers sought damages for the alleged ipod overcharge on behalf of herself and other consumers who purchased their ipod from a reseller.
in february,the district court related this action to a case making similar factual allegations and claims against apple on behalf of direct purchasers of apple products apple ipod itunes antitrust litigation,no.c direct purchaser action.in the direct purchaser action,the district court concluded that the technological interoperability between the ipod and media sold through its did not constitute unlawful tying,and ordered the tying claim dismissed.
in february,somers moved to certify an injunctive and damage class of indirect purchasers of apple ipod under rules b and b,respectively the district court denied somers motion to certify a class of indirect purchasers of the ipod under rule b,on the ground that illinois brick illinois,d,prohibits indirect purchasers from recovering for violations of federal antitrust law.the district court further ruled that even though california has enacted statutes repealing the illinois brick rule of private actions under state antitrust laws,certification under rule b was still inappropriate because somers had failed to establish a reliable measure for damages in an action on behalf of indirect purchasers.the district court deferred ruling on somers motion for certification of the rule b injunctive class in light of the pending direct purchaser action.
in july,somers filed her first amended complaint fac.somers dropped her tying claim and brought monopolization claims under section of the sherman act,as well as a claim under california unfair competition law ucl,cal.bus,et.somers asserted a damage claim based on two new theories i inflated prices for music downloads and ii deflated value of the ipod.the district court dismissed the fac with leave to amend.
second amended complaint 
in january,somers filed the sac,in which she dropped her damage claim based on the ipod theory,and otherwise renewed her federal antitrust claims and ucl claim.in the sac,somers seeks to represent a class of individuals who purchased music files from its.somers alleges that as a result of the fairplay encryption,apple achieved a monopoly in the pdmp and audio download markets.specifically,somers alleges that shortly after the release of its in april,i apple achieved and maintained a market share of over percent of the audio download market and ii increased its market share of the pdmp market from to percent.somers claims that apple achieved a monopoly in both the pdmp and music downloads markets by,at the latest.
somers next alleges that apple maintained and furthered its monopoly in these markets through the use of software updates intended to prevent competitors from selling audio downloads that were compatible with ipods.sac.for example,in july,real networks introduced a technology known as harmony,which enabled songs purchased through its online stores to be compatible with ipods and other digital media players,thereby offering an alternative to its.real networks began selling its music as low as cents per track,compared to the cents per track charged by apple.in october,apple responded by updating its ipod and itunes software to prevent songs downloaded from real networks music store from being played on ipods.somers alleges that as a result of such software updates,apple was able to thwart real networks effort to compete in the audio download market,thereby enabling apple to continue to charge supracompetitive prices for digital music.according to somers,h ad apple not engaged in this anticompetitive action,it would have had to price audio downloads on price with real networks.id.
somers then alleges that apple continually issued software updates from through to prevent competitors from entering and threatening its monopolies.specifically,somers claims that apple issued software updates to itunes to block and neutralize computer programs such as jhymn,qtfairuse,playfair,and requiem,which enabled users to play their its music on devices.apple also introduced software updates to prevent syncing functionality with certain media players.
in january,amazon became the first music store to sell music files without drm restrictions.amazon sold over half of the more than million songs in its initial catalog for cents each.in january,apple announced that it would begin selling most songs through its without fairplay restrictions.when apple introduced variable pricing in,and offered for,amazon sold many of the same tracks for cents.apple sold a few songs for cents.consumers who had previously purchased their music through its could upgrade their files to a format,but only by paying cents per file.by the end of march,all music sold through its was free of fairplay encryption.
somers asserts that as a result of apple software updates and the technological link created by fairplay,apple was able to preserve its monopoly in both the pdmp and audio download markets,charge supracompetitive prices,and restrict consumer choices.id.somers claims that apple has maintained the restriction on music purchased from its,thereby forcing customers to pay apple substantial sums to free their music libraries or purchase an apple product to play their music.
based on these allegations,somers asserts claims for injunctive relief counts i,ii and damages count iii for violation of section of the sherman antitrust act,as well as a ucl claim count iv.the district court dismissed the sac with prejudice,and somers timely appealed.

discussion 
class certification of indirect purchasers of the ipod 
somers challenges the district court july order denying her motion to certify a class of indirect purchasers of the ipod under rule b.apple argues that this decision is not properly before us because somers abandoned her underlying individual claim.apple is correct.
in the original december complaint,somers sought to represent,inter alia,a class of indirect purchasers of the ipod damages class.somers class claim was predicated on her individual claim for damages under section of the sherman act based on inflated ipod prices.apple answered the original complaint in february.in her february motion for class certification,somers sought to certify a class of indirect purchasers of the ipod only.the district court denied that motion.in the fac,filed in july,somers did not renew her individual damage claim based on an overcharge ipod theory,but rather,asserted a new theory based on the diminution in ipod value.somers alleged that apple purported conduct restricted the ipod capability,and lessened its uses,usefulness and value to plaintiff and the class.fac.before somers filing of the fac,apple did not move to dismiss her overcharge ipod claim.nor did the district court dismiss somers individual overcharge ipod claim.in her january sac,somers again changed her damage theory this time on the basis of supracompetitive music prices.although apple,twice,expressly asserted that somers had dropped her overcharge ipod claim,somers did not pursue that claim or challenge apple assertion.see mot.to dismiss appeal,exh.mot.to dismiss fac,at for ipod purchasers,she drops the claim that ipod prices were supracompetitive which the court had ruled was not a basis for class certification.and exh.mot.to dismiss sac,at she now has dropped the ipod overcharge claim with which she began her suit four years ago.
under these circumstances,somers has voluntarily abandoned her overcharge ipod claim.see lacey,at f or any claims voluntarily dismissed,we will consider those claims to be waived if not repled.walsh.dep t of human,cir a plaintiff who makes a claim in his complaint,but fails to raise the issue in response to a defendant motion to dismiss has effectively abandoned his claim,and can not raise it on appeal.somers had an obligation to pursue her overcharge ipod claim on an individual basis to obtain review of the district court denial of certification on that claim.see huey teledyne,cir finding the district court refusal to certify the class unreviewable because plaintiff failed to prosecute the underlying individual claim following denial marks real estate,cir p laintiff must be willing to proceed to trial,albeit reluctantly,on his individual claim in order to obtain eventual review of the class decertification order.because somers has abandoned the individual claim for which she sought class certification,the issue of whether the district court erred in denying her motion to certify that claim for class treatment is waived.
ii.damages claim based on diminution in ipod value 
somers also appeals the district court december order dismissing her monopolization claim for damages based on the theory of diminution in ipod value,as alleged under count iv of the fac.in the fac,somers sought to represent a class on behalf of i direct purchasers of its music,and ii indirect purchasers of the ipod.somers alleged that apple impaired the uses,usefulness and value of ipods purchased by indirect purchasers,and made ipods less valuable to plaintiff and the class,because they were unable to download music tracks that would have been available from competitors at lower prices.fac.somers sought compensatory damages on behalf of herself and all other indirect purchasers of ipods for the diminution in value to their ipods caused by apple restrictive updates.id.
the district court properly dismissed this claim on the ground that it was barred by illinois brick illinois,d.the indirect purchaser rule bars suits for antitrust damages by customers who do not buy directly from a defendant,as explained by the supreme court in hanover shoe,united states machinery,d,and illinois brick.in illinois brick,the court held that allowing indirect purchasers to sue for damages,while refusing to allow a defense to direct purchaser plaintiffs,would create the risk of double recovery against defendants,and necessitate complex and costly inquiries into the amount of injury passed on to the plaintiffs.at see also.valley surgical supply johnson johnson health care,cir observing that a bright line rule emerged from illinois brick only direct purchasers have standing under of the clayton act to seek damages for antitrust violations accord in re atm fee antitrust,cir.the underlying purposes for the rule are to eliminate the complications of apportioning overcharges between direct and indirect purchasers to eliminate multiple recoveries and to promote the vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.in re atm fee antitrust,at quoting kansas utilicorp united,d.
here,while somers requests compensatory damages on the theory that apple software updates deflated the value of her ipod rather than causing an inflation of initial ipod prices the rationale under illinois brick applies equally to this type of damage claim.the plaintiff in the related direct purchaser action case is seeking damages based on the same kinds of ipods that form the basis of somers suit here,but on the theory that the software upgrades inflated ipod prices.thus,allowing somers to sue as an indirect purchaser would lead to litigation on contradictory,duplicative theories of recovery necessitating evidentiary complexities and uncertainties,which the indirect purchaser rule was intended to prevent.illinois brick,at 
but even if illinois brick did not apply,somers lacks standing to bring this claim under the facts alleged in the fac.somers alleges that she purchased her ipod in november,but apple purported conduct use of software updates began in.see fac.apple software updates after thus only served to maintain the status quo,music downloaded from its can only be played on the ipod.
somers theory is also useless by any other ipod purchaser because somers alleges that apple used fairplay from the beginning,when it first launched its in,and that the ipod was incapable of playing music from any other store.see fac ipods were unable to play any file encrypted with any drm format other than fairplay,from the beginning of its,apple designed the ipod software so it could only play a single protected digital format,apple aac format.accordingly,apple use of subsequent software updates only served to maintain the status quo at the time of purchase,and therefore can not plausibly be the basis for diminishing the value of the ipod.
iii.damages claim based on overcharged music downloads 
somers next challenges the district court july order dismissing her music overcharge claim.in the fac,somers alleged an antitrust claim based on the theory that apple use of software updates inflated its music prices.the district court initially dismissed the claim with leave to amend on the ground that somers failed to allege sufficient facts in support of her allegation that apple its pricing was supracompetitive or that the pricing of excluded competitors were competitive.the district court noted that somers had only alleged that apple competitor priced music lower than did apple.the district court also observed that somers alleged in contradictory fashion that the prices for its music remained the same since apple entered the market in,including prior to purportedly obtaining a monopoly in the market,and after apple share declined.
somers renewed the same claim in the sac.the district court dismissed the claim with prejudice because somers had not corrected the deficiencies identified in the fac,and because somers claim was premised on the presumption that apple maintenance of its files constituted an antitrust violation a presumption that the district court had already rejected.on appeal,somers argues that the district court erred by applying an improper proof requirement,and ignoring allegations supporting her monopolization claim.neither argument has merit.
first,somers contends that the district court erred by requiring her to prove supracompetitive pricing.somers is mistaken.the district court did not require her to prove,but rather,to plead the elements of a monopolization claim.section of the sherman act provides every person who shall monopolize,or attempt to monopolize,or combine or conspire with any other persons,to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce shall be deemed guilty of a felony.to state a plausible monopolization claim under this provision requires plaintiff to show a the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market b the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power and c causal antitrust injury.allied orthopedic appliances tyco health care group lp,cir citation and quotes omitted accord cost mgmt.natural gas,cir.thus,contrary to somers assertion,causal antitrust injury is a substantive element of an antitrust claim,and the fact of injury or damage must be alleged at the pleading stage.see kline coldwell,banker,cir rebel oil atl.richfield,cir.
at issue here is whether somers has pleaded sufficient facts to state a plausible antitrust injury.antitrust injury means injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.brunswick pueblo bowl o mat,d.parsing the supreme court definition of antitrust injury,we have held that antitrust injury consists of four elements unlawful conduct,causing an injury to the plaintiff,that flows from that which makes the conduct unlawful,and that is of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent.am.ad.of cal,cir accord glenn holly entm t,tektronix,cir.with respect to the second element,a plaintiff must allege some credible injury caused by the unlawful conduct.there can be no antitrust injury if the plaintiff stands to gain from the alleged unlawful conduct.am.ad,at.in addition,we have imposed a fifth element that the injured party be a participant in the same market as the alleged malefactors,meaning the party alleging the injury must be either a consumer of the alleged violator goods or services or a competitor of the alleged violator in the restrained market.glenn holly entm t,at citations and quotes omitted.a plaintiff can request treble damages for an antitrust violation under section of the clayton act.a 
a key issue in this appeal is whether under american ad second requirement,somers suffered an injury caused by apple anticompetitive conduct.at.somers alleges that she suffered injury in the form of inflated music prices.the premise of her overcharge theory is that apple used software updates to thwart competitors,real networks and gain a monopoly in the music download market,which permitted apple to charge higher prices for its music than it could have in a competitive market.specifically,somers alleges that if apple had not engaged in conduct to exclude real networks from the market,it would have had to price audio downloads to compete on price with real networks.sac.
unfortunately for somers,her own allegations do not square with her overcharge theory.somers claims that the price for music downloads remained the same cents since it entered the market in,before it obtained monopoly in the audio download market,and after it allegedly acquired monopoly in that market in.see id.its initially offered over songs from the major record labels for cents each,apple achieved a monopoly by at the latest,stating that apple charged cents per track in july after realnetworks entered the market.moreover,with the exception of brief references to a few tracks and,somers does not allege that apple music price changed even after apple alleged monopoly ended in the beginning of when amazon began selling music,and after apple began selling music in january.but somers earlier alleged that if apple had not used software updates to thwart competition,it would have had to lower the price of its music to compete with its rivals.see id.accordingly,if somers overcharge theory were correct,then apple music prices from to were supracompetitive as a result of software updates that excluded competition,and the emergence of a large seller such as amazon would have caused its music prices to fall.but somers alleges no such price reduction.somers overcharge theory is thus implausible in the face of contradictory market facts alleged in her complaint.as somers herself acknowledges,under basic economic principles,increased competition as apple encountered in with the entrance of amazon generally lowers prices.see leegin creative leather prods.psks,d barr,abbott,cir.the fact that apple continuously charged the same price for its music irrespective of the absence or presence of a competitor renders implausible somers conclusory assertion that apple software updates affected music prices.see coalition for icann transparency,verisign,cir on a motion to dismiss in an antitrust case,a court must determine whether an antitrust claim is plausible in l
