factual and procedural background 
factual background 
cox is a trucking company specializing in hauling petroleum products and related products.plaintiffs are former truck drivers employed by cox in the state of california.
cox drivers haul ethanol from storage tanks at ethanol storage facilities in california,known as hubs,to storage tanks at truck terminals in california,known as tank farms.at the truck terminals,cox trucks are loaded with a combination of ethanol from ethanol storage tanks and gasoline from gasoline storage tanks for delivery to gasoline service stations in california.techron,a gasoline additive used exclusively by chevron,is transported by truck from storage facilities in california to truck terminals in california and then loaded onto delivery trucks together with gasoline and ethanol in the same manner.cox drivers also haul motor oil,known as lube oil,the gasoline additives isooctane and alkylate,and fuel oil from facilities in california to other facilities in california.cox drivers also haul products across state lines.cox maintains that its drivers are exempt from state and federal overtime compensation requirements and does not pay its drivers overtime.
cox vacation benefits policy provided that eligible employees earned one or more weeks of paid vacation annually,depending on their length of employment.the policy provided,however,that drivers would be paid only per week increased in to per week during their vacation and that employees would receive no payment for vacation benefits upon the termination of their employment.
plaintiffs filed a complaint against cox in july and filed a first amended complaint in april alleging counts for failure to pay overtime compensation due under state law failure to provide meal periods and rest breaks failure to pay wages for work performed off the clock failure to pay promised vacation benefits in full failure to pay vacation benefits due upon termination of employment,failure to pay overtime,vacation and other compensation due upon termination of employment and unfair business practices bus,
cox removed the action to federal district court.the federal district court determined that it had no subject matter jurisdiction and granted plaintiffs motion to remand the action to the superior court in october.
class certification 
the trial court granted class certification on plaintiffs count for failure to pay vacation benefits due upon termination of employment,but denied class certification on the other counts.the court defined the certified class as all truck drivers employed by cox at any time after july,who were not paid their accrued vacation wages upon the termination of their employment with cox plaintiffs petitioned this court for a writ of mandate.we held that the denial of class certification on the counts for failure to pay overtime compensation and failure to pay promised vacation benefits was error and directed the court to grant class certification on those counts.bell superior court,opn.ordered nonpub.we concluded that plaintiffs count for failure to pay promised vacation benefits was based on the alleged illegality of cox policy of paying drivers a flat rate of vacation benefits.id.at.
summary adjudication 
cox filed a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication in august.the trial court granted summary adjudication of the first count for failure to pay overtime compensation,fourth count for failure to pay promised vacation benefits and fifth count for failure to pay vacation benefits due upon termination of employment,and otherwise denied the motion.the court concluded that the counts for failure to pay promised vacation benefits and failure to pay vacation benefits due upon termination were preempted by the employee retirement income security act erisa et.the court also found with respect to the count for failure to pay promised vacation benefits that cox vacation benefits policy was legal in any event.
motion to exclude witnesses from testifying at trial 
plaintiffs filed a motion on april,to exclude from testifying at trial witnesses who were not identified in cox interrogatory responses.the trial was scheduled to commence on april.the witnesses were individual representatives of third party shippers whom cox intended to call to testify at trial regarding the interstate nature of its business.after the trial date was continued,cox agreed to cooperate in arranging for depositions of the witnesses provided that the depositions took place close to their homes at a time convenient for the witnesses and that the depositions would be limited to the subject of the witnesses expected trial testimony.plaintiffs declined the offer.
plaintiffs filed another motion on june,to exclude from testifying at trial witnesses who were not identified in cox interrogatory responses.the trial was scheduled to commence on june.plaintiffs argued that cox had willfully failed to disclose the names of the witnesses in response to discovery requests directly calling for such information and that the failure to identify the witnesses had impeded plaintiffs trial preparation.citing thoren johnston washer d,plaintiffs argued that the exclusion of the witnesses from testifying at trial was appropriate as an evidence sanction to prevent cox from profiting from its misconduct.
cox argued in opposition that it had identified the third party shippers in its interrogatory responses and that plaintiffs never moved to compel further responses to identify individual representatives of the shippers or took any other measures to discover the individual witnesses names.cox also argued that it did not know the names of the individual witnesses at the time of its discovery responses and that it neither willfully withheld those names nor willfully violated any order to disclose such information.the trial court apparently denied the motion.
trial,statement of decision and judgment 
a nonjury trial on the unfair business practices count commenced in july.the unfair business practices count was based on alleged violations of the federal labor standards act flsa.a regarding payment of overtime compensation.the nonjury trial was limited to cox affirmative defense that all of its employees were exempt from overtime compensation pursuant to the motor carrier exemption.after several days of testimony,the jury phase of trial began.
a jury trial on the count for failure to provide meal periods and rest breaks commenced in august.plaintiffs proposed special instructions,and cox proposed three special instructions.the trial court rejected all of the proposed special instructions and gave its own special instructions on meal periods and rest breaks.the jury returned a verdict in august finding that cox did not fail to provide any of the named plaintiffs either a meal period or a rest break.
the trial court issued a statement of decision in september with respect to the bench trial portion of the case.the court found that cox intrastate transport of ethanol,techron,lube oil for exxon,isooctane and fuel oil was part of the continuous movement of those products in interstate commerce.it also found that cox transported products across state lines and that such interstate transport was more than de minimis.the court found that cox assigned drivers to interstate deliveries indiscriminately and that all of its drivers could reasonably expect to be assigned to an interstate delivery.the court also stated that the department of transportation had licensed and regulated cox and that both the department of transportation and department of labor had determined that cox drivers were exempt from the flsa overtime compensation requirements.the court concluded that these circumstances and the fact that cox had consistently solicited interstate work supported the conclusion that cox was engaged in interstate commerce and therefore was exempt from the flsa overtime compensation requirement pursuant to the motor carrier exemption.the court therefore concluded that plaintiffs were entitled to no relief under the unfair competition law.
the trial court entered a judgment on november,stating that the first,fourth and fifth counts were summarily adjudicated in favor of cox,that plaintiffs had voluntarily dismissed the third count,and that the jury found in favor of cox on the second count for failure to provide meal periods and rest breaks.the judgment states that plaintiffs are entitled to no relief on the seventh count for unfair business practices and that the sixth count for failure to pay overtime,vacation and other compensation due upon termination of employment was derivative of other counts that were decided in cox favor.plaintiffs timely appealed the judgment no.
attorney fees 
cox filed a motion in january for an award of attorney fees pursuant to labor code section.cox argued that it was the prevailing party in an action for nonpayment of wages and therefore was entitled to a fee award under the statute in the amount of.plaintiffs opposed the motion arguing among other things that cox was not entitled to fees under the statute.the trial court found that cox as the prevailing party was entitled to a fee award on the counts for failure to pay promised vacation benefits and failure to pay vacation benefits due upon termination of employment,but not on the other counts.the court awarded cox in attorney fees in an order filed on april.plaintiffs timely appealed the order no.
contentions 
plaintiffs contend the trial court erred by finding that the counts for failure to pay promised vacation benefits and failure to pay vacation benefits due upon termination of employment were preempted by erisa finding that cox vacation benefits policy was legal denying their motion to exclude witnesses at trial and their oral request to depose the witnesses prior to trial finding that plaintiffs were exempt from the flsa overtime compensation requirement pursuant to the motor carrier exemption failing to adequately instruct the jury on the count for failure to provide meal periods and rest breaks and awarding cox attorney fees under labor code section.

summary adjudication was proper as to the count for failure to pay promised vacation benefits to current employees but improper as to the count for failure to pay vacation benefits due upon termination of employmenta.standard of review 
summary adjudication of a cause of action is appropriate only if there is no triable issue of material fact as to that cause of action and the moving party is entitled to judgment on the cause of action as a matter of law.code civ,subd.f.a defendant moving for summary adjudication of a cause of action must show that one or more elements of the plaintiff cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense,subd.p.if the defendant makes that initial showing,the burden then shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of material fact exists,subd.p.

b.the existence of a triable issue of fact as to erisa preemption precludes summary adjudication on this basis 
erisa is a comprehensive statute designed to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans.citations.shaw delta airlines.employee benefit plans governed by erisa include plans providing vacation benefits,a.erisa expressly preempts any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan covered by erisa,a.
the united states supreme court in massachusetts morash considered whether erisa preempted an action under state law to enforce a company policy of paying its discharged employees for their unused vacation time.id.at.morash noted that t he precise coverage of erisa is not clearly set forth in the act id.at and stated that the act does not specify whether every policy to provide vacation benefits falls within its ambit id.at.morash concluded that a policy of maintaining a separate fund to pay employees vacation benefits constitutes an employee benefit plan governed by erisa,but a policy of paying vacation benefits from an employer general assets does not constitute an employee benefit plan governed by erisa.id.at.morash held that because the employer paid vacation benefits from its general assets the plan at issue was not an employee benefit plan under erisa,so there was no preemption.id.at.erisa preempts an action under state law for failure to pay vacation benefits only if the employer maintains an employee benefit plan governed by erisa.see id.at.
accordingly,erisa preempts an action under state law for failure to pay vacation benefits only if the employer maintains a separate account for payment of vacation benefits and does not pay its employees vacation benefits from its general assets.millan restaurant enterprises group,th,see california hospital henning cir.whether the employer maintains a separate account for payment of vacation benefits or pays vacation benefits from its general assets is a question of fact.see marshall bankers life casualty cal th,stating that the existence of an employee benefit plan governed by erisa is a question of fact.
cox filed with the internal revenue service irs form,entitled annual of employee benefit plan,for the periods from may,to april,and may,to april,clearly stating that its vacation benefits plan was funded from g eneral assets of the sponsor.the sponsor was identified as cox.the forms were signed by the plan administrator under penalty of perjury.cox filed certified copies of the form in federal district court in in connection with its remand motion.
cox argued in its motion for summary adjudication that its vacation benefits plan was an employee benefit plan governed by erisa and that the counts for failure to pay promised vacation benefits to current employees and failure to pay vacation benefits due upon termination of employment therefore were both preempted.cox filed a declaration by its president,daniel mairs,stating that he was trustee of a trust from which all employee benefits under the vacation benefits plan were paid.attached to the declaration were copies of the trust agreement and benefits checks paid from the trust.he declared that cox had irrevocably contributed funds to the trust.mairs declared that he learned in that the outside accountants for the plan and trust had incorrectly stated on the form for the plan years through that benefits were paid from cox general assets.he declared that corrected form were later filed with the irs.he declared that the outside accountants had also incorrectly stated on irs form for the same years the amount held by the trust in checking accounts at the end of each fiscal year and that corrected form had been filed with the irs as well.
plaintiffs argued in opposition to the motion for summary adjudication that,in these circumstances,the form initially filed with the irs created a triable issue of fact as to whether the vacation benefits plan was funded from cox general assets,as stated in those forms,or from a separate trust,as stated in the mairs declaration and in the corrected forms we agree.the fact that the corrected forms were created and filed with the irs only after the filing of plaintiffs complaint would support an inference that the corrected forms were false and were created for purposes of defending against the complaint.in our view,the trial court could not simply accept as true cox explanation that the forms initially filed with the irs were incorrect.instead,in these circumstances,those competing filings created a triable issue of fact precluding summary adjudication of both the fourth and fifth counts on this basis.
plaintiffs have shown no error in the finding that cox vacation benefits policy was legal with respect to current employees 
the trial court granted summary adjudication of the fifth count for failure to pay vacation benefits due upon termination of employment based solely on erisa preemption.in light of our conclusion that a triable issue of fact exists with respect to the erisa preemption issue,the summary adjudication of the fifth count was error.the court also granted summary adjudication of the fourth count for failure to pay promised vacation benefits based on both erisa preemption and the additional basis that cox vacation benefits policy was legal.plaintiffs challenge the granting of summary adjudication of the fourth count on this additional basis.we conclude that plaintiffs have shown no error in the trial court conclusion that cox vacation benefits policy was legal as applied to current employees.we therefore conclude that although the trial court erred in basing summary adjudication of the fourth count on erisa preemption,its ruling based on the legality of cox policy was proper.
plaintiffs contend cox policy of paying its drivers and later per week of unused vacation time violated the statutory requirement that,upon the termination of employment,an employee unused,vested vacation time shall be paid to him as wages at his final rate in accordance with such contract of employment or employer policy respecting eligibility or time served.the relevant facts are undisputed.this presents a question of statutory construction,which we review de novo.pineda williams sonoma stores,cal th.

labor code section states in full 
unless otherwise provided by a agreement,whenever a contract of employment or employer policy provides for paid vacations,and an employee is terminated without having taken off his vested vacation time,all vested vacation shall be paid to him as wages at his final rate in accordance with such contract of employment or employer policy respecting eligibility or time served provided,however,that an employment contract or employer policy shall not provide for forfeiture of vested vacation time upon termination.the labor commissioner or a designated representative,in the resolution of any dispute with regard to vested vacation time,shall apply the principles of equity and fairness.
the california supreme court in suastez plastic dress up cal d held that if an employer policy or contract of employment provides for paid vacation time,the right to paid vacation time vests as the labor is rendered.id.at.vacation pay constitutes deferred wages for services rendered,rather than an inducement for future services.id.at.
the employer vacation benefits policy in suastez,supra,cal d,provided that employees were entitled to a number of weeks of paid vacation annually,but that they did not become eligible for paid vacation time until the anniversary date of their employment.id.at.suastez held that the employer refusal to pay an employee whose employment was terminated before his anniversary date a pro rata share of his earned vacation pay violated labor code section.suastez,supra,cal d at.suastez rejected the employer argument that the language all vested vacation time shall be paid to the employee as wages at his final rate in accordance with such contract of employment or employer policy respecting eligibility or time served italics added in labor code section supported a contrary result.suastez explained that this language means that the employer policy determines the amount of vacation time earned,typically based on the employee length of employment and position held,and does not mean that the employer policy determines the time of vesting.suastez,supra,at.
thus,labor code section prohibits the forfeiture of vested vacation benefits upon the termination of employment.suastez,supra,cal d at.the courts of appeal have held,however,that the statute does not prohibit a no additional accrual policy that prevents employees from earning additional paid vacation time in excess of a specified limit boothby atlas mechanical,th,and that an employer need not provide paid vacation time to its employees owen macy,th.
labor code section,by its express terms,applies only to the situation where an employee is terminated without having taken off his or her vested vacation time.neither labor code section nor any other authority cited by plaintiffs supports the proposition that,apart from the situation where an employee is terminated with unused vacation time,a vacation benefits policy must provide for payment of vacation time at an employee regular rate of pay.thus,plaintiffs have shown no error in the summary adjudication of the fourth count for failure to pay promised vacation benefits on this basis.
the denial of plaintiffs motion to exclude witnesses at trial was proper 
plaintiffs moved to exclude witness testimony at trial as an evidence sanction for misuse of the discovery process.we review the ruling on such a motion for abuse of discretion.thoren johnston washer,supra,d at.we review any factual findings in connection with the ruling under the substantial evidence standard.haraguchi superior court cal th.
the record on appeal contains no ruling on the motion to exclude witnesses and no explanation of the trial court reasons for apparently denying the motion.we presume that the court found that plaintiffs failed to satisfy their burden to show that cox had provided willfully false responses to the interrogatories.
the record shows that cox responded the shippers,in addition to naming individual cox employees,in its answer to an interrogatory requesting the identity of all witnesses that have knowledge of the facts that shippers transport the ethanol into california by rail carriers.in response to another interrogatory requesting the identity of all shippers as described in your contention that cox merely delivers the product to its intended ultimate destination,in accordance with the shipper intent,and is simply completing a step in the interstate delivery process,cox identified numerous entities.there is no indication in the record that plaintiffs requested further responses.although cox did not identify the shippers in its responses to other interrogatories relating to purported interstate shipments,we conclude that substantial evidence supports an implied finding that cox did not willfully provide false responses.moreover,absent an order compelling cox to identify the individual witnesses and a violation of such an order or other egregious misconduct,plaintiffs have shown no basis for an evidence sanction.new albertsons,superior court th.for these reasons,we hold that the denial of plaintiffs motion to exclude witnesses at trial was proper.
plaintiffs also argue on appeal that the trial court denied their request to depose the undisclosed witnesses.but their written motion to exclude witness testimony at trial did not include such a request,and plaintiffs cite nothing in the record showing that they ever made such a request.plaintiffs have failed to substantiate their claim of error.
plaintiffs are exempt from the flsa overtime compensation requirement pursuant to the motor carrier exemption 
legal framework 
the flsa requires employers to pay employees covered by the act one and times their normal hourly wage for each hour worked in excess of forty hours per week.a.this requirement,however,is inapplicable to any employee with respect to whom the secretary of transportation has power to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service pursuant to the provisions of section of title,b.this is known as the motor carrier exemption.employees subject to the secretary of transportation jurisdiction under title united states code section b are exempt from the flsa overtime compensation requirement pursuant to the motor carrier exemption regardless of whether the secretary of transportation actually exercises jurisdiction.levinson spector motor service.klitzke steiner cir.
the motor carrier exemption applies to individual employees only if their employer is a carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the secretary of transportation under title united states code section b,and the individual employees are engaged in activities directly affecting the safety of operation of motor vehicles in interstate or foreign commerce.songer dillon resources,cir,walters american coach lines of miami,cir,dauphin chestnut ridge,sdny d,see a.exemptions to the fsla are narrowly construed against the employers seeking to assert them and their application limited to those establishments plainly and unmistakably within their terms and spirit.arnold ben kanowsky.

even drivers who do not transport goods in interstate commerce are subject to the jurisdiction of the secretary of transportation if,as part of their regular duties,they reasonably could be expected to be called on to make interstate runs.morris mccomb.walters american coach lines of miami,d,walters,affd.cir garcia pace suburban bus service,a div.of regional transp,garcia.the united states supreme court in morris held that,although interstate hauls constituted only percent of the carrier trips and many of its drivers performed no interstate hauls,the motor carrier exemption applied to all of the carrier drivers.morris,supra,at.morris stated that the interstate hauls were shared indiscriminately by the drivers and mingled with intrastate work,and were thus a natural,integral and apparently inseparable part of the common carrier service of the petitioner and of his drivers.id.at.recognizing the desire to regulate employees whose work may affect the safety of operation of vehicles in interstate commerce,morris held that the interstate commerce commission had the power to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service for all of the carrier drivers and mechanics and that the motor carrier exemption therefore applied to all such employees id.at.
subsequent opinions have explained that the jurisdiction of the secretary of labor extends to drivers who reasonably could be expected to drive an interstate route,meaning that it is more than a remote possibility.walters,supra,d at garcia,supra.at.
plaintiffs have shown no error in the finding that they reasonably could be expected to be assigned to interstate routes 
plaintiffs challenge the trial court finding that their intrastate deliveries are part of the continuous movement of goods in interstate commerce.they also challenge the court finding that cox drivers are indiscriminately assigned to interstate routes and that all of the drivers reasonably could be expected to be called on to drive an interstate route.because we conclude that plaintiffs have shown no error in the latter finding,and that finding supports the conclusion that plaintiffs are exempt from overtime,we need not further discuss the finding that plaintiffs intrastate deliveries are part of the continuous movement of goods in interstate commerce.
the trial court stated in its statement of decision that drivers are considered to be indiscriminately assigned to interstate routes if they reasonably could be expected to be called on to drive an interstate route.the court found that cox drivers hauled loads on interstate routes to or from california during the class period from through,and that cox employed drivers as of september.it stated that plaintiffs contention that cox assigned interstate hauls on a volunteer basis was not accurate and that the evidence showed that cox sometimes asked for volunteers and sometimes assigned drivers who did not volunteer to drive interstate routes.it found that all of cox drivers and all of its trucks were qualified for interstate hauls and that some drivers had been randomly assigned to interstate routes.the court noted that,in requesting volunteers,cox made it clear that no driver was immune from being assigned to drive an interstate route.the court found that all of cox drivers reasonably could be expected to be called on to drive an interstate route.
plaintiffs argue in their appellants opening brief that they had no reasonable expectation that they would be called on to drive outside of california.they cite evidence that cox advertised for drivers for local hauls,that they were not told at the time of their initial hiring that they might have to drive outside of california and that many of them have never been asked to drive outside of california they also cite evidence that,in july,cox notified all drivers at three of its locations that they would be required to drive an interstate route,but then rescinded the policy after only a few days.plaintiffs cite no legal authority in support of their argument that their subjective expectations are determinative see walters american coach lines of miami,june,civ wl rejecting the same argument and have not shown that any of these circumstances compels the conclusion that they reasonably could not be expected to be assigned to interstate routes.
moreover,plaintiffs fail to cite or discuss the evidence supporting the trial court finding that all of cox drivers reasonably could be expected to be assigned to an interstate route.we must presume that the evidence supports the court factual findings unless the appellant affirmatively demonstrates to the contrary.in re marriage of fink cal d.an appellant challenging a factual finding can not selectively cite only evidence favorable
