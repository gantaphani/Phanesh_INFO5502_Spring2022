plaintiff brought this putative class action against a doctor and the hospital where he practiced,claiming that they had misrepresented the hospital cardiac surgeons qualifications.when the plaintiff settled with the doctor,the trial court certified a plaintiff class,preliminarily approved the settlement,and scheduled a fairness hearing at which it would review and finalize both the certification and the settlement.see civ.the hospital attempted to appeal the trial court order,but the court of appeals dismissed the appeal.it held that the hospital lacked standing to challenge the order and that the challenge to both certification and settlement was premature pending the fairness hearing disposition.id.at.we hold that the hospital certification challenge is ripe and that it has standing to appeal the trial court order.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment dismissing the hospital appeal and remand the case to that court for further proceedings.
background 
ramiro cortez,filed this putative class action against mcallen medical center mmc and francisco bracamontes,a cardiac surgeon at mmc.cortez alleges that bracamontes and mmc misrepresented to patients that all mmc cardiac surgeons were board certified.he seeks economic damages from both mmc and bracamontes,and damages for mental anguish and intentional infliction of emotional distress from bracamontes.weeks after filing suit,cortez reached a tentative settlement with bracamontes,and they jointly moved for the trial court to certify a class for purposes of approving the settlement.the proposed class consisted of everyone who had cardiac surgery at mmc from december,to may.
mmc received less than one day notice of the certification hearing.mmc appeared at the hearing and asked the trial court to delay ruling on the motion until mmc could evaluate it.the trial court questioned mmc standing to contest either the certification or the settlement,but gave mmc three days to file objections.mmc objections contended that it had inadequate time to prepare for the hearing and that the proposed class met none of the criteria for class certification under texas rule of civil procedure.the trial court implicitly overruled mmc objections when it entered an order that certified a class action for purposes of settlement with defendant bracamontes only,preliminarily approved the settlement,scheduled a fairness hearing on the settlement,and provided for class notice of the class action and the proposed settlement.
the class notice is directed not just to bracamontes patients,but to all patients who had cardiac surgery at mmc.the notice also describes class claims against both bracamontes and mmc.the order recites that it will not prejudice any other defendant right to contest class certification with respect to claims against it,and provides that the court will rescind the certification if it does not approve the settlement after the fairness hearing.mmc filed an interlocutory appeal,and the parties agreed to postpone the fairness hearing pending the court of appeals decision.the fairness hearing has not yet occurred.
mmc claims that it is directly affected by,and therefore has standing to contest,the bracamontes class certification,class notice,and settlement.but the court of appeals dismissed mmc appeal,holding that it did not have jurisdiction because mmc had shown no injury that would give it standing to appeal.at.the court did not consider the class notice improper or harmful to mmc,and it did not believe that mmc potential complaints about the settlement gave mmc standing to appeal the certification.id.at.the court of appeals further held that the appeal was premature pending the trial court disposition at the fairness hearing.id.we granted review to consider whether the court of appeals correctly decided that it lacked jurisdiction.see qwest communications v.at t.
ii.the court of appeals jurisdiction 
a court of appeals judgment in an appeal from an interlocutory order is generally conclusive on the law and facts and may not be appealed to this court.see.gov t code b.here,however,the court of appeals did not consider the merits of mmc challenge,but instead dismissed the appeal on jurisdictional grounds.at.when a court of appeals determines that it lacks jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal,this court has jurisdiction to review that decision.qwest,at.the parties do not dispute that the trial court order certifies a class action and is thus subject to interlocutory appeal.see.civ.prac.a allowing appeal from an interlocutory order that certifies or refuses to certify a class action.but the interlocutory appeal statute does not supplant the constitutional requirement that the court of appeals have jurisdiction,and both ripeness and standing are necessary components of that jurisdiction.patterson planned parenthood of houston southeast.thus,we must decide whether the trial court order is ripe for review and whether mmc has standing to challenge it.
texas courts have no authority to render advisory opinions.patterson,at.this prohibition encompasses cases that are not yet ripe.id.the ripeness doctrine avoids premature adjudication on a hypothetical set of facts.id.at.cortez contends that mmc challenges to the order and the settlement are not ripe.we address each of these arguments in turn.
this court has not determined when an order certifying a class becomes ripe for appellate review.but we have held that the trial court must conduct a complete review of rule criteria before determining that a case may proceed as a class action.southwestern ref.bernal.and we have noted that settlement does not eliminate the need for a rigorous inquiry into the class action propriety.general motors bloyed.our focus here is when that rigorous inquiry should occur so that it becomes ripe for appellate review.
cortez claims that,in this case,the inquiry will occur at the fairness hearing,and the trial court will then review rule s numerosity,commonality,typicality,and criteria.because no final determination has been made,he reasons,appellate review of the trial court order is premature.but cortez argument echoes the certify now and worry later approach that we have rejected.bernal,at.we require courts to perform a rigorous analysis before ruling on class certification to determine whether all prerequisites to certification have been met.id.emphasis added.we see no reason why classes should merit less rigorous treatment.
it is true that classes present different concerns than litigation classes.thus,in deciding whether to certify a class,criteria designed to protect absent class members demand heightened scrutiny.see amchem,windsor,d bloyed,at.these protections may lose effect if the trial court waits until the fairness hearing to consider them.
for example,the trial court has a special responsibility to protect absent class members from unwarranted or overbroad class definitions.see amchem,at.ford motor sheldon,a properly defined class is essential to the maintenance of a class action.strict scrutiny of rule criteria will likely inform and influence the trial court class definition.for instance,careful consideration of whether,or which,common questions of law or fact will predominate over individual class members questions will influence the class structure and,by definition,the necessary class notice.if notice is sent to a broadly defined settlement class without regard to these considerations,the trial court ability to later adjust the class at the fairness hearing and still protect all class members interests may be severely limited.
the trial court in this case conditionally certified an class,and ordered notice sent to a ll persons who underwent cardiac surgery at mmc from december,until may.the deadline is five days before the scheduled fairness hearing.consequently,the class members must make their election before the trial court determines at the fairness hearing whether the class was properly defined in the first instance.and absent class members may be confused if,after considering rule criteria,the trial court redefines the class or determines that it can not ultimately be maintained.see crown,cork seal,parker,d observing that class members may rely on pending class action to protect their rights,and so forgo individual suits mars steel continental.bank trust,cir noting that,by the time class members learn that class certification has fallen through,their only option will be to litigate their individual claims using increasingly stale evidence.
rule typicality and criteria similarly demand heightened scrutiny when a settlement occurs.these criteria require the trial court to consider whether the asserted claims are typical of the putative class,and whether the class representative and its counsel will fairly and adequately protect the class interest.civ.a,a.if the class includes members with diverging or conflicting interests,a single class representative claims may not be typical,and a settlement that is fair for the representative may be unfair for the class as a whole.see amchem,at.bloyed,at.even when the class members share a broad area of common interest,a settlement may benefit the defendant,the class representative,and class counsel far more than it benefits unnamed class members whose claims the settlement extinguishes.see,kamilewicz bank of boston,cir.and when a settlement occurs,the potential for class representatives and counsel to ignore differences among class members,or even collude with defendants at absent class members expense,mandates that the trial court rigorously scrutinize rule typicality and criteria.see ortiz fibreboard,d requiring heightened scrutiny because i n class actions the procedural protections built into the rule to protect the rights of absent class members during litigation are never invoked in an adversarial setting citing amchem,at.
here,the trial court has allowed cortez and his counsel to compose and send class notice,to represent themselves to the class as its spokesmen,and to formulate and defend the class settlement,without first determining that rule typicality and requirements are met.whether or not they are,rule requires the trial court to make that determination before it permits cortez and his counsel to take action on the class behalf.because the certification order here permits cortez and his counsel to proceed without first meeting these requirements,the order is ripe for appellate review.see patterson,at.
cortez argues that the trial court deferring full consideration of rule criteria until the fairness hearing offers benefits to the class that balance any potential harm.he notes,for instance,that a class notice distributed upon preliminary class certification allows the proposed class members to appear at the fairness hearing and object to both certification and settlement.but class notice distributed after the trial court conducts a careful rule analysis achieves the same purpose and provides absent class members greater protection.then,after they receive notice,class members may still voice their concerns at the fairness hearing,and the trial court may alter,amend,or withdraw its certification order at any time before final judgment to protect their interests.see civ.c.
when a trial court preliminarily certifies a class action,the effect on the course of the proceedings is immediate,significant,and perhaps irreparable if it is later determined that the class can not be maintained.we hold that such an order may not be shielded from appellate review merely because it is termed preliminary or because the trial court may later reconsider its ruling at a fairness hearing.a fairness hearing is no substitute for rigorous adherence to rule criteria.see amchem,at.once the trial court certified the settlement class against bracamontes,its order was ripe for appellate review,and the court of appeals erred in dismissing mmc appeal as premature.
the proposed settlement 
mmc also asked the court of appeals to disapprove certain aspects of the proposed settlement between bracamontes and the cortez class.the court refused,however,determining that mmc complaints were premature pending the trial court disposition at the fairness hearing.at.we agree with the court of appeals that the proposed bracamontes settlement is not ripe for review,although the court of appeals may consider the settlement terms insofar as they may relate to reviewing the certification order.see amchem,at.
unlike the trial court decision to certify a class action,which immediately and directly impacts the proceedings course with possibly irremediable consequences,the trial court preliminary approval of the bracamontes settlement has no binding force.rather,the settlement does not gain legal effect until the trial court gives its final approval.civ.e.the trial court has a duty at the fairness hearing to examine the proposed settlement thoroughly,with input from objectors,and may approve the settlement only if the court determines that it is fair.see bloyed,at.until then,the proposed settlement terms do not affect the parties or the proceedings,and appellate review is premature.
although the class certification order is ripe for appellate review,only a party with standing may seek that review.see torrington stutzman.an issue is ripe when it presents a fully developed controversy,while standing requires that the controversy adversely affect the party seeking review.planned parenthood,at.
the court of appeals held that mmc had no standing to challenge the trial court certification order.at.in its analysis,the court relied upon fifth circuit authority for the proposition that defendants generally have no standing to complain about a settlement,since they are not members of the settling class.id.at emphasis in original citing transamerican ref.dravo,cir.concluding that any injury mmc might suffer from the bracamontes settlement was speculative and premature,the appellate court held that mmc lacked standing to appeal the certification order because mmc could not do indirectly what it may not do directly.id.at.thus,the court of appeals presumed that if the bracamontes settlement does not affect mmc,neither does the certification.
cortez echoes the court of appeals reasoning here,arguing that the order has no effect on mmc because it certifies a class only for the limited purpose of settling with bracamontes.cortez contends mmc will only be affected if and when the trial court certifies a class against mmc,and until then mmc has no standing to appeal.in response,mmc suggests that rule does not allow the trial court to certify a class action against fewer than all defendants.in any event,mmc notes several ways in which the certification order injures it,giving mmc standing to pursue its appeal.
we need not decide today whether rule generally prohibits piecemeal certification against individual defendants.rather,we hold that a nonsettling defendant has standing to contest certification of a settlement class if the nonsettling defendant can show that the certification adversely affects it.determining adverse effect necessarily requires a inquiry.we conclude that,in this case,mmc has shown sufficient adverse effect to confer standing to appeal the certification order.
the certification order defines a broad settlement class.although the order purportedly concerns a proposed settlement with bracamontes,the class includes everyone who had cardiac surgery at mmc from december,to may.the class is not limited to patients bracamontes treated or those who might otherwise have encountered bracamontes while at mmc.moreover,the approved notice to the broadly defined class treats mmc as a class defendant.the notice provides 
notice the purpose of this notice is to inform you of the pendency of a class action against defendants mcallen medical center,mmc,and francisco bracamontes,settling defendant,collectively defendants,and the proposed settlement with the settling defendant.
description of the litigation.this lawsuit was filed against defendants and settling defendant alleging misrepresentations concerning the level of services,and the overcharging for such services,by defendants and settling defendant to all persons who underwent cardiac surgery at mcallen medical center from december,until may.the lawsuit alleges,among other things,that def
