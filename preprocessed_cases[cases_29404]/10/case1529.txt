in this action for medical monitoring of the residents of a geographic area affected by defendants toxic chemical discharge,the question before us is whether plaintiffs,in moving for class certification,have met their burden of demonstrating that common issues of law and fact predominate.we conclude they have not.we therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
background 
plaintiffs roslyn carrillo et alia allege that defendants lockheed martin corporation et alia,in the course of conducting manufacturing operations in the city of redlands,beginning in,discharged dangerous chemicals that contaminated the city drinking water with harmful toxins and that this contaminated water was used by a large portion of the city residents.in december,on behalf of themselves and persons similarly situated,plaintiffs filed this action in the san bernardino county superior court.plaintiffs pray that the court order defendants to fund a program for the medical monitoring of class members,and for punitive damages.
plaintiffs moved for certification of a medical monitoring class and a punitive damage class,defined identically as people who were exposed to water contaminated with any of the following chemicals tce,pce,tca,other solvents,ammonium perchlorate,perchlorate,other unknown rocket fuel components and rocket fuel decomposition products,beryllium,carbon tetrachloride,vinyl chloride,hydrazine and hydrazine derivatives,nitrosamines and nitrosamine derivatives,epoxides and epoxide derivatives,triazines and triazine derivatives,at levels at or in excess of the dose equivalent of the maximum contaminant level or in excess of the safe dose where there is no mcl,for some part of a day,for greater than of a year,for one or more years from to the present within specified geographical limits.plaintiffs class definition indicated that review of relevant water quality documents was ongoing and that the definition would be amended if additional chemicals were identified.
one of plaintiffs attorneys declared that estimating the number of persons in the class was difficult,because the university of redlands is located within the specified geographic boundaries,and persons residing,working or studying within the defined area may qualify as class members.the attorney best estimate was that the class includes between and people.
the trial court certified the classes,finding that plaintiffs had met their burden of proof under code of civil procedure section the court finds that the plaintiffs have a realistic chance of success on the merits.specifically,the court finds that the plaintiffs have shown that there is a realistic chance that the defendants caused contaminants to be leaked into the water table beneath redlands and that this contaminated water was served to the members of the proposed class.the court also found that there is an ascertainable class,concluding it was not necessary to determine the levels of toxins received by each plaintiff at this time and that the geographic limits placed on the class are reasonable and related to the alleged contamination.the court concluded,finally,that members of the class have a community of interest and that common questions of law and fact predominate in the action.
parties objecting to certification filed three writ petitions in the court of appeal,which that court consolidated.opining that individual issues raised by plaintiffs claims clearly predominate,making class certification inappropriate,the court of appeal granted a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order certifying the classes.we granted plaintiffs petition for review.
discussion 
suitability of medical monitoring claims for class treatment 
we first addressed the availability of medical monitoring as a form of damages in potter firestone tire rubber cal th,d,potter.there,residents of homes located near a landfill at which the dumping of toxic substances was prohibited brought,as individual claimants,an action against a tire manufacturing company that had dumped toxic waste materials,alleging that their water supply had thereby been contaminated.the plaintiffs sought damages for,inter alia,fear of cancer and the costs of medical monitoring.see id.at,d.recognizing that expenditures for prospective medical testing and evaluation,which would be unnecessary if the particular plaintiff had not been wrongfully exposed,are detriment proximately caused by negligent disposal of toxic substances id.at fn,d,quoting,we held that the cost of medical monitoring is a compensable item of damages where the proofs demonstrate,through reliable medical expert testimony,that the need for future monitoring is a reasonably certain consequence of a plaintiff toxic exposure and that the recommended monitoring is reasonable potter,supra,at,d.
in determining the reasonableness and necessity of monitoring,we stated,the following factors hereafter the potter factors are relevant the significance and extent of the plaintiff exposure to chemicals the toxicity of the chemicals the relative increase in the chance of onset of disease in the exposed plaintiff as a result of the exposure,when compared to a the plaintiff chances of developing the disease had he or she not been exposed,and b the chances of the members of the public at large of developing the disease the seriousness of the disease for which the plaintiff is at risk and the clinical value of early detection and diagnosis.potter,supra,cal th at,d.
we have not previously addressed the prerequisites for class treatment of medical monitoring claims.section of the code of civil procedure authorizes class suits in california when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court.the burden is on the party seeking certification to establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members.washington mutual bank superior court cal th,d,washington mutual.
plaintiffs assert that separate litigation of each class member medical monitoring claim would unnecessarily consume vast judicial resources and time.they also urge us to repudiate the court of appeal suggestion that the presence of individual issues generally precludes class certification in mass toxic exposure cases,arguing any such categorical foreclosure would render our decision in potter meaningless.defendants,on the other hand,emphasize that potter proximate cause rationale for recognizing medical monitoring costs as damages logically extends only to such increased or different monitoring potter,supra,cal th at,fn,d,as a defendant conduct actually necessitates.in light of their due process right to litigate each individual plaintiff actual toxic dosage and relevant personal characteristics,defendants argue,individual issues in the case predominate over common ones,such that the community of interest required for class certification is lacking.
the certification question is essentially a procedural one that does not ask whether an action is legally or factually meritorious.linder thrifty oil cal th,d,linder.the community of interest requirement for class certification embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.richmond dart industries,cal d.plaintiffs acknowledge it is their burden to establish the requisite community of interest and that the proponent of certification must show,inter alia,that questions of law or fact common to the class predominate over the questions affecting the individual members.washington mutual,supra,cal th at,d.
the ultimate question in every case of this type is whether the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.collins rocha cal d,see also linder,supra,cal th at,d.
defendants point to our statement that the potter factors comprise substantial evidentiary burdens for plaintiffs potter,supra,cal th at,d,as if to suggest the factors constitute novel proof requirements applicable only in medical monitoring cases.not so.potter recognizes not a separate tort but simply an item of damages that can not be awarded until liability is established under a traditional tort theory.san diego gas electric superior court cal th,fn,d,citing potter,supra,at,d.so to observe does not gainsay the high court observation that limitations and cautions like the potter factors are of the decisions that permit asymptomatic plaintiffs a separate tort claim for medical monitoring costs.commuter buckley,d see also id.at,citing,inter alia,potter,supra,at,fn,d.
as defendants acknowledge,potter simply specified for the medical monitoring context the traditional requirement that a plaintiff prove causation of damage.thus,while in potter we ma de it clear that the monitoring must be additional or different than that previously required gutierrez cassiar mining th,d,we just as clearly stated that if additional or different tests and examinations are necessitated as a result of the toxic exposure caused by the defendant,then the defendant bears full responsibility for their costs potter,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
defendants assert that the required proof under potter includes that each of the elements of the claims asserted on behalf of proposed class members,and all applicable defenses,are capable of common proof.again,not so.we consistently have recognized,before and after potter,that the fact that each member of the class must prove his or her separate claim to a portion of any recovery by the class is only one factor to be considered in determining whether a class action is proper.vasquez superior court cal d.
in sum,no per se or categorical bar exists to a court finding medical monitoring claims appropriate for class treatment,so long as any individual issues the claims present are manageable.accordingly,we shall review the certification ruling before us in light of the established standards for class certification generally.
ii.plaintiffs demonstrated presence of some common issues 
as indicated,in granting plaintiffs certification motion,the trial court expressly found that common questions predominate and determined that any individual issues that might arise at the time of trial are manageable.because trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action,they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification.linder,supra,cal th at,d.nevertheless,we must examine the trial court reasons for granting class certification.id.at,d,see also washington mutual,supra,cal th at,d.in particular,we must consider whether the record contains substantial evidence to support the trial court predominance finding,as a certification ruling not supported by substantial evidence can not stand.linder,supra,at,d,see also richmond dart industries,supra,cal d at.
at the outset,the record reveals that plaintiffs claims sound generally in negligence,entailing proof of the elements of any negligence cause of action,duty,breach of duty,proximate cause and damages.artiglio corning cal th,d.addressing whether questions common to the class predominate over questions affecting members individually,therefore,required the trial court to consider these elements.
whether defendants in disposing of their chemical wastes owed a duty of care to the class members,to the persons who lived for the specified period within the specified geographical area,is a question of law for the court.parsons crown disposal cal th,d.defendants proffer no reason why a court would need to engage in individualized analysis in order to answer that question.the trial court rationally could conclude that the duty element of plaintiffs claims will be susceptible of common proof.
additionally,how and when defendants disposed of toxic chemicals and whether defendants conduct was negligent are,as the court of appeal recognized,significant common issues of fact in this case.the parties already have presented extensive evidence including well sampling and other hydrological data about the pattern and degree of contamination of redlands groundwater with various chemicals and the potential health consequences to humans of exposure to those chemicals.defendants have conceded that common issues are present in the case because defendants acts allegedly are the same with regard to each plaintiff.thus,the record also contains substantial evidence supporting the conclusion that the breach of duty element of plaintiffs claims will be susceptible of common proof 
as noted,when first recognizing the medical monitoring remedy in potter,we focused on the causation and damages elements of such claims,stating that in order to recover plaintiffs must demonstrate,through reliable medical expert testimony,both that the need for future monitoring is a reasonably certain consequence of toxic exposure and that the monitoring sought is reasonable.potter,supra,cal th at,d.defendants take the position that plaintiffs in moving for class certification have failed to demonstrate either that the causation reasonably certain consequence or the damages reasonable monitoring elements of their medical monitoring claims will be susceptible of common proof.
plaintiffs clearly are in a position to address some aspects of causation and damages on a class basis.defendants concede,for example,that the toxicity of the chemicals allegedly discharged and the seriousness of any disease for which the plaintiff is at risk both factors discussed in potter,supra,cal th at page,d,be susceptible of common proof.and as the court of appeal noted,the amount of contaminants that entered the groundwater and,when,where,and at what levels were contaminants pumped by the city wells entered into the domestic water system are significant common issues of fact in this case.
plaintiffs contend that,on the theory of liability they intend to present,each individual exact dosage of each discharged chemical will not be relevant.according to expert testimony already in the record,plaintiffs argue,anyone living or working in the area of contamination for at least six months has a plausible claim for medical monitoring.class membership,plaintiffs stress,is restricted by definition to persons who have received a specified medically significant minimum dosage for some part of a day,for greater than of a year,for one or more years from to the present within specified geographical boundaries.all who meet that definition,plaintiffs propose to prove,will require a generalized monitoring program for the diseases caused by such exposure.on such a theory,plaintiffs argue,specific individual dosages above the specified minimum are not relevant and,therefore,the significance and extent of toxic exposure potter,supra,cal th at,d,will involve largely common proof.
the trial court in ruling on the certification motion apparently took plaintiffs minimum dosage liability theory into account,stating that proof of the actual dosage received by each plaintiff is not necessary at this time.strictly speaking,that is correct,as in ruling on certification a court does not ask whether plaintiffs action is legally or factually meritorious.linder,supra,cal th at,d.moreover,nothing in potter precludes liability premised on a theory that a defendant negligence has necessitated increased or different monitoring for all,or nearly all,exposed individuals,as long as the need is a reasonably certain consequence of the exposure.potter,supra,cal th at,d.that a class of water consumers could,under particularly egregious circumstances,demonstrate that everyone who drank from a polluted municipal water system over a specified period is at significant risk for having received a dose sufficient to cause serious disease and,therefore,needs special monitoring,is not inconceivable.thus,on an appropriate theory,even dosage issues may be susceptible of common proof.
iii.plaintiffs failed to demonstrate common issues predominate 
plaintiffs burden on moving for class certification,however,is not merely to show that some common issues exist,but,rather,to place substantial evidence in the record that common issues predominate.washington mutual,supra,cal th at,d.as we previously have explained,this means each member must not be required to individually litigate numerous and substantial questions to determine his or her right to recover following the class judgment and the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,must be sufficiently numerous and substantial to make the class action advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.id.at,d,quoting city of san jose superior court cal d.
while the record on certification undoubtedly contains substantial evidence that many redlands residents were exposed to toxic chemicals during the class period,evidence of exposure alone can not support a finding that medical monitoring is a reasonably necessary response.potter,supra,cal th at,d.as defendants emphasize,that all plaintiffs exposed to redlands water received identical dosages of any toxic chemicals it contained is unlikely.on the one hand,duration of exposure to polluted water will vary among class members,as the class would include numerous people who lived in redlands for a relatively short period of time during the more than class period.on the other hand,as the court of appeal observed,severity of exposure among class members may vary according to the amount of water they used.
examination of the instant record reveals that plaintiffs have not provided substantial evidence that they are in a position to resolve possible dosage issues with common proof.each class member actual toxic dosage would remain relevant to some degree even if plaintiffs minimum dosage liability theory ultimately were to prove viable.membership in the class as plaintiffs have defined it requires,not merely exposure to water contaminated with one or more of the chemicals listed in the definition,but exposure at levels at or in excess of the dose equivalent of the maximum contaminant level,or in excess of the safe dose where there is no mcl for at least the defined minimum period of time.but plaintiffs experts did not unqualifiedly opine that all who resided in redlands for the defined period likely received such dosages.dahlgren was asked to assume that there was a clinically significant exposure to these chemicals among members of a group that is geographically defined as residing within redlands.italics added.and teitelbaum opinion that risk of disease due to the toxins is spread over the whole exposed population was qualified with the observation that t he outcome of the exposure is determined by many factors including the dose,and the genetic makeup of the target individual.
moreover,regardless of how a particular medical monitoring class might be defined,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the need for future monitoring is a reasonably certain consequence of the toxic exposure potter,supra,cal th at,d,that the plaintiff faces a significant but not necessarily likely risk of serious disease id.at,d.for the following reasons,we conclude plaintiffs have not placed in the record sufficient evidence to warrant the trial court concluding that they are likely to be able to make that demonstration with common proof.
plaintiffs class definition refers to at least different toxic substances,and plaintiffs contend that,as a consequence of defendants toxic dumping,each class member now requires special monitoring for numerous potential medical conditions.in linking their class definition to the toxic dumping and water pollution evidence submitted in support of the certification motion,plaintiffs relied primarily on the testimony of two medical experts,james dahlgren and daniel teitelbaum.we previously have held that reliable medical expert testimony may establish the reasonableness and necessity of medical monitoring.potter,supra,cal th at,d.expert medical opinion,however,does not always constitute substantial evidence place workmen comp.app.bd.cal d,see,mann cracchiolo cal d,medical malpractice action kerr bock cal d,res ipsa loquitur case zemke workmen.bd.cal d,disability apportionment appeal.no reason appears why in the medical monitoring context we should depart from our settled understanding that a n expert opinion which rests upon guess,surmise or conjecture,rather than relevant,probative facts,can not constitute substantial evidence garza workmen.bd cal d,fn.
dahlgren testified in conclusionary fashion that a ll persons who are at risk should be in a monitoring program.he testified generally that chemical exposure in redlands has resulted in an excess of certain cancers and e arly diagnosis and treatment for these cancers would improve the prospect of cure or long term remissions,but he acknowledged that t he precise dose of exposure experienced by each person can not be determined exactly because of variability in the delivery of the water.italics added.he also conceded that safe levels of exposure in such a setting are not known precisely italics added.
teitelbaum opined that any person who fulfills the class definition proposed in this case is at greater risk of developing cancer and other serious illness which is known by medical scientists and toxicologists to be associated with the chemicals at issue in this case.but neither dahlgren nor teitelbaum categorically stated that mere qualification under the class definition demonstrates a need for medical monitoring irrespective of actual chemical dosages received.
we previously have noted that courts confronting medical monitoring claims may consider the relative increase in the chance of onset of disease in the exposed plaintiff as a result of the exposure,when compared to a the plaintiff chances of developing the disease had he or she not been exposed,and b the chances of the members of the public at large of developing the disease potter,supra,cal th at,d.indisputably,a member of the public chances of developing any particular disease would be susceptible to common proof,but each individual plaintiff chances of developing that particular disease,had he or she not been exposed as alleged,may not be.
taken as a whole,the medical expert testimony plaintiffs presented in support of their motion for class certification is too qualified,tentative and conclusionary to constitute substantial evidence that plaintiffs,by adopting a liability theory that makes actual dosages and variations in individual response irrelevant,will be able to prove causation and damages by common evidence.as the record stands,therefore,the causation and damages issues raised by plaintiffs claims must be counted among those that would be litigated individually,even if the matter were to proceed on a class basis.especially when considered in light of the trial court finding that the class consists of an estimated to people,that conclusion fatally undermines the trial court predominance calculation.
in light of the foregoing,we conclude that the trial court predominance finding is not supported by the record.the questions respecting each individual class member right to recover that would remain following any class judgment appear so numerous and substantial as to render any efficiencies attainable through joint trial of common issues insufficient,as a matter of law,to make a class action certified on such a basis advantageous to the judicial process and the litigants.washington mutual,supra,cal th at,d.
iv.conclusion 
although the court of appeal erred to the extent it stated or implied that no action in which plaintiffs seek medical monitoring as a remedy may ever appropriately be certified for class treatment,we agree with the court that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the instant certification motion.linder,supra,cal th at,d.
disposition 
the judgment of the court of appeal is affirmed.
i agree that there is no per se or categorical bar to the class treatment of medical monitoring claims lead,ante,d at,at,and that there are some common issues see lead,ante,at,at.i also agree that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the instant certification motion because plaintiffs failed to establish that the common issues predominate.id.at,at.thus,i join in parts i and ii of the lead opinion and its disposition.i,however,can not join part iii of the lead opinion because it fails to adequately convey the complexity of plaintiffs claims and,as a result,fails to acknowledge many of the individual issues that must be resolved in order to decide the proposed class action.indeed,upon considering the full breadth of plaintiffs claims in light of the record,i do not believe any court could reasonably conclude that they are suitable for class treatment.
to fully appreciate the complexity of plaintiffs proposed class action,i recount in greater detail the relevant facts.
in,grand central rocket company gcrc constructed a facility used for the production,testing and disposal of rocket propellants the rocket facility in the area.in,defendant chemical corporation which was jointly owned by defendants food machinery and chemical corporation fmc and tennessee gas transmission corporation now el paso tennessee pipeline tenneco acquired gcrc and the rocket facility.in a series of transactions from to,defendant lockheed martin corporation lockheed acquired gcrc and the facility.lockheed manufactured,assembled and tested solid fuel rockets at the covered approximately.from the opening of the rocket facility in to its closing in,these defendants discharged toxic substances throughout the facility property and contaminated the water used by surrounding residents.
in,lockheed leased acres of the property to seven w enterprises,seven w.seven w then acquired another acres of adjacent property from the city of redlands and constructed an industrial park.since the creation of this park,defendants baumac corporation baumac,highland supply corporation highland and palco communications,palco have discharged toxic substances around the park and further contaminated the water used by surrounding residents.
as a result of this discharge of toxic substances,plaintiffs filed this class action against seven,fmc,tenneco,lockheed,baumac,highland and palco.plaintiffs did not seek compensatory damages.instead,they limited their recovery to s pecial damages to establish a fund for periodic medical monitoring and medical testing for each plaintiff and class member and punitive and exemplary damages.consistent with this limitation,plaintiffs identified two potential medical monitoring class and a punitive damages class.
in their motion to certify,plaintiffs defined the class as p eople who were exposed to water contaminated with certain toxic substances at levels at or in excess of the dose equivalent of the maximum contaminant level,or in excess of the safe dose where there is no mcl,for some part of a day,for greater than of a year,for one or more years from to the present,within certain geographical boundaries which encompassed the city of redlands.plaintiffs estimated the class contained to members and identified over toxic substances discharged by defendants,including tce,pce,tca,ammonium perchlorate,perchlorate,beryllium,carbon tetrachloride,vinyl chloride,hydrazine and hydrazine derivatives,nitrosamines and nitrosamine derivatives,epoxides and epoxide derivatives and triazines and triazine derivatives.plaintiffs also identified over different medical conditions that may require medical monitoring due to exposure to those substances 
the trial court certified both the medical monitoring and punitive damages classes.the court of appeal reversed,concluding that the individual issues raised by plaintiffs claims clearly predominate over the common issues.
plaintiffs seek to certify a class consisting of all people exposed to a specified dose of one of at least different toxic substances for a certain period of time from to the present,within a geographical area encompassing the city of redlands.they allege that each class to number to require medical monitoring for over medical conditions.plaintiffs seek to recover medical monitoring damages from seven different defendants that dumped these chemicals in various locations on a property over a time period of years.given the size and complexity of these class claims,i do not believe a court could reasonably conclude that the common issues predominate and certify the proposed class.
t he cost of medical monitoring is a compensable item of damages where the proofs demonstrate,through reliable medical expert testimony,that the need for future monitoring is a reasonably certain consequence of a plaintiff toxic exposure and that the recommended monitoring is reasonable.potter firestone tire rubber cal th,d,potter.under this standard,a plaintiff may not obtain medical monitoring based solely upon a showing of an increased but unquantified risk resulting from exposure to toxic chemicals.ibid.rather,toxic exposure plaintiffs may recover only if the evidence establishes the necessity,as a direct consequence of the exposure in issue,for specific monitoring beyond that which an individual should pursue as a matter of general good sense and foresight,italics added.the availability of monitoring therefore depends on the particular need of a particular plaintiff.see ibid.
thus,a member of plaintiffs proposed class may obtain medical monitoring damages for a medical condition only if that member exposure to the chemicals dumped by defendants necessitate more monitoring than he or she would otherwise need.see potter,supra,cal th at,d.to order additional medical monitoring,a trier of fact must therefore determine the extent of monitoring that the class member would have required for that medical condition absent exposure and whether the class member needs any additional monitoring due to exposure to the substances discharged by defendants.
applying this standard of causation,the majority concludes that the medical expert testimony plaintiffs presented in support of their motion for class certification is too qualified,tentative and conclusionary to constitute substantial evidence that plaintiffs,by adopting a liability theory that makes actual dosages and variations in individual response irrelevant,will be able to prove causation and damages by common evidence.lead,ante,d at,at.in reaching this conclusion,the majority focuses on plaintiffs failure to show that dosages issues and the need for medical monitoring are susceptible to common proof.see lead,ante,at,at.i agree with the majority so far as it goes.but the majority fails to fully consider the extraordinary complexity of plaintiffs claims in its analysis and,as a result,understates the deficiencies of plaintiff showing in support of class certification.
as a threshold matter,determining each defendant liability to the class for medical monitoring damages requires the resolution of a staggering number of complex individual issues.first,determining the extent of monitoring required by each class member absent exposure poses a highly individualized inquiry.a class member risk of developing a medical condition depends on numerous factors unique to that member,such as age,gender,lifestyle,fitness,preexisting conditions,exposure to hazardous substances not released by defendants.given that plaintiffs identify over medical conditions that may necessitate additional monitoring for approximately to individuals,the number and complexity of these individual determinations is overwhelming.
second,determining whether each class member requires additional monitoring due to exposure requires individual litigation of numerous and substantial questions.a class member need for additional monitoring hinges on the particular traits or characteristics of each class member.as plaintiffs own experts acknowledge,human reaction to environmental and other hazards varies from individual to individual.it is directly affected not only by the individual dosage or extent of exposure,but also by preexisting conditions,genetic makeup,age,gender,size,nutrition,adaptation and acclimatization to geographic and climatological factors,lifestyle,family history,social history,occupational history and personal health history.thus,whether an individual class member needs additional medical monitoring depends heavily on numerous factors specific to that not just the dosage of toxic substances received.moreover,the clinical value of early detection and diagnosis may vary significantly depending on the medical condition at issue and the individual characteristics of each class member.given the number of hazardous substances involved,the number of medical conditions implicated,and the size of the class,resolution of the many individual issues necessary to establish each individual class member entitlement to additional monitoring due to exposure would be a herculean task.because determining the basic issue of defendant s liability to the purported class requires the resolution of countless issues specific to each class member,class treatment is not appropriate.city of san jose superior court cal d,city of san jose.
aside from the individualized inquiries necessary to establish liability,the individualized inquiries necessary to establish the extent of additional medical monitoring required by those class members who prove liability are also numerous and substantial.to determine the extent of monitoring required,the court would have to ascertain the significance and extent of each member exposure to the chemicals dumped by defendants.because of the number of chemicals involved,their potential synergistic effects,the duration of dumping,the size of the area in which the dumping occurred,and the intricacies of hydrogeology,this task depends on the resolution of numerous questions specific to each class member.consequently,individual questions dominate such a determination.finally,the resolution of various affirmative,statute of requires separate adjudication for each class member.
viewed altogether,the individual questions that must be resolved in order to resolve plaintiffs claims are staggering in both number and complexity.indeed,subsequent to the rendering of any class judgment which determined in plaintiffs favor whatever questions were common to the class,the trial court in this case would have to conduct tens of thousands of complex individualized trials over causation,damages and affirmative defenses.vasquez superior court cal d.invocation of the class action mechanism under these circumstances would not promote efficiency.rather,it would deprive either the defendant s or the members of the a fair trial.see city of san jose,supra,cal d at.
the possible creation of subclasses makes no difference in this case.while subclasses may sufficiently minimize the individual issues in certain cases,we have long recognized that there are limits outside of which the subclassification system ceases to perform a sufficiently useful function to justify the maintenance of the class action.city of san jose,supra,cal d at,fn.this is such a case.plaintiffs allege that seven different defendants dumped over chemicals at multiple locations on a property over years.in doing so,these defendants allegedly harmed to people with different characteristics by placing them at greater risk for contracting over possible medical conditions.given the number of variables involved in this case,the potential number of subclasses is.kennedy baxter healthcare th,d.class certification under these facts would therefore defeat the purposes served by class action litigation.ibid.
in this respect,boeing north american,ii is instructive.in boeing north american,i and ii,the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants discharged radioactive and nonradioactive hazardous substances at four facilities.see i,at.this discharge allegedly created a continuing health hazard for people living near these facilities.id.at.the plaintiffs sought to certify three classes.as relevant here,class i consisted of a ll persons who presently reside or work in the contamination area or who,at any time since,have resided or worked in the contamination area and who have not been diagnosed with a type of cancer or other serious illness or disease which may be attributed to exposure to the radioactive contaminants hazardous,substances released from the facilities.id.at.like plaintiffs,the plaintiffs sought to establish a medical monitoring program for the class funded by the defendants.ibid.
although the federal district court initially certified the medical monitoring class see i,supra,at,it later decertified the class see ii,supra,at.in doing so,the court not only cited the individualized focus of the statute of limitations defense ibid,but also admitted that it had underestimated the difficulty of applying the individualized factors required by potter to the class i medical monitoring claim in its order certifying the class id.at,fn.
these conclusions are especially cogent in this case,given that plaintiffs class claims and the class claims in ii are analogous in their breadth and complexity.moreover,the reasoning of the court in ii is even more persuasive here because plaintiffs proposed medical monitoring class is even broader than the class proposed in ii.see i,supra,at the plaintiffs class expressly excluded those persons who have been diagnosed with a medical condition attributable to exposure.indeed,other courts have refused to certify medical monitoring classes in analogous cases using similar reasoning.see,goasdone american cyanamid,goasdone refusing to certify a medical monitoring class consisting of all people who worked at a textile plant for days or more from until and were exposed to dyes resulting in an increased risk of contracting bladder cancer because the individual issues predominated.
the federal cases cited by plaintiffs in support of class certification are inapposite.even assuming these cases are still persuasive see goasdone,supra,at,all of them involved simpler facts and claims by contrast,plaintiffs class claims are incredibly complex even for a mass tort action.permitting certification under these facts would,as a practical matter,make all medical monitoring claims subject to class treatment.such a result would open the floodgates of litigation notwithstanding our carefully crafted decision in potter.potter,supra,cal th at,d.rather than do so,i believe other procedures traditionally used to manage complex litigation,like consolidation and coordination,may be more appropriate.see rose medtronics,d.consolidation of actions is the preferred procedure for disposition of mass tort cases.
accordingly,i join the lead opinion in affirming the judgment of the court of appeal.
i join parts i and ii of the lead opinion,holding that there is no per se bar to class treatment of medical monitoring claims,and concluding that plaintiffs have demonstrated some common issues as a class.however,i dissent from the lead opinion holding in parts iii and iv that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that common issues predominate and in certifying the class in this case.contrary to the majority,i conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in certifying the class of plaintiffs seeking damages for the cost of future medical monitoring.
plaintiffs in the present case allege that defendants caused contaminants,including toxic rocket fuel ammonium perchlorate and trichloroethylene a carcinogenic solvent to be leaked into the water table in redlands and that this contaminated water was consumed by members of the proposed class.plaintiffs brought a claim seeking damages for the cost of a medical monitoring program,and punitive damages.the trial court determined that plaintiffs had a realistic chance of success on the merits.in addition,the trial court found that common issues predominate in this action and that plaintiffs could pursue their claims as a class.
the decision of a trial court to certify a class action is reviewed for abuse of discretion.because trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action,they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification.linder thrifty oil cal th,d,linder.the majority disregards this deferential standard of review and instead engages in its own examination of the record to decide that,while there are some common issues in this case,these issues do not predominate.the majority concludes,therefore,that the trial court erred in certifying the class.i believe that substantial evidence supports the trial court certification order.because i would uphold the trial court decision to certify the class in this case,i dissent.
applicable standard of review 
the lead opinion briefly summarizes the standard for reviewing a trial court decision to certify a class.see lead,ante,d at,at.this short discussion,however,does not fully acknowledge the level of deference given to a trial court.the lead opinion cites our opinion in linder,supra,cal th at page,d,for the proposition that we must examine the trial court reasons for granting class certification.the lead opinion does not mention,however,that in the following sentence in linder we clarify that any valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.ibid.thus,while the lead opinion is correct in stating that reviewing courts may overturn a trial court ruling on certification if it is not supported by substantial evidence,it misses the point that any valid pertinent reason is sufficient to uphold an order for certification.this is an extremely deferential standard of review.
further,we have stated that a trial court ruling on certification supported by substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous legal assumptions were made citation.linder,supra,cal th at,d.for example,in washington mutual bank superior court cal th,d,washington mutual,we reversed a court of appeal decision upholding the trial court certification order because the order was premised upon a faulty legal assumption.in the present case,however,the majority does not conclude that the trial court used improper criteria in granting the certification order,nor do they find that the trial court made erroneous legal assumptions.in such a case,the sole question is whether the court abused its discretion.occidental land,superior court cal d.
in addition,an appellate court review of a certification order should not consider the merits of the underlying suit.as we have said,we view the question of certification as essentially a procedural one that does not ask whether an action is legally or factually meritorious.linder,supra,cal th at,d.in reviewing a certification order,then,we assume that the plaintiffs theories of liability are viable.any challenge to the viability of the plaintiffs claims should be left for a pleading or motion that considers the merits of these claims.as we have stated,w hen the substantive theories and claims of a proposed class suit are alleged to be without legal or factual merit,the interests of fairness and efficiency are furthered when the contention is resolved in the context of a formal pleading demurrer or motion judgment on the pleadings,summary judgment,or summary adjudication that affords proper notice and employs clear standards.were we to condone challenges as part and parcel of the certification process,similar procedural protections would be necessary to ensure that an otherwise certifiable class is not unfairly denied the opportunity to proceed on legitimate claims.id.at,d.
trial court certification order 
in the certification order at issue here,the trial court explained that while it recognized that this case presents some individual issues,these issues were manageable.the trial court found that plaintiffs case derived from a common nucleus of facts and that common issues predominate.because we review the certification order for abuse of discretion,i set forth in detail its relevant contents.
in granting the certification order,the trial court stated that its ruling was interlocutory this order may be rescinded or modified as the changed circumstances of the class,its representatives,or particular actions require.after concluding that plaintiffs have a realistic chance of success on the merits,and recognizing that plaintiffs allege that they were exposed as a class to water contaminated by toxic chemicals,the court noted this court further finds that although there is no evidence of the dosage of toxins that were received by the members of the proposed class,proof of dosage received is not necessary at this time.additionally,the court found that it is not necessary to determine the levels of toxins received by each plaintiff at this time.
most importantly,the trial court found that t he issues of law and fact in this case all evolve from a common nucleus of facts and these common questions of law and fact predominate over those that are individual to the plaintiffs.the court recognizes that there are individual issues that will have to be dealt with at the time of trial,however,the court finds these individual issues to be manageable.
turning to the benefits of class treatment,the trial court found that proceeding with this action as a class action will substantially benefit the court and the litigants because it will provide a superior method of dealing with the common questions of law and fact that exist in this case.the trial court noted that it had considered other methods of proceeding with this litigation but found that the class action is the superior method.
in addition,the trial court found that the prerequisites for a class action set forth in federal rules of civil procedure,rule a,were satisfied.we have stated that in determining whether a class action proponent has demonstrated a predominance of common issues and manageability of the class,we may look to the procedures governing federal class actions under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure for guidance.washington mutual,supra,cal th at,d.the trial court in this case found that the class consists of an estimated people and therefore,the members of the class are so numerous that joinder of members of the class as individual plaintiffs is impracticable the common questions of law and fact predominate over those that are individual to the plaintiffs the claims of the persons representing the class are typical of the class generally the persons acting as class representatives are able to fairly and adequately protect the interest of all members of the class and class counsel is able to adequately represent the class.
applying the standard of review to the trial court certification order,it is clear that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in certifying the class in this case.contrary to the majority,i conclude that substantial evidence supports the trial court determination that common issues predominate and that any individual issues in this case are manageable.
duty and breach 
in reviewing the factors that plaintiffs will have to prove at trial to recover medical monitoring damages,there is substantial evidence to support the trial court conclusion that common issues predominate.part ii of the lead opinion recognizes that it is undisputed that several key issues at trial will be proven by evidence that is common to all class members.lead,ante,d at,at.as the lead opinion states,because plaintiffs claims sound generally in negligence,plaintiffs will have to prove duty,breach of duty,proximate cause,and damages.artiglio corning cal th,d.the lead opinion acknowledges that the issue of whether defendants owed a duty of care to the proposed class members is susceptible to common proof.lead,ante,at,at.in addition,the lead opinion states that the issue of defendants breach of this duty of care is also one that will be proven by evidence common to all class members.lead,ante,at,at.
the trial court,in its certification order,explained that it found that common issues predominate because t he issues of law and fact in this case all evolve from a common nucleus of facts.this conclusion is supported by substantial evidence since the central question of whether defendants acted negligently is common to all class members.in order to establish defendants liability,plaintiffs will present common evidence attempting to show that defendants negligently disposed of toxic chemicals that contaminated the groundwater of redlands.evidence of how these chemicals were discharged,and in what amounts,and how they entered into the domestic water system,will be common to all class members.in fact,all of defendants actions will be proven by common evidence.
proximate cause and damages the potter factors 
in addition to establishing defendants duty of care and their breach of this duty,plaintiffs will also have to show that their injuries were proximately caused by defendants actions and that they are entitled to damages as compensation for these injuries.plaintiffs in this case,however,do not seek traditional compensatory damages.instead,they seek to recover damages for the cost of medical monitoring of future injuries.as we explained in potter,i n the context of a toxic exposure action,a claim for medical monitoring seeks to recover the cost of future periodic medical examinations intended to facilitate early detection and treatment of disease caused by a plaintiff exposure to toxic substances.potter firestone tire rubber cal th,d,potter.
damages for medical monitoring are unlike a traditional damages remedy because in order to recover medical monitoring damages,a plaintiff need not demonstrate a present physical injury or even show proof that injury is reasonably certain to occur in the future.we have determined that medical monitoring may be called for as a result of defendant tortious conduct,even in the absence of actual physical injury.potter,supra,cal th,d.r ecovery of medical monitoring damages should not be dependent upon a showing that a particular cancer or disease is reasonably certain to occur in the future.id.at,d.to recover medical monitoring damages,a plaintiff must show that the need for future monitoring is a reasonably certain consequence of a plaintiff toxic exposure and that the recommended monitoring is reasonable.id.at,d.
as the lead opinion explains,we set forth five factors in our decision in potter the potter factors that are relevant to a court determination of the reasonableness and necessity of medical monitoring.potter,supra,cal th at,d,see lead,ante,d at,at.the five potter factors are not novel evidentiary burdens they are simply meant to give courts guidance in determining whether plaintiffs seeking medical monitoring have met the traditional tort requirements of causation and damage.see lead,ante,at,at.thus,plaintiffs will need to present evidence relating to the potter factors in order to prove the elements of proximate causation and damages.
as with the elements of duty and breach,i agree with the majority that some of the potter factors are clearly subject to common proof.the majority recognizes that two of the five potter toxicity of the chemicals allegedly discharged and the seriousness of a disease for which the plaintiffs are at involve common proof.
furthermore,the lead opinion acknowledges that s trictly speaking,the trial court was correct in ruling that the first potter significance and extent of plaintiffs exposure to subject to common proof,since under plaintiffs theory of liability,the exact dosage of each discharged chemical received by each individual plaintiff is irrelevant.lead,ante,d at,at.part iii of the lead opinion,however,ultimately rejects plaintiffs theory of liability and concludes that the first potter factor is not subject to common proof.it is largely this determination,that the issue of plaintiffs exposure is not subject to common proof,that leads the majority to reject the trial court conclusion that common issues predominate.for this reason,i will focus on this factor to explain why i believe that the issue of exposure is subject to common proof,and that the trial court did not err in concluding that common issues predominate.
the lead opinion refers to potter for the proposition that evidence of exposure alone can not support a finding that medical monitoring is a reasonably necessary response.lead,ante,d at,at,citing potter,supra,cal th at,d.this statement is,of course,correct.a plaintiff can not recover the cost of medical monitoring merely because he or she has been exposed to toxic chemicals.instead,a plaintiff must show the need for medical monitoring in light of the other potter factors,including the toxicity of these chemicals and the seriousness of the diseases for which plaintiff is at risk as a result of the exposure to these chemicals.
the lead opinion is incorrect,however,in concluding from our statements in potter that the issue of plaintiffs exposure to toxic chemicals can not be subject to common proof.we did not decide in potter whether evidence of exposure could be presented on a basis.we merely said that one factor relevant in determining whether a plaintiff could recover the cost of medical monitoring was the significance and extent of plaintiff exposure to the toxic chemicals.we did not say whether or not plaintiffs could present evidence of exposure on a basis by alleging that all plaintiffs in a proposed class have received a certain minimum level of exposure to the chemicals.
plaintiffs theory of liability is that all individuals who meet the class requirements are entitled to medical monitoring.plaintiffs allege that everyone exposed to defendants discharged chemicals over specified minimum safety levels for some part of a day,for greater than of a year,for one or more years from to the present will require specialized monitoring for diseases caused by such exposure.class membership,therefore,is restricted by definition to persons who have received a specified,medically significant minimum level of exposure to the allegedly contaminated water.plaintiffs claim that individual class members need only establish their residency employment in the contaminated area for at least six months to be eligible for medical monitoring.thus,under plaintiffs theory of liability,the significance and extent of toxic exposure is susceptible to common proof.while plaintiffs may or may not be able to succeed in proving this theory,the trial court was correct in accepting this theory for purposes of a certification motion.
the majority concludes,however,that plaintiffs can not prove exposure on a basis because each plaintiff received different dosages of toxic chemicals.see lead,ante,d at,at.of course,whether someone is exposed to toxic chemicals is not the same issue as what dosage of the chemical he or she received.i agree with the majority that any relevant questions relating to variations in actual chemical dosage received by individual members of the plaintiff class are likely not susceptible to common proof.plaintiffs,however,have constructed their theory of liability to make these questions of individual dosage largely irrelevant.
the majority errs in examining the record in this case to determine whether plaintiffs experts declarations support plaintiffs theory of liability.the lead opinion finds that the medical expert testimony plaintiffs presented in support of their motion for class certification is too qualified,tentative,and conclusionary to constitute substantial evidence that plaintiffs,by adopting a liability theory that makes actual dosages and variations in individual response irrelevant,will be able to prove causation and damages by common evidence.lead,ante,at,at.this type of reevaluation of the record and critique of expert testimony is inappropriate in the context of a certification motion.
in reviewing a certification order,we are not called upon to determine whether plaintiffs experts declarations demonstrate the reasonableness and necessity of medical monitoring whether the evidence submitted in support of certification is adequate to support plaintiffs theories on their merits is not before us,since certification may not be conditioned upon a showing that class claims for relief are likely to prevail.linder,supra,cal th at,d.
by rejecting the viability of plaintiffs theory of all plaintiffs in the proposed class are entitled to medical monitoring based on a threshold level of majority is effectively ruling on the substantive merits of plaintiffs claims in the context of a procedural motion for certification.such a conclusion should not be made in the context of a certification motion but rather should be made in the context of a formal pleading or motion that affords proper notice to the parties and follows clear standards of review.by ruling on the merits of plaintiffs claims in the context of a certification motion,the majority denies plaintiffs the procedural protections to which they are entitled.linder,supra,cal th at,d.
in addition,the majority search of the record for evidence to support plaintiffs theory of liability risks making a motion for certification a more complicated and burdensome procedure.as we have cautioned,s ubstantial discovery may be required if plaintiffs are expected to make meaningful presentations on the merits.all of that is likely to render the certification process more protracted and cumbersome,even if trial courts were prohibited from resolving factual disputes.such complications hardly seem necessary when procedures already exist for early merit challenges.linder,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
furthermore,the majority ignores the fact that the nature of the remedy requested in this case reduces the importance of each plaintiff individual exposure.if plaintiffs had sought to recover compensatory damages,the issue of each individual exposure clearly would have been relevant to each individual recovery.in seeking medical monitoring damages,however,plaintiffs need not prove present or future individual injury.instead,they need only show that medical monitoring is reasonably necessary as a result of exposure to the toxic chemicals.plaintiffs allege that all class members,having received a threshold level of exposure,are entitled to the same remedy because they are all at a greater risk of disease.this is the approach taken in yslava hughes aircraft,where the court determined that for a class action seeking medical monitoring,a ll persons who were exposed to a certain level for at least a year would qualify for medical monitoring.thus,proof of an exact or individual amount of exposure or particular risk level is not necessary.the core issues of liability and exposure are common to all class members.id.at,italics added.
ultimately,the majority,in rejecting plaintiffs theory of liability,fails to give proper deference to the findings of the trial court.the trial court accepted plaintiffs theory of liability for purposes of the certification order.as the trial court concluded,although there is no evidence of the dosage of toxins that were received by the members of the proposed class,proof of the dosage received is not necessary at this time.moreover,the certification order was interlocutory.thus,should plaintiffs theory of liability prove to be not viable at a later date,the trial court retained the option of decertifying the class.see boeing north american,while trial court initially certified class seeking damages for medical monitoring,the court decertified the class after its summary judgment rulings.at this early point in the proceedings,however,the trial court assumed,as it should,that plaintiffs theory of liability was viable.under this theory,the first potter exposure to the toxic subject to common proof.
turning to the remaining potter factors,the lead opinion briefly states that proof of each individual plaintiff chances of developing a particular disease,had he or she not been exposed,may not be subject to common proof.i agree with the lead opinion that an individual preexisting conditions are,by definition,not susceptible to common proof.i am not convinced,however,that predisposition to a disease should preclude a plaintiff who has been exposed to toxic chemicals from receiving medical monitoring for diagnostic purposes.as we stated in potter,while there is no question that a defendant ought not to be liable for medical monitoring of a plaintiff preexisting condition that is unaffected by a subsequent toxic exposure negligently caused by the defendant,we see no reason why the defendant should not be held responsible for any increased or different monitoring of the preexisting condition whether or not the preexisting condition is caused by the plaintiff voluntary conduct where necessitated as a direct result of the subsequent exposure.potter,supra,cal th at,fn,d.thus,neither the possibility nor the actuality of preexisting medical conditions constitutes a bar to medical monitoring liability.furthermore,screening for preexisting conditions,while individualized,is irrelevant to an initial determination of defendants liability.such screening for preexisting conditions can be done postjudgment,perhaps as an initial part of the monitoring process.
finally,the lead opinion does not discuss the fifth potter factor,the clinical value of early detection and diagnosis.potter,supra,cal th at,d.presuming that the clinical value of early detection and diagnosis varies among diseases,whether monitoring has clinical value in a particular case would seem to depend,at least in part,on the specific toxicity of the chemicals allegedly discharged.as previously discussed,the lead opinion agrees that such toxicity may be susceptible to common proof.
part i of the lead opinion states that even if one potter factor is not subject to common proof,this should not prove fatal to a certification motion.the lead opinion explicitly rejects defendants argument that potter requires that each of the five factors is capable of common proof.see lead,ante,d at,at.i agree with this conclusion and determine that even though some factors may not involve common proof,certification of a class action may still be appropriate.as we have stated,the fact that each member of the class must prove his or her separate claim to a portion of any recovery by the class is only one factor to be considered in determining whether a class action is proper and t he requirement of a community of interest does not depend upon an identical recovery.vasquez superior court cal d,vasquez.even that each class member might be required ultimately to justify an individual claim does not necessarily preclude the maintenance of a class action.collins rocha cal d,see also vasquez,supra,at.
here,the trial court concluded that class treatment was the superior method since the case arose out of a common nucleus of facts and common issues predominate.in my view,substantial evidence supports this conclusion.i agree with the majority that the issues of defendants duty and breach of this duty is susceptible to common proof.in addition,i conclude that most,if not all,of the potter factors will involve proof that is common to all class members.therefore,unlike the majority,i can not conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that common issues predominate.
while the majority concludes that there is no per se bar to class treatment of medical monitoring claims,i am concerned that by reversing the trial court decision to certify the class in this case,the effect of our ruling will be a de facto bar on class treatment of medical monitoring claims.plaintiffs theory of liability is that all plaintiffs who meet a threshold level of exposure should recover damages for the cost of medical monitoring.the majority rejects this theory,agreeing with defendants that proof of exposure alone is insufficient to show causation and damages.since the majority believes that each plaintiff will have to show the specific dosage of toxic chemicals he or she received,they conclude that the trial court erred in certifying this case as a class action.my concern with this holding is that it essentially precludes plaintiffs from constructing a claim for medical monitoring damages that minimizes questions of individual exposure.if plaintiffs are required to show evidence of dosage on an individual basis,and such a requirement of individualized proof will prove fatal to a certification motion,then essentially no claim for medical monitoring damages can be treated on a basis.
in every potential class action for medical monitoring damages,exposure will be individualized in some sense.a group of plaintiffs seeking medical monitoring based on their exposure to asbestos in the workplace,for example,will have been employed for varying amounts of time.even for those plaintiffs employed for the same length of time,contact with hazardous substances may vary fro
