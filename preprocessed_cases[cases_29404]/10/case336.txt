background 
the underlying actions 
the securities actions allege defendants manipulated the ipo and ipo aftermarkets in a variety of ways,including nondisclosure of commissions and other compensation,undisclosed arrangements wherein purchasers who participated in an ipo were required to buy stock in the ipo aftermarket,and the issuance of misleading analysts reports the putative class includes all investors who bought the stocks at issue from the date of the ipo through december.in re initial pub.secs,d at.complaints were originally assigned randomly to judges in the southern district of new york,but were transferred to judge scheindlin for purposes on august,by order of chief judge mukasey.
in addition,nine separate antitrust actions were filed in the southern district,consolidated under the caption in re initial public offering antitrust litigation,civ,the antitrust actions and assigned to the william pauley,iii.in re initial pub.offering secs,d at and.the antitrust actions also allege d efendants manipulated the prices of securities brought to market in the ipos traded in the aftermarkets and include in their putative class all persons who purchased any of the manipulated securities in the aftermarket of ipos conducted by the d efendants from march through the present.
the district judge alleged conflicts 
prior to consolidation of the securities actions,judge scheindlin presided over eight cases involving an ipo for internet capital group.in re initial pub.offering sec,d at.the district judge notified parties that she had purchased and sold the stock at a small profit,and she opted out of membership in any class action involving that ipo.id.none of the parties sought her recusal.id.a similar divestment occurred in two actions involving the ipo for breakaway solutions.id.judge scheindlin informed the parties that she purchased that stock in july and sold it in august at a loss.id.again,the district court judge opted out of any class action involving that ipo.id.again,none of the parties sought her recusal.id.
after the transfer of the securities actions,and following the issuance of the first case management order and case management conference,several defendants asked to meet with the district court judge regarding potential conflicts.in re initial pub.offering sec,d at.following that inquiry,judge scheindlin asked the parties to perform a conflicts check,due to what she termed the extraordinarily large number of disclosure statements filed pursuant to rule of the joint local civil rules for the southern and eastern districts of new york.id.at.that check revealed a number of previously undisclosed conflicts.id.at.the district court judge held stock in and kana communications.id.kana communications is a defendant in the securities actions.while is not a defendant in any of the securities actions,the moving defendants argue is implicated in one of the securities actions,klein merrill lynch,civ.sas.in re initial pub.offering sec,d at.the allegations in klein involve an ipo for internet infrastructure holdrs,a basket security which represent s an undivided beneficial ownership interest in specified internet infrastructure companies.id.internal quotation marks omitted,along with kana communications,is one of the specified companies included in the basket,although the klein complaint did not include purchasers of the constituent stocks as plaintiffs.id.the district court judge informed parties she was unaware of the conflicts at the time of the reassignments in august,immediately sold both stocks,and waived any interest in pursuing claims involving those purchases.id.at.
in addition,the moving defendants identified a number of stocks deemed troublesome because the stocks were sold through ipos from through,and thus may be implicated in the antitrust actions.of the ten stocks not previously discussed,seven were sold by judge scheindlin prior to any of the securities actions being filed.in re initial pub.offering secs,d at.the district court judge continues to hold two of the stocks,while the remaining stock merged with,which did not issue an ipo during the relevant time period.id.the district judge also waived any interests she may have held as a putative class member in the securities actions and antitrust actions.the moving defendants also identified as a conflict a stock owned by judge scheindlin adult son in one of the issuer defendants.id.the district judge never learned the identity of the stock,and her son sold the stock at issue and waived any interest in participating in any action arising from that investment.id.at.
the district judge comments 
the moving defendants also rely on comments made by the district judge to support their recusal motion.the first of the comments at issue were made at a july,conference regarding the internet capital cases 
all i know is the broker called and said this a good stock to buy and i said sure,then the next day she called and said this is a good stock to sell and i said sure.that it.sad to say,very sad to say,i do read anything i should read.and that the end of it.so i know nothing i think i probably am not in the class by definition anyway,because i made money,and if i was in it,i do want to be in it,i opt out,and i do know anything other than there is that name on the list of things that were bought and sold that has a problem i know nothing.i read nothing.nobody tells me anything.i am really one of those sad investors.the brokers call,i say yes,goodbye they say sell,i say yes,goodbye.i regret all of my yeses for all these past few years.every one was a mistake.but that is what i know.
the district judge expanded on those comments during a september,conference 
and to get specific,to discuss that it would be everything that has gone down,which as far as i can tell is techs and everything else that i bought some of my worst losers were reits.i was absolutely creamed in reits from the broker,kmart,elder trust,corporate office properties,there was a whole slew of that.i apparently just am not talented at this in general and would not pick a stock ever again of any variety.so,i say that again and i say broadly,whether it was reits,whether it was techs,whether it was blue chips,i regret every yes.
work done on the securities actions from the consolidation through the recusal motion 
more than entries have been docketed in the consolidated action,which involves at least class action lawsuits against issuers,underwriters and hundreds of individuals.in re initial pub.offering secs,d at.according to the district judge,w hile a great deal of organizational time and effort has been expended,this court has not made any substantive decisions.id.at.judge scheindlin has supervised administrative staff in organizing the unprecedented number of class actions and held meetings with court members and staff,including additional staff hired to handle the extra work created by the consolidated action.id.the district judge also prepared and issued a case management order,which required hundreds of case management submissions and the processing of those submissions.id.the first case management conference,attended by hundreds of attorneys,required a detailed case management agenda.id.hundreds of lead plaintiff and lead counsel motions have been filed.id.in addition,the district judge assisted in the formation of a plaintiffs executive committee,steering committee,and the selection of plaintiffs liaison counsel.id.the district judge also decided which cases belonged in the consolidation and which needed to be assigned to a different judge.id.finally,the district court signed numerous orders permitting the appearance of counsel pro hac vice and consolidating cases by issuer.id.at fn.
discussion 
we review the denial of a motion to recuse for abuse of discretion.in re aguinda,cir.an error of law or fact would constitute an abuse of discretion,but we are nevertheless free to affirm an appealed decision on any ground which finds support in the record.beal stern,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.further,we will not grant the exceptional remedy of mandamus except where the petitioner has demonstrated that its right to such relief is clear and indisputable.in re drexel burnham lambert,cir internal quotation marks omitted emphasis in original.thus,our analysis requires we consider not only the standards governing recusal but the extraordinary showing required to obtain the issuance of a writ of mandamus.id.petitioners bear the burden of clearly and indisputably proving the district court abused its discretion.absent such a showing,mandamus will not lie.id.at.
the discretion to consider disqualification rests with the district judge in the first instance.drexel,at.the reasons for this are plain.the judge presiding over a case is in the best position to appreciate the implications of those matters alleged in a recusal motion.id.a judge considering recusal must balance the need for public confidence in the judiciary against the possibility that those questioning her impartiality might be seeking to avoid the adverse consequences of her presiding over their case.id.finally,a district judge is as much obliged not to recuse herself unnecessarily as she is obliged to recuse herself when necessary.id.
on appeal,the moving defendants first argue the district court judge interests mandate recusal under b her participation in several ipos gives her personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts requiring recusal under b and as a putative class member,she is a party to the proceeding forcing recusal under b i.the district court rejected all three grounds for recusal.judge scheindlin found she properly cured any conflict by promptly divesting of the stocks at issue and by waiving any interest in both the securities actions and the antitrust actions.in re initial pub.secs.offering,d at.the district judge also found her experiences of investing in several ipos did not give her knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts,id.at,and that her waiver of interests meant she was not a party to a proceeding.id.at.as we find recusal unnecessary based on the district court investment of substantial judicial time in the securities actions,we offer no opinion as to the district court findings regarding b.
the statute governing recusal,appears to mandate recusal under certain circumstances,such as when a judge is a party to,or has a financial interest in,a proceeding 
there is,however,an exception 
notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section,if any judge to whom a matter has been assigned would be disqualified,after substantial judicial time has been devoted to the matter,because of the appearance or discovery,after the matter was assigned to him or her,that he or she individually or as a fiduciary,or his or her spouse or minor child residing in his or her household,has a financial interest in a party other than an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome,disqualification is not required if the judge divests herself of the interest that provides the grounds for disqualification.
f.the statute defines a financial interest in relevant part as ownership of a legal or equitable interest,however small.d.therefore,if the discovery of judge scheindlin ipo investments came after substantial judicial time was devoted to the securities actions,and her interest was not one that could be substantially affected by the outcome,she could properly divest herself of the securities involved in the litigation without recusing herself on the basis of her stock ownership.f see kidder,peabody maxus energy,cir.
congress enacted f to solve a specific problem that has arisen as a consequence of existing disqualification requirements and their application in class action cases,reprinted in.specifically,congress was troubled by the outcome of in re cement and concrete antitrust litigation,in which a district court judge was forced to recuse himself,after five years,from a class action because it was discovered his wife owned stock in seven of class members.id.section f was created 
to permit a judge or his or her spouse or minor children to resolve the conflict by divesting themselves of the property creating the conflict.disqualification would continue to be automatic if the interest in the controversy was one that could be substantially affected by the outcome.for example,a significant stockholder in a closely held corporation with close acquaintances would be expected to recuse himself or herself rather than divest.
the case before us falls squarely within the situation envisioned by district judge with a minor interest in a class action lawsuit discovered after assignment,who quickly divested herself of the conflicting interest.congress clearly did not envision class membership as an interest substantially affected by the outcome,otherwise f could not solve the very problem it was meant to remedy.
we turn then to the issue of whether the district court devoted substantial judicial time.the statute does not define substantial judicial time.the district court discussed f in support of its argument that it could prospectively divest of conflicting stocks before substantial judicial time was invested.in re initial pub.secs.offering,d at.we think the district court failed to appreciate the application of f to the recusal motion.we hold measuring substantial judicial time means examining the time and effort a district court invests in a matter,rather than simply counting off days on the calender to see if substantial time passed.the inquiry is thus properly focused on the amount of work a case requires,not on calender time.in some matters,months may pass with little or no involvement by the district court,requiring a finding that substantial judicial time has not been devoted.other cases will,in a matter of weeks,demand a great deal of the court time and attention.for example,little judicial time would probably be expended on a typical employment discrimination action within the first few months of assignment.in contrast,the securities actions required a herculean organizational effort upon assignment,with the docket reflecting the entry of more than items.organizational work may be the grunt work of the judicial system,but it is as necessary and vital to its success as motion and trial practice.we recognize that this case is unusual in requiring the devotion of significant judicial resources early on,and suspect that in most cases the passage of calender time will closely track the devotion
