the petition for panel rehearing is denied,and no judge in regular active service having requested that the court be polled on rehearing en banc,the petition for rehearing en banc is denied.the opinion,cir,is withdrawn for the limited purpose of making minor adjustments in the analyses contained in parts,and although by far the greater portion of the opinion remains intact,we now issue a new opinion,as follows 
in what may be the ultimate negative value class action lawsuit plaintiffs challenge defendants alleged practice of paying lower benefits and charging higher premiums to blacks in the sale of life insurance.the district court denied plaintiffs motion to certify a class pursuant to.b,finding,inter alia,that the majority of class members would not benefit from injunctive relief.based primarily on allison citgo petroleum,cir,we reverse and remand.
this is a consolidation of civil rights actions against three life insurance companies monumental life insurance company monumental,american national insurance company anico,and western and southern insurance company western and southern.plaintiff policyowners,all of whom are black,allege that,for decades,defendants discriminated against them in the sale and administration of life insurance policies,known as industrial life policies that have face amounts of or less and require small weekly or monthly premiums.defendants comprise over companies that issued industrial life policies over a fifty to period 
plaintiffs allege two overtly discriminatory practices.first,they accuse defendants of placing blacks in industrial policies offering the same benefits as do policies sold to whites,but at a higher premium dual rates.second,defendants allegedly placed blacks in substandard industrial policies providing fewer or lower benefits than do comparable plans sold to whites dual plans.these practices are memorialized in the insurer rate books and records,which explicitly distinguish dual rate and dual plan policies by race although,before filing their motion for class certification,plaintiffs challenged the insurers alleged practice of charging blacks substandard premiums because of underwriting factors,such as mental condition,occupation,socioeconomic status,educational level,living conditions,and personal habits,plaintiffs no longer complain of such pretextual underwriting procedures.
defendants state that they issued hundreds,perhaps thousands,of different industrial life insurance products encompassing a countless variety of underwriting standards.it is undisputed that all companies that sold dual rate or dual plan policies have not done so since the early.also,as early as,some insurers voluntarily adjusted premiums death benefits to equalize the amount of coverage per premium dollar.still,plaintiffs estimate that over million of the million industrial policies issued by defendants remain many other policies have been terminated,surrendered,or without remediation defendants expert estimates that the ratio of terminated policies to outstanding policies is approximately five to one,meaning that slightly more than one million policies remain.
plaintiffs sued for violations of and,seeking an injunction prohibiting the collection of discriminatory premiums,reformation of policies to equalize benefits,and restitution of past premium overcharges or benefit underpayments.pursuant to,the judicial panel for multidistrict litigation mdl consolidated the actions against monumental and transferred them to the eastern district of louisiana for pretrial proceedings.later,the mdl panel took the same action with the cases against anico and western and southern.
plaintiffs moved for certification of a class pursuant to rule b,requesting that class members be provided notice and rights.the district court denied certification,finding that plaintiffs claims for monetary relief predominate over their claims for injunctive relief,making rule b certification inappropriate.the court also found that,given the large number of companies and policies involved,individualized hearings were necessary to determine damages and whether claims were barred by the statute of limitations.defendants sought,and this court granted,interlocutory review pursuant to.f.
defendants contend that class members can not be readily identified by way of the class definition.a precise class definition is necessary to identify properly those entitled to relief,those bound by the judgment,and those entitled to notice.james moore et,moore federal practice,at ed see debremaecker short,cir.some courts have stated that a precise class definition is not as critical where certification of a class for injunctive or declaratory relief is sought under rule b where notice and rights are requested,however,a precise class definition becomes just as important as in the rule b context.
plaintiffs sought to certify a class comprised of a ll who own,or owned at the time of policy termination,an industrial life insurance policy that was issued as a substandard plan or at a substandard rate.defendants argue that the plain language of that definition does not comport with the class plaintiffs seek to certify.as we have noted,before moving for certification plaintiffs had included not only blacks who had purchased dual rate or dual plan policies,but also blacks who allegedly were forced into substandard plans,or forced to pay substandard rates,through the use of underwriting factors.
in their motion for certification,plaintiffs narrowed the class,stating that t he proposed class does not include those who may have been subjected to covert forms of racial discrimination.plaintiffs specified that the term substandard applies to overt dual premiums and plans,not to policies called substandard because of other factors such as underwriting.
we agree with defendants observation that,as written,the class definition includes all blacks who paid substandard rates or were issued substandard plans.the definition makes no distinction between class members who purchased dual rate or dual plan policies and those forced into substandard rates or substandard plans through the use of pretextual underwriting practices.in other words,one must look to the certification motion for an adequate description of the proposed class.
holding plaintiffs to the plain language of the class definition would be overly formalistic.in the first place,the district court,in denying certification,apparently did not consider the pretextual claims as part of the proposed class.though referring to the mass of policies involved and the differing underwriting practices among some companies,the court stated that in calculating damages,individualized hearings were necessary to account for the idiosyncracies of each policy.at no point did the court suggest that individualized hearings were necessary to determine liability,as would be necessary if pretextual underwriting claims were part of the class.
second,holding plaintiffs to the plain language of their definition would ignore the ongoing refinement and inherent in class action litigation,particularly in the formation of a workable class definition.district courts are permitted to limit or modify class definitions to provide the necessary precision if the class is certified on remand,we trust that the plaintiffs or district court will amend the definition accordingly.
defendants also argue that the definition terms own,or owned,industrial life insurance policy,substandard plan,and substandard rate are ambiguous,further complicating identification of class members.this argument,too,is overly formalistic.see forbush,at.
plaintiffs filings in the district court clarified any ambiguities by stating that the class is limited to industrial policies sold at a substandard,higher rate for and a lower rate for caucasians,or as a substandard plan,a more costly plan for and a corresponding less expensive plan for caucasians.plaintiffs define industrial life insurance policies as policies labeled as industrial or those policies with a face amount of less than and weekly or monthly home premium collection.defendants were provided adequate notice and discovery by which to argue that the narrowed class can not be certified pursuant to rule b.
we review for abuse of discretion the denial of class certification.jenkins raymark,cir.implicit in this deferential standard is a recognition of the essentially factual basis of the certification inquiry and of the district court inherent power to manage and control pending litigation.allison,at.we review de novo however,the question whether the district court applied the correct legal standard.forbush,at.
all classes must satisfy the four baseline requirements of rule a numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation.a.assuming these requirements are satisfied,a rule b class may be certified if the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class,thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.b.plaintiffs premise rule b certification on their request for an injunction prohibiting the further collection of discriminatory premiums.
the court observed that many proposed class whose policies have lapsed,those whose policies have already been voluntarily adjusted by defendants,and those whose death benefits already have been not benefit from injunctive relief.the court concluded that this is a case in which individuality overrides any bland,and money becomes the prime goal not injunctive relief.rule b certification is improper,the court held,where the class request for injunctive relief merely serves as a bootstrap for a claim of monetary damages.
in allison,we carefully explained the statement in the advisory committee notes that rule b certification does not extend to cases in which the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or predominantly to money damages.advisory committee notes emphasis added allison did not hold,as the district court believed,that monetary relief predominates where it is the prime goal or a mere bootstrap to injunctive relief.instead,determining whether one form of relief actually predominates in some quantifiable sense is a wasteful and impossible task that should be avoided.allison,at citing charles wright et,federal practice and procedure,at ed.in other words,certification does not hinge on the subjective intentions of the class representatives and their counsel in bringing suit 
instead,allison looked to the nature of the rule b device in defining when monetary relief predominates.that rule focus on injunctive and declaratory relief presumes a class best described as a homogenous and cohesive group with few conflicting interests among its members.id.at.class certification centers on the defendants alleged unlawful conduct,not on individual injury.once monetary damages enter the picture,however,class cohesiveness is generally lost,because m onetary remedies are more often related directly to the disparate merits of individual claims.id.citations omitted.where the need to address the merits of individual claims requires separate hearings,the efficiency gained by class litigation is lost.
in allison,therefore,we held,id.at,that monetary relief,to be viable in a rule b class,must flow directly from liability to the class as a whole on the claims forming the basis of the injunctive or declaratory relief.monetary relief must be incidental,meaning that it is capable of computation by means of objective standards and not dependent in any significant way on the intangible,subjective differences of each class member circumstances.id.additional hearings to resolve the disparate merits of each individual case should be unnecessary.id.
of course,certification under rule b is appropriate only if members of the proposed class would benefit from the injunctive relief they request.the question whether the proposed class members are properly seeking such relief is antecedent to the question whether that relief would predominate over money damages.
in bolin sears roebuck,cir,we considered a proposed rule b class of one million consumers who claimed to seek injunctive relief,alleging that defendant had employed various unlawful practices to coerce payment of debt.before applying the allison predominance test,however,we observed that m ost of the class consists of individuals who do not face further harm from sear sic actions.id.at.because only a negligible proportion of proposed class members were properly seeking injunctive relief,we held that rule b certification was inappropriate.
here,by contrast,defendants and plaintiffs experts estimate that between one million and million of million issued policies remain.although the exact number of class members continuing to pay discriminatory premiums is unknown,the proportion is sufficient,absent contrary evidence from defendants,that the class as a whole is deemed properly to be seeking injunctive relief.
bolin reflects a concern that plaintiffs may attempt to shoehorn damages actions into the rule b framework,depriving class members of notice and protections.indeed,we suggested in allison,at,that monetary relief may predominate when its presence in the litigation suggests that the procedural safeguards of notice and are necessary.defendants seize on this point,arguing that plaintiffs request for notice and is a tacit admission that rule b certification is inappropriate.this ignores the discretion given a district court to order notice and rights when certifying a rule b class.see.d.
as fundamental requisites of the constitutional guarantees of procedural due process,eisen carlisle jacquelin,d,notice and are mandatory for damage classes certified under rule b.though rule does not explicitly extend these safeguards to rule b classes,due process requires the provision of notice where a rule b class seeks monetary damages 
on the other hand,there is no absolute right of in a rule b class,even where monetary relief is sought and made available.penson,at kincade tire rubber,cir.under our precedent,should the class be certified on remand,class members must be provided adequate notice,and the district court should consider the possibility of rights 
allison statement that monetary relief may predominate where notice and are necessary reflects only the inescapable fact that such safeguards are most appropriate where individual issues diminish class cohesiveness.then,conflicts among class members and issues of adequate representation are most likely to surface.rule b is the default vehicle for certification,but only because notice and rights are mandatory components.a district court is empowered by rule d to provide notice and for any class action,so rule b certification should not be denied on the mistaken assumption that a rule b class is the only means by which to protect class members 
all of this further demonstrates the futility of the district court and dissent inquiry as to whether the prime goal of the class is injunctive or monetary relief.the rule b predominance requirement,by focusing on uniform relief flowing from defendants liability,serves essentially the same functions as the procedural safeguards and efficiency and manageability standards mandated in b class actions.allison,at.therefore,to deny certification on the basis that the damage claims would be better brought as a rule b class serves no function other than to elevate form over substance indeed,interests of judicial economy are best served by resolving plaintiffs claims for injunctive and monetary relief together.
applying allison predominance test,the district court determined that the requested monetary relief does not flow from liability to the class as a whole.the court stated that many and a variety of hearings would be required to determined personalized harm to each individual plaintiff because of the mass of policies involved,differing underwriting practices among some companies,differing benefits,account dividends,and age at policy issuance.
plaintiffs contend they seek equitable restitution in the form of a constructive trust for class members who no longer have policies.by characterizing this relief as equitable,plaintiffs hope to demonstrate that that relief is inherently compatible with rule b certification,thereby avoiding allison monetary predominance inquiry.defendants argue that plaintiffs,who never used the term constructive trust in the district court,are trying to their straightforward request for damages.
equitable monetary relief is compatible with a rule b class importantly,this pronouncement has been limited to the context of title vii backpay,a remedy designated by statute as equitable.g life annuity ins.knudson,d.backpay is therefore unique in that it is an integral component of title vii make whole remedial scheme.allison,at see also johnson.highway express,cir.not coincidentally,as compared to compensatory damages,calculation of back pay generally involves less complicated factual determinations and fewer individual issues.coleman motors acceptance,cir.in allison,at,we recognized that,for this reason,backpay generally does not predominate over injunctive or declaratory relief.
it would be mistaken to presume that because remedy readily calculable on a classwide compatible with a rule b class,any other remedy designated as equitable may automatically piggyback a claim for injunctive relief.to be sure,equitable monetary remedies are less likely to predominate over a class claim for injunctive relief,but this has more to do with the uniform character of the relief rather than with its label.therefore,rather than decide whether plaintiffs claim for restitution is legal or equitable in nature,we apply allison and examine whether the claim predominates over the request for injunctive relief.
this is not a case in which class members are entitled to a refund assuming liability is established,individual damages will depend on the idiosyncracies of the particular dual rate or dual plan policy.for example,the age at which a class member purchased a dual rate policy will have an impact on how long the insured paid premiums and consequently on the amount of damages.some policies contain benefits covering occurrences outside of death,such as loss of limb others pay periodic dividends.as we have observed,some defendants,beginning in,voluntarily adjusted premiums and benefits for some policies sold on a basis.
plaintiffs propose using standardized formulas or restitution grids to calculate individual class members damages.defendants counter that thousands of grids must be constructed to account for the myriad of policy variations.that may be so,but the monetary predominance test does not contain a exception.rather,we are guided by its command that damage calculation should neither introduce new and substantial legal or factual issues,nor entail complex individualized determinations.allison,at.
in the list of policy variables cited by defendants and the district court,none requires the gathering of subjective evidence this is not,for example,like allison,a title vii case in which class members claims for compensatory and punitive damages necessarily implicate the subjective differences of each plaintiff circumstances.id.at.rather,assuming that unlawful discrimination is found,class members automatically will be entitled to the difference between what a black and a white paid for the same policy.not coincidentally,such damages flow from liability in much the same manner that an award of backpay results from a finding of employment discrimination.pettway,at.
we are well aware that,as allison qualifies,at,the calculation of monetary damages should not entail complex individualized determinations.although it is arguable that the construction of thousands of restitution grids,though based on objective data,involves the sort of complex data manipulations forbidden by allison,we read allison to the contrary.the policy variables are identifiable on a classwide basis and,when sorted,are capable of determining damages for individual policyowners none of these variables is unique to particular plaintiffs the prevalence of variables common to the class makes damage computation virtually a mechanical task.alabama blue bird body,cir quoting windham am.brands,cir 
finally,defendants records contain the information necessary to determine disparities between,on the one hand,dual rate and dual plan policies,and on the other hand,plans sold to whites.damage calculations do not require the manipulation of data kept outside defendants normal course of business.defendants complaints to the contrary are belied by the fact that,since,many policies have been adjusted to account for racial disparity.
as noted,defendants have not sold dual plan or dual rate policies since the some class members purchased their policies as far back as the.the district court denied certification also on the basis that individualized hearings are necessary to determine expiration of the statute of limitations for particular sets of policies.the predominance of individual issues necessary to decide an affirmative defense may preclude class certification.castano,at.limitations is an affirmative defense.c james moore et,moore federal practice,at ed.
although,under and,state law governs the substantive limitations period,federal law determines when the period accrues.perez laredo junior,cir.it commences when the plaintiff either has actual knowledge of the violation or has knowledge of facts that,in the exercise of due diligence,would have led to actual knowledge state law may further toll the running of limitations.gartrell gaylor,cir.
doubtless most class members,the majority of whom are poor and uneducated,remain unaware of defendants discriminatory practices.of the thirteen representative plaintiffs,defendants point to only one,jo ella brown,whose claim may have expired because of actual knowledge of defendants practices.
to hold that each class member must be deposed as to precisely when,if at all,he learned of defendants practices would be tantamount to adopting a per se rule that civil rights cases involving deception or concealment can not be certified outside a two or period waste mgmt.holdings,cir.such a result would foreclose use of the class action device for a broad subset of claims,a result inconsistent with the efficiency aims of rule.though individual class members whose claims are shown to fall outside the relevant statute of limitations are barred from recovery,this does not establish that individual issues predominate,particularly in the face of defendants common scheme of fraudulent concealment.
instead,defendants rely on a theory of constructive notice,arguing that widespread media reporting of the issue over the last several decades should have excite d the inquiry of a reasonable person.conmar mitsui,cir.where events receive widespread publicity,plaintiffs may be charged with knowledge of their occurrence.united klans of am.mcgovern,cir in re beef antitrust indus,cir.the district court believed constructive notice to be an individual issue,or at least a regional one,stating that whether a plaintiff in michigan,as compared to a plaintiff in louisiana,had constructive notice,is a fact issue which needs to be determined individually and not on a basis.
whether the media reports were sufficiently publicized so as to provide constructive notice is an issue reserved for the merits.our analysis is limited to whether this issue is determinable on a classwide basis.had defendants provided even media treatment of this issue was more prevalent in some regions of the country than in others,the district court observation that individualized hearings are required to determine the geographic reach of constructive notice might be sustainable.
the requirement of widespread publicity,mcgovern,at,suggests,however,that the appropriate frame of reference is the national media market,at least for issues of national importance.several publications listed by defendants,including the washington post,the wall street journal,and usa today,are available throughout the united states,and although many other publications are local newspapers,that fact is entirely consistent with national treatment of the issue.neither the district court nor defendants give good reason for geographically splicing constructive notice.we therefore have no difficulty concluding that whether plaintiffs wer
