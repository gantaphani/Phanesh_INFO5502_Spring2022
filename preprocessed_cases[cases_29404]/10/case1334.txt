nine oklahoma foster children named plaintiffs,acting through their next friends,filed suit under against members of the oklahoma commission for human services and the director of the oklahoma department of human services okdhs in their official capacities,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.the oklahoma commission for human services is the body responsible for formulating the policies and adopting the rules and regulations for the administration of the okdhs.in their complaint,named plaintiffs sought certification of a class of all children who are or will be in the legal custody of okdhs due to a report or suspicion of abuse or neglect or who are or will be adjudicated deprived due to abuse or children.named plaintiffs allege okdhs foster care policies and practices expose all class members to an impermissible risk of harm,violating their fourteenth amendment right to substantive due process,their fifth and fourteenth amendment rights to procedural due process,and their liberty and privacy interests guaranteed by the first,ninth and fourteenth amendments.specifically,named plaintiffs assert okdhs deficiencies include failing to protect class members from abuse and neglect while in okdhs custody failing to protect class members from abuse or neglect by their biological parents while in okdhs custody assigning excessive caseloads to its child welfare caseworkers and supervisors engaging in dangerous monitoring and oversight practices placing class members in unsafe and overcrowded emergency shelters placing class members in unsafe foster homes as a result of failing to develop sufficient numbers of safe placements maintaining policies and practices that deny class members opportunities to develop critical family relationships and maintaining policies and practices that subject class members to harmful moves among multiple inappropriate homes and facilities.
when named plaintiffs filed their complaint seeking class certification in february,the parties did not have the benefit of our decisions in shook board of county commissioners,cir shook ii,and vallario vandehey,cir,which explain the proper standards for class certification when plaintiffs seek injunctive relief.in light of shook ii,the district court allowed named plaintiffs to supplement their motion for class certification by submitting a statement of relief sought and then ordered both parties to submit briefs addressing whether a class action seeking the relief requested by named plaintiffs would satisfy the requirements of federal rules of civil procedure a,b,and d as explained in shook ii.
after reviewing named plaintiffs nine alleged common questions of fact,five alleged common questions of law,and seven requested remedies,as well as both parties supplemental briefs,the district court certified the proposed class.the district court found the proposed class met rule a numerosity requirement and rule a adequacy of class representation requirement.neither party disputes the class meets those requirements.the district court also explained in a thorough and careful order that at least one question of fact and one question of law were common to the class,satisfying rule a commonality requirement.based on the evidence submitted by the parties,the district court concluded w hether ok dhs has a policy or practice of failing to adequately monitor the safety of class members causing significant harm and risk of harm to their safety,health and wellbeing presents an issue of fact common to the entire class.according to the court,this common question of fact raised one common issue of law w hether ok dhs policies or practices violate class members right to be reasonably free from harm and imminent risk of harm while in state custody.the court then concluded because named plaintiffs claims are typical of the class claims and named plaintiffs claims are not significantly antagonistic to the class,the class satisfied rule a typicality requirement.finally,the court determined at least two of named plaintiffs proposed remedies an injunction setting limits on the caseloads of caseworkers and their supervisors assigned to the class based on council on accreditation coa and child welfare league of america cwla standards and an injunction requiring caseworkers to visit all children in okdhs custody as frequently as set forth under coa and cwla rule b and d requirements as explained in shook ii.
we granted defendants timely request for permission to file an interlocutory appeal of the district court order granting class certification.defendants argue the district court abused its discretion by erroneously finding the proposed class satisfied rule a commonality and typicality requirements.they also assert the district court erred in concluding the proposed class satisfied rule b generally applicable and cohesiveness requirements.exercising jurisdiction under e and.f,we find no abuse of discretion and affirm the district court order.
we review the standard the district court used in making its rule determination de novo and the merits of that determination for an abuse of discretion.vallario vandehey,cir see also shook el paso county,cir shook i.recognizing the considerable discretion the district court enjoys in this area,we defer to the district court certification ruling if it applies the proper rule standard and its decision falls within the bounds of rationally available choices given the facts and law involved in the matter at hand.vallario,at.we reverse for an abuse of discretion when the district court bases its decision on either a clearly erroneous finding of fact or conclusion of law or by manifesting a clear error of judgment.id.
in determining the propriety of a class action,the question is not whether the plaintiff or plaintiffs have stated a cause of action or will prevail on the merits,but rather whether the requirements of rule are met.shook i,at quoting anderson city of albuquerque,cir.a district court may certify a class if the proposed class satisfies the requirements of rule a and the requirements of one of the types of classes in rule b.the party seeking class certification bears the burden of proving rule requirements are satisfied.shook i,at.in deciding whether the proposed class meets these requirements,the district court must accept the substantive allegations of the complaint as true,though it need not blindly rely on conclusory allegations of the complaint which parrot rule and may consider the legal and factual issues presented by plaintiff complaints.id.quoting ex rel.hart valdez,cir see also vallario,at.while the court should not pass judgment on the merits of the case at the class certification stage,it must conduct its own rigorous analysis,to ensure rule requirements are met.vallario,at quoting shook i,at see also shook ii,at.
rule a requires numerosity of class members,commonality of at least one question of fact or law among the class,typicality of named plaintiffs claims or defenses to the class claims or defenses,and adequacy of the named plaintiffs and their attorneys as class representatives.a.on appeal,defendants only challenge the district court rule a findings as to commonality and typicality.a finding of commonality requires only a single question of law or fact common to the entire class,at.mere allegations of systemic violations of the law,however,will not automatically satisfy rule a commonality requirement a discrete legal or factual question common to the class must exist.id.e very member of the class need not be in a situation identical to that of the named plaintiff to meet rule a commonality or typicality requirements.milonas williams,cir citing rich martin marietta,cir.factual differences between class members claims do not defeat certification where common questions of law exist.id.citing penn san juan hospital,cir.
defendants assert none of named plaintiffs questions of law or fact are common to all class members by stressing that each of the approximately children in okdhs custody receives an individualized and specific placement,treatment,and service plan that necessarily changes based on evolving circumstances and the unique characteristics of each child.defendants,as a result,maintain that determining whether okdhs has inadequate monitoring policies requires an individualized determination for each foster child.they also argue that named plaintiffs have not met their burden of proving that every class member is simultaneously subject to an imminent risk of serious harm as a result of okdhs controverted policies and practices.defendants assert that the very statistics named plaintiffs of oklahoma foster children in reported abuse or neglect,for named plaintiffs have not met this burden.they reason b ecause of foster children did not suffer injury or neglect,and because not all putative class members are under an imminent threat of serious harm,the district court findings were clearly erroneous.
defendants also argue for the first time that named plaintiffs proposed class definition is overly broad because it includes children who are not under an actual or imminent threat of harm,thereby defeating commonality and typicality.we,of course,generally will not consider new arguments on appeal.see bencorp financial,cir explaining that we will not consider a new theory on appeal,even one that falls under the same general category as an argument presented at trial.but to the extent that defendants overly broad argument relies on their argument,which they did assert below,that named plaintiffs must prove every class member is under a threat of harm to satisfy rule a requirements of commonality and typicality,we address it here.
named plaintiffs allege okdhs caseworkers routinely fail to comply with its own policy of requiring caseworkers to visit children in the foster care program at least once per month to monitor children safety and placement.they presented evidence to the district court that for the last five years oklahoma has placed among the three worst states in the nation for the abuse or neglect of children in foster care.they also assert a report by the oklahoma commission on children and youth found that of the foster homes it reviewed had serious safety issues and should never have been approved for placement by okdhs in the first place.named plaintiffs maintain this and other similar evidence reveal okdhs has a practice of failing to adequately monitor the safety of class members,exposing all of them to an unreasonable risk of harm.
in its ruling,the district court acknowledged the considerable diversity of the class named plaintiffs seek to children range in age from infants to teenagers,enter the system for many different reasons,may be placed in different kinds of placements,and have varying needs and goals.nevertheless,the district court found at least one common issue of fact as to w hether ok dhs has a policy or practice of failing to adequately monitor the safety of plaintiff children causing significant harm and risk of harm to their safety,health and wellbeing.the district court explained that,based on the evidence submitted,whether okdhs policies or practices inflict harm or a risk of harm presents a question of fact common to all children in the proposed class but expressly noted it was not making any finding that these children are all subjected to harm as a result of ok dhs monitoring practices.similarly,the district court did not state it found okdhs policies or practices actually subjected all class members to a risk of harm.the court simply found that the issue of whether okdhs monitoring practices compromise the safety of foster children is an issue common to the entire proposed class,regardless of their unique factual circumstances.based on the same rationale,the district court found at least one common issue of law regarding whether the alleged policies or practices violate plaintiffs substantive due process right to be reasonably free from harm and imminent risk of harm while in state custody.citing yvonne new mexico dep t of human,cir explaining that children in state custody have a constitutional right to be reasonably safe from harm.
accepting named plaintiffs allegations as true,as we must,we find the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding an issue of fact and law common to the class.named plaintiffs presented more than conclusory statements that okdhs monitoring policies and practices,or lack thereof,create a risk of harm shared by the entire class all class members,by virtue of being in okdhs foster care,are subject to the purportedly faulty monitoring policies of okdhs,regardless of their individual differences therefore,all members of the class are allegedly exposed to the same unreasonable risk of harm as a result of defendants unlawful practices.though each class member may not have actually suffered abuse,neglect,or the risk of such harm,defendants conduct allegedly poses a risk of impermissible harm to all children in okdhs custody.thus,we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the requirement of commonality satisfied.
defendants discussion of milonas williams,cir is unavailing.in milonas,we affirmed the certification of a class of all juveniles committed to a utah correctional school in a lawsuit which alleged that regardless of their individual differences all of the boys at the school were in danger of being subjected to the institution illegal practices.id.at.we,therefore,concluded the typicality and commonality requirements of rule a had been met.id.the shared risk of being subjected to the purportedly unconstitutional practices justified certification.we did not require the named plaintiffs in milonas to prove either every class member had actually been subjected to the controverted practices or every class member had actually suffered harm as a result of the practices.similarly,in this case,every class member,by virtue of being in okdhs custody,is subject to okdhs monitoring practices or lack thereof and,therefore,the issue of whether the monitoring practices compromise the safety of foster children is an issue common to the entire proposed class.
defendants reliance on ex rel.hart valdez,cir,is also unpersuasive.in,we held the district court had not abused its discretion in denying class certification.the named plaintiffs in alleged multiple state agencies violated their rights whereas,here named plaintiffs only allege one state agency and its policies violated their rights.second,the class of plaintiffs in was far broader.the proposed class consisted of all children,custodial and those at risk of being taken into state custody,who had any form of developmental or mental disability.we,therefore,concluded o ther than being disabled in some way and having some sort of contact with the state child welfare system,no common factual link joins the suggested class.id.at.in contrast,named plaintiffs in this case propose a class of only those foster children in the custody of okdhs by reason of abuse or neglect.unlike the class members denied certification in,all class members now before us are in the custody of one the same or all are subject to okdhs monitoring policies,which allegedly subject them to a constitutionally unreasonable risk of harm.
despite defendants repeated suggestions otherwise,at the class certification stage named plaintiffs do not bear the burden of proving the veracity of their complaint allegations.defendants contention that rule a commonality and typicality requirements demand that named plaintiffs prove all class members were inadequately monitored or are actually exposed to an imminent threat of harm as a result of deficient monitoring conflates the requirements for standing,prospective injunctive relief,and class certification.first,only named plaintiffs in a class action seeking prospective injunctive relief must demonstrate standing by establishing they are suffering a continuing injury or are under an imminent threat of being injured in the future.see warth seldin,d petitioners must allege and show that they personally have been injured,not that injury has been suffered by other,unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent.tandy city of wichita,cir to seek prospective relief,the plaintiff must be suffering a conti
