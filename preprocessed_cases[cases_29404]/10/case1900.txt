plaintiff,willie hadley,an inmate at big muddy river correctional center,filed a class action complaint in the circuit court of sangamon county,seeking to enjoin defendant,the illinois department of corrections doc or the department,from charging him and other allegedly indigent inmates a for nonemergency medical and dental services.see ilcs f west.the circuit court granted doc section motion to dismiss.ilcs west.a divided appellate court reversed and remanded the cause for further proceedings.d.we allowed doc petition for leave to appeal.
for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the judgment of the appellate court.
background 
according to the allegations of the complaint,plaintiff has been incarcerated since his arrest in and is serving an indeterminate sentence of to years.plaintiff claimed that during the period beginning in february,doc charged his inmate trust fund account a total of in for nonemergency medical and dental services.plaintiff claimed that such charges ran afoul of section f of the unified code of corrections,under which an indigent inmate is exempt from the ilcs f west.more specifically,plaintiff alleged that doc implemented a policy,through its administrative directives,of deducting the statutory from an inmate trust fund account irrespective of whether funds were available,and requiring inmates who requested nonemergency medical or dental services to first sign a request for payment form authorizing doc to deduct the from present or future funds in the inmate account.in addition to violating the statute,plaintiff argued,this policy thrust indigent inmates into further debt.plaintiff noted that he had filed an institutional grievance challenging doc practice,which was denied.through his complaint,plaintiff sought to enjoin doc from forcing indigent inmates to sign the form prior to receiving nonemergency medical and dental services.
doc filed a section motion to dismiss the complaint.ilcs west.doc argued that section f,when read in its entirety,states that an indigent inmate must be treated the same as a solvent inmate,and is thus exempt from the requirement to pay the before receiving treatment,but that the statute does not forever relieve the inmate of his requirement to pay.emphasis in original.according to doc 
treatment will not be withheld,nor will an inmate be treated differently,because the inmate is a pauper however,the inmate will be expected to pay the required amount when and if he is financially able to do so.plaintiff has not alleged,and indeed can not claim,that he is certain to remain indigent for the entire period of his incarceration.if his financial circumstances change and he is at some point capable of remitting the he has accrued,he will be required to do so.in the event that plaintiff remains indigent and is released with a negative balance on his trust fund account,that indebtedness will not follow him into the free world.
in response,plaintiff argued that section f nowhere states that an indigent inmate is required to pay the once the inmate becomes solvent.plaintiff relied on the plain and ordinary meaning of the word exempt.the circuit court granted doc motion and dismissed the complaint.plaintiff appealed.
the appellate court,with one justice dissenting,reversed the circuit court and remanded the cause for further proceedings.d.the appellate court concluded that doc regulatory scheme was inconsistent with the statutory language.specifically,the appellate court held that doc special definition of indigent,which considers the inmate ability to remit the during the entire term of his or her incarceration.g,and doc practice of restricting future funds in the inmate account.g,conflicted with the plain language of the statute and the ordinary definitions of indigent and exempt.d at.the appellate court concluded that section f gave plaintiff a clear right to an exemption from the if,at the time he sought nonemergency medical or dental services,he lacked the means to pay it.d at.based on plaintiff allegation that doc charged the to his inmate trust account even though he had no funds or assets,thus putting his account balance in negative territory,the appellate court found that plaintiff has alleged the first of the three conditions for granting an injunction a certain and clearly ascertainable right that needs protection.d at.the appellate court also found that plaintiff adequately pleaded the two remaining conditions for injunctive injury and lack of an adequate remedy at that the circuit court erred in dismissing plaintiff complaint the appellate court thus reversed and remanded the matter to the circuit court for further proceedings.d at.we allowed doc petition for leave to appeal.
the present appeal arises from the grant of a section motion to dismiss,a matter subject to de novo review.city of chicago beretta.whether plaintiff complaint was properly dismissed turns on whether plaintiff sufficiently alleged a certain and clearly ascertainable right that needs protection.d at.this,in turn,depends upon an issue of statutory interpretation,namely,whether doc definition of what it means to be an indigent inmate,and its related rules,appropriately implement section f of the unified code of corrections or,as the appellate court held,conflicts with that statute.on this issue of law our review also proceeds de novo.taddeo board of trustees of the illinois municipal retirement fund,jarvis south oak dodge.

with these principles in mind,we consider the statute at issue and doc interpretation thereof.
section of the unified code of corrections requires doc to establish accounting records with accounts for each person who has or receives money while in an institution or facility of the department and to allow the withdrawal and disbursement of money by the person under rules and regulations of the department.ilcs west.subject to doc regulations,an inmate may receive funds for deposit into his or her account from outside sources or through employment with doc.see.describing restrictions on funds received for deposit into a committed person account ilcs west describing the types of employment potentially available to committed persons through doc ilcs west authorizing compensation to persons performing a work assignment under rules established by doc.an inmate may use the funds in his or her account to make purchases,primarily through the prison commissary,of tobacco products and other approved items.see ilcs a west setting maximum prices for tobacco and nontobacco commissary items.items sold in the committed persons commissary shall be shown on an approved listing of standard commissary items beahringer page,noting that the plaintiff inmate purchased approved art supplies from commissaries in the several doc facilities where he had been housed.
in addition to the deductions doc makes to an inmate account for commissary purchases,section f requires doc to deduct a for certain medical and dental services.section f states in relevant part 
the department shall require the committed person receiving medical or dental services on a basis to pay a to the department for each visit for medical or dental services.the amount of each shall be deducted from the committed person individual account.a committed person who has a chronic illness,as defined by department rules and regulations,shall be exempt from the for treatment of the chronic illness.a committed person shall not be subject to a for visits ordered by a physician,who is employed by,or contracts with,the department.a committed person who is indigent is exempt from the and is entitled to receive medical or dental services on the same basis as a committed person who is financially able to afford the.notwithstanding any other provision in this subsection f to the contrary,any person committed to any facility operated by the juvenile division,as set forth in subsection b of section of this code,is exempt from the requirement for the duration of confinement in those facilities.emphasis added.ilcs f west.
to implement the provisions of section f,doc adopted certain administrative rules which provide,in pertinent part,as follows 
section medical and dental examinations and treatment 
g adult offenders who require medical or dental services shall authorize the department to deduct a from present or future funds in his or her trust fund account prior to each visit.services do not include any visits determined necessary by a department physician.
the shall be paid from the offender trust fund when the services are delivered.
offenders who are without funds at the time services are delivered shall not be denied medical or dental services.the offender trust fund account shall be restricted for the amount of and shall be paid upon receipt of future funds.
an offender who is found to be indigent shall be exempt from the.an offender shall be considered indigent if during the entire term of his or her incarceration the offender is without funds to pay the.
under doc rules,an inmate account is debited for the against current funds or future funds.thus,even if an inmate account has no funds or insufficient funds at the time nonemergency medical or dental services are rendered,the account is debited,resulting in a negative balance.the inmate account is restricted and the inmate remains liable for the,and any successive,for the entire term of his or her incarceration,be it a matter of weeks,months,or even decades.only at discharge can an inmate become eligible for the indigence exemption.the appellate court could not square doc regulatory scheme with the statutory language 
just as a matter of pure logic,it is impossible to both charge the to an inmate account and exempt the inmate from the.one must choose one course of action or the other.the only reasonable interpretation of section f is that doc shall deduct the from the inmate account unless the inmate is indigent,in which case doc shall exempt the inmate from the.d at.
doc argues that the appellate court erred in rejecting doc reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute,and that the legislative history supports doc interpretation.plaintiff responds that the statute is unambiguous,but even if an ambiguity is found,the legislative history does not provide clarity.our analysis begins,as it must,with the statutory language.see wauconda fire protection district stonewall orchards,llp.
the statute provides that a committed person who is indigent is exempt from the.emphasis added.ilcs f west.the term indigent is not expressly defined in the statute,but is ordinarily understood to mean being poor usu ually without being destitute impoverished,needy.webster third new international dictionary.though relevant,the dictionary definition of indigent does not explain what it means to be an indigent committed person for purposes of the statutory.
some insight into the legislature intent can be gleaned from other words and phrases appearing in the same sentence of the statute.that sentence reads in its entirety a committed person who is indigent is exempt from the and is entitled to receive medical or dental services on the same basis as a committed person who is financially able to afford the.emphasis added.ilcs f west.the statute thus recognizes two groups of inmates those who are indigent,and those who are financially able to afford the.accordingly,a committed person who is indigent must be a committed person who is not financially able to afford the.what this means in practice is not clear from the statutory language.for example,should an inmate financial ability to afford the be judged solely by his account balance on the day he or she requests nonemergency medical or dental services,or should some other measure of financial ability be used i n terms of dollars or net worth,how destitute must an inmate be to qualify as indigent within the meaning of section f the legislature does not say.d at.thus,an ambiguity or gap exists in the statute.
we agree with the appellate court that,by implication,the legislature has delegated to doc the authority to fill this gap.d at,see also church,at,recognizing that the legislature may implicitly delegate to an agency the authority to clarify and define a specific statutory provision.accordingly,doc interpretation of what it means to be an indigent inmate,if reasonable,is entitled to deference by this court.see church,at.conversely,to the extent doc interpretation is contrary to the statute,that interpretation is not binding on this court and will be rejected.see people ex rel.birkett,at,illinois consolidated telephone,at.as discussed below,we conclude that doc interpretation of section f conflicts with the statutory language.
the definition of indigent adopted by doc reads in relevant part an offender shall be considered indigent if the offender is without funds to pay the.g.this portion of the definition mirrors the statutory language which focuses on whether the inmate is financially able to afford the.ilcs f west.doc definition,however,adds another element an offender shall be considered indigent if during the entire term of his or her incarceration the offender is without funds to pay the.emphasis added.g.this definition of indigent,together with doc rule that an inmate must authorize doc to deduct the from present or future funds,means that an inmate is always charged the,irrespective of the inmate financial ability to pay.only at discharge can an inmate be deemed indigent for purposes of the exemption,at which point any outstanding are,to use doc phrasing,written off.
doc regulatory scheme is problematic for several reasons.first,doc rules effectively exclude inmates serving life sentences from the reach of the statutory exemption.this is so because under doc definition of indigent,no action is taken on the statutory exemption until discharge from the day that will never arrive for this group of inmates.section f,however,contains no exception from the indigence exemption for inmates serving life sentences.the same is true of inmates who have been sentenced to death.an agency can not,through its rulemaking,limit the scope of the statute.van material department of revenue.
second,and more fundamentally,doc rules fail to implement the statutory exemption for any group of inmates.the statute mandates that a committed person who is indigent is exempt from the.emphasis added.ilcs f west.exempt means free or released from some liability to which others are subject excepted from the operation of some law or obligation not subject to.webster third new international dictionary.thus,pursuant to the plain language of section f,a committed person who is indigent,who is not financially able to afford the is released from liability for the is excepted from the operation of the is not subject to the.under doc rules,however,every inmate is subject to and liable for the each and every time nonemergency medical and dental services are provided,irrespective of the inmate ability to afford the.indeed,the inmate account is restricted for the amount of the.g.if all inmates are always subject to the,then no inmate is ever not subject to the and no exemption exists.
the fact that doc writes off accrued at the time an inmate is discharged is not tantamount to exempting the inmate from the in the first place.to reiterate to be exempt from the means that the inmate is excepted from the operation of the.webster third new international dictionary.an inmate who is charged the and remains liable for the has not been excepted from the operation of the.
the conflict between the statutory language and doc peculiar definition of indigent is exemplified in doc section motion.in its motion,doc made plain its position that even if it recognized that an inmate was indigent,or a pauper,or insolvent,the inmate account will be debited for the and the inmate will be expected to pay the required amount when and if he is financially able to do so.under the statute,however,an inmate indigence is the very condition that triggers application of the exemption.as the appellate court aptly observed 
the statute speaks of a present,not a future,state of affairs is indigent and is exempt it speaks of the inmate financial condition at a particular point in time,when the inmate is to receive medical or dental services.emphases added.ilcs f west.the statute does not say a committed person who remains indigent throughout the term of his or her imprisonment shall be exempt from the.the statute does not say that inmates shall pay the to quote the state brief if and when they later have the means to do so.emphasis in original.d at.
doc argues that its regulatory scheme appropriately implements section f.according to doc,inmates who have immediate funds meet their statutory duty to pay the.those who can not make immediate payment are exempt from payment for as long as they are without funds,but are given the same nonemergency medical and dental services as those who are financially able to afford the.
doc argument,that it applies an exemption from immediate payment,is contrary to its own rules.as discussed above,under doc rules an indigence finding can only be made,and the exemption can only be applied,after the person has completed the entire term of his or her incarceration.g.even if doc rules could be read as providing an exemption from immediate payment,the statute does not authorize such an exemption.the statute plainly mandates that if the inmate is indigent,the inmate is.
doc also argues that the indigence exemption must be examined in light of the other statutory exemptions,particularly the exemption for juveniles,and that when so examined,the reasonableness of its rules is apparent.
the statute,as set forth in full above,contains four exemptions from the for nonemergency medical and dental services a committed person who has a chronic illness shall be exempt from the for treatment of the chronic illness a committed person shall not be subject to a for visits ordered by a department physician a committed person who is indigent is exempt from the and any person committed to any facility operated by the juvenile division is exempt from the requirement for the duration of confinement in those facilities.ilcs f west.
doc maintains that the first two exemptions are triggered by the type of treatment chronic illness or a that there is no disagreement here that the general assembly intended prisoners receiving such treatments never to be required to make a.doc further maintains that the last two exemptions are triggered by the type of indigent adult inmate and a that the language of the two exemptions establishes that the legislature intended a distinction to be drawn between the two types of prisoners.according to doc,juveniles housed in doc juvenile facilities are entitled to an exemption from the for the duration of confinement ilcs f west,but in the absence of similar statutory language applicable to indigent adult inmates,such adult inmates are not exempt for the duration of confinement.
doc argument erroneously assumes that if an inmate is found to be indigent at any point during his or her incarceration,that finding must remain with the inmate for the duration of his or her confinement.the language in section f does not support doc argument.we note,too,that the appellate court did not so hold,and that plaintiff does not argue that the statute authorizes some sort of permanent indigence exemption.
although doc attempts to distinguish the indigence exemption from the other three exemptions,we find nothing in the language of the statute that supports doc practice of considering an inmate financial ability to afford the at discharge,rather than at or near the time nonemergency medical or dental services are rendered.we note that where an inmate pursues nonemergency treatment for a chronic condition or a visit ordered by a department physician,doc understands that the general assembly intended prisoners receiving such treatments never to be required to make a.similarly,where a juvenile who is housed in a juvenile facility requests nonemergency medical or dental services,the juvenile is not required to make a.doc,however,departs from this practice when the indigence exemption comes into play.only in that instance is the inmate required to pay the,through a debit to his or her account,irrespective of whether the inmate comes within the exemption.the statutory language does not evince an intent by the legislature that the indigence exemption operate differently than the other three exemptions.
doc further argues that the legislative debates and policy concerns support its interpretation of the statute.during the legislative debates on house bill,which ultimately added the provision and the indigence exemption to section f,the following exchange occurred between representative pugh and representative bost,a sponsor of the bill 
pugh could you tell me how an individual who is in need of medical services and does not have the ability to pay,will prove that he does not have the ability to pay,will he be judged based on his the monies that he has currently on the books or would it be based on a bank account that he has somewhere will it be based on previous inheritances that he might have had could you tell me exactly how an individual would be proven indigent 
bost the department already keeps those accounts and those records,and based on that,he would be able to,he or she would be able to pay out of that fund and he can also incur a negative balance so that as the sic accumulated funds,later on,that debt could be paid off.
pugh so so you saying that if an individual does not have the money on the books,if the individual does not have the money have money on his personal account,then he would be considered indigent.
bost if he does not have the money in his personal account,he can not and will not be refused or denied the opportunity to go to seek medical treatment,but there will be a negative balance applied to that account,house proceedings,may,at statements of representatives pugh and bost.
this brief exchange during the legislative debates does not address the only uncertainty in the statute,namely,how the indigence determination should be made.although representative pugh attempted twice to clarify the circumstances under which an inmate would be deemed indigent,his inquiry was never answered.indeed,representative pugh understanding was that if the individual does not have the money on his personal account,then he would be considered indigent,house proceedings,may,at statements of representative pugh.representative bost reference to a possible negative balance that would be paid off later when the inmate accumulated funds does not ipso facto demonstrate the reasonableness of doc rules.whatever representative bost envisioned,his comment can not supercede or undo the statute that was adopted by the general assembly.see kunkel walton,noting that while courts give some consideration to statements by a sponsor of a bill,such statements are not controlling accord people burdunice.the statute mandates that an indigent inmate is exempt from the.ilcs f west.it does not mandate or authorize a system under which an inmate trust fund account is debited for the irrespective of whether the inmate is
