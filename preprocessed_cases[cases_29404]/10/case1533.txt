pamela silva filed an action against her former employer,see candy shops,alleging wage and hour violations.silva brought the action in her individual capacity,on behalf of a class of see candy employees,and on behalf of aggrieved workers under the private attorney general act of paga.the court certified a class on silva claims challenging two of see candy policies pertaining to the calculation of employee work time a rounding policy,which calculates timeclock punches to the nearest tenth of an hour and a policy,which permits employees to clock in minutes before and after a shift,but calculates work time from the employee scheduled times.
in a prior appeal,we granted see candy writ petition challenging the trial court dismissal of see candy affirmative defense that its rounding policy was lawful.see candy shops,superior court th see candy.after remand,see candy successfully moved for summary adjudication on silva paga cause of action.in a later proceeding,the court granted summary judgment in see candy favor on all of silva remaining claims.
in this appeal,silva challenges the summary adjudication order on her paga claim and the summary judgment on all remaining causes of action.she raises numerous contentions.we determine the court erred in granting summary judgment with respect to certain of silva individual claims,but the court properly entered judgment in see candy favor on all remaining claims,including the paga cause of action and the claims.
factual and procedural summary 
background 
in october,silva filed her original complaint alleging wage and hour violations,including see candy failure to pay proper compensation for work performed.
the same day,silva sent a letter to the labor and workforce development agency lwda informing the agency,as required by paga notice requirements,of her claim that see candy violated numerous labor code sections,including by failing to provide statutorily compliant meal and rest periods,overtime compensation,itemized wage statements,compensation for all hours worked,and reimbursement for business expenses.see lab.code,subd.a.on november,the lwda responded that after review,the agency does not intend to investigate the allegations.
five days later,silva filed her first amended complaint the operative complaint here,alleging three causes of action.in the first two causes of action,silva alleged see candy violated california wage and hour laws and the unfair competition law ucl bus.code,et by failing to pay for all work performed pay overtime compensation maintain lawful meal and rest period policies pay for each meal or rest period that was not provided reimburse employees for business related expenses and provide accurate itemized wage statements.silva brought these claims on behalf of herself and on behalf of a putative class of current and former see candy workers.
in the third cause of action,silva alleged a paga claim,seeking paga statutory penalties for the alleged labor code violations.et in this cause of action,silva alleged see candy committed the and incorporated wage and hour violations against plaintiffs and the class members.she also specifically identified several alleged statutory violations,including the failure to pay full compensation due by improperly rounding the time worked by employees,citing sections,and provide required rest and meal periods,citing sections and provide itemized wage statements,citing section and indemnify employees for necessary business expenditures or losses,citing section.
in its amended answer,see candy denied silva allegations and asserted numerous affirmative defenses,including that its employees were fully and fairly compensated under its rounding policy and policy,and that these policies were consistent with state and federal laws.
based on silva request,the court certified a class only on the issues of whether see candy rounding and policies violate applicable law.the certified class consisted of california workers who were employed by see candy from october,to the present.the court certified the class on two issues whether class members suffered a loss of compensation when they clocked in and out on the timekeeping system utilized by see candy which rounded time to the nearest six minutes the rounding policy and whether class members suffered a loss of compensation when they clocked in or out on the timekeeping system utilized by see candy during the grace period,defined as up to ten minutes before their scheduled start times and up to ten minutes after their scheduled quitting times the policy.
silva then moved for summary adjudication on see candy affirmative defense.silva argued see candy rounding policy violates california law requiring an employer to fully compensate an employee every two weeks and pay premium wages for overtime work.the court judge joel pressman agreed,granted the motion,and dismissed see candy rounding defense.
see candy successfully petitioned for a writ of mandate in this court.see candy,supra,th.adopting the federal standard and the rule used by california regulatory agency,we held an employer is entitled to use a rounding policy if the policy is fair and neutral on its face and is used in such a manner that it will not result,over a period of time,in failure to compensate the employees properly for all the time they have actually worked.id.at.applying this standard,we found that silva did not meet her summary adjudication burden to show see candy rounding policy was unlawful as a matter of law,and even if she did meet this burden,see candy evidence showed the existence of triable issues of fact.id.at.because see candy had not affirmatively moved for summary adjudication or judgment,we did not consider whether see candy was entitled to judgment based on its own submitted evidence.
summary adjudication on paga claim 
while this writ proceeding had been pending in this court,see candy moved in the trial court for summary adjudication on silva paga claim seeking penalties for the alleged labor code violations.in this motion,see candy asserted separate arguments regarding two portions of silva paga claim the portion of the paga claim challenging see candy rounding and polices and the portion of the paga claim asserting other statutory violations,mealtime violations,failure to reimburse for business expenses.
on the portion of silva paga claim challenging see candy rounding and policies,see candy argued it was entitled to judgment on this claim because silva notice to the lwda was insufficient to notify the agency of these challenges see,subd.a paga does not govern challenges to rounding and policies silva position conflicted with the labor commissioner enforcement policies and paga is unconstitutional.
on the portion of the paga claim seeking relief for the other alleged labor violations,see candy argued these claims were without merit based on see candy discovery responses reflecting that these claims were no longer at issue.
silva opposed the motion on numerous grounds.regarding the policies,silva argued the lwda notice was adequate and that she was not required to more specifically detail the grounds of the claim in the notice,particularly because these issues pertain to an affirmative defense and because she was unaware of these grounds alleged improper timekeeping policies when she first sent the lwda notice.
regarding the other alleged labor code violations,silva argued she never abandoned these claims,and produced evidence of her counsel january letters to defense counsel indicating the and rounding policy challenges were not the only claims being asserted in her complaint.she did not,however,produce any facts supporting the validity of these alleged labor code violations.
shortly after the parties filed these briefs,the trial court stayed the matter pending the completion of the writ proceeding.our decision in see candy then became final in february.after remand,the trial court gave the parties leave to file supplemental briefs given the lengthy passage of time.in her supplemental brief,silva focused only on her paga claims based on the claim,and did not present any argument or evidence on the individual claims.
after considering the parties submissions and conducting a hearing,the court judge randa trapp granted summary adjudication on silva paga cause of action.on the portion of the paga claim challenging see candy rounding and policies,the court found see candy was entitled to prevail as a matter of law because silva lwda notice was defective as it was not sufficiently specific with respect to these particular challenges.see,subd.a.on the paga claims based on other alleged labor code violations,the court found that although silva had alleged various wage and hour violations in her paga claim,silva interrogatory responses showed she had abandoned these claims.the court also noted that silva had certified a class only as to the issues of rounding and grace periods.
see candy summary judgment motion 
ten days later,see candy moved for summary judgment on the remaining claims alleged in silva first and second causes of action.in this motion,see candy argued the claims failed as a matter of law because the undisputed evidence demonstrated silva could not prove the class lost compensation as a result of see candy application of the rounding or policies.
in support,see candy produced evidence describing its timekeeping policies.according to this evidence,see candy uses a timekeeping software system,known as kronos,to record its employee work hours.employees are required to punch into the system at the beginning and end of their shifts,as well as for lunch breaks.a kronos punch shows the actual time to the minute when the employee clocked into the system.during the relevant times,see candy calculated an employee pay based on the kronos punch times,subject to adjustment under two policies a rounding policy and the policy.
under the rounding policy,in and out punches are rounded up or down to the nearest tenth of an hour every six minutes beginning with the hour mark.the time punches are thus rounded to the nearest mark.for example,if an employee clocks in at,the system rounds up the time to.if the employee clocks in at,the system rounds down the entry to both times are indicated on the punch card.
under the separate policy,employees whose schedules have been programmed into the kronos system may voluntarily punch into the system up to minutes before their scheduled start time and minutes after their scheduled end time.this grace period is voluntary,and is offered to employees to provide flexibility in the manner and times that workers clock in and out of the shifts.see candy rules prohibit employees from working during the grace period.if an employee is asked to work during this time,the manager is required to make a timekeeping adjustment to ensure the employee is paid for that work.managers at see candy shops closely monitor employee start and stop times to ensure they are not working outside their scheduled work times.
because see candy assumes the employees are not working during the grace period,if an employee punches into the system during this time,the employee is paid based on his or her scheduled time,rather than the punch time.in other words,the accurately show when the employee punched in or out,but they do not show the beginning or end of the employee work time,compensable time.generally,if the rule is applied,the rounding policy becomes irrelevant because the start stop time will be exactly the employee scheduled time and there will be no need to round down or up to the nearest tenth of an hour.
see candy also presented two declarations of ali saad,a labor economist and statistician,who examined thousands of see candy time records.saad said that each time punch record contained two entries the actual time the employee clocked in or out and the actual punch time to the nearest tenth of an hour,either up or down.using these records,saad calculated each employee shift twice,first using the actual unrounded time stamps,and second using the rounded time stamps.saad then computed the differences in duration between the shifts.based on these calculations,saad concluded in two separate studies one in and one in that see candy rounding rule is unbiased.
in his study,saad examined see candy employee time punch records from october to march.saad found see candy rounding policy resulted in a total gain of hours for the class members as a whole.for plaintiff silva,saad found an aggregate shortfall of hours or minutes,which he said equates to a shortfall in the average rounded relative to actual shift of seconds.based on these calculations and a statistical analysis,saad opined that the rounding policy is exactly neutral and unbiased.
in the study,saad expanded the coverage period to april and also included hourly employees who worked in see candy administrative office locations.this increased the number of employees analyzed from to,and the number of shifts from approximately to more than million.saad also specifically considered california law providing a worker had the right to overtime pay after working an day.
based on this study,saad reaffirmed that see candy rounding rule is both mathematically and empirically unbiased.specifically,he concluded the aggregate impact of rounding actual time punches produced a net surplus of employee work hours in time paid and thus resulted in a net economic benefit to the employees as a group percent of the employees had either no impact or a net gain under the rounding policy the rounding policy did not negatively impact employee overtime compensation it was virtually a wash neither the employees nor see benefited from this rounding practice and there was no meaningful impact on silva hours paid under the rounding practice she obtained an aggregate surplus of hours.
in reaching these conclusions,saad said he had assumed employees did not work during the grace period whether this assumption was correct could not be observed from the data and he was not asked to address this factual issue.saad indicated he did not round during the minutes before or after an employee scheduled time period if the employee scheduled work times had been programmed into the kronos system because under the policy,the employee would be paid from the scheduled time,not from a rounded time.
see candy also presented evidence that it periodically reminded employees they were prohibited from working if they clocked in during the grace period,and employees were told that if they worked during this time they must notify the manager who would manually add time to the employee kronos records.see candy submitted declarations from numerous employees who stated they did not work during the grace period understood that if they did work they would be compensated for the time understood that the decision to use the policy is always voluntary and described the types of personal activities performed during this period,including using the restroom to do my makeup or hair,going to the post office to drop off personal mail,go ing across the street to the drugstore,and play ing games on my cell phone.
silva summary judgment opposition 
in opposition,silva argued the summary judgment motion must be denied because see candy made no attempt to meet its burden to show her nonclass claims claims alleged in her first two causes of action have no merit.she noted that in her amended complaint she alleged that she did not receive rest and meal periods in violation of sections and,and that see candy failed to reimburse her for expenses she incurred through the performance of her job duties,in violation of section.silva also presented her declaration to support the viability of these individual claims.in relevant part,silva declaration stated 
while i was working at see,there were times when our store was very busy.this was especially true during the holiday season,which normally lasted from october through january,each year.during these peak times,it was extremely rare that i would be provided a rest break.
i also know that i never received a rest period payment on the occasions where i was not provided a rest break.in fact,i am unaware of anyone at see who ever received a rest period payment.throughout my employment,but especially during the holiday season,there were occasions when it was just not possible for me to get to take a full minute meal break,because we were too busy in the store.
during these interrupted lunch breaks,my time records would show i was punched out for lunch.however,i would be asked by see to perform work or assist a customer during my lunch break.i would do so when asked,even though i did not punch back in to be paid for that time.i do not believe i was ever given a meal period payment for these interrupted lunches.
additionally,while working for see,i was often required to use my personal car to drive to the bank for see business.while i did receive some reimbursement from see,i do not believe it was enough to cover all of my expenses.i also received,and had to make,calls for see on my personal cell phone,for which i never received reimbursement.
silva also contended that the summary judgment motion on her class claims challenging the policies was without merit because the see candy court had already ruled triable factual issues exist on these issues.she alternatively argued that see candy did not meet its summary judgment burden because saad had made numerous unsupported assumptions and his conclusions were contrary to applicable law.silva also submitted the declaration of her own expert,robert fountain,a statistics professor,to show the existence of triable issues of fact on her claims.in his declaration,fountain opined that see candy timekeeping system is inherently not fair or neutral in its application to the employees,and that numerous employees lost very large amounts of compensation 
to show triable issues of fact on her challenge to see candy policy,silva mainly argued that the employees were under see candy control while clocked into the kronos system.silva relied on her expert declaration who assumed that employees were working during the grace period and excerpts from her deposition testimony,in which she said that she occasionally saw employees clocking in minutes before their shifts and they would then either do hand exercises or do things or whatever,you know.they would just come in and start their shift and work.silva acknowledged,however,that she did not know if these other employees schedules were programmed into the kronos system and did not know if they were paid for the time they worked before their scheduled shifts.
see candy reply 
in its reply memorandum on the issue of silva individual claims,see candy argued that silva first two causes of action encompass only class allegations challenging see candy rounding and policies,and that these causes of action did not include any individual claims.see candy also presented a copy of a july settlement and release agreement settlement agreement between see candy and silva,in which silva agreed to release discrimination claims she previously filed with the equal opportunity commission in exchange for a monetary payment from see candy.see candy argued that in this settlement agreement,silva had agreed not to pursue any individual claims in her existing superior court action and to assert only her class claims.see candy alternatively argued that if the court concluded that silva had remaining viable individual claims,the court should permit see candy to file and serve an amended notice requesting summary adjudication on the class claims as an alternative to a summary judgment.
see candy also asserted numerous objections to fountain declaration,including that fountain opinions lack factual foundation and were based on assumptions contrary to the law established in see candy.
silva response to new material submitted in see candy reply 
silva objected to see candy presenting new evidence the settlement agreement,and argued that the settlement agreement was irrelevant because it applied only to her discrimination claims and not to her wage and hour claims alleged in the first amended complaint.silva also objected to see candy counsel proposed amended notice to add a summary adjudication motion as an alternative to her summary judgment motion.
court ruling granting summary judgment 
after considering the parties submissions and conducting a hearing,the court granted see candy motion in its entirety.with respect to the class claims,the court first sustained see candy evidentiary objections to the declaration of silva expert,fountain.the court then found that see candy met its initial burden on summary judgment of demonstrating that the time rounding policy was facially neutral,and silva did not meet her burden to create a triable issue of fact on this issue.the court similarly found see candy met its burden to show its policy did not result in undercompensation,and silva did not meet her burden to show a triable factual issue on the lawfulness of this policy.
the court also agreed with see candy that silva had not alleged individual claims in her first two causes of action.the court noted that although the complaint caption stated the claims were being brought in silva individual capacity,the body of the complaint focused on her class allegations.the court also found silva had released any individual claims by entering into the settlement agreement.
in moving for reconsideration,silva objected to the court conclusion that she had not alleged individual claims in her amended complaint.silva pointed out that her amended complaint contained numerous references to the fact that she was bringing claims in her individual capacity particularly the alleged meal and rest break violations and the failure to reimburse for business expenses.silva also submitted her counsel declaration and her own declaration explaining the settlement of the discrimination claims,and that the parties did not intend that it would apply to the individual wage and hour claims asserted in the complaint.she noted that the settlement agreement contained an express exclusion for the claims alleged in silva class action complaint.the court denied the motion.

ii.summary and overview of conclusions 
silva first amended complaint identifies three causes of action violations of various labor code sections violation of the ucl and entitlement to paga penalties for the violations described in the first cause of action.the court certified a class only on one of silva claims within her first two causes of action silva allegation that see candy timekeeping policies rounding and policies resulted in undercompensating its employees for all work performed.
after the see candy remand,the trial court first heard see candy summary adjudication motion on the paga cause of action,and the court granted the motion,finding silva could not prevail on the paga cause of action based on her challenge to the policies because silva did not provide adequate statutory notice of this claim to the lwda and silva could not prevail on the paga cause of action based on the remaining alleged labor code violations because she had abandoned these claims.
the court then granted see candy summary judgment motion on the remaining causes of action based on the court conclusion that the undisputed facts show silva could not recover on her class claims because the timekeeping policies were proper under california law and did not result in undercompensation and silva had not alleged individual claims in her first two causes of action,had settled and dismissed those claims.
on appeal,silva challenges both summary judgment and summary adjudication.
as to the summary judgment,we conclude see candy met its burden to show it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the claims failure to properly pay wages based on see candy rounding and policies,and silva did not meet her burden to show a triable issue of fact on these claims.the court thus properly granted summary judgment on silva claims challenging see candy timekeeping policies.we conclude,however,the court erred in granting summary judgment on silva individual claims alleged in her first and second causes of action because see candy did not move for summary judgment on these claims.
this latter conclusion does not mean the summary judgment must be reversed in its entirety.although see candy did not bring a summary adjudication motion as an alternative to its summary judgment motion on the first two causes of action,it did request leave to amend its summary judgment notice to add the alternate summary adjudication request.this proposed amendment should have been granted.there is no showing silva would have been prejudiced by permitting the amendment.additionally,as explained below,allowing the amendment promotes judicial efficiency and fairness.
accordingly,we uphold the summary judgment on the causes of action challenging see candy policies,and reverse on the causes of action asserting the individual and business expense statutory violations.
as to the paga third cause of action,we affirm the court dismissal of this cause of action in its entirety in the summary adjudication proceeding.on the portion of the paga cause of action challenging the rounding and policies,we do not reach the lwda notice issue because the court conclusion was correct on another ground.a paga claim is viable only if the underlying labor code violations have merit.based on our finding that the undisputed facts show silva can not prevail on her challenges,it necessarily follows that silva can not prevail on her paga cause of action based on these same theories,even if she gave proper notice.
as to the challenged summary adjudication on the portion of the paga cause of action based on the other labor code violations,we determine the court properly granted the summary adjudication because see candy met its burden to show factually deficient discovery responses,and silva failed to meet her burden to show a triable factual issue.
iii.summary judgment 
summary judgment on class claims challenging.rounding policy 
in see candy,this court held the rule in california is that an employer is entitled to use the rounding policy if the rounding policy is fair and neutral on its face and it is used in such a manner that it will not result,over a period of time,in failure to compensate the employees properly for all the time they have actually worked.see candy,supra,th at.we reasoned that is a practical method for calculating work time and can be used to ensure all workers are fully compensated for their work for a relevant time period.id.at.we stated assuming a policy is neutral,both facially and as applied,the practice is proper under california law because its net effect is to permit employers to efficiently calculate hours worked without imposing any burden on employees.ibid.under this standard,courts have upheld an employer rounding policy if on average,it favors neither overpayment nor underpayment,but have rejected timekeeping policies that systematically undercompensate employees such as where the employer rounding policy encompasses only rounding down.id.at see corbin time warner partnership cir,agreeing with see candy reasoning as applied to federal rounding rule.
applying these principles,in see candy we determined the trial court erred in granting silva summary adjudication motion on see candy rounding defense.see candy,supra,th at.because she was the moving party below,silva had the initial burden to show see candy rounding policy was unlawful.id.at.in considering whether she met this burden,we discussed silva expert opinion that the rounding policy resulted in employees not being fairly compensated,but found this evidence did not satisfy the burden because the expert opinion was based on an unsupported assumption that employees worked during the grace periods.id.at.we also held that even if silva expert report satisfied her burden,see candy presented evidence primarily saad declarations creating a triable issue of fact on this issue.id.at.we thus granted see candy writ petition and ordered the court to reinstate see candy defense that its rounding practices were lawful.id.at.
after remand and after successfully obtaining dismissal of the paga cause of action,see candy moved for summary judgment on the rounding issue based on the same expert declarations of saad.as detailed in the factual section above,saad concluded based on two statistical studies that during the class period see candy employees were paid for all of their work under see candy rounding policy and that see candy rounding policy was mathematically neutral over time.saad also opined that silva was fully compensated for her work the study showed she had a shortfall of minutes over the term of her employment,which equated to an average relative time of two seconds per shift statistically meaningless over the time period studied and the study showed that she was compensated for an aggregate surplus of hours.
this evidence met see candy summary judgment burden on silva claim challenging see candy rounding practice.in opposing the summary judgment motion,silva presented the declaration of statistics professor robert fountain,who opined that the system does not appear to be fair or neutral as there is a net loss of regular time worked and a net loss of overtime worked.see candy objected to the opinions and conclusions in fountain declaration on numerous grounds,including that fountain opinions were contrary to applicable legal standards,were without evidentiary foundation,and improperly failed to distinguish between the rounding policy and the policy.the court sustained each of these objections.
on appeal,silva cites to her expert declaration to show a triable issue of fact,but does not challenge the court evidentiary ruling.in her opening brief,she asserts only that it was error for the court to ignore her evidence that see employees were grossly undercompensated.but she does not further discuss this point cite to her expert declaration challenge the court evidentiary ruling or provide any supporting legal authority.in her reply brief,silva summarily states without a legal or factual citation that it was an abuse of discretion for the court to sustain see objections and completely ignore fountain testimony,while simultaneously allowing saad conclusions into evidence.she does not identify any legal basis for this assertion.a conclusory statement is insufficient to challenge a court evidentiary ruling.an undeveloped argument unsupported by any citation to any legal or factual authority is forfeited.see benach county of los angeles th,when an appellant fails to raise a point,or asserts it but fails to support it with reasoned argument and citations to authority,we treat the point as waived.accordingly,we are bound by the court evidentiary ruling and disregard fountain declaration for purposes of our appellate analysis.frittelli,north canon drive,lp th,fn.
silva also contends see candy never met its own summary judgment burden because saad improperly presumed employees did not work during the grace periods.however,as explained below,the assumption was supported because see candy presented evidence showing it had a strict policy against working during the grace period employees followed this policy and if employees worked during the grace period,they would be compensated for their time.silva did not present any contrary evidence raising a triable issue of fact on this issue.
in a related argument,silva argues see candy rounding policy is inherently unfair because its policies mean that an employee time will always round forward to the employee scheduled start time and round backward to the employee scheduled end time.this argument reflects a misunderstanding of see candy policy.the policy is not a rounding policy in the sense that it recalculates an employee work time to the nearest mark.instead,the policy is a method that seeks to accurately count each employee actual work time.if the employee is not working during the grace period,the calculation of the employee time from the employee scheduled start time or end time is accurate.
silva also contends see candy did not meet its summary judgment burden because see candy rounding policy fails to account for the difference in monetary value between regular minutes and overtime minutes.however,saad specifically opined that see candy rounding policy did not negatively impact employees overtime compensation.after considering the rounding policy in light of california overtime rules,saad opined that it was virtually a wash with respect to overtime pay,and neither the employees nor see candy benefited from this rounding practice.saad expert opinion was sufficient to meet see candy burden,and silva did not present any contrary admissible evidence on this issue.
silva also argues that see candy has several attendance tardy policies which disciplined employees for clocking in late and t hese policies create a multitude of slightly early which always round in favor of see.silva cited evidence does not support this claim.if the rounding policy is neutral and the tardiness policy is based solely on the actual punch time,there is no basis for finding that see candy unfairly benefits from the rounding policy because of its tardiness policies.
silva also contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because see candy held the legality of the rounding policy must be decided by a jury.see candy,supra,th.silva misreads our prior decision.because see candy had not moved for summary adjudication or summary judgment in the prior proceeding,we had no occasion to determine whether see candy evidence satisfied its burden to show it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the rounding and policy issues.id.at.the issue presented here was not decided in silva favor in see candy.
silva also devotes lengthy portions of her appellate briefs to her argument that the trial court erred in granting see candy summary judgment motion because the court improperly imposed the initial burden of proof on her.we disagree with silva reading of the trial court order.although the order contained some ambiguity on the burden issue,the court clearly stated that see candy had the initial burden on summary judgment to demonstrat e that the time rounding policy was facially neutral more important,even if the trial court misapplied the summary judgment burden rules,on our de novo review we evaluate the court final determination,and not its rationale.gafcon,ponsor associates th.we have conducted an independent analysis of the parties contentions,and on our application of the proper summary judgment burden rules,we have concluded that see candy met its burden to show the rounding policy is fair and neutral on its face and is used in a manner that over a relevant time period will compensate the employees for all the time they have actually worked.because silva produced no admissible evidence to rebut this conclusion,the trial court properly found silva claims based on the rounding policy were without merit.
under see candy policy,employees whose schedules have been programmed into the kronos system may voluntarily punch the time clock up to minutes before their scheduled start times and minutes after their scheduled end times.because employees are required to comply with company policy that prohibits them from working during the grace period,if an employee punches into the system during the grace period,the employee is paid based on his or her scheduled time,rather than the punch time.
silva does not challenge the legality of this policy if during the grace period the employee was not working was not under the employer control.but she argues the court erred in granting summary judgment because the evidence showed employees were under the control of see candy during the grace period,and were not compensated for this time.in this regard,silva asserts that an employer must prove the accuracy of its time records,particularly when there is any discrepancy between the time and the paid time.we agree with this principle but find that see candy met its summary judgment burden on these issues,and silva did not come forward with evidence showing a triable factual issue.
generally,employees must be paid for the time they are working or are subject to the control of an employer.see morillion royal packing cal th,morillion.in defining control,morillion held employees are subject to the control of their employers when they are prevented from using the time effectively for their own purposes.id.at.in morillion,the high court found agricultural employees were subject to their employer control when they were required to ride on an employer bus to travel to and from the fields.id.at,italics added.the court reasoned that during the bus ride plaintiffs could not engage in personal errands of their choice and were prohibited from effectively using their travel time for their own purposes.id.at.the court also rejected the employer argument that the workers were not under its control because they could read or sleep while on the bus,noting that employees while working in an office setting do not lose their entitlement to be paid merely because they listen to music and drink coffee,italics added.
in this case,see candy presented evidence that it had a policy of prohibiting employees from working during the grace period and submitted numerous employee declarations supporting that see candy exercised no control over the employees during the grace period.this evidence showed that see candy employees were permitted to voluntarily clock in early or clock out late,and during this time they could and did engage exclusively in personal activities,including leaving the premises to run quick errands,drinking coffee,applying makeup,and making personal calls.see candy also presented evidence that if any worker did perform work during the grace period he or she would be paid for that time.
this evidence established see candy employees were in a different position from the morillion agricultural workers,who were required to be confined to a bus to be transported to their next workplace.further,contrary to silva argument,the factual record does not requires us to assume or presume that the employees did not work during the grace period.see candy presented admissible,credible evidence that its employees engaged only in personal activities during the grace period and were neither working nor under see candy control during this time.silva did not present any contrary evidence.
silva reliance on safeway superior court th is unhelpful.in safeway,the court of appeal upheld a trial court order certifying a class alleging an employer failed to provide required meal and rest breaks.id.at.in concluding the employees sufficiently demonstrated an employer policy to pressure employees not to take meal breaks,the court quoted a concurring opinion in brinker restaurant superior court cal th,stating that if employer records show no meal period for a given shift over five hours,a rebuttable presumption arises that the employee was not relieved of duty and no meal period was provided.id.at.
this case is in a different procedural context we are reviewing a summary judgment and not a class certification.but even if there exists a presumption here that all see candy employees were working during the grace period,see candy proffered admissible evidence rebutting the presumption and showing that the employees did not in fact work during the grace period.
at that point in the summary judgment proceeding,it was silva burden to submit evidence negating this fact.as her only attempt to do so,silva relied on excerpts from her own deposition in which she testified that she sometimes saw employees clocking in before their shifts and they would then either do hand exercises or do things or whatever,you know.they would just come in and start their shift and work.silva acknowledged,however,that she did not know if these employees schedules were programmed into the kronos system a predicate to the application of the rule and did not know if these employees were paid for the time they worked before their shifts.without this information,there is no reasoned basis for concluding that employees were not fully paid for their time under the policy.likewise,silva argument that employees were not permitted to leave the premises during the grace period was unsupported by the factual record.silva relied on deposition testimony that pertained to clocking in and out,and did not refer to personal discretionary activities.
summary judgment on silva individual claims 
silva next contends the court erred in adjudicating her individual claims even though see candy did not move for summary judgment on these claims.
see candy acknowledges it did not move for summary judgment or summary adjudication on any individual claims asserted by silva in the first and second causes of action.after silva raised the issue in her summary judgment opposition papers,see candy asserted several responsive arguments silva never alleged individual nonclass claims in her first and second causes of action silva released any such claims in the july settlement agreement and if the court finds these individual claims remained,the court should provide see candy with leave to amend its summary judgment notice to add an alternative motion for summary adjudication on the class claims.the court agreed with the first two arguments and thus found that summary judgment was not precluded.
we agree with silva that the court erred in this ruling.on our independent review of silva first amended complaint,we find silva did sufficiently allege individual claims in the first two causes of action.silva alleged she was suing in her individual capacity as well as on behalf of a class,and alleged that see candy failed to possess a compliant meal or rest period policy that she did not receive rest and meal periods in violation of sections and and that see candy failed to reimburse her for expenses she incurred through the performance of her job duties,in violation of labor code section in her ucl cause of action,silva repeated that she was bringing the action on her own behalf as well as on behalf of a class and alleged she suffered an injury in fact under business and professions code section.
under the required liberal review standards applicable to pleadings challenged on a summary judgment motion taylor lockheed martin th,nelson superior court th,we find silva pled sufficient facts to allege entitlement to recover on individual claims.silva also presented her own declaration to support her factual claims that she was denied required breaks and was not reimbursed for business expenses to support the allegations in her first and second causes of action.silva stated in her declaration that it was extremely rare that she was provided a rest break during the holiday season it was usually not possible for her to take a full meal break she was frequently asked to work while she was clocked out for her lunch break and she did not receive reimbursement for required business expenses.
we reject see candy alternate argument that silva is barred from recovering on the individual claims because silva released these claims in the settlement agreement.we note initially that by first presenting the settlement agreement in its reply,see candy did not provide silva fair opportunity to counter this evidence.where a remedy as drastic as summary judgment is involved,due process requires a party be fully advised of the issues to be addressed and be given adequate notice of what facts it must rebut in order to prevail.san diego watercrafts,wells fargo bank,th.additionally,on our independent review of the settlement agreement,the agreement does not support see candy argument that silva released her individual wage and hour claims.in the agreement,silva agreed to immediately withdraw with prejudice her discrimination complaints filed with the department of fair employment housing and the equal employment opportunity commission,and agreed she would not assert any claim arising from or attributable to any alleged unlawful practice of see with the exception of the claims alleged in the existing action,referred to as the class action.italics added.specifically,the settlement agreement states class action exception this settlement and the release do not apply to the claims set forth in plaintiff class action against see pamela silva,see candy shops,et,san diego county superior court case.first italics added.
viewing the plain language of this exception in the context of the entire settlement agreement,silva agreed to release all past and future claims,except for the claims alleged in her existing action at that time,the first amended complaint,which included her individual claims.italics added.read in context,the reference to the class action was a descriptive term to refer to the existing action,and not one of limitation.there is nothing in the settlement agreement supporting a reasonable conclusion that the class action language was intended to limit the exception to only the class action allegations in the complaint.this interpretation is consistent with see candy subsequent actions in which see candy after the settlement agreement was executed assumed silva had continued rights to pursue her paga claims despite they were not encompassed within the certified class claims.
we conclude see candy did not meet its summary judgment burden on silva individual claims alleged in her first and second causes of action.we thus reverse the judgment with respect to these claims.
silva contends this conclusion requires that we also reverse the summary judgment on the class challenges because see candy did not move for summary adjudication on these causes of action as an alternative to summary judgment.we disagree.see candy specifically requested the trial court to allow it to amend its summary judgment notice to include a summary adjudication motion in the alternative,and filed a proposed amended notice.the court should have granted this request.there was no prejudice to silva because she had a full and fair opportunity to address the arguments on the claims.the record before us consists of more than pages and the parties have submitted voluminous appellate briefs on the issues.we have thoroughly reviewed the record and arguments on the claims,and have concluded silva claims have no factual basis.it would be nonsensical to reverse the court ruling on the claims and require the parties to go to trial on those issues merely because there may exist potential triable issues of fact on silva claims.see candy specifically requested the court for leave to amend its notic
