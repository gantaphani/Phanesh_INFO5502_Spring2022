background 
schwab investments schwab trust is an investment trust organized under massachusetts law.such a trust,which is often referred to generically as a massachusetts trust,even when not created under massachusetts law,is an unincorporated business organization created by an instrument of trust by which property is to be held and managed by trustees for the benefit of persons who are or become the holders of the beneficial interests in the trust estate.see hecht malley,thus,the schwab trust agreement and declaration of trust states that the trustees hereby declare that they will hold all cash,securities and other assets,which they may from time to time acquire in any manner as trustees hereunder in trust to manage and dispose of the same for the pro rata benefit of the holders from time to time of shares in this trust.schwab investments,registration statement form n,agreement and declaration of trust ex,hereinafter agreement and declaration of trust.such a trust today is a preferred form of organization for mutual funds and asset securitization.dukeminier,sitkoff lindgren,wills,trusts,and estates.
one of the significant features that distinguishes a massachusetts trust from the ordinary or private trust lies in the manner in which the trust relationship is created investors in a business trust enter into a voluntary,consensual,and contractual relationship,whereas the beneficiaries of a traditional private trust take their interests by gift from the donor or settlor.herbert chermside,modern status of the massachusetts or business trust,see also berry mccourt,ohio by an underlying contract,or in the provisions of a business trust instrument,or both,the parties agree on the operations of the venture.thus,the agreement and declaration of trust at issue here states at the very outset that it was made by the trustees hereunder,and by the holders of shares of beneficial interest to be issued hereunder.agreement and declaration of trust.moreover,it continues that e very shareholder by virtue of having become a shareholder shall be held to have expressly assented and agreed to the terms hereof and to have become a party hereto.agreement and declaration of trust.
because this case involves the relationship between investors and a mutual fund,the trust which created the fund and the investment adviser which manages the fund,it is helpful to have a clear understanding of the relationships among these parties.we begin with a useful,if oversimplified,description of a mutual fund 
t,an investment professional,approaches a,b,c,and others like them and agrees to pool certain of their assets in a common fund to be managed by a,b,c,and the other investors each receive tradable shares in the fund in an amount proportional to their investment.by structuring their collective investment in this way,a,b,c,and the others are able to take advantage of economies of scale,obtain professional portfolio management,and achieve a more diversified portfolio than each could have individually.in managing the portfolio,t is subject to a fiduciary obligation to a,b,c,and the other investors in the fund.
dukeminier,sitkoff lindgren,wills,trusts,and estates.
this simple description does not adequately discuss perhaps the most important party to this arrangement,namely,the investment adviser,whose main role is to supervise and manage the fund assets,including handling the fund portfolio transactions.clifford kirsch,an introduction to mutual funds,in mutual fund regulation clifford kirsch,ed.the investment adviser is not a mere employee,contractor,or consultant.instead,it is more often than not also the creator,sponsor,and promoter of the mutual fund.charles rounds,charles rounds,iii,loring and rounds a trustee handbook ed.see also kamen kemper fin,mutual funds typically are organized and underwritten by the same firm that serves as the company investment adviser.daily income fund,fox,mutual funds are typically created and managed by a external organization known as an investment adviser.citing burks lasker.
thus,while i n theory,the trust is able to choose any adviser it deems appropriate to invest the fund portfolio,based on the adviser investing style,track record and fees,in practice,the investment adviser picked to manage the portfolio is most often and unlikely to be removed.john shipman,so who owns your mutual fund,wall,may,at,available at.because a typical fund is organized by its investment adviser which provides it with almost all management services,a mutual fund can not,as a practical matter sever its relationship with the adviser.burks,at quoting,at,reprinted in.
consistent with this description of the structure of a mutual fund and its relationship with its investment adviser,the schwab trust selected charles schwab investment management,schwab advisor as its investment adviser.indeed,charles schwab is alleged to have been chairman and trustee of the schwab trust and a member of the board of the schwab advisor.third am.compl.the latter is a subsidiary of the charles schwab corporation,of which schwab has served as ceo at various times,including from through october.third am.compl.moreover,the complaint alleges that all d efendants and their affiliates held themselves out as one schwab entity.third am.compl.
the mutual fund at issue here,one of several operated by the schwab trust,is the schwab total bond market fund.reflecting the terms of a proxy statement proposed by the schwab trust in,and subsequently adopted by the shareholders by majority vote,the prospectuses that the fund issued during the relevant period stated that the fund was designed to offer high current income by tracking the performance of the lehman brothers aggregate bond index lehman index and was intended for investors seeking to fill the fixed income component of their asset allocation plan.specifically,the lehman index included government,corporate,mortgage,commercial mortgage and bonds that were denominated in dollars and ha d maturities longer than one year.northstar fin.advisors,schwab,d,nevertheless,the fund is not itself an index fund and,according to the fund prospectus,it was not required to invest any percentage of its assets in the securities represented in the lehman index.decl.of kevin calia in support of motion to dismiss second amended class action complaint,ex.a at.

northstar financial advisors,northstar is a registered investment advisery and financial planning firm that manages discretionary and accounts on behalf of investors and had over shares of the fund under its management.in august,northstar filed this shareholder class action against the defendants,alleging that they deviated from the fund fundamental investment policies and exposed the fund and its shareholders to tens of millions of dollars in losses.
northstar has identified two classes of potential plaintiffs a pre breach class,consisting of those who purchased shares of the fund on or prior to august,and who continued to hold their shares as of august,and a breach class,consisting of those who purchased shares of the fund during the period september,through february.northstar alleges that august,was the last day of the fiscal year preceding the one during which the fund first began deviating from its required fundamental investment policies,and that on february,the fund reverted back to the required policies.
this case has a lengthy and complicated procedural history that includes the dismissal of successive amended complaints for failure to state a cognizable cause of action.specifically,the third amended complaint,which is based on the fund unauthorized deviation from its fundamental investment objectives,alleges five causes of action on behalf of each of the two identified classes,for a total of ten claims breach of fiduciary duty against the counts one and six breach of fiduciary duty against schwab advisor counts two and seven aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty against the trustees counts three and eight aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty against schwab advisor counts four and nine breach of the investment advisory and administration agreement iaa between schwab trust and schwab advisor.the last cause of action is based on the allegations that the investors are beneficiaries of the iaa.the third amended complaint also incorporates by reference a breach of contract cause of action against the schwab trust that was alleged in the second amended complaint,but dismissed with prejudice on an earlier motion to dismiss.the incorporation by reference was included to preserve northstar right to appeal from the dismissal of this cause of action with prejudice.

discussion 
we pause before addressing the merits to discuss the issue of whether northstar has standing.northstar filed its initial class action complaint on behalf of investors in the fund on august.northstar owned no shares of the fund,but it brought the action in its own name,without obtaining an assignment of claims from an investor in the fund.subsequently,in a comparable case brought by an asset management firm,the second circuit held that the minimum requirement for is that the plaintiff have legal title to,or a proprietary interest in,the claim.w.huff asset mgmt.deloitte touche llp,cir.on december,after huff was decided,northstar obtained an assignment of claim from a.
defendants argue that because standing must be determined at the time a complaint is filed,and because northstar did not obtain an assignment of claim until several months after the original complaint was filed,the assignment could not cure northstar original lack of standing.the district judge susan illston,to whom the case was then assigned,dismissed northstar complaint for lack of standing with a suggestion that this defect could be cured by filing an amended complaint.northstar fin.advisors,schwab,d.northstar followed her suggestion.after schwab renewed its motion to dismiss the amended complaint,the district court judge to whom the case had been reassigned lucy koh,declined to order the dismissal of the complaint because to do so would have elevate d form over substance and thus she treated the prior order as granting plaintiff leave to file a supplemental pleading under rule d instead of an amended complaint pursuant to rule a.northstar fin.advisors,schwab,d.in so doing,she observed that,a lthough there is no published ninth circuit authority on this point,courts in other circuits have found that parties may cure standing deficiencies through supplemental pleadings.id.at citing,inter alia,travelers ins.third,cir.we review this ruling de novo,renee duncan,cir,and we agree with judge koh application of.d.

although g establishes filing of an application as a nonwaivable condition of jurisdiction,espinosa satisfied this condition while the case was pending in the district court.a supplemental complaint in the district court would have eliminated this jurisdictional issue since the record discloses,both by affidavit and stipulation,that the jurisdictional condition was satisfied,it is not too late,even now,to supplement the complaint to allege this fact.
id.at internal citations omitted.this holding is consistent with rockwell int l united states,in which the supreme court subsequently held that when a plaintiff files a complaint in federal court and then voluntarily amends the complaint,courts look to the amended complaint to determine jurisdiction.
we add here a brief discussion of the thoughtful holding of the court of appeals for the federal circuit that summarizes the case law addressing supplemental pleadings.there,a s an initial matter,the parties dispute d whether the allegations in the plaintiff amended complaint that concern actions taken after the filing of the initial complaint can be used to establish subject matter jurisdiction.prasco,llc medicis pharm.relying on rule d and matthews diaz,the court of appeals treated the complaint as a supplemental complaint and held that it was sufficient to cure the original complaint jurisdictional defect

judge koh holding is also consistent with the approach to the federal rules of civil procedure taken by judge clark,the principal architect of the federal rules of civil procedure.zahn international paper.thus,in hackner guaranty trust of new york,cir,the complaint was subject to dismissal because the plaintiffs did not allege damages sufficient to satisfy the minimum amount required to invoke jurisdiction on the basis of diversity of citizenship.an amended complaint was then filed which added a plaintiff,eunice eastman,whose alleged damages were well over the requirement.id.at.speaking for the second circuit,judge clark wrote that jurisdiction was proper notwithstanding the fact that it was first established by the addition of eastman as a plaintiff in the amended complaint 
since eastman alleges grounds of suit in the federal court,the only question is whether or not she must begin a new suit again by herself.defendants claim that one can not amend a nonexistent action is purely formal,in the light of the wide and flexible content given to the concept of action under the new rules.actually she has a claim for relief,an action in that sense as the supreme court has pointed out,there is no particular magic in the way it is instituted.so long as a defendant has had service reasonably calculated to give him actual notice of the proceedings,the requirements of due process are satisfied.hence no formidable obstacle to a continuance of the suit appears here,whether the matter is treated as one of amendment or of power of the court to add or substitute parties,federal rule,or of commencement of a new action by filing a complaint with the clerk,rule.in any event we think this action can continue with respect to eastman without the delay and expense of a new suit,which at long last will merely bring the parties to the point where they now are.

our dissenting colleague relies on morongo band of mission indians california state board of equalization,cir,for the proposition that where the district court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over a matter at the time of filing,subsequent events do not confer subject matter jurisdiction on the district court.dissent at.we find this argument inapposite because,unlike the present case,morongo did not involve a supplemental pleading,much less one with allegations of events that occurred after the commencement of the action.
while morongo does contain the broad statement that subject matter jurisdiction must exist as of the time the action is commenced and that a lack of jurisdiction at the outset can not be cured subsequently,it is now clear,if it was not then,that this rule is more nuanced than the inflexibility suggested by its language both as it relates to curing jurisdictional defects through supplemental pleadings,see,matthews,and other circumstances in which defects in jurisdiction were cured by the substitution,addition,or elimination of a party,see,newman green,alfonzo larrain,mullaney anderson,california credit union league city of anaheim,cir.nevertheless,we need not belabor this issue because,in order to decide this case,it is enough to say that the rule as stated in morongo does not extend to supplemental pleadings filed pursuant to.d.
the same is true of righthaven llc hoehn,cir,which the dissent relies on for the general principle that jurisdiction is based on facts that exist at the time of filing.dissent at.of course,a general principle,which righthaven observed was subject to at least a few exceptions,is significantly different from the hard and fast rule that the language in morongo suggested.indeed,righthaven acknowledged the possibility of additional exceptions and left open the question of whether permitting standing based on a property interest acquired after filing should be added to the list of exceptions.righthaven,at we need not decide whether the circumstances of this case call for a new exception to the general rule,however,because righthaven lacked standing either way.
nor does the supreme court holding in grupo dataflux atlas global group,compel a contrary result.there,diversity jurisdiction was lacking at the time the lawsuit was commenced because the plaintiff was a limited partnership that included two mexican citizens as members and the defendant was a mexican corporation.id.at.after a verdict was rendered in favor of the plaintiff,the district court granted the defendant motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.id.on appeal,the plaintiff partnership argued that the mexican partners had left the partnership in a transaction consummated the month before the trial began.id.a sharply divided supreme court held that this change in the composition in the membership of the partnership was insufficient to cure the initial jurisdictional defect.specifically,it held that the rule measures all challenges to jurisdiction premised upon diversity of citizenship against the state of facts that existed at the time of filing whether the challenge be brought shortly after filing,after trial,or even for the first time on appeal.id.at.moreover,notwithstanding significant departures from the rule in diversity cases where the parties have changed after the filing of the complaint or on appeal,see newman green,at,it declined to depart from this rule where the change in circumstances arose not from a change in the parties to the action,but from the change in the citizenship of a continuing party.grupo dataflux,at citing conolly taylor.
nevertheless,we do not regard that holding as dispositive here.first,the present case does not involve the issue of diversity jurisdiction.see connectu llc zuckerberg,cir while the court in grupo dataflux relied upon the rule to thwart an effort to manufacture diversity jurisdiction during the pendency of an action,the decision operates exclusively in the realm of diversity jurisdiction.more significantly,unlike grupo dataflux,the present case involves the filing of a supplemental pleading that became the operative pleading in the case on which jurisdiction must be based.
nor we do not see any consideration of policy that would justify a rule,for which our dissenting colleague argues,that a party such as northstar must file a new complaint instead of a supplemental pleading because of a assignment from a party that had standing.the dissent does not dispute,nor can it,that the assignee of a cause of action stands in the shoes of the assignor,hoffeld united states,and unquestionably has the same standing to file a complaint that the assignor could have filed.sprint communications apcc services.indeed,the dissent concedes that had northstar accepted the dismissal without prejudice and then filed a new complaint after it obtained an assignment of rights,it would have had standing and a personal stake in the outcome of this litigation.dissent at emphasis in original.
a rule that would turn on the label attached to a pleading is difficult for us to accept.as the eleventh circuit has observed in a case in which an amended complaint contained jurisdictional allegations that were based on events,e xcept for the technical distinction between filing a new complaint and filing an amended complaint,the case would have been properly filed we therefore hold that we have jurisdiction over this appeal and we will reach the merits.homes,ameron homes,cir.
perhaps reflecting sensitivity to having a case turn on the technical distinction between a new complaint and a supplemental pleading,the dissent suggests a policy reason for the hypertechnical rule it advocates.thus,it argues that permitting a plaintiff to proceed by supplemental pleading alleging a assignment of the claim has adverse practical effects.dissent at.more specifically,u ninjured parties,particularly those in search of class action lead plaintiff status,could sue first,then trawl for those truly and timely injured.today the majority those who would race to the courthouse and bend federal rules of civil procedure and article iii standing requirements to gain an edge over other claimants who are not as fleet of foot.id.
under current law,however,the benefit that the dissent suggests goes to the winner of the race to the courthouse does not exist.presumably,the dissent is referring to the fact that counsel for the lead plaintiff becomes class counsel.in,however,congress amended.to set out discrete standards for the appointment of class counsel.thus,rule g now provides that in appointing class counsel,courts should consider the work counsel has done in identifying claims,counsel experience in such matters,counsel knowledge of the applicable law,and the resources that counsel will commit to representation.g a wright,miller,kane,federal practice and procedure civil,pgs.under these circumstances,it would be an abuse of discretion to appoint an attorney as class counsel solely because he may have won the race to the courthouse.
more significantly,the present case was not one in which northstar won a race to the courthouse and in which its attorneys were appointed lead counsel for that reason.indeed,by the time it obtained the assignment from henry holz,over three months had passed since the complaint was filed.this was more than enough time for a competing plaintiff to file a complaint.no such complaint was filed.in sum,whatever merit there may be to the dissent concern,it is not present in this case and has been substantially eliminated by the amendments to the federal rules of civil procedure.moreover,that a supplemental pleading can only be filed with the permission of the district judge provides additional protection against the misuse of the pleading for strategic gamesmanship.
thus,we agree that judge koh did not abuse her discretion in permitting northstar to file a supplemental pleading after a assignment from a party that clearly had standing.see northstar,d at.
before we review each of northstar claims,we give a brief overview of the case,and explain how the various claims relate to each other.we begin with the various governing documents of the fund to which we have already made reference.the agreement and declaration of trust,and its bylaws,establish the trust and govern its internal affairs,and are governed by massachusetts law.the fund prospectus is issued by the schwab advisor on behalf of the fund on an annual basis.the statement of additional information,or sai,produced at the same time as the prospectus,is made available to investors freely on demand,although it does not need to be mailed to them automatically.see glazer,prospectus disclosure and delivery requirements,in mutual fund regulation citing sec.exch.comm n,form n at,available at last visited.
in,a proxy statement was submitted to and approved by the fund investors.it included two relevant proposals which we have already described in detail.briefly,proposal stated that the trust would seek to track the investment results of the lehman index through the use of an indexing strategy.proposal stated that the trust would not invest more than of the fund total assets in any industry.these fundamental investment objectives could be changed only by shareholder vote.subsequent registration statements and prospectuses reflected these changes.
northstar original complaint alleged four causes of action arising from the fund alleged violations of the fundamental investment policies.first,northstar claimed a private right of action under section a of the investment company act.second,northstar alleged that all of the defendants had breached their fiduciary duties to the shareholders.third,northstar claimed that all of the defendants had breached the contract between the investors and the fund,contained in the fund prospectuses and its proxy statement.finally,northstar claimed that all of the defendants had violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
on an interlocutory appeal,we rejected northstar theory that it had a private right of action under the investment company act.northstar fin.advisors,schwab,cir.nevertheless,the district judge had allowed northstar to replead its state law claims,specifying under which state law they were asserted and on which documents they relied.northstar fin.advisors,schwab,d.
northstar then filed an amended complaint that left those claims at risk of dismissal under the securities litigation uniform standards act of slusa,because it contained allegations that suggested that its claims were based on misrepresentations.slusa bars certain state law class actions that allege an untrue statement or omission of a material fact or the use of any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance,b,unless the governing law is the law of the state that has chartered or organized the entity issuing the securities.id.d.
slusa operates wherever deceptive statements or conduct form the gravamen or essence of the claim.freeman,lp pac.life ins,cir.the district judge ruled that the central theme of the second amended complaint was that the defendants made misrepresentations about how investments in the fund would be managed.northstar,d at.in the district judge view,the crux of northstar case was that the defendants statements about how the shareholders funds would be managed were false,or became false when the fund deviated from the index in.id.at.the district judge also noted that the second amended complaint contained one specific allegation that the trust gave a false explanation for why the fund underperformed its index in its may report.id.at sac.the district judge then dismissed the contract claims,with prejudice,for failure to state a claim on the ground that they were barred by slusa,and that they failed to allege a contract between the shareholders and the fund.northstar.at.the district judge also rejected northstar breach of fiduciary duty causes of action under slusa,but gave northstar leave to replead them under massachusetts law.id.
northstar repled the fiduciary duty causes of action in its third amended complaint and also amended its allegations in an effort to remove their supposed focus on misrepresentations.indeed,the schwab defendants conceded in their motion to dismiss the third amended complaint that northstar avoided slusa preemption for its fiduciary breach claims by asserting them under massachusetts law and coming within the delaware a term used to describe an exception to slusa preemption if such a cause of action is available under the law of the state that had chartered or organized the entity issuing the securities.def.mot.to dismiss third am.compl.see d madden cowen,cir.nevertheless,the district judge held that the fiduciary duty claims had to be brought derivatively,and dismissed them.northstar fin.advisors,schwab,d.the district judge also held that northstar could not assert a claim as a beneficiary of the investment advisory agreement.id.at.presumably because she had dismissed the breach of contract cause of action in the second amended complaint with prejudice,she did not address northstar arguments as to these claims in the third amended complaint.nor did the district judge decide whether the allegations in the third amended complaint survived under slusa.
as we discuss in detail below,we reverse the district court dismissal of the breach of contract claims for failure to allege a contract between the shareholders and the fund.we also reverse the district court dismissal of the fiduciary duty and beneficiary claims.we do not,however,reach the question of whether any of northstar claims are barred by slusa.the district court has not yet had the need to determine whether the allegations in the third amended complaint can survive under slusa,and should do so in the first instance.see,haskell harris,cir w e are a court of review,not first view.
with this as a backdrop,we proceed to discuss the merits of northstar complaint.
breach of contract claim 
northstar argues that,once the shareholders approved the proposals regarding the fundamental investment objectives of the schwab trust,which were described in the proxy statement,the schwab trust was contractually obligated to comply with them in managing the fund.moreover,northstar argues that the subsequent dissemination of the fundamental investment objectives in the registration statement and prospectuses formed a contract between the schwab trust and the existing investors who retained shares and new investors who purchased shares in consideration for schwab contractual obligations.appellant br.at see also appellant reply br.at.
the restatement second of contracts provides that a promise may be stated in words either oral or written,or may be inferred wholly or partly from conduct.restatement second of contracts.while contracts are often spoken of as express or implied,t he distinction involves no difference in legal effect,but lies merely in the mode of manifesting assent.id.cmt.just as assent may be manifested by words or other conduct,sometimes including silence,so intention to make a promise may be manifested in language or by implication from other circumstances,including course of dealing or usage of trade or course of performance.id.the distinction between an express and an implied contract,therefore,is of little importance,if it can be said to exist at all.joseph perillo,corbin on contracts at ed see also richard lord,williston on contracts at ed.an contract requires proof of the same elements necessary to evidence an express contract mutual assent or offer and acceptance,consideration,legal capacity and a lawful subject matter.
while it is not necessary to characterize the contract here as either express or implied,a particularly instructive discussion of the concept of implied contracts,in circumstances analogous to those present here,appears in trustees of dartmouth college woodward,wheat,one of the earliest cases applying article i,section of the constitution,which provides that n o state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts.the case arose out of an effort by the state of new hampshire to alter the terms of a corporate charter that had provided certain guarantees as to the structure and governance of dartmouth college.as professor tribe succinctly describes it,the supreme court held that new hampshire could not pack the dartmouth college board of trustees and alter its faculty so as to change the college into a public institution in violation of its charter from george iii.laurence tribe,american constitutional law ed.of particular relevance here is the concurring opinion of justice story,who began his discussion of this issue by describing the creation of the corporation and the terms of its charter.specifically,he observed 
the corporation was expressly created for the purpose of distributing in perpetuity the charitable donations of private benefactors.by the terms of the charter,the trustees,and their successors,in their corporate capacity,were to receive,hold and exclusively manage all the funds so contributed.the crown,then,upon the face of the charter,pledged its faith that the donations of private benefactors should be perpetually devoted to their original purposes,without any interference on its own part,and should be for ever administered by the trustees of the corporation,unless its corporate franchises should be taken away by due process of law.
dartmouth college,wheat.at.
justice story then identified two implied contracts in this circumstance.first,there was an implied contract on the part of the crown,with every benefactor,that if he would give his money,it should be deemed a charity protected by the charter,and be administered by the corporation,according to the general law of the land.as,soon,then,as a donation was made to the corporation,there was an implied contract that the crown would not revoke or alter the charter,or change its administration,without the consent of the corporation.id.second,t here was also an implied contract between the corporation itself,and every benefactor,upon a like consideration,that it would administer his bounty according to the terms,and for the objects stipulated in the charter.id.at 
the fundamental investment objectives of the schwab total bond market fund can be analyzed in the same manner.indeed,when they were adopted by the shareholders,they added a structural restriction on the power conferred on the trustees in the agreement and declaration of trust that can only be changed by a vote of the shareholders.this created a contract between the trustees themselves,and every investor that the schwab trust would administer his investment according to the terms,and for the objects stipulated in the two restrictions adopted by the shareholders of the fund.id.at.significantly,after the shareholders voted in favor of the proxy statement that included these restrictions,they were subsequently reflected in the fund registration statements and prospectuses.thus,anyone who purchased shares in the fund after,or held shares that he then owned,was legally and contractually entitled to have his investment managed in accordance with the proposals in the proxy statement,unless the shareholders voted to permit otherwise.
the defendants argue that undertakings in sec filings themselves can not reflect contractual obligations that can be enforced in a suit for breach of contract.this argument can not be reconciled with lapidus hecht,cir,where the plaintiffs sought to recover losses sustained by the mutual funds as a result of short sales made without shareholder approval,allegedly in violation of the registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission.id.at.specifically,the defendant,a massachusetts business trust,had filed a prospectus with the sec that provided that the trust could engage in short sales of securities with a value of up to of the value of the mutual fund total assets.id.at.the trust later issued an amended prospectus which authorized the trust to enter into short sales of securities with a value of up to of the mutual fund total assets.id.nevertheless,t his amendment to the short sales restriction was made without shareholder approval and,subsequently,the mutual fund short sale position had increased to of the mutual fund assets and the mutual fund suffered substantial losses.id.
on appeal,we addressed whether the plaintiffs could bring their action for violations of the ica directly against the defendant or whether the action had to be brought derivatively.we held that the lapidus plaintiffs had adequately alleged an injury predicated upon a violation of the shareholder voting rights,id.at citing cases,and that those allegations are sufficient to satisfy the injury requirement for a direct action under massachusetts law,id.significantly,the violation held to be adequately alleged was of the plaintiffs contractual rights as shareholders to vote on proposed changes to the short sale and senior security restrictions.id.emphasis added.these restrictions were spelled out in the registration statement,and in the prospectus filed with the sec,id.at.lapidus holding is directly applicable here because northstar breach of contract cause of action rests on the deviation by defendants from two fundamental investment objectives,which required a shareholder vote to be changed,without first obtaining shareholder approval.until the fundamental investment objectives were amended by shareholder vote,the investors had a contractual right to have the fund managed in accordance with those objectives 
mckesson hboc,new york state common retirement fund,cir,upon which the district judge relied,does not support the defendants argument.in that case 
mckesson hboc sued its own shareholders for unjust enrichment arising from a merger between mckesson and hbo company hboc.mckesson claim ed that the former hboc shareholders we re the beneficiaries of a windfall triggered by alleged accounting improprieties by hboc.the shareholders,according to mckesson,exchanged artificially inflated shares of hboc for mckesson shares in the merger transaction.mckesson wanted to recover the excess value from the shareholders.
id.at.mckesson sought recovery for unjust enrichment,which was potentially available only if there was no governing contract between the parties.id.at.while mckesson hboc ultimately held that there was no recovery for unjust enrichment,even if there were no governing contract,it first addressed whether the merger agreement or the relevant proxy prospectus was a contract that governed mckesson claims against the shareholders.
first,mckesson hboc held that it is clear from the text and the signatories to the agreement that the only parties to the merger agreement were the corporations themselves.id.at.second,it held that the prospectus was not an offer by mckesson to the hboc shareholders to enter into a bilateral contract separate and apart from the merger agreement.id.at.specifically,mckesson hboc explained that,although the prospectus references the merger agreement,advising shareholders that t he merger can not be completed unless the stockholders of both companies approve the merger agreement and the transactions associated with it,such references do not convert mckesson solicitation of the shareholders vote into a contractual offer.id.thus,mckesson hboc concluded that the prospectus did not serve as the basis for a contract between mckesson and the shareholders.id.at.
significantly,mckesson hboc distinguished the scenario it addressed from a tender offer situation,where the courts have found a contract between the corporation and an individual shareholder who tenders shares.id.at see also fletcher cyc.at ed.a binding contract is created when the shareholder tenders his or her securities in accordance with the terms of the offer.unlike a tender offer,the shareholders in mckesson did not tender their shares.mckesson hboc,at.moreover,shareholders who objected to the merger could not separately opt out or contract out of the merger.individual shareholders were not in a position of contracting with mckesson,and shareholder ratification did not convert the prospectus into a contract.id at.
this case is clearly distinguishable from mckesson hboc.first,the parties to the contract at issue in this case are the trustees and the shareholders of the fund.second,the breach of contract cause of action is predicated,in part,on the approval of the fundamental investment objectives by the shareholders.once those objectives were adopted,they significantly restricted the discretion which the agreement and declaration of trust conferred on the schwab trust to manage the fund.moreover,the fund registration statement and prospectuses reflected the adoption of those restrictions.the acquisition of the securities constituted an acceptance of the offer.
nor does in re charles schwab.securities litigation,no.c wha,wl.may,hereinafter charles schwab,on which defendants rely,and which involved legal issues comparable to this case,constitute persuasive authority to the contrary.the district judge there first stated that t he ninth circuit has never addressed whether mutual fund disclosure documents constitute a contract under these precise circumstances.id.at.nevertheless,as lapidus makes clear,this is not an accurate statement of ninth circuit law.see at.moreover,we do not find persuasive the argument that lapidus is distinguishable because it did not involve contract claims but rather statutory claims under the ica.charles schwab,wl,at.the plaintiffs ability in lapidus to bring a direct action under the ica was based upon a breach of their contractual rights as shareholders to vote on proposed changes to the short sale and senior security restrictions.lapidus,at.these contractual rights were derived from the registration statement and the prospectus.id.at.
we find equally unpersuasive the argument that the prospectuses here at issue are not contracts but rather are mandatory regulatory disclosure documents.charles schwab,wl,at.the prospectus,which is the primary selling document,offers to sell shares to investors in a mutual fund which will invest the proceeds in the manner described in the prospectus,unless shareholders approve a proposal to do otherwise.indeed,the securities and exchange commission urges investors to request and read the fund prospectus before making an investment decision.mutual fund prospectus,sec.exch.comm n,last visited.the mere fact that congress has chosen to ensure that investors are fully informed of the fundamental investment objectives of mutual funds hardly provides a license to ignore the objectives,enshrined by shareholder approval,which a mutual fund has obligated itself to pursue.nor does it alter the fact that the purchase of those shares constitutes an acceptance of the offer by the investor.indeed,as previously observed,this is precisely how the shareholders became parties to the agreement and declaration of trust.agreement and declaration of trust every shareholder by virtue of having become a shareholder shall be held to have expressly assented and agreed to the terms hereof and to have become a party hereto.
moreover,the district judge in charles schwab did not cite any authority for his suggestion that a mandatory regulatory disclosure document can not form the basis for an implied contract.lapidus holds otherwise and the district judge in charles schwab acknowledged that,in certain circumstances prospectuses can constitute a contract.charles schwab,wl,at.indeed,even before the enactment of the securities act of,the term prospectus was well understood to refer to a document soliciting the public to acquire securities from the issuer.gustafson alloyd,citing black law dictionary ed.
in sum,we conclude that the mailing of the proxy statement and the adoption of the two fundamental investment policies after the shareholders voted to approve them,and the annual representations by the fund that it would follow these policies are sufficient to form a contract between the shareholders on the one hand and the fund and the trust on the other.the fund offered the shareholders the right to invest on these terms,and the shareholders accepted by so investing.the consideration for the contract was the shareholders investment,or continued investment,in the fund,and the parties object was lawful.the conduct of the parties thus fulfills all the requirements for a binding contract under traditional common law principles.see lord,williston on contracts at ed.
we are aware that judge koh held that,under the particular circumstances of this case,northstar failed to successfully allege the formation and breach of a contract.d at.she reasoned that 
a september,statement of additional information was issued which stated that the fund would,from then on,cease to treat securities issued by private lenders as a separate industry and therefore could invest more than of the fund assets in this area would seem to defeat plaintiffs contract claim.if this became a term of the contract between plaintiffs and the trust when investors held or subsequently purchased shares,then the trust could not have breached this contract by in mbs,as plaintiffs claim.
we are not persuaded.northstar alleged that the sai statement that the funds have determined that securities issued by private lenders are not part of any industry for the purposes of the funds concentration policies,northstar fin.advisors,schwab,cv lhk,statement of additional information,at,doc,was an improper attempt to circumvent the fund concentration policy that limited investment in one industry to of its assets because no vote was taken to approve it.this position was supported by a complaint filed by the securities and exchange commission,which alleged that the schwab trust deviated from its policy on concentration for the schwab total bond market fund by deciding to not treat securities as an industry without shareholder approval.appellees br.citing sec charles schwab inv.mgmt,cv,compl,doc.
specifically,the sec charged that before august,the concentration policy stated that b ased on characteristics of securities,the total bond fund has identified securities issued by private lenders and not guaranteed by the government agencies or instrumentalities as a separate industry for purposes of the fund concentration policy.sec charles schwab inv.mgmt,cv,compl,doc.see also schwab investments,statement of additional information form n,part b.the position of the sec was that,because schwab had identified securities issued by private lenders as an industry,the total bond fund could not invest more than of its assets in mbs without obtaining shareholder approval under section a of the ica.sec charles schwab schwab inv.mgmt,cv n,compl.
judge koh reliance on the september,sai,even if correct,overlooks the fact that the fund concentration policy was only one of the two fundamental investment objectives from which the defendants could not depart without shareholder approval.the primary violation was causing the fund to deviate from its fundamental investment objective to seek to track the investment results of the lehman brothers aggregate bond index through the use of an indexing strategy.the complaint then goes on to allege that the fund also deviated from its stated fundamental investment objective by investing more than of its total assets in agency and securities and cmos.
the sai did not provide any notice that the defendants intended to depart from the first of the fundamental objectives which obligated the fund to seek to track the investment results of the lehman index.thus,even if judge koh was correct in her analysis with respect to the breach of the second investment objective,as to which notice was provided in the sai,the complaint still sufficiently states a claim for breach of contract.this is true with respect to those who purchased before september,and held on to their shares afterward,and those who purchased after that date.
particularly as to those who purchased before september,and held onto their shares,we are not prepared to assume that the sai itself was sufficient to provide adequate notice.an sai,affords the fund an opportunity to expand discussions of the matters described in the prospectus by including additional information that the fund believes may be of interest to some investors.glazer,prospectus disclosure and delivery requirements,in mutual fund regulation quoting sec.exch.comm n,form n at,available at last visited.the sai is not automatically provided investors but must be available free of charge upon request.id.moreover,the sai may be specifically incorporated by reference into the prospectus without delivering the sai with the prospectus.id.d.while there may be sophisticated shareholders who make the effort to ask for an sai or read it with the care necessary to digest the relevant parts of a long and multifaceted document,we think it is reasonable to assume that there are many ordinary shareholders who do not do so.indeed,even if a mutual fund could alter a fundamental investment objective by the vehicle of an sai,it should provide current shareholders with clear and unambiguous notice of the alteration that it wishes to make.
breach of fiduciary duty claim 
northstar alleged that the schwab defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to ensure that the fund was managed in accordance with the fundamental investment objectives and by changing the fund fundamental investment objectives without obtaining required shareholder authorization.the district judge held that northstar failed to successfully allege a breach of any duty owed directly to fund investors,and that these claims would have to be asserted derivatively.northstar fin.advisors,schwab,d.
defendants conceded at oral argument that the allegations in the operative complaint are sufficient to state a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.they argue,however,that the trustees did not owe a fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries of the schwab trust namely,the shareholders.instead,they argue that because of the close resemblance of a mutual fund operated as a massachusetts business trust to a corporation,the trustees should be treated in the same way as corporate directors,who owe fiduciary duties to the corporation rather than to its shareholders.appellees br.at.this argument provides the predicate for the claim that northstar was required to proceed by way of a derivative action.
there are several deficiencies in this argument.first,it simply ignores the plain terms of the agreement and declaration of trust.
the document states expressly that 
the trustees hereby declare that they will hold all cash,securities and other assets,which they may from time to time acquire in any manner as trustees hereunder in trust to manage and dispose of the same for the pro rata benefit of the holders from time to time of shares in this trust.
agreement and declaration of trust.we are not aware of any massachusetts case that holds that agreements of this kind can not be enforced directly by the beneficiaries of a trust.
second,the supreme judicial court of massachusetts has held that i t is axiomatic that the trustees stand in a fiduciary relationship to all the beneficiaries of the trust.fogelin nordblom,see also dukeminier,sitkoff lindgren,wills,trusts,and estates in managing the portfolio,the trustee is subject to a fiduciary obligation to the investors in the mutual fund john langbein,the secret life of the trust the trust as an instrument of commerce,yale,the familiar standards of trust fiduciary law protect trust beneficiaries of all sorts,regardless of whether the trust implements a gift or a business deal unless,of course,the terms of the transaction expressly contraindicate.while the supreme judicial court of massachusetts has acknowledged similarities between corporations and business trusts,it has held that business trusts are not corporations,nor are they entities apart from the trustees.swartz sher.under these circumstances,there is no logical basis for the argument that the trustees of a mutual fund organized as a massachusetts business trust owe a fiduciary duty to the trust,rather than the shareholders,and that for this reason they are limited to a derivative action on behalf of the trust.
lapidus hecht,cir,upon which defendants rely,does not support their position.lapidus involved two discrete claims of wrongdoing.the first,which is comparable to the cause of action here,was based on deviations from the investment objectives of the mutual fund and the issuance of senior securities without shareholder approval.id.at citing a.the second cause of action involved the issuance of senior securities in violation of section f.
lapidus first addressed the issue of whether a direct action could be brought for the departure from the mutual fund investment objectives and the issuance of senior securities without shareholder approval.lapidus,at.we held that,t o bring a direct action under massachusetts law,a plaintiff must allege an injury distinct from that suffered by shareholders generally or a wrong involving one of his or her contractual rights,such as the right to vote.lapidus,at emphasis added.we then went on to observe that the plaintiffs alleged violations of their contractual rights as shareholders to vote on proposed changes to the short sale and senior security restrictions.id.such claims could be brought directly.id.
lapidus then addressed the second cause of action based on the allegedly improper issuance of senior securities,id.at,in violation of federal law,id.at.this action could not be brought directly because it failed both parts of the disjunctive test.first,the injury was not distinct from the injury to all shareholders holding the same series of stock because the alleged improper issuance of senior securities would be an injury to the trust generally.id.at.second,the alleged improper issuance was unconnected to any violation of voting rights or any other contractual right.id.
the first prong of the test was applied with respect to both causes of action in lapidus,namely,that to bring a direct action under law,a plaintiff must allege an injury distinct from that suffered by shareholders generally.id.we refer to law because lapidus relied on two delaware cases and one massachusetts case applying delaware law for the circumstances under which a direct action may be brought under massachusetts law.at.the delaware law has since changed.thus,in tooley donaldson,lufkin,jenrette,the supreme court of delaware rejected,as confusing,the concept that an action can not be direct if all stockholders are equally affected or unless the stockholder injury is separate and distinct from that suffered by other stockholders.id.at.
moreover,even if that prong survived the holding in tooley,a direct action in this case would be appropriate under the second prong of the disjunctive test applied in lapidus because the plaintiffs allege a wrong involving one of their contractual rights as shareholder s.at.northstar breach of contract cause of action rests on the deviation by defendants from two fundamental investment objectives,which required a shareholder vote change,without first obtaining shareholder approval.the right to vote,however,is not the only contractual right at issue.instead,it is inextricably intertwined with the restrictions placed on the power of the trustees to invest the assets of the fund.until the fundamental investment objectives were amended by shareholder vote,the investors had a contractual right to have the fund managed in accordance with those objectives.
the third deficiency in defendants argument that this action must be brought derivatively is that the distinction between direct and derivative actions has little meaning in the context of mutual funds,at least on the facts present here.a publicly held corporation,in contrast to a mutual fund,engages in a business,the buying and selling of widgets,in which the accretion of share price is generally the byproduct of business success,and the depletion of share price can be the of either unsuccessful business decisions or misconduct by fiduciaries.the particular facts in the latter scenario will determine whether claims against corporate officers are derivative or direct in nature or both.see tooley.in a mutual fund,however,there is no business other than acquiring investment instruments for the purpose of increasing the net asset value for the pro rata benefit of the holders of shares in this trust.agreement and declaration of trust.any decrease in a mutual fund share price flows directly and immediately to the shareholders.this is particularly true when such an injury results from the failure to comply with a fund fundamental investment objectives.thus,such misconduct supports a direct action.
there may be scenarios where a mutual fund trustee can be sued only derivatively for example,if he embezzles assets held by the fund,the injury may be first to the mutual fund and only secondarily to the investors in the fund.but that is not this case.rather,this case alleges a failure to follow trading restrictions,the very essence of the fund business,which,accepting the allegations as true,caused a diminution in shareholder value.the claim supports a direct action because the impact is directly on the investors in the fund and a recovery would not be dependent on demonstrating an injury to the schwab trust.tooley,at holding that a corporate stockholder who brings a direct action must demonstrate that the duty breached was owed to the stockholder and that he or she can prevail without showing an injury to the corporation.
even if we were to accept defendants attempt to analogize the fund to a publicly held corporation,their argument that northstar may only sue derivatively would fail.significantly,the principles of corporate governance promulgated by the american law institute ali recognize that in circumstances comparable to this case,a direct action may be appropriate.thus,in a comment to,the section that is captioned direct and derivative actions distinguished,the ali observes 
in some instances,actions that essentially involve the structural relationship of the shareholder to the corporation which thus should be seen as direct actions may also give rise to a derivative action when the corporation suffers or is threatened with a loss.one example would be a case in which a corporate official knowingly acts in a manner that the certificate of incorporation denied the official authority to do,thereby violating both specific restraints imposed by the shareholders and the official duty of care.in such cases,the plaintiff may opt to plead either a direct or a derivative action,or to bring both actions simultaneously,unless the court finds that the plaintiff is unable to provide fair and adequate representation pursuant to a standing to commence and maintain a derivative action.
american law institute,principles of corporate governance,cmt.c 
the present case involves the same kind of structural relationship of shareholders to the schwab trust that the foregoing comment addresses.of course,we deal here with an agreement and declaration of trust rather than a certificate of incorporation.the adoption by the shareholders of the fundamental investment objectives of the fund effectively imposed a restraint on the structural relationship in the agreement and declaration of trust comparable to an amendment of a certificate of incorporation.the allegations in the complaint,although not in haec verba,are sufficient to support an argument that the trustees violat ed both specific restraints imposed by the shareholders and the official s duty of care.ali,principles of corporate governance,cmt.thus,even if the same rules that apply to corporations are applied to the schwab trust,this is the kind of case in which the plaintiff may opt to plead either a direct or a derivative action.id.
moreover,there is another reason,directly rooted in massachusetts case law,which provides a basis for permitting a direct action even against a corporation.while massachusetts cases generally preclude direct actions where corporate recovery for misdeeds by a corporate fiduciary is available under traditional corporate law,they contain the significant caveat that such recovery must provide a just measure of relief to the complaining stockholder.crowley commc ns for,see also diamond pappathanasi.rptr,wl,at s hareholders may resort to a direct,personal action against a miscreant fiduciary where a corporate recovery would not provide a just measure of relief to the complaining shareholder.we have likewise acknowledged that,even where corporate shareholders have been relegated to pursue their claims in a derivative action,a direct action may be appropriate to provide a remedy to shareholders who have been injured and who would not recover under the traditional rules governing derivative actions.see,eagle am,cir.
this case is one in which a recovery by the schwab trust would not provide a just measure of relief to the complaining shareholder.diamond,wl,at.any recovery in a derivative action would simply increase the net asset value of the fund at the time any damages were recovered.consequently,as defendants conceded at oral argument,if a derivative suit is successfully prosecuted,all current shareholders would participate in the recovery by the schwab trust even if they were not shareholders during the relevant time period,and injured former shareholders would not necessarily participate in the recovery at all.
significantly,the remedy agreed to in an enforcement action by the sec avoids such a n un just measure of relief to the complaining shareholders.crowley,at.the action,as we have previously observed,was based on the allegation that the schwab trust improperly deviated from its policy on concentration for the fund by deciding to not treat securities as an industry without shareholder approval.appellees br.at citing sec charles schwab inv.mgmt,cv,compl,doc.a consent judgment was entered requiring the schwab trust to disgorge profits and prejudgment interest.appellees br.at citing sec charles schwab inv.mgmt,cv,consent to enter,doc.the schwab trust,however,did not share in the recovery.instead,the settlement proceeds were deposited by the defendants into a fund for distribution to adversely affected investors,including investors in the fund.appellees br.at citing sec charles schwab inv.mgmt,cv,order approving distribution plan with modification,doc.this kind of remedy could be obtained if this direct class action is successful.
halebian berv,upon which defendants rely,does not compel a contrary result.the defendants correctly argue that halebian held,in an appropriate case,a shareholder of a mutual fund may be forced to resort to making a demand on the trustees to file a derivative action.nevertheless,halebian did not address the circumstances under which such a course of action would be required.instead,it held that the statute regulating derivative actions.laws ch,applies to a shareholder bringing such a claim against a corporation or a business trust.id.at.because the plaintiff had filed a derivative action,halebian went on to address the narrow issue of whether the legislature intended that the provisions for dismissal under apply only to derivative proceedings that are commenced after rejection of a demand,or to any derivative proceeding where a plaintiff shareholder demand has been rejected by the corporation.id.at.
moreover,the allegations in that case were quite unlike the misconduct alleged here.in halebian,the plaintiff claimed that the trustees failed to engage in competitive bidding in their selection of an investment adviser.id.at.a derivative suit was arguably appropriate in the case because the injury to the shareholders was the attenuated result of an improper trust expenditure the investment adviser fee.
nor are we persuaded by the policy arguments defendants rely on to support treating this case as a derivative action.defendants argue that b y requiring shareholders to demand that a corporation bring a claim before filing a derivative action,derivative action rules allow disinterested directors to halt suits that are meritless or contrary to the corporation interest and allow them to exercise their judgment and oversee litigation in the best interest of the company.appellees br.at citing.laws ch,daily income fund,at halebian,at.moreover,they go on to argue that,applying derivative action rules in this context ensures that disinterested trustees remain primarily responsible for management of a trust litigation.appellees br.at.this argument is particularly unpersuasive in light of the manner in which massachusetts business trusts that operate mutual funds conduct business.the supreme court has recognized that mutual funds are typically organized and underwritten by the same firm that serves as the company investment advisor.kamen,at.they are essentially puppets of the investment adviser.
moreover,although fund boards have been required to include a percentage of independent directors,the definition of independent is fairly loose when it comes to fund board members.shipman,so who owns your mutual fund,wall j,may,at.as one commentator has observed 
an independent director ca be an employee of the fund investment adviser or a member of the immediate family of an employee.other restrictions also apply.but former employees of the fund investment adviser or the adviser affiliates are considered to be independent when it comes to serving on a fund board.so,for example,joseph dimartino,who was president of dreyfus for a dozen years before becoming chairman of the fund boards for the dreyfus fund group,is considered an independent director.
id.indeed,notwithstanding the requirement that a percentage of the members of the mutual fund board be independent from the adviser,congress required that the shareholders of the fund annually approve the adviser contract.this requirement reflected the fact that the trustees of a mutual fund can not seriously be expected to induce arm length bargaining.as the sec long ago recognized,any independent directors would obviously have to be satisfactory to the dominating stockholders who are in a position to continue to elect a responsive board.fox,at quoting in re petroleum trading.under these circumstances,it is wrong to suggest that applying derivative action rules in this context ensures that disinterested trustees remain primarily responsible for management of a trust litigation.appellees br.at.this is particularly true here because one of the principal defendants,aside from the trustees themselves,is the schwab advisor.
there are,of course,other reasons commonly advanced for distinguishing between a derivative action,which is brought on the corporation behalf against either corporate fiduciaries or third persons,and a direct action,which is brought on a shareholder own behalf against either corporate fiduciaries or the corporation itself.eisenberg cox,corporations and other business organizations.the first has been described as theoretical since a corporation is a legal person separate from its shareholders,an injury to the corporation is not an injury to its shareholders.this proposition is somewhat dubious,because every injury to a corporation must also have an impact,however slight,on the shareholders as well.id.the other,and more compelling,reasons of policy are summed up in watson button as follows to avoid a multiplicity of suits by each injured shareholder,to protect the corporate creditors,and to protect all the stockholders since a corporate recovery benefits all equally,cir see also eisenberg cox,corporations and other business organizations.significantly,two of these three policy objectives,which defendants also put forward here,are ameliorated by the very nature of the class action,which is designed to avoid a multiplicity of suits by shareholders and which contain procedural mechanisms to ensure that all members of the class are treated equally.moreover,to the extent that one of the reasons for favoring a derivative suit is a concern for the protection of creditors,it is enough to say here that the defendants do not argue that the concern is at issue in this case.
third party beneficiary of contract claims 
the schwab trust entered into an agreement with the schwab advisor to serve as its investment adviser and administrator of the fund.the schwab advisor expressly agreed to use the same skill and care in providing such services as it would use in providing services to fiduciary accounts if it had investment responsibilities for such accounts.the principal duty of the schwab advisor,as prescribed in the iaa with the schwab trust,was to determine from time to time what securities and other investments would be purchased,retained,or sold by the fund.this agreement with the schwab advisor was expressly approved by the shareholders of the fund.northstar alleges that the schwab advisor breached the iaa by managing the fund in a manner inconsistent with the fund fundamental investment objectives,and that the shareholders may hold the schwab advisor liable for such a breach as beneficiaries of the iaa.
the iaa expressly states that it shall be governed by the laws of the state of california.under california civil code,a critical element of a cause of action is a showing that the contract was made expressly for the benefit of a third person.the phrase,however,has been held not to mean exclusively,hartman ranch associated oil,cal,solely,le ballister redwood theatres,or primar il y,montgomery dorn,for the benefit of a third person.similarly,the term has been construed not to require that performance be rendered directly to the beneficiary,lucas hamm,cal,or that the beneficiary be specifically named or identified in the contract,garratt baker,cal.
consequently,its connotative meaning having been destroyed by judicial interpretation,the term expressly has now come to mean merely the negative of incidentally.kay bruce,martinez socoma companies problems in determining contract beneficiaries rights,hastings,footnotes omitted.indeed,the supreme court of california has explicitly held that t he effect of the section is to exclude enforcement by persons who are only incidentally or remotely benefited.lucas,p d at see also spinks equity residential briarwood apartments,d,judith kline brent olson,california business law deskbook.
under these circumstances,the critical issue is w hether the third party is an intended beneficiary.balsam tucows,cir quoting prouty gores tech,d.the resolution of this issue,in turn,involves construction of the intention of the parties,gathered from reading the contract as a whole in light of the circumstances under which it was entered.id.quoting prouty,d at restatement second of contracts,reporter note a court in determining the parties intention should consider the circumstances surrounding the transaction as well as the actual language of the contract.citing cases.insofar as intent to benefit a third person is important in determining his right to bring an action under a contract,it is sufficient that the promisor must have understood that the promisee had such intent.lucas,at.
northstar has adequately alleged an intent to benefit a third person.northstar has also plausibly alleged that the schwab advisor understood that it was the intent of the schwab trust to benefit the shareholders of the fund.moreover,compelling evidence lending plausibility to the beneficiary cause of action,based on the premise that the shareholders are intended beneficiaries of the iaa,is that congress has required that the contract between the adviser and the company be approved by a majority of the company shareholders.kamen,at citing a see also navellier sletten,cir david sturms renee hardt,regulation of the advisory contract,in mutual fund regulation clifford kirsch,ed.
thus,the agreement between the schwab trust and the schwab advisor explicitly provides that it has been approved by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of such schwab fund,in accordance with the requirements under the ica.this suffices to establish that the shareholders have more than a remote relationship to the contract between the schwab trust and the schwab advisor.rather,it indicates the direct relationship that the shareholders have with the iaa and the fact that they are the actual beneficiaries of the iaa.indeed,as we have held,the requirement for shareholder approval,which is imposed by the ica,reflect s the judgment of congress that stockholders of the investment company have a substantial interest in evaluating the new owners of an investment manager.zell intercapital income,cir citing a.
the sufficiency of the complaint is also supported by a number of california cases.specifically,in gilbert financial steelform contracting,the plaintiff,a property owner,entered into a contract with a general contractor for the construction of a building.the general contractor subcontracted work to the defendant.the california court of appeal held that the plaintiff was an intended beneficiary of the subcontract between the general contractor and the defendant,even though the plaintiff was not specifically named.id.at.indeed,the allegations in the complaint demonstrated that the subcontractor had,in effect,assumed the role of the general contractor to provide construction services for the plaintiff,such that the plaintiff was the ultimate beneficiary of the contract between the subcontractor and the general contractor.id.at.
applying the reasoning of gilbert,the fund shareholders are comparable to the property owners,the schwab trust is comparable to the general contractor,and the schwab advisor is comparable to the subcontractor.the schwab trust engaged the schwab advisor to manage and operate the fund in accordance with the fundamental investment objectives that the shareholders had adopted.in this situation,the schwab advisor management of the fund directly affected whether the fund achieved its stated goal of tracking the lehman index.thus,the ultimate beneficiary of the schwab advisor contractual duties were the shareholders.
a more recent case,spinks equity residential briarwood apartments,d,is similarly analogous.in spinks,an employer had contracted with a landlord to provide housing for an employee.sometime thereafter,the employer terminated the employee and directed the landlord to change the locks on the employee apartment,which the landlord did.the employee brought suit against the landlord as a beneficiary of the contract between the employer and the landlord.the california court of appeal held that the employee had adequately alleged that she was an intended beneficiary.see id.at.in so holding,the court noted that the most basic aspect of the landlord performance is its obligation to supply the employer with a place for its staff to live.id.at.in the present case,the most basic aspect of the schwab advisor performance properly managing the fund is for the benefit of the shareholders.
nor does the fact that the iaa contained an inurement clause providing that it shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors,preclude a beneficiary action in the context of this case.the defendants cite cases holding that,because the parties specified one particular beneficiary in the contract,other beneficiaries are excluded.these cases are not dispositive.the cases upon which the defendants rely do not speak to this issue or are not controlling.for instance,klamath water users protective ass patterson,cir,involved a governmental contract,not a private contract.parties that benefit from a government contract are generally assumed to be incidental beneficiaries,and may not enforce the contract absent a clear intent to the contrary.id.at.arista films.emp.profit sharing plan gilford,d,the only california case the defendants cite,concerned an arbitration contract,where the overwhelming weight of authority was against enforcement,and which was governed by new york law,not california law.id.at.
the other cases on which the defendants rely are all from courts outside california and this circuit.at this stage in the case a motion to dismiss we follow those courts that have ruled that any weight that should be given to an inurement clause is outweighed by the other evidence of the parties intent,anwar fairfield greenwich,d,see also solid host,nl namecheap,d,cal because they involve factual questions of intent,third party beneficiary claims are often not appropriate for resolution via motion to dismiss.
under california law,as the district judge recognized,a plaintiff may be a beneficiary of a contract if he alleges that he is a member of a class named or referred to in the contract,or if the contract discharges a contractual duty owed to the plaintiff.northstar,d at.we hold,contrary to the district judge,that northstar has adequately alleged the existence of a contract between the trust and the investors.northstar has also alleged that the iaa was designed to discharge the trust duties to the shareholders under this contract.therefore,northstar allegations that the shareholders are beneficiaries of the iaa survive the motion to dismiss 
therefore,we hold that northstar allegations that the shareholders are beneficiaries of the iaa survive the motion to dismiss.
conclusion 
to summarize 
we hold that by filing a supplemental pleading alleging a assignment from a party that clearly had standing,northstar has standing to prosecute this case.
we reverse the district judge dismissal of northstar breach of contract claim and hold that northstar adequately alleged the formation of a contract between the investors and the schwab trust.
we vacate the district judge dismissal of the fiduciary duty claims and remand for the district judge to address the other arguments raised by the parties regarding northstar claims for breach of fiduciary duty.northstar,d at.
we reverse the district judge dismissal of northstar beneficiary breach of contract claim and hold that northstar adequately alleged that the investors are beneficiaries of the iaa.
we decline to address the effect of slusa on the various common law causes of action.we leave that to the district court in the first instance.
reversed in part,vacated in part,and remanded.
when northstar financial advisors,northstar commenced this action by filing its complaint,it did not own,nor had it ever owned any schwab total bond market fund fund shares.likewise,at the commencement of this action,northstar did not own any claims of anyone who had owned any of such shares during the period when the defendants are alleged improperly to have lowered the share value of the fund.
hence,when northstar sued for damages on its own behalf and for those of the class of share owners northstar sought to represent in this class action,northstar itself had not suffered any losses,nor did northstar own any claims of others who had suffered losses the defendants had allegedly caused.last,no other person who claimed to have been injured by defendants joined northstar as plaintiff.
defendants moved to dismiss northstar complaint for lack of standing,because northstar failed to allege it had suffered an injury in fact northstar had no case or controversy within the meaning of article iii of the constitution 
the district court quite properly granted defendants motion and dismissed the complaint without prejudice but then quite misguidedly suggested that through an amended complaint,northstar could remedy its lack of standing by an assignment of rights from a person who had been a fund shareholder during the period when defendants allegedly injured the fund shareholders.more than three months later,northstar found henry holz,a man who had indeed owned fund shares during the period in question.holz could claim injury in fact he did have standing to sue.but for reasons best known to himself,he chose neither to sue nor to join northstar action.northstar procured an assignment of holz claims against defendants.
northstar then filed an amended complaint that alleged holz assignment of claims to northstar.defendants again moved to dismiss on the ground that northstar still had not alleged facts sufficient to establish northstar standing to sue,only to have the district court deny the motion upon an original but nonetheless erroneous theory.the district court noted that in light of the previous holding that an assignment of claims would cure the northstar lack of standing,and direction to the northstar to file an amended complaint based on the assignment,it would be unfair to northstar to punish them for relying on the prior district judge specific instructions.northstar,d at of course,if this notion of unfairness were the law,parties benefitted by erroneous rulings of district courts and who took action in reliance on such erroneous rulings could not be made to give up those benefits.
thankfully,there is no exception to the requirement of standing based on earlier district court error it is not unfair to lose a meritless point won earlier before an erring judge.what is unfair is not to apply the correct law.here,both district court judges erred.because northstar failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute standing to sue in its complaint,the district court originally lacked subject matter jurisdiction.see cetacean cmty.bush,cir.it was not even permissible to grant leave to amend to see if the standing defect could somehow be remedied.see footnote,supra.but even if permissible,an amendment to allege an assignment of rights which took place over three months after the action was commenced was useless to allege the standing northstar needed to commence the action in the first place.morongo band of mission indians cal.state bd.of equalization,cir citing mollan torrance,jurisdiction depends upon the state of things at the time of the action brought nuclear eng g scott,cir jurisdictional questions are answered by reference to the time of the filing of an action mobil oil kelley,cir jurisdiction is determined at the outset of the suit.to determine federal court jurisdiction,we look to the original,rather than to the amended complaint.id.
the first district court judge did not have jurisdiction to grant leave to amend,and the second judge could not out of considerations of fairness allow an amendment or a supplement to an original complaint of which the district court had no subject matter jurisdiction.
the majority and the district court opinion examine the law of other circuits because there is no published ninth circuit authority as to whether parties may cure standing deficiencies through supplemental pleadings.northstar,d at.in dicta this court reiterated the general principle that jurisdiction is based on facts that exist at the time of filing and noted that the supreme court has enunciated few exceptions to this general principle so far,permitting standing based on a property interest acquired after filing is not one of them.righthaven,llc hoehn,cir in any event,even if this panel were not bound by the dicta of righthaven,morongo is dispositive where the district court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over a matter at the time of filing,subsequent events do not confer subject matter jurisdiction on the district court.the district court has jurisdiction only to dismiss the complaint 
nevertheless,the majority cites to limited exceptions where courts have allowed the cure of jurisdictional defects other than standing through additional pleadings.in short,the district court and the majority argue that if a supplemental pleading can cure defects in the original complaint,and if that supplemental pleading can be tacked onto the original complaint,then northstar would retroactively have standing as of its original complaint,even though jurisdiction depends on the state of things at the time of the action brought.rockwell intern.u,internal quotations and citation omitted.this argument misses one crucial point t he state of things and the originally alleged state of things are not synonymous.id.therefore,even if our circuit allowed supplemental pleadings to cure standing deficiencies,those supplemental pleadings must allege facts necessary to establish standing only as those facts existed at the time of the original complaint.this is not a novel concept in our circuit.see wilbur locke,cir,abrogated on other grounds by levin commerce energy,s tanding is determined as of the date of the filing of the complaint t he party invoking the jurisdiction of the court can not rely on events that unfolded after the filing of the complaint to establish its standing.internal quotations and citation omitted.in other words,even though a party may serve a supplemental pleading setting out any transaction,occurrence,or event that happened after the date of the pleading to be supplemented.d emphasis added,the facts which establish a party standing must have existed when the original complaint was filed.thus a.d supplemental pleading can not validly allege transactions to cure a lack of standing
