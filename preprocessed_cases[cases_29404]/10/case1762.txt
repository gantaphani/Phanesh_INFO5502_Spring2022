appellants are jeffrey koehl,wendy lingo,terrence mccarthy,and john brehm when referred to collectively,appellants,former sales associates at respondent verio,verio.appellants compensation plans provided for base pay and commissions,which commissions were paid when an order was booked,but which verio could recover,or charge back,if certain conditions were not met.the fundamental question presented by this appeal is whether the commissions were wages,thus making the chargebacks unlawful under section of the labor code.the trial court concluded that the commissions were not wages,and entered judgment for verio.our review leads to the same conclusion,and we affirm.
a.the parties 
verio is an internet service provider that sells internet access and web hosting services.its internet access customers are predominantly businesses with high volume internet needs that generally require the purchase and installation of equipment and hardware in order to obtain ongoing internet access through fiber optic lines.in,verio was purchased by nippon telephone and telegraph corporation ntt and began doing business as.
appellants worked primarily as sales associates for verio between and.lingo began her employment in february as a sales associate and was a major sales associate when she left in may or june.brehm was a sales associate from july to september.koehl was employed from february to april,first as a sales associate and later in key accounts development,which was,as he described it,a program set up where they basically picked the top or reps in the county,started a new sales division that the main goal was to go out and hunt for fortune,fortune,and any business.mccarthy,the only named plaintiff who did not testify at trial,was a sales associate from march until june.
sales associates earned base salaries,described as their standard wage or base pay,of between and per year this amount remained constant regardless of the number of deals they booked.in other words,sales associates earned their base salaries for performing their basic job duties as employees of verio,and received that base salary every month regardless of whether they booked any business.in addition to their base salaries,sales associates also earned commissions on sales pursuant to a series of compensation plans described in detail below.they earned commissions for their results,for sales that resulted in revenue for verio.
b.the sales process 
the duties of the sales associates involved typical sales functions,described by verio as identifying customers,building relationships,attempting to sell internet service,booking deals,following up with customers to finalize sales,and serving as a point of contact for billing and service questions after a sale.when a sales associate obtained an order,he or she would submit to the provisioning department a service order form,a form consisting of the customer name,contact information,services being ordered,and terms of the agreement.at this point the order was booked and the sales associate received an advance payment for the anticipated commission,without verification that the customer was a real company,that the signature was authentic,or that the customer had the financial ability to pay.in short,booking the order did not include an assessment of the quality of the business,but was an administrative step to make certain that the order form was complete.manager approval of an order was not required unless the order deviated from verio standard terms.after an order was booked,the provisioning department called the customer to arrange for installation.
responsibilities after booking 
although the provisioning department was directly responsible for making sure that service was installed,the sales associates also had significant ongoing responsibilities with customers after an order was booked.they acted as a contact point with the customers,directed them to others within verio on technical and billing issues,and served as problem solvers,all to the end of making sure that the orders were billing could begin.as lingo explained it,she acted as the contact person if a customer encountered any problems,directing the customer to the appropriate department,such as customer service or billing and collections,for corrective action.she had constant contact with customers to ensure that their system was up and running,playing a key role in maintaining the customer happiness,which made them more likely to pay.the testimony of brehm and koehl was similar,as shown by that of brehm 
q after you booked a deal and you were advanced the commission,it was part of your job,was it not,to make sure that the customer was happy after booking 
q and so that they would install the business after booking it correct 
q and that they would actually start making the payments correct 
q you would do whatever you could to resolve any customer problems 
q and that was part of your job,to stay in touch,resolve problems,make sure the business started paying correct 
q all that after the booking right 
d.the compensation plans 
central to the issues in this case were the compensation plans,typically called the sales associate compensation plan,which governed the manner in which sales associates were paid by verio.and more specifically central were the portions of the plans concerning commissions and chargebacks,which are set forth in detail here for the years to.
the sales compensation plan 
the sales compensation plan contained a section entitled monthly revenue commissions section that explained the calculation of commissions due sales associates this incentive,compensation components are calculated based on the total amount of recurring revenue booked for the accounting month.commission of the eligible commission will be paid on the last pay period of the next month after the sale booking,with the balance due upon installation of the customer circuit assumed to occur no later than the last pay period of the second month after sale booking.commissions for bookings with expected installation date of days or longer from the booking date will be paid at circuit order and at installation.
pertinent to the chargebacks at issue here,section of the plan,account cancellation charge back,provided as follows 
verio,sales management has the right to impose a charge back on all accounts canceled with days of activation.
the charge back will be 
charge backs will be treated as a reduction in revenue credit in the month following the account cancellation.
the direct sales compensation plan 
the direct sales compensation plan provided,in section on commissions,that if a sales associate met of his or her quota,the commission would be between and of the monthly recurring revenue,defined in section as the amount agreed to be paid by the customer per month for the particular service desired it further provided,as to when commissions are paid verio has two paydays per month the first is the,and the second is the last day of the month.if the installation is expected to occur within days after the order is booked,the full commission will be paid on the second payday of the month following the month the order was booked.if the installation is scheduled or contracted to occur more than days after the order is booked,of the commission will be paid on the second payday of the month following the month the order was booked and the remaining of the commission will be paid on the next payday following the installation date.a supervisor has the discretion to require that a commission not be paid until installation in those circumstances that require a supervisor approval before allowing the sale to be made a low margin sale,a significant discount given.please note that verio is paying commission in some instances prior to when the commission is actually earned,which does not occur until the service or product has been delivered,accepted and payment has been received by verio.
the plan provided in section,account cancellation verio management has the right to seek reimbursement for any commission paid for any account canceled prior to billing and up to days after activation of the service.the reimbursement will come out of the sales associate commission in the month following the account cancellation.
the sales associate compensation plans 
the record contains two different compensation plans for in the sales associate compensation plan dated january,section on commissions provided a commission is defined as the percentage amount of monthly recurring revenue and monthly revenue that the sales associate is entitled to receive.the percentage amount of monthly revenue the sales associate is eligible to receive is based on how close the sales associate is to reaching the assigned quota,using a percentage figure.commissions are based on the total revenue brought in on new orders booked for each month commissions are not earned until after three months of monthly recurring revenue payments have been received however verio will begin paying commissions before they are actually earned.
in section on commission payments,the plan again noted verio is paying commission prior to when the commission is actually earned,which does not occur until the service or product has been delivered,accepted and payment has been received by verio for three months.
section,account cancellation chargebacks provided verio management has the right to seek reimbursement for any commission paid for an account cancelled prior to receiving three full months of monthly recurring revenue payments from the customer.the reimbursement will come out of the sales associate commission in the month following the account cancellation.
the sales associate compensation plan dated may,was identical as far as sections and concerning the payment of commissions.however,section,account cancellation chargebacks now provided verio management has the right to seek reimbursement for any commission paid for an account cancelled prior to receiving three full months of monthly recurring revenue payments from the customer.this reimbursement is referred to as a chargeback.by signing below,verio has the right to deduct from a sales associate future paycheck any chargeback verio is owed.
the sales associate compensation plan 
the material terms of the sales associate compensation plan were the same as the material terms in the plans,except that in,verio began paying commissions upon installation,rather than at booking a commission is defined as the percentage amount of monthly recurring revenue and revenue that the sales associate is entitled to receive for an installed product.the percentage amount of monthly revenue the sales associate is eligible to receive is based on the profitability of the sale.commissions are based on new orders and upgrades installed for each month.
the plan also expressly stated,in section,account cancellation chargebacks,that verio could deduct chargebacks from any source management has the right to seek reimbursement for all commissions paid for an account canceled for any reason prior to receiving three full months of monthly recurring revenue payments from the customer.this reimbursement is referred to as a chargeback.by signing below,the sales associate authorizes any chargeback owed under this or previous compensation plans to be deducted from the sales associate future paycheck,including salary and commissions,severance pay,right to receive cash payments,and vacation pay upon separation from.
each plan contained a final section entitled plan acknowledgment,which required the employee signed acknowledgment that he or she had read,understood,and agreed to the plan.all appellants signed all acknowledgements.
each time there was a new commission plan,verio provided a written copy of it to the sales associates,reviewed it with them,and conducted both formal and informal training on how it operated.michael mickley,a global accounts manager for,described the meetings in which management presented the plans to the sales associates basically what would happen is we get a powerpoint and highlight areas of the compensation plan for the sales associates.and so,typically,what would happen is we go over this with everybody in a meeting and it was everybody was in attendance and essentially we would go over the highlights of all of the compensation plan.at that point,what we would do is send out the compensation plan to all of the sales associates.and the compensation plan usually included everybody on that.and at that point the sales associates would get with management if they had any questions,any concerns,anything that,raise a red flag in their mind that they wanted to discuss with either upper management hr.as to whether the issue of chargebacks came up at these presentations,mickley responded,every time.mickley also testified that the issue of chargebacks was even raised with applicants during the interview process,before the individuals were hired as sales associates.
lingo,brehm,and koehl all testified that they received and read the plans,had the opportunity to ask questions about them,understood them,and signed them.and all three of them understood that the compensation plans governed the terms of their compensation.
moreover,appellants all admitted that verio paid them in advance of when the commissions were earned,and reserved the right to recover those advance payments back if the conditions for earning the commissions did not occur.for example,lingo admitted that she was only entitled to wages she earned,and if a commission was not earned,she was not entitled to it.her specific understanding was that the commission she earned was a percentage of the revenue that verio ultimately collected and,she said,if a deal canceled before it installed,she would not earn a commission on that deal.and lingo understood,just as confirmed by the plans,that verio paid commissions prior to when the commission was actually earned.
brehm testimony was the same,and could not have been more clear 
q let me ask you some questions about earning commissions under those plans.first,you not claiming any money from verio that you did not earn correct 
q your understanding of the plan is that commissions were not earned until the sales generated revenue correct 
q and your understanding of the comp plan is that you need three months of that recurring revenue before you earn a commission correct 
a i learned that,yes.
q and there nothing about that that was ambiguous to you correct 
q and you understood that verio actually paid you a commission payment before they were earned under that three months recurring revenue correct 
q so in a sense they were paying you in advance of when it was earned correct 
q now,it was also your understanding,was it not,that if you sold something and that you were advanced money at booking but then that order cancelled,that verio could take the money back that it had advanced correct 
reasons for verio commission structure 
michael linos joined verio in january,as vice president of sales in charge of the southern california region,a position he held for some months before being promoted to vice president of sales of the western region.in january,he was again promoted,this time to vice president of sales of enterprise hosting,a position he held until his employment with verio ended on december.linos was involved in the preparation of the,and compensation plans,and explained the reasons behind verio advancing commission payments while requiring three months recurring revenue before the commissions were earned.first,three months of consecutive payment was the industry standard at the time for the payment of commissions.second,it took approximately six to seven months of recurring revenue for verio to begin to recover its costs.third,advancing payment at booking and then requiring three months of recurring revenue created the right incentives for the sales associates to provide with the customer,to improve the likelihood that the customer would actually pay.
at the same time,advancing commissions was considered particularly attractive by the sales associates,as confirmed by koehl,who acknowledged that one of the attractions of working at verio as opposed to other companies was that the sales associates received their commissions at booking,rather than waiting to see if the booking actually generated revenue.
linos also explained that verio commission plan created a mechanism which he called a plan.that is,paying commissions at booking,while reserving the right to charge it back if the sale did not generate revenue,eliminated the need for verio to scrutinize every order at the time it was booked to determine whether it was good business.and this feature of the commission plans was justified by the potential for abuse by sales associates,manifest by the evidence indicating that verio paid several commissions on questionable orders.notably,while mccarthyhimself did not testify at trial,there was significant testimony about him,especially on the issue of questionable orders.michael bowers,an executive from linkline,an internet service provider and potential verio customer,testified that mccarthy urged bowers to sign what he represented to be a letter merely expressing linkline interest in purchasing bandwidth from verio in a region around ontario,california,commonly referred to as the inland empire.bowers prepared a letter indicating that a fictional entity named newco,meaning new company,would buy bandwidth if verio was able to provide it.linkline did not place an order for services with verio,yet mccarthy received commissions on the inland empire sales.
jason cavalli,a sales associate with verio since february,testified that mccarthy,his sales manager,encouraged him to j ust get the deals signed.according to cavalli,a asked mccarthy if he felt bad booking business that would never get installed,to which mccarthy responded,just get the business installed.verio wo charge you back.i made a lot of money where business has installed.cavalli also testified that on a different occasion,mccarthy and koehl contacted him about putting together a bogus deal just to get a deal booked before the end of the month,to the point that mccarthy insisted that cavalli forge a contract.cavalli refused,but confirmed that the order was nevertheless booked despite his refusal to submit it.
deanna tymochko,who began employment at verio in as a customer installation coordinator and was twice promoted to become international deal coordinator,also testified about suspicious bookings.according to tymochko,on one occasion koehl asked her not to cancel a deal with page one communications,which was experiencing legal problems that eventually led to the arrest of the owner,because koehl knew he was going to be charged back for it.koehl also kept adding additional services onto the original order,despite the fact that page one communications was not proceeding with installation on the original order.
f.the chargeback process 
vinnie john,who held the positions of finance manager,manager of billing and accounting,and commission manager prior to being laid off in june,testified regarding the administration of chargebacks.as he explained the chargeback process,when an installation order cancelled before the customer paid for the first three months,verio recovered its previous commission payment on that transaction by reducing the advance commission payments in a subsequent month.the amount of each chargeback was the same amount the sales associate had been previously advanced for the installation in issue verio effectively reversed the transaction for the specific sales associate for the specific customer order on which verio had previously paid the commission it basically an undoing of that transaction.john confirmed that verio sought recovery of the advanced commission payments only from subsequently earned commissions,never from a sales associate base pay.and the chargeback was applied only to the particular sales associate who booked the order.
although the terms of verio commission plans provided that the company could collect chargebacks on any order that cancelled before verio received three months of revenue,approximately percent of the chargebacks were on deals where the orders were cancelled before the services were ever installed,and thus before verio received any revenue at all.
mickley,the global accounts manager,also testified about the chargeback process essentially what would happen is i would get a report on a monthly basis of booked deals,and then i would also get on that very same report charged back deals.and essentially what we would do is we have an undetermined amount of time,usually about days to get with the sales associates and get with all the appropriate people to make sure,number one,that is a valid chargeback and,number two,that,you know,we should be proceeding with the chargeback to the sales associates.we did that every single month with every single employee that was commissioned.mickley explained that the sales associate then had an opportunity to dispute the chargebacks,whether for administrative reasons,clerical errors,or errors related to fault.often,if the sales associate demonstrated that verio was at fault for the failure to install,the chargeback did not occur.
chargebacks were widely discussed with appellants and the other sales associates.mickley testified,for example,that lingo discussed chargebacks with him on a regular basis,asking for the reports reflecting the proposed chargebacks in advance of when they were normally received and then trying to sell more revenue to offset the amount of chargebacks for that particular month.likewise,linos confirmed that he had many conversations with koehl and mccarthy regarding chargebacks,including a situation where verio agreed to a payment plan allowing koehl to pay back a very large chargeback over time,ultimately waiving about half of the payment for the good will of the employee.
sales associates also had access to information about whether their customers had paid the required three months revenue.this information was provided either by access to people in verio billing and provisioning departments or later through direct access to verio billing information system.appellants and other sales associates inquired about and monitored customer payment history in connection with their regular review of chargebacks and potential chargebacks.
ii.procedural background 
on august,appellants filed a class action and representative complaint for restitution of wages chargebacks,alleging that verio violated the labor code by charging back previously paid commissions when a sale failed to generate revenue.the complaint alleged three causes of action commission chargebacks in violation of labor code sections,and waiting penalties pursuant to section and unfair competition under business and professions code section et.
on november,verio filed an answer and also a to recover what verio referred to as an overpayment of unearned commissions.
on february,appellants moved for class certification which,over opposition,was granted by order dated april,certifying as a class all sales people who defendant charged back commissions paid from four years prior to the filing of appellants complaint to the date of judgment after trial herein.
on july,trial commenced before judge dondero and concluded on july.on september,the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,and on september,appellants submitted opposition to verio proposed findings and conclusions.
on december,judge dondero issued his tentative findings of fact and conclusions of law,tentatively finding in verio favor on both the complaint and the.he also tentatively concluded that as the prevailing party verio was entitled to attorneys fees pursuant to section,and ordered verio to submit a declaration of attorneys fees and interest.on january,appellants filed a notice of appeal from the tentative findings of fact and conclusions of law appeal no.
on january,verio filed a declaration of daniel friesen regarding attorneys fees and interest.friesen,counsel for verio,detailed the attorney and paralegal time spent on each component of the case up through posttrial work,with documentation,supporting attorneys fees in the amount of.friesen declaration also contained a calculation of interest owed by mccarthy,koehl,and brehm on the overpaid commissions from the date of their respective terminations until an estimated judgment date of january.on february,appellants filed opposition,challenging only verio entitlement to attorneys fees,not the fees themselves.verio filed a reply.on march,judge dondero heard verio request for attorneys fees and interest,and by order of april,awarded verio,as the prevailing party under section.judge dondero also awarded verio prejudgment interest in the amount of,allocated among mccarthy,koehl,and brehm.on april,appellants filed an notice of appeal from order granting defendant verio motion for attorneys fees appeal no.
meanwhile,on february,judge dondero entered his statement of decision and findings of fact and conclusions of law,accompanied by a memorandum of decision adopting the court tentative findings of fact and conclusions of law.on february,appellants moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,which verio opposed,and which we presume judge dondero denied,though the ruling is nowhere in the record.
on may,judge dondero entered judgment following court trial in favor of verio and against appellants on both the complaint and the,the latter awarding verio damages of against mccarthy,against brehm,and against koehl.the judgment also provided that appellants were jointly and severally liable to verio for in attorneys fees.
on may,appellants filed a timely notice of appeal from judgment following court trial appeal no.
on august,we ordered appellants three appeals consolidated for purposes of briefing,oral argument,and decision pursuant to the stipulation of the parties 
iii.discussion 
summary of appellants position 
appellants opening brief contends that judge dondero erred in eight particulars,numbered as follows in finding that verio commission plans did not violate section in finding that verio commission plans were lawful under section in finding the acknowledgment constituted a contract between verio and its employees in failing to recognize that consent is not possible because section prohibits and nullifies any agreement contrary to section in applying a legislative purpose analysis to a statute that is clear on its face in finding that the chargebacks were against new advances,not earned commissions in failing to recognize that,if a contract did exist,it was an unconscionable contract and in relying upon an unpublished decision in violation of california rules of court,rule a.
as we explain,none of appellants contentions has merit.the determination of the fundamental question of the enforceability of verio commission plan disposes of contentions numbered,and.contention number is simply wrong.contentions numbered and could not be ground for reversal.and contention number was not even urged below and,in any event,is groundless.
verio chargebacks did not violate section 
the pertinent statutes are found in division of the labor code et entitled employment regulation and supervision,which begins with the definitions in section as used in this article a wages includes all amounts for labor performed by employees of every description,whether the amount is fixed or ascertained by the standard of time,task,piece,commission basis,or other method of calculation.b labor includes labor,work,or service whether rendered or performed under contract,subcontract,partnership,station plan,or other agreement if the labor to be paid for is performed personally by the person demanding payment.stats,ch.thus,commission payments can be wages under the express description of section and applicable cases.hudgins neiman marcus group,th,d hudgins commissions are wages within the meaning of section.reid overland machined products cal d,holding commissions are wages.
if the commissions at issue here are wages,then verio attempt to recover them back could run afoul of section,which provides in its entirety that it shall be unlawful for any employer to collect or receive from an employee any part of wages theretofore paid by said employer to said employee.section is,of course,the basis of appellants fundamental contention below,and here,a contention necessarily premised on a determination that the commissions were wages.judge dondero concluded they were not.we agree with judge dondero.
the right of a salesperson or any other person to a commission depends on the terms of the contract for compensation.steinhebel los angeles times communications,llc th,d steinhebel commeford d,commeford.and it is clearly the law in california that a sales person is required to repay the excess of advances made over commissions earned when there is an express agreement on the part of the sales person to repay such excess.agnew cameron d,citing korry of california lefkowitz d,korry.
steinhebel,supra,th,d,recently confirmed that agreements between employer and employee concerning commissions have long been an practice,as indeed it has,manifest by various opinions over the years,both from courts and from the division of labor standards enforcement dlse.
american software,ali th,d american software,an opinion by division five of this court,is representative.the issue there involved a provision of a software salesperson employment contract which terminated her right to receive commissions received on her accounts days after severance of employment.the trial court found the provision unconscionable.id.at,d.the court of appeal reversed and,finding the contract enforceable,first noted that there were no unclear or hidden terms in the employment agreement,and no unusual terms that would shock the conscience.id.at,d.moreover,the court noted,its survey of case law indicates that the challenged contract provision is commonplace in employment contracts with sales representatives who have ongoing responsibilities to service the account once the sale is made.id.at,d,citing chretian donald bren d.deweese,entis atlantic wire cable corporation cir.
along the same lines is powis moore machinery d,which reversed a judgment for plaintiff awarding him commissions.doing so,the court upheld the validity of a commission plan that required the customers to pay for goods as a condition precedent to the salesperson earning the commission.the salesperson had responsibilities,and the court held that conditioning payment of commissions on receipt of payment from customers did not deprive plaintiff of any commission which he had already earned since it related in part to services to be performed in the future.id.at.other cases include prudential ins.fromberg d,where plaintiff employer obtained a declaratory judgment that upon termination of defendant employment as plaintiff agent,the employer was entitled to retain certain sums advanced to defendant under two salary plans division of labor standards enforcement dick bullis,d supp,where the employee had responsibilities necessary to complete the sale,and the court affirmed a judgment for defendant on the basis that the right of a salesman to commissions is dependent upon the terms of his contract for compensation and korry,supra,d,which allowed recovery of excess advances over earned commissions where the agreement specifically provided employees would have weekly advances that would be charged against commissions.
in sum,cases have long recognized,and enforced,commission plans agreed to between employer and employee,applying fundamental contract principles to determine whether a salesperson has,or has not,earned a commission.two cases from the second district court of appeal have recently addressed the issue,which cases are extensively cited by the parties.the first is steinhebel,supra,th,d,relied on by verio the second is harris investor business daily th,d,modified th,harris,relied on by appellants.we discuss them in turn.
steinhebel,decided by division eight of the second district,was an action by former telesales employees of the defendant newspaper publisher,whose primary job was to telephone prospective customers to attempt to sell newspaper subscriptions they also telephoned existing customers with limited subscriptions to attempt to sell them broader ones.steinhebel,supra,th at,d.the employees had a telesales agreement under which a sale of a subscription did not qualify as a commissionable order unless the customer kept the subscription for days.the employees nevertheless received advances before defendant could determine whether the order would in fact ripen into a commissionable order.id.at,d.
plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking relief under sections,and business professions code,section.steinhebel,supra,th at,d.defendant moved for summary judgment,which the trial court granted,ruling that,although the commissions were earned at the time the work was complete,the commissions were subject to a condition precedent.id.at,d.
the court of appeal affirmed,framing the issue and its holding as follows we are presented with the issue whether an employer may advance commissions to its employees and then by agreement charge back any excess of advances over commissions earned against future advances.as we discuss below,we hold an employer may legally advance commissions to its employees prior to the completion of all conditions for payment and,by agreement,charge back any excess advance over commissions earned against any future advance should the conditions not be satisfied.id.at,d.
reaching that holding,the court of appeal relied on facts and law manifestly applicable here appellants executed acknowledgements indicating they read and understood the agreement,which specified that commissions were payable only on commissionable sales,subscriptions that were verified sales and were kept by the customer for at least days.appellants right to commissions therefore must be governed by the provisions of the agreement.lucian all states trucking d.employees who voluntarily left employment before end of accounting period not entitled to pro rata share of profits under bonus incentive plan requiring employee to work the entire accounting period before benefits vested commeford,supra,d,employees right to commission determined by terms of their contract.t he right of a salesman or any other person to commissions under given circumstances depends upon the terms of his contract for compensation.commeford at.steinhebel,supra,th at,d.
the essence of an advance is that at the time of payment the employer can not determine whether the commission will eventually be earned because a condition to the employee right to the commission has yet to occur or its occurrence as yet is otherwise unascertainable.an advance,therefore,by definition is not a wage because all conditions for performance have not been satisfied.steinhebel,supra,th at,d.
we find steinhebel persuasive here.indeed,the subject setting is a fortiori,as in steinhebel the salespersons had no further responsibilities after the sale.steinhebel,supra,th at,d.as described at length above,appellants admitted that they had responsibilities necessary to earn their commissions they serviced accounts,acted as liaisons with customers,responded to questions,solved customer problems,and directed customers to the appropriate people at verio.
thirteen months after steinhebel,supra,th,d and after verio respondent brief was prepared,division four of the second district decided harris,supra,th,d,a lawsuit by telemarketers hired to sell subscriptions to defendant financial newspaper investor business daily,ibd.plaintiffs there were compensated on a point system which rewarded them for selling longer subscriptions,winning daily contests,and meeting weekly order goals.they were also subject to chargeback from the points earned if the customer cancelled the subscription within weeks.id.at,d.as germane to the issues here,plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit that included various claims under the labor code,one of which was for unlawful commission deduction.ibid.the trial court granted summary adjudication for defendant on this claim id.at,d,but the court of appeal reversed.id.at,d.
the court of appeal first noted that defendant personnel policy changed in incidentally,after the lawsuit was provide for the first time that the commissions would be advanced.harris,supra,th at,d.this,plaintiffs had contended,meant that the earlier policy indicated that money paid for commissions were wages,not an advance.ibid.the court then briefly referred to steinhebel,supra,th,d,which it distinguished as including the word advance in the employment agreement.harris,supra,th at,d.then,after distinguishing hudgins,supra,th,d,the harris court concluded as follows unlike the employees in steinhebel and hudgins,appellants did not expressly agree to the chargeback policy in writing.even if they knew about the policy,ibd materials suggested that the points were earned at the time of the sale,not at some designated point in the future the trial court erred in granting summary adjudication on the unlawful wage deduction claim.respondents failed to demonstrate that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a triable issue of fact exists as to whether the chargeback plan in effect during appellants employment violates labor code section.harris,supra,th at,d.
appellants rely heavily on harris,supra,th,d,devoting most of their reply brief to the case,arguing that the trial court should be overruled based upon the recent case of harris investor business daily.we are not persuaded.
it is perhaps enough to note that harris merely reversed a summary adjudication,on the basis that a triable issue of fact exists as to whether the chargeback plan violates labor code section.harris,supra,th at,d.the setting here is clearly distinguishable,judge dondero having made extensive factual determinations after a full blown trial.harris is also inapposite factually,the court there noting that,unlike the employees in steinhebel and hudgins,appellants did not expressly agree to the chargeback policy in writing.even if they knew about the policy,ibd materials suggested that the points were earned at the time of the sale,not at some designated point in the future harris,supra,th at,d.here,like the employees in steinhebel and hudgins,appellants did expressly agree to the policy in writing.and here the policy expressly,and clearly,stated that the commissions were not earned at the time of appellants expressly admitted.
the commission plans between appellants and verio provided that,although commissions would be paid at booking or,in,installation,they were not in fact earned at that time.this is what appellants agreed.this is what appellants understood.and this is what appellants admitted at trial.we conclude that verio commission plans are enforceable,and that verio is entitled to the chargebacks despite that the word advance is not used.appellants agreed to what they agreed to,and that agreement will be enforced,as have such agreements over the years,as recognized by the dlse.
the dsle is the state agency empowered to enforce california labor laws.tidewater marine western,bradshaw cal th,d.as such it frequently issues opinions and letters from which we can properly obtain guidance in the dlse employment policies and interpretations manual,the dlse expressly recognized that the right to commissions may be conditioned,in section,which provides as follows computation of commissions frequently relies on such criteria as the date the goods are delivered or the payment is received.sometimes,the commission of the selling salesperson is subject to reconciliation and chargebacks if the goods are returned.if these conditions are clear and unambiguous,they may be utilized in computing the payment of the commission.
the above paragraph in the manual confirms various other statements in various opinions issued by the dlse before and since,which opinions,though admittedly rendered in response to the particular fact pattern in which the opinion was sought,contain various observations supportive of our conclusion here.the following observations from the referenced opinion letters are illustrative 
a commission is earned when the employee has perfected the right to payment that is,when all of the legal conditions precedent have been met.such conditions precedent are a matter of contract between the employer and employee,subject to various limitations imposed by common law or statute.dlse opinion letter.
it would be permissible for an employer to have a commission policy which provided that in the event that an account was not paid,the commissions paid on that account would be recovered from future commissions paid to the salesperson.dlse opinion letter.
commissions are due and payable after the reasonable conditions precedent of the employment agreement have been met.dlse opinion letter.
reasonable conditions may be placed upon the right to recover commissions.dlse opinion letter,fn.
appellants assert that,notwithstanding their understandings and agreements,the commissions were wages because verio did not refer to them as advances,absence of which word appellants cite to attempt to distinguish steinhebel,supra,th,d.such distinction is misplaced as we concluded above.appellants expressly agreed,and understood,that commissions were not earned until the customer paid.they also understood that verio was paying them in advance of when the commissions were earned.
appellants assert at various places in their opening brief that conditioning payment of commissions on receipt of payment from customers improperly shifts the company business losses to its sales associates,citing several cases in which courts have held that an employer can not deduct from employee pay to cover certain kinds of general business losses.none is pertinent here.
kerr catering service department of industrial relations cal d,kerr catering held only that it was unlawful for an employer to make deductions from agreed upon commissions to cover cash shortages from a food vendor truck,relying on a specific regulatory prohibition against reductions from wages for cash shortages unless those shortages were caused by the employee dishonest or willful acts.quillian lion oil company d,relying on the same regulatory prohibition,held that it was unlawful for the employer to reduce an employee promised bonus by shrinkage at a gas station.ralphs grocery superior court th,d,a demurrer case,held that allegations that an employer bonus program based in part on each store workers compensation expenses and cash shortages stated a claim for violation of specific prohibitions on deductions in section.and hudgins,supra,th,d,involved a commission deduction system which we held violated section because it included a policy of deducting from paid commissions an amount for customer returns for which the particular sales person would not be entitled.doing so,however,we noted facts which support our conclusion that verio plan did not violate that section.that is,while we held that recovery of wages to cover unidentified returns was unlawful because the people from whom the company recovered its losses had not received any commission on,or been involved with,the sale at issue,we noted that the store practice of recovering commissions on identified returns was acceptable because those chargebacks were specifically tied to the sales in which the associate had been involved and for which the associate had received a direct benefit in the form of a commission.hudgins,supra,th at,fn,d.here,of course,the chargebacks are sales associate by sales associate,order by order.
finally,we note appellants can find no support in barnhill robert saunders d,the case relied on at oral argument.barnhill,a bookkeeper for defendant,had signed a promissory note to defendant which provided in part that it was payable by payroll deduction or on demand.subsequently,the parties orally agreed that defendant would deduct from barnhill wages every two weeks.barnhill was discharged,at which time the balance due on the note was plus interest.at that time,barnhill was owed two weeks wages of.when barnhill went to pick up her check,she was given a stub with a net zero balance,indicating various deductions including a setoff against the balance owing on the note.id.at.affirming a labor commission decision for barnhill,division three of this court held that t he policy underlying the state wage exemption statutes is to insure that regardless of the debtor improvidence,the debtor and his or her family will retain enough money to maintain a basic standard of living,so that the debtor may have a fair chance to remain a productive member of the community.citation.moreover,fundamental due process considerations underlie the prejudgment attachment exemption.permitting appellant to reach respondent wages by setoff would let it accomplish that neither it nor any other creditor could do by attachment and would defeat the legislative policy underlying that exemption.we conclude that an employer is not entitled to a setoff of debts owing it by an employee against any wages due that employee.d at.barnhill has nothing to do with the setting here.
as our presiding justice kline has confirmed,section was enacted in order to prevent employers from utilizing secret deductions or kickbacks to pay employees less than their stated wages.finnegan schrader th,d,citing kerr catering,supra,cal d at,accord steinhebel,supra,th at,d.as demonstrated by the extensive evidence set forth above,there was nothing secret about verio conduct here.nor were there any kickbacks.we conclude,as did the court in steinhebel,that i n referring to wages paid,section prohibits an employer only from collecting or receiving wages that have already been earned by performance of requirements.steinhebel,supra,th at,d.the commissions here were not so earned,as appellants expressly admitted.
section provides an independent basis to affirm the chargebacks 
judge dondero concluded that section provided an independent basis to uphold verio chargebacks.appellants contend that conclusion was error.we disagree.
section provides in pertinent part as follows the provisions of sections,and shall in no way make it unlawful for an employer to withhold or divert any portion of an employee wages when a deduction is expressly authorized in writing by the employee to cover deductions not amounting to a rebate or deduction from the standard wage thus,even if payments are wages,an employer may withhold or divert them if the two conditions in section are met the deduction is authorized in writing,and does not reduce the employee standard wage.both conditions are present here.
prudential ins.fromberg,supra,d.is persuasive.there,fromberg was employed as prudential agent under two salary plans under which prudential made advance payments on commissions.when fromberg employment was terminated,prudential claimed it could withhold commissions otherwise due him to offset the indebtedness arising from advances the company had previously made.id.at.the court of appeal affirmed a declaratory judgment for prudential,holding in part that the offsets were proper under section because they were made pursuant to a written agreement and were not a deduction of the employee standard wage.id.at.the same applies here.
verio chargebacks were made pursuant to written commission plans which expressly authorized them.and the chargebacks were not taken against the employee standard wage.although standard wage is not defined in section,and we can find no authority defining it,common usage of the term refers to an employee base pay,as shown by the testimony of appellants,who referred to their base pay as their standard wage 
d.there is no unconscionability 
appellants contend that judge dondero erred in failing to recognize that any contract,if one did exist,was an unconscionable contract.such contention can not succeed,either procedurally or substantively.
appellants have not preserved any claim of unconscionability 
responding to appellants claim of unconscionability,verio first contends that no such argument was made below and was thus waived.such contention is well taken,for several reasons.
first,appellants brief on this point asserts,in the most conclusory way,that,unlike the steinhebel case,appellants here argued unconscionability.however,no record reference is set forth in support of such statement.second,appellants reply brief does not even respond to verio claim of waiver.third,appellants do not demonstrate that they argued unconscionability below.their own proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law do not even mention the word,which is perhaps not surprising,as neither their complaint nor their answer to v
