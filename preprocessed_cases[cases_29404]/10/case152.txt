plaintiffs appellants are three plans hbps that brought suit under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,et rico,and various state laws,claiming that defendants appellees llp and,collectively,aventis engaged in a pattern of mail fraud by failing to disclose the true risks of the antibiotic drug telithromycin,marketed as ketek.plaintiffs sought to certify a class of all hbps that paid for ketek prescriptions on the theory that such hbps were injured as a result of paying for ketek prescriptions that would not have been written if aventis had not concealed ketek safety risks.the united states district court for the eastern district of new york sandra townes,judge,denied plaintiffs motion for class certification,relying on our decision in ufcw local eli lilly,cir zyprexa,to hold that the individual decisions of prescribing physicians thwarted plaintiffs effort to prove causation using generalized proof.the district court subsequently granted aventis summary judgment on all claims,again citing zyprexa and plaintiffs inability to prove causation with generalized evidence.
although we agree with plaintiffs that zyprexa does not foreclose class certification for all rico claims brought against a drug manufacturer,we nevertheless conclude that zyprexa reasoning applies to this case,and bars plaintiffs attempt to certify a class.while it may be possible for a class of plaintiffs to prove the causation element of a pharmaceutical fraud claim such as this one with generalized proof,plaintiffs have failed to offer such proof here.class certification was therefore correctly denied.our class certification decision,moreover,necessarily disposes of the summary judgment question as well if plaintiffs rico claims can not be proved by generalized proof and plaintiffs have adduced no individualized proof which they have not,plaintiffs claims can not survive summary judgment.we also agree with the district court dismissal of plaintiffs claims.accordingly,we affirm the district court orders denying class certification and granting aventis motion for summary judgment on all claims.
background 
antibiotic treatment options for respiratory tract infections 
the human respiratory tract comprising the sinuses,throat,and lungs is highly susceptible to invading microorganisms.these microscopic invaders are the cause of the sniffling,sneezing,congestion,and coughing that most laypeople identify as symptoms of a cold or the flu.the medical community classifies such symptoms as those of either upper respiratory infections the common cold and sinusitis being the most common examples or lower respiratory which bronchitis and pneumonia are the most familiar.see patrick murray et,medical microbiology,ed.respiratory tract infections may be caused by bacteria or by viruses most cases are caused by viruses.ctrs.for disease control prevention,get smart know when antibiotics work what everyone should know,last visited,hereinafter cdc,get smart.
antibiotic drugs were first produced for widespread use in the,and their discovery was one of the greatest medical advances in history.ctrs.for disease control prevention,about antimicrobial resistance,last visited,hereinafter cdc,antimicrobial resistance.one of the first antibiotic drugs was penicillin,which was a member of a class of antibiotics known as.pneumonia in depth report antibiotic and antiviral drug classes,times,last visited.other antibiotics include amoxicillin,which,with the addition of clavulanic acid,is marketed under the name augmentin.id.in addition to the,the most common classes of antibiotic drug used to treat respiratory infections are macrolide drugs,such as azithromycin zithromax and clarithromycin biaxin,and the most recent major class of antibiotics to come on the market,fluoroquinolones.id.all categories of antibiotic drug have their own benefits and risks.antibiotics in all categories,however,are only effective against bacteria,and not against viral infections.thus,because most respiratory tract infections are viral in nature,most such infections are unaffected by antibiotics.cdc,get smart.
for a variety of reasons,doctors nonetheless frequently prescribe antibiotic drugs to patients with respiratory tract infections,even if they have no evidence that the infection in question is caused by a bacteria rather than a virus.this kind of of antibiotic drugs,as well as the widespread use of antibiotic therapies in general,has given rise to a phenomenon known as antibiotic resistance.cdc,antimicrobial resistance.antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria mutate to become impervious to the antibacterial action of a particular antibiotic drug this resistant bacterial strain then multiplies and spreads,becoming more prevalent as antibiotic drugs wipe out its competitor strains.id.many of the bacteria commonly responsible for respiratory tract infections,such as streptococcus pneumoniae,exist in strains that have developed resistance to antibiotics or to macrolide antibiotics.ctrs.for disease control prevention,antibiotic resistance threats in the united states pneumonia has developed resistance to drugs in the penicillin and erythromycin groups,causing excess hospitalizations and deaths every year.some strains have developed resistance to multiple classes of antibiotic drugs these are known as strains,or mdrs.
although the various classes of drugs used to treat respiratory infections exhibit similar effectiveness and thus offer a similar benefit,each class has different downsides.such as penicillin and amoxicillin are not suitable for patients with penicillin allergies,and augmentin amoxicillin with clavulanic acid is a cause of liver injury.in addition,resistance to both and to macrolide antibiotics is high.macrolides can cause serious allergic reactions,impaired liver function,and heart problems.fluoroquinolones can cause serious side effects in the central and peripheral nervous system,and can cause heart problems.although all antibiotics can cause colitis by killing the normal,healthy microorganisms in a patient body that protect us from the dangerous bacterium clostridium difficile,or dif,see ctrs.for disease control prevention,making health care safer stopping difficile infections,ht tp last visited,fluoroquinolones are particularly prone to this effect,because they attack a broader spectrum of bacteria,and thus kill more healthy gut bacteria than other drugs.all antibiotic drugs can have dangerous side effects antibiotics are responsible for approximately twenty percent of all emergency room visits for adverse drug events.cdc,get smart.
b.the fda approval process for ketek 
aventis original application for fda approval for ketek 
on february,aventis submitted a new drug application nda to the food and drug administration fda seeking approval to sell and market ketek as a treatment for four types of respiratory infections acute bacterial sinusitis abs,acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis aecb,tonsillopharyngitis,and pneumonia cap.in support of the nda,aventis submitted data from in vitro testing of ketek against various bacteria in a controlled lab setting,data from animal testing,and data from small human safety and efficacy trials.the in vitro data demonstrated that ketek was capable of killing strains of common bacterial pathogens that were resistant to other antibiotics,including mdrs,though in vitro results can not always be replicated in clinical trials.
at the time when the fda was considering the ketek application,the fda used a standard to assess the efficacy of antibiotic drugs in treating respiratory tract infections.this means that the fda accepted,as conclusive proof of a drug effectiveness,trials demonstrating that a new drug was no worse at treating a particular illness than existing,approved drugs or,at least,was not so much worse than existing drugs that it fell below a set statistical threshold.the fda did not require,and there was thus no incentive for a manufacturer to conduct,studies comparing the effectiveness of the new drug to the effectiveness of a placebo.in other words,manufacturers were merely required to prove that their product was no worse than similar products,even though because minor respiratory infections like sinusitis and bronchitis usually go away on their own even without medication the fda did not know whether any of those similar products actually improved patient outcomes.this odd situation arose mostly by historical accident because antibacterial drugs were discovered so long ago and represented such a major advance in treatment,antibacterial therapy was incorporated into clinical practice before clinical trial design had become more sophisticated.there was also an ethical concern regarding giving sick patients placebos instead of real drugs.
aventis ketek application was evaluated by the fda anti infective drug advisory committee aidac,a panel of experts tasked with assessing an antibiotic drug profile and making an approval recommendation to the fda.the agency usually follows the recommendation of such a committee,but it is not bound by it.on april,the aidac met and voted to recommend limited approval of ketek only for treatment of cap the most serious of the four conditions considered.the committee also recommended that further studies be performed to assess ketek potential side effects,known in the medical community as adverse events.specifically,the aidac members were concerned that ketek might have serious but rare side effects that the clinical trials conducted thus far might not have revealed.following this meeting,the fda sent aventis a letter finding its application for cap,aecb,and abs though not tonsillopharyngitis approvable subject to the performance of a clinical study.such a study would ideally reveal rarer side effects that might not have appeared in trials of only a few hundred or few thousand subjects.in other words,the study recommended by the aidac would be a microcosm of what could be expected to happen if ketek were approved and entered the marketplace.
aventis agreed to perform such a study,and enlisted pharmaceutical product development,ppd to create the study protocol for and oversee the operation of what aventis dubbed study.study was designed to enroll patients,half of whom would be treated with ketek,and half of whom would be treated with augmentin.patients were to be randomly assigned to one or the other drug.ppd was charged with recruiting physicians,who would be paid for every patient of theirs who completed the study.the study required that each patient be diagnosed with abs,aecb,or cap at an initial appointment,at which baseline labs would be drawn and one of the two study medications would be prescribed.the protocol then required two visits.
study was a fiasco.david ross,who was the primary fda safety reviewer responsible for review of ketek,testified before a congressional hearing that the fraud in study was unprecedented at this scope and scale.o ut of study sites that were inspected by the fda,all had serious problems that made their data completely unreliable e very single one was found to have significant violations of what are called good clinical practices,the rulebook for conducting clinical trials.four of the percent were referred for criminal investigation.id.most egregiously,the study largest enroller by far anne kirkman campbell,who enrolled patients fabricated data on a vast scale.in the end,fda investigators determined that she had only administered the study drugs to fifty patients,and that the other patients were fictitious.another study site regularly failed to report adverse events,while yet another site submitted suspiciously similar records for multiple subjects,including nearly identical blood test results.a site that enrolled patients was run by a doctor who was ignorant of the study guidelines or the good clinical practices rules,argumentative about complying with the guidelines,and un interested in learning about them.
as a result of this widespread fraud and incompetence,the fda division of scientific investigations dsi concluded that t he integrity of data from all sites involved in study can not be assured with any degree of confidence.i f these sites,which were sites,where supposedly the company had been keeping close tabs on the doctors,were unreliable,the rest of the sites could be relied on either.ultimately,because the integrity of data from all of the investigative sites could not be assured,the fda did not rely on those data to take a regulatory action.see also although the fda did not rely on study to support approval,we reviewed the study for safety findings that would have counted against the drug,as is consistent with good review practice.thus,study ultimate conclusion that ketek was comparable to augmentin in safety and effectiveness was worthless.
fda approval of ketek 
on july,before the fda had reason to suspect fraud in study aventis filed its amended nda,including data from study,and safety data from countries in europe and south america,where ketek had already been approved for sale.aventis report about study omitted any mention of the study data integrity problems.on october,dsi began its investigation of kirkman campbell involvement in study,which led swiftly to discovery of her fraud.
on january,the aidac met for a third time to discuss the ketek application.the committee was missing crucial information,however the fda did not reveal to the aidac members any information relating to dsi ongoing investigation of study.unaware of the unreliability of study results,the aidac recommended that the fda approve ketek for abs,aecb,and cap.the fda,armed with the information the aidac lacked,did not accept the committee recommendation,but instead requested additional information from aventis concerning both study and safety data from countries where ketek was already in use.
finally,on april,the fda approved ketek for three indications abs,aecb,and cap.because the agency was aware that study was unreliable,and aventis had conducted no other safety studies,the fda relied almost entirely on safety reports from other countries in approving the drug.this was highly unusual.see david graham,associate director for science and medicine in fda office of surveillance and epidemiology,testified that he could not think of a single other example where fda used such data as the primary basis for the approval of a drug safety.
at congressional hearings later convened on the topic of ketek approval,witnesses put forth different explanations for the fda decision.ross pointed to a culture of approval at the fda,and a fear of being seen as holding up new products.john powers,former lead medical officer for antimicrobial drug development at the fda,noted that there were economic issues regarding antibiotic development that were pressuring fda from the outside namely,drug companies had decided to stop antibiotic discovery because the market for antibiotics is flooded with generic competitors,and because antibiotics are not as lucrative as drugs like antidepressants or statins,which are taken continuously for months or years.this slowdown in the development of new antibiotic drugs,according to powers,was especially dangerous given the need for new drugs to replace older antibiotics to which antibiotic resistance had developed.in this environment,if the fda made any moves to increase the rigor of scientific studies in the area of antibiotics,there was a fear that it would be perceived as a disincentive to the development of new drugs.andrew von eschenbach,of the fda,testified that ketek approval was based on the need for newer,more effective antibiotics to overcome resistance and add to the antibiotic armamentarium.
the label agreed upon by aventis and the fda for ketek noted that there was some risk of liver failure associated with the drug,but this information was not included in the warnings section,nor was any indication included therein that ketek should not be prescribed to patients with a history of liver problems.no information from study appeared on the ketek label.the fda approval of ketek,like fda approval of any other drug,see zyprexa,at,permitted doctors to prescribe ketek not only for its approved indications abs,aecb,and cap,but also for any other disease or symptom for which an individual physician thought it might be effective.prescription of a drug for an indication other than the indications approved by the fda is called prescription or use.id.
ketek in the marketplace 
the marketplace for antibiotic drugs 
a prescription for antibiotic drugs,like any prescription,involves three main actors the patient,who takes the medication and often assumes some share of the cost the doctor,who prescribes the drug but is not involved with the financial side of the prescription and the payer,who covers the majority of the drug cost.for insured patients,the payer is a plan hbp,which pays whatever cost the patient does not cover.plaintiffs in this case are all hbps.most hbps contract out their prescription drug benefit coverage to pharmacy benefit managers pbms,and all three named plaintiffs here did so.pbms manage approximately percent of all outpatient prescription drug claims,and the three largest pbms medco,caremark,and express scripts handle about of those claims,or about half of all retail prescriptions.
most pbms use formularies to outline which drugs are covered by a particular plan and what type of coverage each drug receives.many formularies are tiered,often using a system which separates generics tier,preferred brand name drugs tier,and brand name drugs tier.tier drugs require the smallest,and may even be free,while tier and tier drugs will be progressively more expensive for the patient.formularies may also place freestanding restrictions on their coverage of a drug for example,they may refuse to cover a particular drug until a preferred alternative has been tried,and has failed.it is rare for a pbm to remove an drug from its formulary,although pbms regularly move particular drugs up or down a tier based on new information about a drug.
although hbps implement tiered formularies and otherwise classify drugs in order to incentivize patients to request cheaper,safer,and more effective drugs over more expensive,dangerous,or ineffective ones,the ultimate decision regarding which drug will be prescribed to a patient rests entirely with the patient doctor.the parties to this case agree that a variety of factors contribute to a physician decision,including both factors and the physician own experience with,and knowledge about,the various options.those factors include,in the case of antibiotics the patient age and sex,the possibility of pregnancy,drug allergies,success of prior courses of treatment in this patient,other medications the patient is taking,other illnesses the patient is experiencing,family history,drug compliance tendencies whether the patient is likely to take and finish the course of treatment as prescribed,patient preferences,side effects from previous antibiotics,the likelihood of antibiotic resistance in the patient,the profile of antibiotic resistance in the region,and,of course,the drug safety and efficacy.
there are many antibiotic drugs available to treat respiratory tract infections,including aecb,abs,and cap.as discussed above,each class of drug,and each individual drug within that class,comes with its own particular risks and benefits,including the type and severity of potential side effects,the existence of resistant organisms,and whether the drug targets a broad or narrow spectrum of bacteria.ketek competitors also vary significantly in cost.zithromax,in the timespan shortly after ketek entrance into the market,cost for a full course of therapy,while levaquin a fluoroquinolone cost for a course of treatment for aecb and for a course of treatment for abs.amoxicillin clavulanate cost for a full course of therapy for both diseases.generic competitors like penicillin cost much less.ketek was priced close to zithromax,which aventis considered its main competitor per course of therapy for both abs and aecb.
following fda approval,hbps placed ketek on their formularies.at the time relevant to this action,two of the named plaintiffs,new england carpenters health benefits fund nec and allied services division welfare fund asd,employed a formulary sergeants benevolent association health and welfare fund sba,the third named plaintiff,did not employ a tiered formulary at all.it is not clear in which tier asd pbm classified ketek during the relevant time period all that is known is that,as of march,asd pbm listed ketek as tier,which is the tier for preferred drugs.nec covered ketek at tier until december,at which point it moved ketek to tier.sba,which does not employ a tiered formulary,has covered ketek at the same level from the time of its original fda approval through the date of the district court summary judgment decision.
ketek market performance 
after fda approval in april,ketek entered the market in july and became an immediate commercial success.even though ketek only became available halfway through the year,ketek was prescribed times in.ketek sales grossed million in alone,and ross estimated that,in,a ketek prescription was written every four or five seconds.cap represented only eight percent of ketek prescriptions the rest were for abs,aecb,or indications.
ketek entered a market that was in a significant state of flux.zithromax,the market leader,and the drug that aventis considered ketek true rival,was scheduled to go in the fourth quarter of.biaxin,another popular macrolide antibiotic,was scheduled to go generic in the second quarter of.cefzil,a less popular competitor,was going in the third quarter of,and levaquin and tequin,two of the first fluoroquinolone drugs,were scheduled to go in.in other words,ketek entered a market which was dominated by drugs facing off against other,but which likely would not remain that way for long.ketek had to be able to compete even when its most popular rivals became cheaper and more widely available than ever before.
ketek sales peaked in the winter months and dropped in the summer months,which is typical for drugs treating seasonal illnesses like sinusitis and pneumonia.after the peak sales of winter,however,sales dropped much more steeply than they had following the first winter peak in sales ultimately fell to about prescriptions in july,far below the july low of about prescriptions.ketek numbers then began to rise again,as expected in the fall and winter,but on a much smaller scale.indeed,ketek peak for the winter was only about prescriptions lower than ketek summer low of about.in short,ketek sales took an unmistakable dive starting in early to mid.the reason or reasons for this precipitous decline are intensely disputed by the parties.
ketek post marketing safety history 
the fda maintains a publicly available database of spontaneous reports of adverse drug reactions,known as the adverse event reporting system,or aers.in march,slightly less than a year after ketek was approved,the fda center for drug evaluation and research asked the division of drug risk evaluation ddre to evaluate reports appearing in aers related to ketek specifically,reports of visual disturbances,automobile accidents,liver events,and of consciousness.after assessing the aers reports in detail and determining that a number of the reported hepatic adverse events were caused by something other than ketek,ddre concluded that the hepatic adverse event reports were consistent with those seen prior to approval in worldwide experience and as described in the current labeling.id.ddre recommended only including a statement in the precautions section of the ketek label,following the current statement about hepatic dysfunction,that the hepatic dysfunction may be severe as was currently stated in other parts of the label.id.
by the end of january,ketek had been prescribed approximately four and a half million times,and ten cases of serious hepatic adverse events closely associated with ketek had been reported to aers,including two deaths.on january,the medical journal annals of internal medicine published a short article describing a cluster of three hepatic adverse events that occurred in north carolina.all three patients were previously healthy one patient died,one spontaneously recovered,and one required a liver transplant.on the same date that the article was published online,and prompted by the publication of said article,the fda issued a public health advisory regarding ketek.the public health advisory affirmed that earlier studies had suggested that the risk of liver injury with ketek was similar to that of other marketed antibiotics,but nevertheless recommended that healthcare providers monitor patients taking ketek for signs or symptoms of liver problems.j.
the year saw a spike in reports of hepatic adverse events associated with ketek.the six months from january to june saw cases of serious hepatic side effects reported as associated with ketek more than twice as many as had been reported in the entire eighteen months that ketek had previously been on the market.the six months from june to december saw an additional eighteen reported serious adverse hepatic events,for a total of such events since ketek came on the market.ddre noted in an october report on ketek that the rising trend of reporting rates associated with ketek is of concern,but also noted that the rise in reporting of hepatic events associated with ketek was potentially stimulated reporting prompted by the annals of internal medicine article in january.stimulated reporting occurs when press coverage of a particular adverse event associated with a drug prompts healthcare providers to notice and report similar pairings with greater frequency when it occurs,this phenomenon makes it difficult to compare reporting rates for different drugs,because a higher reported rate of liver failure associated with one drug as opposed to another may simply reflect greater public salience rather than greater risk.the october ddre report noted that the domestic reporting rate for serious hepatic adverse events was per million prescriptions and recommended consideration of regulatory actions for ketek such as restricted use for only patients who have failed other antibiotic treatments or even market withdrawal.on june,aventis with the fda approval changed ketek label to include additional warnings about liver toxicity and sent a dear healthcare professional letter to prescribers alerting them to the change.on the same date,the fda issued a press release cautioning that many antibiotics may pose a risk of liver failure,and that as drug usage becomes more widespread,it is expected that rare adverse events may be detected or reported in greater numbers.on september,the aidac voted to reject an nda for the fluoroquinolone gemifloxacin,targeted at abs,in part because clinical trials demonstrated only the manufacturer could not prove that gemifloxacin was more effective than a placebo.on october,the fda effectively announced a new superiority requirement for antibiotic trials by rejecting an nda for another aimed at respiratory infections,faropenem,and raising no safety concerns but instead advising the manufacturer to conduct superiority trials.
fda withdrawal of approval 
in december,the fda convened a joint meeting of the aidac and the drug safety and risk management advisory committee dsrmac to consider whether the agency should withdraw,limit,or modify ketek approval for some or all of its three indications require changes to ketek label or issue an official restriction on ketek use.the meeting included both voting and attendees,and those voting included members of both committees,as well as special government employee consultants and federal employee consultants.the attendees voted,inter alia,on the specific question,if superiority studies are conducted with ketek,would that be sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that benefit outweighs risk.
the meeting introductory comments,delivered by the director of the fda office of surveillance and epidemiology,gerald dal pan,noted concerns that trials can not determine if the observed clinical success rate of drugs treating respiratory infections is due to the drug or to the natural history of the condition.similar concerns about the continued viability of trials recurred throughout the meeting.the meeting also featured an fda statistical analysis of the reports appearing in aers,which concluded that ketek displayed a fairly high propensity to cause hepatic failure but noted that its propensity to cause both hepatic failure and hepatitis was statistically similar to that of another leading antibiotic drug,augmentin.an epidemiological analysis of ketek connection to hepatic adverse events by the fda office of surveillance and epidemiology concluded that the reporting rate for ketek associated liver failure was found to be similar to reporting rates for selected comparators in the quinolone family given variation inherent in spontaneous adverse event reporting.
regarding the deficiencies of study,one attending consultant remarked that,although m uch has been made out of the fact that study had been improperly conducted and could not be considered in connection with ketek risks,a clinical trial is not a great way to get an answer to a question that involves a very low event rate,because for the event rates we are talking about,a patient trial is going to show much.another attendee agreed,asking,how much power would a study of patients exposed to ketek have to tell us about liver injuries that are occurring at a potential rate of in to in.a third attendee pointed out that one other major limitation to clinical trials in terms of safety data is that the majority of clinical trials do enroll very sick people,which is precisely the group of patients most likely to develop adverse drug reactions once a drug is prescribed widely in the general population.
at the end of the meeting,the attendees voted to withdraw ketek approval for abs and aecb.asked to state their rationale along with their votes,a number of members cited safety concerns,explaining that they would need to know more about the risks before allowing ketek back on the market,or that they were concerned about the possibility that the level of toxicities we see right now may herald an increasing prevalence that may occur in the future.but many members cited effectiveness instead,noting that,in the absence of superiority trials,ketek might well be no better than a sugar pill.several attendees expressly explained their votes in terms of the shift from trials to superiority trials.two attendees voted to continue ketek approval based on fairness concerns,arguing that ketek and its competitors had been approved when trials were considered acceptable,and that it was unfair to single out a single drug company because we have shifted the playing grounds.finally,the voting attendees unanimously voted yes on the question if superiority studies are conducted with ketek,would that be sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that benefit outweighs risk.
the fda accepted the attendees recommendation that ketek approval for abs and aecb be withdrawn,and that ketek continue to be approved for cap.the attendees also recommended that ketek label be amended with a black box warning and expressed concern that foreign postmarketing data indicated that ketek exacerbated the rare neurological disorder myasthenia gravis in patients already suffering from the disease,resulting in hospitalization and sometimes death.the black box warning ultimately added to ketek label in indicated that ketek is contraindicated in patients with myasthenia gravis and referenced this data.shortly after learning of the agency decision,aventis decided to terminate its rebate for ketek and to stop promoting ketek in the united states.
the withdrawal of ketek approval for abs and aecb took effect on february.on february,the house energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations began hearings on the fda process,focused in large part on the fda decision to approve ketek,the widespread fraud in study,antibiotic resistance,and the issue of versus superiority trials for drugs that address infections like abs and aecb.ketek domestic sales,already declining,continued their downward trend after the withdrawal.ketek is still available for sale in the united states,but is rarely prescribed here.sales remain brisk abroad.
procedural history 
plaintiffs filed the original complaint in this action on january,alleging violations of state consumer protection laws and unjust enrichment on june,plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint,alleging for the first time a substantive rico violation under c and a rico conspiracy in violation of d.the substantive rico claim alleged that the between aventis and ppd,the supervisor of study,constituted a criminal enterprise with a common purpose to enable aventis to fraudulently represent that ketek had valid regulatory approval for broad antibiotic uses.special app.the predicate acts alleged were mail fraud,wire fraud,tampering with witnesses,and use of interstate facilities to conduct unlawful activity.id.plaintiffs sought refund damages of million and unjust enrichment damages of million.if plaintiffs rico claims were successful,they stood to recover treble damages of nearly million,not including any recovery for unjust enrichment.
in may,plaintiffs moved to certify a class including all hbps that paid or incurred costs for ketek between april,when the drug received fda approval,and february,when it lost such approval for abs and aecb.plaintiffs argued,inter alia,that ketek was so dangerous that no physician would have prescribed ketek if aventis had not concealed its true safety risks every ketek prescription,according to plaintiffs,was thus traceable to aventis alleged fraud.magistrate judge ramon reyes issued a report and recommendation recommending that class certification be denied because plaintiffs could not establish through generalized proof that aventis alleged rico violations caused plaintiffs injuries.sergeants benevolent ass health welfare fund sanofi aventis llp,cv slt rer,wl,sergeants i.judge reyes reasoned that this case is virtually identical to zyprexa,in which this court held that rico claims brought by hbps against eli lilly lilly under the theory that lilly misrepresented zyprexa safety and efficacy were not susceptible to generalized proof,because physicians individual treating decisions disrupted the causal chain.id.at.that report and recommendation was adopted by the district court on march.sergeants benevolent ass health welfare fund sanofi aventis llp,cv slt rer,wl,sergeants ii.plaintiffs petitioned this court for immediate appeal of the class certification decision,but their petition was denied on july.
on december,aventis moved for summary judgment with respect to all four causes of action alleged in the second amended complaint,arguing that plaintiffs could not prove causation under rico or prove that they suffered an injury,and arguing that plaintiffs claims failed because plaintiffs could not prove a violation of any of the state consumer protection statutes listed in the second amended complaint or make out an unjust enrichment claim under the law of their home states.on january,the district court again referred the matter to magistrate judge reyes,who recommended that aventis motion for summary judgment be granted in its entirety.sergeants benevolent ass health welfare fund sanofi aventis llp,cv slt rer,wl,sergeants iii.
on may,the district court adopted judge reyes report and recommendation except to the extent that judge reyes recommended limiting the causes of action to claims brought pursuant to the laws of plaintiffs home states sergeants benevolent ass health welfare fund sanofi aventis llp,d sergeants iv.the district court expressed concern that the causal connection between aventis alleged wrongdoing and plaintiffs injury might be too attenuated to meet rico proximate causation requirement,but ultimately based its causation holding on zyprexa statements to the effect that physicians prescribing decisions are too independent to allow proof of causation through generalized proof.id.at.the district also held that,e ven assuming that the decline in ketek sales was caused exclusively by safety considerations,one can not use generalized proof to determine the injury to plaintiffs caused by aventis misconduct,because plaintiffs could not prove which antibiotics would have been prescribed in the place of ketek and whether those drugs would have been less expensive than ketek.id.at.
regarding plaintiffs claims,as relevant here,the district court held that plaintiffs claims under new york general business law a,massachusetts general law chapter,and the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act all failed because plaintiffs could not prove that they suffered an injury as a result of aventis actions that plaintiffs illinois unjust enrichment claim failed because plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law and that plaintiffs massachusetts and new york unjust enrichment claims failed because it was not inequitable for aventis to retain the money it was paid in exchange for an antibiotic that provided value to patients by effectively treating their diseases.id.at.plaintiffs timely appealed both the class certification and the summary judgment orders.

we review a district court denial of class certification for abuse of discretion.to the extent that the court decision was based on conclusions of law,we review such conclusions de novo,and to the extent that its decision was based on findings of fact,we review such findings for clear error.see zyprexa,at.our review of a district court denial of summary judgment is de novo.id.summary judgment is properly granted if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.

the core of the substantive rico violation alleged by plaintiffs is a pattern of mail fraud,which occurs whenever a person,having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,uses the mail for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting to do so.bridge phoenix bond indem,quoting.the parties do not dispute that aventis use d the mail in connection with its alleged fraud and thus for purposes of this appeal focus primarily on whether aventis alleged fraud caused an injury to plaintiffs and other class members,rather than on whether aventis alleged conduct actually constituted a scheme or artifice to defraud within the meaning of the statute.the district court determined that common issues did not predominate,rendering class certification unavailable,because plaintiffs could not establish using generalized proof that each putative class member suffered an injury by reason of aventis alleged fraud.because that decision was not an abuse of discretion,we affirm the district court order denying class certification.
although reliance on the defendant alleged misrepresentation is not an element of a rico claim,the plaintiffs theory of injury in most rico cases will nevertheless depend on establishing that someone whether the plaintiffs themselves or third parties relied on the defendant misrepresentation.see bridge,at in re foodservice.pricing,cir,cert.denied.that is because reliance will typically be a necessary step in the causal chain linking the defendant alleged misrepresentation to the plaintiffs injury if the person who was allegedly deceived by the misrepresentation plaintiff or not would have acted in the same way regardless of the misrepresentation,then the misrepresentation can not be a,much less proximate,cause of the plaintiffs injury see bridge,at.
because proving causation will ordinarily require proving reliance,and because of the difficulty of proving reliance using generalized proof,zyprexa,at,it is quite difficult,though not impossible,to certify a class in a rico case.to set out some helpful guideposts for our inquiry in this case,we first examine several cases involving reliance,cases where proving causation requires proof that the plaintiffs themselves had relied on the defendant misrepresentations.halliburton erica john fund,inc,observing,in the context of a securities fraud class action,that i f every plaintiff had to prove direct reliance on the defendant misrepresentation,individual issues then would overwhelm the common ones,making certification under rule b inappropriate second and third alterations in original quoting basic levinson.
in mclaughlin american tobacco,cir,the putative class consisted of cigarette smokers allegedly induced to purchase light cigarettes by a tobacco company misrepresentations that light cigarettes were healthier than regular ones.the plaintiffs theory of injury thus required proving that each class member would not have bought light cigarettes but for the misrepresentation.see id.at.we held that the plaintiffs could not do so by generalized proof individualized proof is needed,we explained,to overcome the possibility that a member of the purported class purchased lights for some reason other than the belief that lights were a healthier alternative for example,if a lights smoker was unaware of that representation,preferred the taste of lights,or chose lights as an expression of personal style.id.at.
for essentially the same reasons,the ninth circuit denied certification in poulos caesars world,cir,to a putative class of plaintiffs who were allegedly induced to gamble by a casino misrepresentations about their odds of winning.the court explained some players may be unconcerned with the odds of winning,instead engaging in casual gambling as entertainment or a social activity.others may have played with absolutely no knowledge or information regarding the odds of winning such that the appearance and labeling of the machines is irrelevant and did nothing to influence their perceptions.still others,in the spirit of taking a calculated risk,may have played fully aware of how the machines operate.id.at.for gamblers who did not rely on the casino misrepresentations in deciding whether to gamble,the alleged fraud simply played no causal role in their injury and because there was no way to establish through generalized proof that each individual class member had,in fact,relied on the casino misrepresentations,certification was improper.see id.at.
we have recognized,however,that plaintiffs may be able to prove causation based on reliance without an individualized inquiry into whether each class member relied on the defendant misrepresentation if circumstantial evidence generates a sufficiently strong inference that all class members did,in fact,rely.mclaughlin,at.in certain factual contexts,it may well be reasonable to infer that each class member would only have taken the action leading to its injury if it had relied on the defendant alleged misrepresentation.such an inference may be available if,for example,the class members all faced the same decisionmaking process,such that the alleged misrepresentation would have been essentially determinative for each plaintiff.richard nagareda,class certification in the age of aggregate proof.although deciding whether to smoke light cigarettes and deciding whether to gamble are not decisions,a plaintiff class may be able to convince a jury that other decisions are.
the eleventh circuit decision in klay humana,cir,illustrates this point.in klay,a putative class of doctors claimed that a number of hmos had misrepresented in their contracts with the doctors that the hmos would provide reimbursement for all necessary medical expenses provided to the doctors patients.the eleventh circuit upheld class certification,rejecting the hmos contention that the plaintiffs could not show reliance using generalized proof it does not strain credulity,the court said,to conclude that each plaintiff relied upon the defendants representations and assumed they would be paid the amounts they were due.id.at.thus,a jury could quite reasonably infer that guarantees concerning physician pay the very consideration upon which those agreements are to the heart of these agreements,and that doctors based their assent upon them.id.this court relied on similar logic in foodservice,where we affirmed certification of a class of plaintiffs who alleged that they had been overbilled by a company.in cases involving fraudulent overbilling,we reasoned,payment may constitute circumstantial proof of reliance based on the reasonable inference that customers who pay the amount specified in an inflated invoice would not have done so absent reliance upon the invoice implicit representation that the invoiced amount was honestly owed.at.
similar principles apply in cases involving reliance,cases in which proving the necessary causal connection between the defendant misrepresentation and the plaintiffs injury requires proving that someone other than the plaintiffs relied on the defendant alleged misrepresentations.see,bridge,at.just as in cases involving reliance,the individualized nature of the reliance inquiry can make it difficult to prove causation using generalized proof.nonetheless,it may be possible in certain circumstances for a putative class to prove causation on a basis by offering sufficient circumstantial proof analogous to that offered in klay and foodservice to permit the reasonable inference that the third parties in question must have relied on the defendant misrepresentation.
our decision in zyprexa illustrates the difficulty of proving causation in a rico case using generalized proof of reliance.there,a putative class of hbps sued the pharmaceutical company eli lilly,alleging that lilly had violated rico by making false representations about the antipsychotic medication zyprexa,which the fda had approved to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.at.the plaintiffs alleged that lilly had concealed evidence of zyprexa tendency to cause serious weight gain and diabetes,and had unlawfully marketed zyprexa for conditions such as depression,dementia,and anxiety disorder for which there was no evidence of effectiveness.id.at.
the zyprexa plaintiffs advanced two theories of injury,which we termed the quantity effect theory and the excess price theory.id.at.the former theory like plaintiffs theory of injury in the present case against aventis argued that lilly misrepresentations caused the hbps to pay for prescriptions that would not otherwise have been written the latter theory maintained that lilly misrepresentations caused the hbps to pay more for zyprexa than they otherwise would have.id.both theories depended on the premise that doctors,as opposed to the hbps themselves,had relied on lilly alleged misrepresentations in choosing to prescribe zyprexa to their patients.to prove that doctors had,in fact,relied on lilly misrepresentations in making their prescription decisions,the plaintiffs primarily offered evidence that the number of zyprexa prescriptions fell after the drug weight and side effects were disclosed by a revision to its label in.id.at see also id.at noting that the plaintiffs expert assum ed that the decline in the number of zyprexa prescriptions following the disclosure of zyprexa risks was due almost entirely to a decrease in the number of zyprexa prescriptions,and also assumed that,but for lilly alleged misrepresentations,sales of zyprexa would never have risen above the number of sales in,after more accurate information about zyprexa side effects became public.
this court held that neither of the plaintiffs two theories was susceptible to generalized proof of causation on the facts presented,and we therefore reversed the district court certification of the plaintiff class.with respect to the quantity effect theory in particular the theory primarily relevant here,we concluded relying heavily on mclaughlin that the plaintiffs attempt to show causation through generalized proof was thwart ed by the individualized nature of physicians prescribing decisions.id.as we explained 
plaintiffs argue that the ultimate source for the information on which doctors based their prescribing decisions was lilly and its consistent pervasive marketing plan.lilly was not,however,the only source of information on which doctors based prescribing decisions.an individual patient diagnosis,past and current medications being taken by the patient,the physician own experience with prescribing zyprexa,and the physician knowledge regarding the side effects of zyprexa are all considerations that would have been taken into account in addition to the alleged misrepresentations distributed by lilly plaintiffs can not use generalized proof when individual physicians prescribing zyprexa may have relied on lilly alleged misrepresentations to different degrees,or not at all 
id.at.in other words,we viewed a doctor decision to prescribe zyprexa as roughly analogous to a smoker decision to smoke light cigarettes because the decision could have been made for any numberof a multitude of reasons,we could not reasonably infer that lilly misrepresentations were,in fact,a cause much less the proximate cause of the excess prescriptions paid for by the plaintiffs.the fact that zyprexa prescriptions declined markedly following the disclosure of the previously concealed information was not sufficient to support this necessary inference,especially in light of evidence that at least some doctors were not misled by lilly alleged misrepresentations.id.at.thus,because a reasonable jury would be unable to find rico causation satisfied for each class member based on the generalized proof offered by the plaintiffs,common questions did not predominate,and class certification under rule b was therefore inappropriate.
here,as in zyprexa,plaintiffs theory of injury requires them to prove reliance by doctors on aventis alleged misrepresentations in order to establish that those misrepresentations caused hbps to pay for ketek prescriptions that would not have been written otherwise.aventis argues,and the district court held,that zyprexa controls this case and forecloses class certification.we agree.as explained below,the proof offered by plaintiffs here does not differ in any meaningful way from that offered by the zyprexa plaintiffs,and zyprexa accordingly establishes that plaintiffs generalized proof is insufficient to establish rico causation for each member of the putative class.we therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying class certification under rule b.
plaintiffs attempt to show causation through generalized proof centers on the premise that,unlike the prescribing decisions described in zyprexa which were multifaceted and therefore called for individualized determinations as to whether the prescriptions had in fact been written because of lilly alleged fraud physicians prescribing decisions regarding ketek were.nagareda,supra,at.in other words,plaintiffs argue that this case is more like klay and foodservice than it is like zyprexa,mclaughlin,and poulos.plaintiffs contend that safety is the preeminent consideration in prescribing an antibiotic,so that had physicians known about ketek true risks,none of them would have prescribed it.on this logic,any ketek prescription written without notice of the safety information allegedly withheld by aventis was necessarily written in reliance on aventis nondisclosure of that information.this argument is not persuasive,and it entirely fails as a basis for distinguishing zyprexa 
plaintiffs purport to demonstrate the nature of a physician decision to prescribe ketek by presenting evidence showing that sales of ketek dropped precipitously after the fda public health advisory and ketek label revisions in.according to plaintiffs,this sequence of events illustrates that doctors must have prescribed ketek in reliance on aventis misrepresentations prior to the new safety disclosures,because they stopped prescribing ketek upon learning of that new information.plaintiffs expert,meredith rosenthal,testified that the drop in ketek sales was so precipitous that she had never seen anything like it that even a drug loss of patent protection generally did not cause such a slide in sales.despite testifying that ketek sales history was unique in her experience,rosenthal nonetheless opined that,i n her experience,this unprecedented drop must have been caused entirely by the disclosure of ketek safety data.
the decline in ketek sales,combined with rosenthal testimony,can not support an inference that all ketek prescriptions were written in reliance on aventis alleged fraud,because we have already addressed precisely this kind of generalized proof in zyprexa and held that it was insufficient to show rico causation.there,too,the plaintiffs expert simply assumed that a downturn in zyprexa sales was attributable to the disclosure of the previously hidden safety risks,thereby illustrating in his view that the difference between the number of prescriptions written before and those written after the disclosure was attributable to lilly alleged fraud.at.we held that this generalized proof which showed a simple correlation between the safety disclosure and the decline in prescriptions was not enough for the plaintiffs to prove that each class member was injured by lilly alleged misrepresentations,in light of the multifaceted and individualized nature of physicians prescribing decisions.
the same is true here ketek declining sales may have been correlated with the issuance of the fda public health advisory and with ketek label revisions,but mere correlation does not demonstrate causation.see,brown entm t merchs.ass n.moreover,the weakness of the inference that plaintiffs ask us to draw is particularly stark in light of the fact that ketek lower sales were also correlated with significant larger changes in the market for,including some of the dominant market players moving,as well as a growing scientific consensus that the entire field of drugs was of dubious efficacy in treating ketek most popular indications,abs and aecb plaintiffs made no attempt to control for these other factors,or to supply any other information that might render reasonable the inference that the drop in sales was actually attributable to the safety disclosures,as opposed to other factors.
to be sure,it is possible as the district court recognized to envision a drug so dangerous that no physician would ever prescribe it to treat a condition if that physician were aware of its true risks.and,in such an extraordinary case,a reasonable jury might well be able to infer solely from a precipitous in sales that any prescription for the drug was necessarily written in reliance on the defendant concealment of the drug risks.see sergeants iv,d at obviously,in situations where the health risks of a drug are extremely severe,safety considerations might be the sole determinant of a physician decision.after all,the multitude of factors recognized in zyprexa as entering into individual physicians prescribing decisions,the age and sex of the patient,the availability of generics,or the patient past reactions to a drug would be irrelevant if a physician knew that the drug would cause certain death or,to take a less extreme example,if the physician knew that a drug meant to treat acne would cause blindness in a tenth of the patients who took it.the tradeoff simply would never be worth the risk.in such a case,the dangerousness of the drug would speak for itself,leaving open the possibility of proving rico causation through circumstantial proof,mclaughlin,at,such as a precipitous in sales,rather than through individualized inquiries as to physicians actual reliance.zyprexa did not involve an extremely dangerous drug,so its class certification holding has little to say about cases that do.
plaintiffs suggest that this is such a case that ketek is so dangerous that no reasonable physician would have prescribed it if the safety information allegedly withheld by aventis had been known.but the record simply does not support this conclusion.the evidence adduced by plaintiffs shows that ketek had risks.but it also shows that all antibiotics prescribed to treat respiratory infections have risks,and that ketek risks,while perhaps higher than those of most of its competitors,were well within the range of dangerousness typical of similar by the end of june,after more than six million domestic ketek prescriptions,only four deaths and approximately serious hepatic adverse events had been linked to ketek.even assuming widespread underreporting of adverse drug events,that rate of adverse events is simply not enough to support an inference that ketek was so seriously dangerous that no physician would ever have prescribed it had the safety information allegedly withheld by aventis been made public earlier.furthermore,as the district court observed,had doctors prescribing decisions truly been,one would expect sales of ketek to cease entirely after the new safety information was made available.but ketek s ales did not drop to zero immediately after the fda issued a public health advisory relating to ketek liver toxicity in january.rather,sales declined in a manner consistent with the cyclical manner in which sales had declined during the same months the previous year.sergeants iv,d at.
plaintiffs point to two sources of evidence supporting their argument that no doctor would have prescribed ketek if its true risks had been known earlier.first,plaintiffs argue that the fda withdrawal of approval for two of ketek indications and imposition of a black box warning demonstrate ketek dangers.but the record shows that the vote at the december joint committee meeting to withdraw those indications was not motivated purely or even predominantly by safety many voting attendees did not mention safety at all,but rather explained their votes on the basis of effectiveness,citing concerns that ketek might not be any better than a placebo at treating abs and aecb.and the warning added to ketek label had nothing to do with ketek hepatic risks it was imposed in connection with ketek tendency to exacerbate the symptoms of patients afflicted with the rare neurological disorder myasthenia gravis.see.
second,plaintiffs argue that data from study data that they claim aventis withheld from the fda revealed that ketek was three times more likely than augmentin to cause serious hepatic adverse events.but plaintiffs position throughout this litigation,including on appeal,has been that study was plagued with fraud and therefore unreliable.and on this point,plaintiffs are absolutely correct.the doctors responsible for conducting study invented patients out of whole cloth,among a host of other failures that tainted the data with fraud.plaintiffs assertion that a specific study result would have revealed the true danger of ketek if only it had been disclosed to the fda therefore strains credulity.the study numbers reveal nothing,because they are utterly unreliable and probably fictional.plaintiffs can not describe study as fraudulent when it is to their advantage while simultaneously arguing that its findings are material and would have changed the fda approval decision and physicians prescribing decisions if made public.accordingly,the alleged three times as dangerous result also does not show that no doctor would have prescribed ketek absent aventis alleged misrepresentations.
as the foregoing discussion illustrates,plaintiffs theory in this case is effectively plaintiffs seek to persuade us that every individual physician decision to prescribe ketek was truly a decision based entirely on safety,and that the safety information allegedly withheld by aventis was so significant that it would dictate every physician decisionmaking,based on nothing more than a decline in ketek sales figures.we have explained why this theory fails on this record as in zyprexa,given the number of factors that enter into doctors prescribing decisions,it is simply not reasonable to infer from just that decline in sales that all ketek prescriptions were written in reliance on the alleged misrepresentations about ketek safety.in contrast to the hypothetical case of an extremely dangerous drug,the record here does not suggest that the safety information allegedly withheld by aventis which revealed ketek to be at most marginally more dangerous than comparable antibiotics would reasonably be expected to have such a significant impact on the number of prescriptions written.this strongly suggests that something other than aventis alleged misrepresentations was at least partly responsible for the decline in sales,which in turn suggests that physicians prescription decisions were not,in fact,based solely on their misperception of ketek relative safety.plaintiffs theory thus simply does not hold up.
we wish to note,however,that it may be possible to demonstrate rico causation in a case such as this one by adducing generalized proof from which a reasonable jury could conclude that only some prescriptions paid for by each class member were written based on the defendant alleged misrepresentations.in other words,not all claims of this type must necessarily be claims.in cases in which reliance is a necessary part of the plaintiffs chain of causation as in mclaughlin and poulos the plaintiff class has no choice but to show through generalized proof that each one of them relied on the defendant alleged misrepresentations otherwise,the misrepresentations could not have caused an injury to each class member.the situation is arguably somewhat different in a reliance case like this one.here,the question is whether aventis misrepresentations caused an injury to each hbp,and because each hbp paid for numerous ketek prescriptions,each would have been injured by aventis misrepresentations so long as at least some of the prescriptions for which it paid were written in reliance on those misrepresentations.while a rico plaintiff must always show that the defendant conduct caused an actual,quantifiable injury,mclaughlin,at,the precise number of excess prescriptions paid for by each hbp would seem to bear on the damages suffered by each class member,and not on the separate question whether aventis misrepresentations caused each class member to suffer an injury see in re neurontin mktg.sales practices,cir asking whether absent the defendant fraud,the plaintiff would have paid for fewer prescriptions bcs,heartwood,llc,cir finding that t he district court confused proof of causation with proof of amount of damages and so denied the plaintiffs the benefit of the easier burden of proving damages than of causation.
even if we were to read plaintiffs claim to be of this more nuanced type,requiring only a showing that aventis alleged misrepresentations caused each hbp to suffer an injury,plaintiffs generalized proof in this case still falls short.at least where as here there is no basis for inferring that the drug in question was so dangerous that no doctor would prescribe it if its true risks were disclosed,zyprexa establishes that mere correlation between a decline in prescriptions and a disclosure of allegedly withheld information is insufficient to prove rico causation on the theory that the defendant withholding of safety information caused doctors to write excess prescriptions.to ultimately find a defendant liable,a jury must be able to base its decision on something firmer than speculation.see anderson liberty lobby.as in zyprexa,the kind of correlation evidence present
