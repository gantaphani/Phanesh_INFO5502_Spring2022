jocelyn allen and others plaintiffs sued the boeing company boeing and landau associates landau in washington state court,alleging that for several decades boeing released toxins into the groundwater around its facility in auburn,washington,and that for over a decade landau had been negligent in its investigation and remediation of the resulting pollution.boeing removed the case to the united states district court for the western district of washington,claiming federal jurisdiction based on diversity and the class action fairness act cafa.see d.the district court remanded the case to state court,finding that there was not complete diversity and that plaintiffs action came within the exception to cafa federal jurisdiction,d b ii i.boeing appealed.we affirmed the district court rejection of boeing allegation of fraudulent joinder which would have allowed for diversity jurisdiction,but vacated and remanded,finding that the case did not come within cafa exception.allen boeing,cir.we noted that plaintiffs had also sought remand to the state court pursuant to the local controversy exception,d a i,but because the district court had failed to address this exception,we referred the issue to the district court to consider in the first instance.id.at.on remand,the district court held that plaintiffs case came within the local controversy exception and again remanded the case to state court.
boeing appeals,arguing that plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they seek significant relief from landau,the defendant,and that landau conduct does not form a significant basis of the claims asserted,as required by d a i.we affirm the district court remand of this case to the state court,holding that plaintiffs have adequately pled both that they are seeking significant relief from landau and that landau alleged conduct forms a significant basis for their claims.
because we look to the complaint to determine whether the plaintiffs action comes within the local controversy exception see infra,we set forth at some length the allegations contained in plaintiffs first amended complaint fac.
from the to the,boeing used solvents,which allegedly contained hazardous chemicals,in its manufacturing plant in auburn,washington.in,the washington state department of ecology initiated requirements for the treatment,storage,and handling of hazardous materials.
plaintiffs are over individuals who allege that for several decades boeing used materials,chemicals,and solvents that it knew to be hazardous to human health and harmful to the environment,including the soil and groundwater.among the solvents allegedly used as degreasing agents for metal parts were tricholoroethylene tce,tricholorethane tca,and tetrachloroethylene,also known as percholorlethylene pce,and possibly dicholorethene.in,boeing agreed with the state of washington to complete a remedial investigation,feasibility study,draft a cleanup action plan,perform cleanup actions,and clean up as necessary to remediate releases of hazardous substances associated with the boeing auburn plant.the agreement provided that boeing must identify the probable source of any release of hazardous substances,chemical constituents,horizontal and vertical extent of any releases of hazardous substances,the rate and direction of migration of the hazardous substances,as well as track and document the contamination concentrations and potential migration.in,boeing also contracted with landau for the investigation and remediation of the boeing auburn plant.plaintiffs allege that around that time boeing and landau identified a plume of volatile organic chemicals vocs,including tce and pce and their degradation products including vinyl chloride vc in the groundwater at the plant,identified a building on the plant as the likely source of the plume,and noted that the plume had moved off the plant property and was continuing to move in the shallow groundwater in a north northwest direction.the fac further asserts that boeing and landau knew at that time that the movement of these hazardous substances posed a threat to the health and rights of nearby property owners and residents and their properties,and that both defendants failed to take reasonable actions to investigate and remediate the plume or to warn nearby property owners and residents of the presence and movement of hazardous substances.
the fac further alleges that in boeing and landau identified a second plume of pollutants,including tce and pce,that was moving off boeing property in the groundwater.plaintiffs reiterate that boeing and landau failed to investigate and remediate the pollution and failed to warn the property owners and residents.
in,boeing and landau performed samplings in the area of plaintiffs homes and informed the residents of the presence of hazardous substances on their properties.the fac alleges that vocs have been detected in air samples taken from crawl spaces and homes.it alleges that these vocs are harmful to humans 
in november,plaintiffs filed an action against boeing and landau in king county superior court,asserting state law claims of negligence,nuisance,and trespass against boeing and negligence against landau.plaintiffs allege that landau owed them a cognizable duty to exercise reasonable care and that it failed to exercise reasonable care in its investigation,remediation,and containment of the hazardous substances.plaintiffs seek damages from boeing and landau for their foreseeable injuries,including the difference between the current value of their properties and such value if the harm had not been done,the cost of remediation actions,costs of repair or restoration,the value of the use of the continuous trespass,injuries to persons,medical costs,medical monitoring,attorneys fees and expenses as allowed by law,and consequential damages flowing from the contamination which are the natural and proximate result of landau conduct.
in april,boeing,the defendant,removed the action to the united states district court for the western district of washington,asserting two independent bases for federal jurisdiction diversity and cafa.the district court ruled that landau,the defendant,had not been fraudulently joined.this meant that there was not complete diversity of citizenship for jurisdictional purposes.at the same time,the district court remanded the case to the state court on the ground that the action came within cafa exception.boeing appealed.we issued an opinion affirming the district court rejection of boeing assertion of fraudulent joinder,but held that plaintiffs claims did not fall within the exception allen,at.
in our prior opinion,we noted that plaintiffs,in addition to asserting that their claims came within the exception to cafa jurisdiction,maintained that the action also came within the local controversy exception.id.at.we recognized that our opinion in coleman estes express lines,cir,set forth the standard for determining whether a complaint came within the local controversy exception.allen,at.however,we declined to determine in the first instance whether plaintiffs case fits within that exception.id.at.
on remand,the district court established a briefing schedule for plaintiffs renewed motion to remand to state court pursuant to the local controversy exception.boeing argued that the exception does not apply because landau conduct was insignificant compared to boeing alleged conduct the relief sought from landau is insignificant compared to the relief sought from boeing and plaintiffs had failed to establish that landau owed them a duty.
the district court granted the motion to remand to state court.citing dart cherokee basin operating,llc owens,d,the court noted that there was no presumption against removal for cafa cases.it further noted that the general criteria for a cafa suit were present the parties were minimally diverse,the putative class consisted of at least members,and the aggregate amount in controversy exceeded million.the district court noted that boeing did not dispute that more than of the plaintiffs were washington citizens landau is a citizen of washington plaintiffs principal injuries were incurred in washington and no similar class action has been filed against boeing and landau in the last three years.
the district court found this case to be analogous to benko quality loan service,cir.the court determined that plaintiffs fac demonstrates that landau conduct forms a significant basis for their claims.it noted that landau was one of only two defendants,that the complaint alleged that boeing and landau knew in of the plume of vocs moving off boeing property,and that boeing and landau allegedly failed to take reasonable actions to investigate and remediate the pollution.the district court concluded that the complaint allegations were asserted against both defendants equally and that the complaint sought relief against landau on behalf of all of the plaintiffs.the district court commented that a s compared to the other two claims against boeing,for nuisance and trespass,particularly in light of the above factual allegations,the court finds that the negligence claim against landau forms a significant basis for the relief sought by plaintiffs.it further found that,looking at the claims as a whole,negligence claims account for of the claims asserted by plaintiffs.
the district court found that the asserted damages were sufficient to show that plaintiffs sought significant relief from landau.the district court rejected boeing objection that plaintiffs had failed to allege liability because plaintiffs have pleaded separate negligen ce claims against boeing and landau and seek to hold each defendant responsible for its own negligence and for any monetary amounts resulting therefrom.the district court discussion of the local controversy exception concluded with the observation that this is the type of class action with a truly local focus that the local controversy exception was designed to encompass 
finally,the district court noted that because it had previously found that landau had not been fraudulently joined,and that decision had been affirmed by the ninth circuit,there is no alternative basis for jurisdiction.
we review de novo a district court order to remand a case before it to state court.corber xanodyne,cir en banc.the local controversy exception to cafa jurisdiction is a narrow exception,and plaintiffs bear the burden of showing its application.benko,at.however,if the exception applies,the district court must remand the case to state court.serrano connect,cir see also d.
on appeal,boeing asserts that plaintiffs action does not meet the criteria set forth in d a i ii aa and bb boeing contends that plaintiffs do not seek significant relief from landau,as required by subsection aa,and that landau conduct does not form a significant basis for plaintiffs claims,as required by subsection bb.
in reviewing boeing claims,we are guided by our prior opinions in coleman and benko.as we noted in allen,at,coleman directs us to look only to the complaint to determine whether these criteria are met.coleman,at we hold that cafa language unambiguously directs the district court to look only to the complaint in deciding whether the criteria set forth in d a i ii aa and bb are satisfied.
limiting the court inquiry to the complaint inherently cabins the amount of detail required to satisfy the local controversy exception.in coleman,we agreed with the tenth circuit statement in coffey freeport mcmoran copper gold,cir,that 
t he statutory language is unambiguous,and a defendant from whom significant relief is sought does not mean a defendant from whom significant relief may be obtained.there is nothing in the language of the statute that indicates congress intended district courts to wade into the factual swamp of assessing the financial viability of a defendant as part of this preliminary consideration.
coleman,at.we further reasoned that factual determinations under subsections aa and bb are likely to be more expensive and than factual determinations of citizenship and,and that congress was particularly concerned that subject matter jurisdiction determinations be made quickly under cafa.id.at.we noted that i f a determination whether significant relief is sought against the local defendant under subsection aa requires a factual determination about the respective ability of the various defendants to satisfy a judgment,that determination has the potential to be expensive and.id.we concluded 
a factual determination whether the alleged conduct of the local defendant forms a significant basis for the claims asserted by plaintiffs under subsection bb is particularly likely to be expensive and.such a determination necessarily implicates the merits of the case.we see nothing in cafa that indicates a congressional intention to turn a jurisdictional determination concerning the local defendant alleged conduct into a on the merits of the plaintiff claims.
in benko,we applied coleman approach to the local controversy exception.benko held that,in determining whether a plaintiff has claimed significant relief from an defendant,we look to the remedies requested in the complaint.see benko,at.we noted that a the plaintiffs claimed general damages of from meridian the only defendant as well as punitive damages b the total damages recoverable from meridian are between and and c plaintiffs sought equitable relief,which would significantly increase the overall value of the judgment against meridian.id.we concluded that t he amounts sought are sufficient to show that the plaintiffs claim significant relief from a local defendant.id.
benko also evaluated whether the plaintiffs alleged that the conduct of the defendant formed a significant basis for their claims by comparing the allegations against meridian to the allegations made against the other defendants.id.at.we noted that a meridian is one of just six defendants referred to in the second amended complaint and b meridian activities constituted between to of the total debt collection activities of all the defendants.id.at.we therefore concluded that several plaintiffs have colorable claims against meridian.id.at.
in benko,we buttressed our analysis by referring to the statement in the senate judiciary committee report that the local controversy exception 
is intended to respond to concerns that class actions with a truly local focus should not be moved to federal court under this legislation because state courts have a strong interest in adjudicating such disputes a federal court should bear in mind that the purpose of each of these criteria is to identify a truly local controversy a controversy that uniquely affects a particular locality to the exclusion of all others.
benko,at quoting,cong.admin.news.
significant relief 
applying the guidance provided by benko to the case at bar,we agree with the district court that plaintiffs have adequately alleged that they are seeking significant relief from landau.boeing contends that plaintiffs have failed to specify the relief they seek from landau or provide a basis for comparing that relief to the relief they seek from boeing.these arguments are not persuasive.
it is true that boeing activities over several decades created the hazardous plumes.however,it does not follow that boeing liability if any for creating the pollutants necessarily dwarfs plaintiffs claims against landau.the gist of plaintiffs claims is that the movement of the volatile organic chemicals off boeing property caused them harm,not that the existence of the chemicals at the plant harmed them.plaintiffs allege that landau undertook in to investigate,remediate,and clean up the hazardous materials moving off boeing property and failed to take reasonable steps to do so.if landau is shown to have failed,for more than a decade,to remediate the spreading toxic chemical plumes,its liability could be as great as boeing.thus,the fact that boeing created the pollution does not in itself render insignificant the damages caused by landau alleged failure to investigate and remediate the spreading pollution.
boeing assertions that plaintiffs have failed to plead their claims with sufficient specificity are similarly not persuasive.the local controversy exception does not require that plaintiffs specify the division of damages between defendants.
