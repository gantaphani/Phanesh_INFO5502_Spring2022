plaintiffs ezra charitable trust,mirror management,and robert bovit brought this action pursuant to sections b and a of the securities exchange act of,b and a,against defendants tyco international,edward breen tyco chief executive officer,david fitzpatrick tyco chief financial officer,and pricewaterhousecoopers,llp tyco auditor pwc.the district court dismissed the action as to all defendants on the ground that the amended class action complaint did not adequately allege scienter under the private securities litigation reform act pslra,b,and plaintiffs appealed.we affirm.
we present the facts as set forth in the amended class action complaint and the sec filings relied upon in the complaint.see gross summa four,cir.
the context of this,the travails of.plaintiffs recount at some length the reported abuses of tyco past officers and directors,notably chief executive officer dennis kozlowski,chief financial officer mark swartz,chief corporate counsel mark belnick,and director frank walsh.in,as revelations of misconduct surfaced,there was a major shake up at tyco.tyco commissioned a massive internal investigation led by the law firm of boies schiller flexner,which was aided by various accounting firms.all told,over attorney hours and accountant hours were invested as a consequence,tyco disclosed the alleged misconduct of its prior management and made necessary accounting adjustments.the changes were costly,as tyco form report for fiscal showed a net loss of over nine billion dollars,a stark contrast from its nearly four billion dollars of profit in fiscal year,and over four and a half billion dollars profit in fiscal year.as part of tyco,new senior officers and directors were appointed.breen was made the chief executive officer in july,and fitzpatrick was made the chief financial officer in september.
plaintiffs action focuses on the initial results of the,spanning the period between december,and march,plaintiffs allege that the fell well short of sanitizing tyco books,and that new management perpetuated a fraud in the accounting for adt,one of tyco largest subsidiaries.
plaintiffs allege that adt,a provider of security systems,purchased customer contracts from its authorized dealers and accounted for the transactions in the following improper manner.first,adt would ostensibly agree to purchase a customer contract from a dealer for.second,the dealer would ostensibly agree to pay adt as reimbursement for adt expenses in connection with acquiring the contract the connection fee.third,adt would remit the net amount to the dealer the only cash that changed hands,record the acquisition of the contract at the full price of,and record a expense offset income.significantly,adt actual expenses related to each contract were de minimis for a credit adt recorded the difference as income.plaintiffs allege that this was alice in wonderland accounting because generally accepted accounting principles gaap require that intangible assets such as these contracts be recorded at their actual cost here,and because no income is to be recognized under such circumstances.thus,according to plaintiffs,these transactions permitted to fraudulently overstate adt income and assets.
plaintiffs allege that the defendants made actionable misrepresentations in connection with these transactions.first,in its form filed with the sec,tyco management disclosed the results of the internal investigation and stated that tyco was not aware of any systemic or significant fraud related to the company financial statements or of any clear accounting errors that would materially adversely affect the company reported earnings or cash flow from operations for the year and thereafter.the form also purported to correct adt accounting,noting that to the extent the connection fee exceeded actual costs,it should be deferred and amortized over the estimated useful life of an acquired customer relationship ten years.as a consequence,the form reported that earnings would be reduced by million,and that a million charge to earnings would be taken to adjust income improperly recognized in fiscal years to a million adjustment in all.tyco form,filed on,largely echoed the form representations.notably,it stated that new senior management has no reason to believe that the financial statements included in this report are not fairly stated in all material respects.as to adt contract acquisitions,the form noted that fees received from dealers,in excess of actual costs incurred,would be amortized over ten years as a deferred credit.the also included pwc audit opinion,dated december,which stated 
in our opinion,the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of operations,of shareholders equity and of cash flows present fairly,in all material respects,the financial position of tyco international,and its subsidiaries at september,and,and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended september,in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the united states of america 
plaintiffs assert that these releases contained four fraudulent misstatements by the tyco defendants that tyco accounting had been corrected that the financial statements fairly presented tyco status that all material accounting issues,particularly those involving adt,had been corrected and that adt would receive a million revenue stream over the next ten years.plaintiffs maintain that these representations were false because there were still major problems in adt books,notably that the income recognized from dealer connection fees to adt was imaginary,and that the contracts acquired were being recorded at an artificially inflated cost.plaintiffs assert that the defendants corrected only a technical,inconsequential the imaginary income was being recognized too quickly immediately rather than over the life of the contract in their initial restatement,but knowingly permitted more significant improper recognition of income and the inflation of asset remain unaltered.plaintiffs also allege that pwc,knowing of the errors in adt books,nonetheless wrongfully issued a clean audit opinion.
plaintiffs allege that the fraud was brought to light in march,when tyco essentially admitted the fraud in a press release and subsequent form.in a march,press release,tyco stated that,pursuant to ongoing discussions with the sec,it expected to take,charges between million and million for issues identified primarily in adt.tyco also announced that the president of adt,jerry boggess,and other senior adt managers,had been fired.tyco stock dropped significantly on the news.plaintiffs say that defendants acknowledged in their form that they had been in ongoing discussions with the sec about their accounting for the dealer fees and were changing their accounting for the dealer charges to treat them properly as a reduction in adt costs in acquiring the contracts 
plaintiffs also allege that tyco falsely attributed the march accounting corrections to a issued accounting requirement from the financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force eitf eitf had nothing to do with the relevant accounting issue.plaintiffs assert that the proper accounting principle is and was located in accounting research bulletin arb,which has been in effect since.
plaintiffs also emphasize the actions of pwc audit engagement partner for tyco,richard scalzo.the sec,in an accounting and auditing enforcement action dated august,barred scalzo from practicing accounting before it based on its finding that scalzo had violated section b and rule and committed improper professional conduct in connection with his audits of tyco for fiscal years.see wl release.essentially,the sec concluded that scalzo was on notice of prior management misconduct,failed to take the necessary steps required by generally accepted auditing standards gaas,and recklessly permitted pwc to issue audit reports stating that tyco books had been audited according to gaas.
plaintiffs assert that the tyco defendants had two basic motivations for the alleged fraud.first,they wished to keep tyco viable as a going concern.plaintiffs allege that tyco had over four billion dollars in debt coming due in early,and faced imminent bankruptcy if it failed to meet these obligations.their theory is that management misstated adt accounting to give the false impression that tyco had a million revenue stream,which permitted tyco to obtain crucial financing second,they wanted to preserve their own lucrative positions,which included large salaries,bonuses,and stock options.plaintiffs allege that the tyco defendants highlighted their deceit by providing false explanations for the belated correction.
as to pwc,plaintiffs allege that pwc audit opinion was fraudulent because pwc knowingly failed to comply with gaas and was aware that tyco accounting was not in compliance with gaap.plaintiffs state that pwc motive was straightforward.pwc looked the other way on tyco new fraud,just as it allegedly had with past frauds,to preserve its lucrative business relationship with tyco.
the district court dismissed the complaint,concluding that scienter was inadequately alleged.as to breen and fitzpatrick,the court concluded that their financial stake in tyco continued viability was inadequate,standing alone,to create a strong inference of scienter,and that the balance of the allegations amounted to nothing more than fraud by hindsight,as there was no basis for concluding that breen and fitzgerald knew the disputed representations were false when made.the court also held that,because tyco liability was solely derivative of breen and fitzpatrick,the claims against the corporate entity should be dismissed.finally,the court concluded that pwc financial stake in its continued business relationship with tyco was inadequate to create a strong inference of scienter,and that the remaining allegations were either too vague or pertained only to conduct outside the class period.
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in evaluating in isolation their allegations of scienter on the part of the tyco defendants rather than assessing the collective picture.they further contend that the court erred in failing to appreciate the import of the alleged gaap and gaas violations that pwc countenanced,as well as the relevance of pwc past misconduct in auditing tyco.
we review the allowance of the defendants motions to dismiss de novo.aldridge cross,cir.in reviewing a motion to dismiss,we take as true all allegations and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor however,we are free to disregard bald assertions,unsupportable conclusions,and opprobrious epithets.in re credit suisse first boston,cir.moreover,we may affirm on any independently sufficient ground,cir.
in general,a securities fraud claim has six elements a material misrepresentation or omission scienter connection with the purchase or sale of a security reliance economic loss and loss causation.dura,broudo,d.our focus here is on the adequacy of plaintiffs allegations of scienter.scienter is defined as a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud,and a plaintiff must allege that defendants consciously intended to defraud,or that they acted with a high degree of recklessness.aldridge,at.
under the pslra,the complaint must first provide detailed pleading about each of the statements challenged,including factual allegations illustrating precisely why the challenged statement is misleading.greebel ftp software,cir the pslra also requires the complaint to plead particular facts that give rise to a strong rather than merely reasonable inference of scienter this alters the usual rule b standard,in that while the court continues to give all reasonable inferences to plaintiffs,those inferences supporting scienter must be strong ones.in re cabletron,cir.
we have interpreted the pslra scienter provision as demanding a recitation of facts supporting a highly likely inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.in re stone webster,sec,cir.in making this assessment,we have eschewed any reliance on a rigid pleading formula,instead preferring to rely on a approach that proceeds case by case.cabletron,at.scienter allegations do not pass the strong inference test when,viewed in light of the complaint as a whole,there are legitimate explanations for the behavior that are equally convincing.credit suisse,at see also aldridge,at the plaintiff must show that his characterization of the events and circumstances as showing scienter is highly likely.pleading fraud by hindsight,essentially making general allegations that defendants knew earlier what later turned out badly,is not sufficient.gross,at internal citation and quotation omitted.
tyco defendants 
as to the tyco defendants,the plaintiffs argue that several factors which,taken together,establish scienter the significant gaap violation in adt accounting defendants false exculpatory statement that the march restatement was mandated by eitf the close proximity between the march restatement and the purported december correction defendants knowledge of kozlowski relationship with boggess and adt and defendants desire to save tyco and maintain their lucrative positions.we conclude that the district court correctly dismissed the claims.
we begin with context.the plaintiffs assert that the district court failed to view their allegations in their entirety.but we think it is the plaintiffs who are being myopic.plaintiffs pay too little heed to the circumstances in which the alleged fraud was taking place tyco had new management,was in the midst of a massive of fraud,and had disclosed the wrongdoing of prior management.we think that it is important to bear this context in mind as we evaluate plaintiffs claims.
tyco statements were not nearly so absolute as plaintiffs present them.for example,the statement in the form that management was currently unaware of systemic fraud was made in the context the form recounting of the investigation,prior management transgressions,and the impossibility of correcting all errors 
few,if any,major companies have ever been subjected to the corporate governance and accounting scrutiny entailed in phase of the boies firm work.however,despite the extent of the boies firm work,the company has not sought to go back and identify every accounting decision and every corporate act over a period that was wrong or questionable,or whether there was a preferable accounting treatment among the alternative treatments available under gaap.given the size and scope of the company operations,such a task,or anything approaching it,would have been impossible within any plausible.moreover,in part because of the passage of time,documentation was not always available the documentation that was available was often dispersed and neither the boies firm nor the company had the benefit of information from prior senior management of tyco because the former chief executive officer,chief financial officer,and chief corporate counsel have all been under criminal indictment during the course of this review and analysis.all of these factors,as well as the company past failure to document many decisions contemporaneously,would have limited the conclusions that could have been drawn concerning individual accounting treatments in any event.nonetheless,for the actual purposes of the work,as discussed above,the company believes that the scope and detail of the review,and the documentation and information available,was sufficient to reach the conclusions discussed below.
the company is not aware of any systemic or significant fraud related to the company financial statements or of any clear accounting errors that would materially adversely affect the company reported earnings or cash flow from operations for the year and thereafter.however,as discussed below,certain instances of erroneous accounting entries have been identified and corrected.in addition,current management has concluded that,in the past,the company in general suffered from poor documentation inadequate policies and procedures to prevent the misconduct of senior executives that occurred inadequate procedures for proper corporate authorizations inadequate approval procedures and documentation a lack of oversight by senior management at the corporate level a pattern of using aggressive accounting that,even when not erroneous,was undertaken with the purpose and effect of increasing reported results above what they would have been if more conservative accounting were used pressure on,and inducements to,segment and unit managers to increase current earnings,including by decisions as to what accounting treatment to employ and a lack of stated and demonstrable commitment by former senior corporate management to set appropriate standards of ethics,integrity,accounting,and corporate governance 
similarly,the form representation that new management believed the financial statements were fairly stated included the caveat 
there can be no assurances,however,that new problems will not be found in the future.we expect to continue to improve our controls with each passing quarter.it will take some time,however,before we have in place the rigorous controls that our board of directors and new senior management desire and our shareholders deserve.
the form sounded other cautionary notes as well.under risk factors,in addition to cautioning that continuing negative publicity and pending litigation could have a substantial negative impact on tyco,the form warned that more bad news could be on the horizon 
we and others have received various subpoenas and requests from the sec,the district attorney of new york,and the attorney for the district of new hampshire and others seeking the production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into our governance,management,operations,accounting and related controls.we can not predict when these investigations will be completed,nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be.it is possible that we will be required to pay material fines,consent to injunctions on future conduct,lose the ability to conduct business with government instrumentalities or suffer other penalties,each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
perhaps most significantly,the form also specifically cautioned about review by the sec 
as of the filing date of this form,we continue to be engaged in a dialogue with the sec division of corporation finance,as part of a routine review of our periodic filings.while we believe that we have resolved the material accounting issues prior to filings there can be no assurance that the resolution of the remaining comments issued by the staff will not necessitate one or more amendments to this or prior periodic reports.
essentially,the hazard came to pass regarding adt contract accounting.see financial acquisition partners lp blackwell,cir what the company warned might happen,did indeed happen.all told,these cautionary statements are far more concrete,in light of tyco circumstances,than vague boilerplate warnings.compare plotkin ip axess,cir.moreover,attempts to provide investors with warnings of risks generally weaken the inference of scienter.see geffon micrion,cir.from this context,we proceed to plaintiffs specific allegations.
as to gaap violations,there is nothing in the complaint supporting an inference that breen or fitzgerald were directly involved in these detailed accounting matters or had knowledge of their alleged falsity.see stone webster,at nothing supporting inference that senior officers were involved in details of accounting.while fitzgerald,as chief financial officer,might be expected to have some general supervisory role over the accounting issues,he appeared on the scene only weeks before the form was prepared,and there is no indication that he was aware of any impropriety.see id.moreover,the representations in tyco filings were,in essence,estimations of whether the books still contained significant errors.plaintiffs allegations fall short of establishing that these estimations were unreasonable in light of the massive internal investigation.see id.at.in sum,there are no alleged facts that strongly suggest that the defendants knew any of the challenged statements were false when made.see credit suisse,at see also blackwell,at no factual allegations supporting inference that individual defendants knew true value of assets or that discount rate or assumption was improper.
plaintiffs reliance on the defendants allegedly false attribution of the restatement to eitf is similarly flawed.obviously,evidence of conscious wrongdoing may be shown by facts demonstrating concealment.see generally cabletron,at.but the allegations fall short again here.there is simply no basis for concluding that the individual defendants were involved in or had personal knowledge of this detailed accounting issue.see stone webster,at.
plaintiffs are correct that a short time period between an alleged misstatement and a later disclosure of inconsistent information may be relevant to the question of scienter.see shaw digital equip,cir.in this case,however,the timing of the correction has limited probative value,as the change appears to have been prompted by sec division of corporation finance the simple fact of a correction is also not particularly probative p laintiffs may not simply seize upon disclosures made later and allege that they should have been made earlier.cabletron,at.
that the defendants were generally aware of kozlowski relationship with boggess also does not suffice.it is ordinarily not sufficient to conclusorily allege an overarching fraudulent scheme or corrupt environment.credit suisse,at.similarly,that there had been issues with adt is not enough.fraud can not be inferred simply because a parent corporation might have been more curious or concerned about the activity at a subsidiary.chill,cir.moreover,plaintiffs fail to account for both breen and fitzgerald general unfamiliarity with tyco indeed,the fact of breen and fitzpatrick recent arrivals,and consequent lack of involvement in past dubious decisions,undermines most of plaintiffs allegations.
this brings us to plaintiffs allegations of motive and opportunity.c allegations which merely assert motive and opportunity,without something more,fail to satisfy the pslra.cabletron,at.the question becomes whether plaintiffs have alleged more than the usual concern by executives to improve financial results.id.
the key motivation alleged is breen and fitzgerald desperation to save tyco from bankruptcy.plaintiffs rely on three factual allegations to support the inference that tyco faced imminent bankruptcy that tyco had to repay or refinance nearly four billion dollars in debt in february that breen acknowledged that tyco faced a liquidity gap in if it failed to obtain a one and a half billion dollar line of credit and that some suppliers had requested letters of credit from tyco.these allegations are rather limited and conclusory,particularly when set against tyco enormous assets well over sixty billion dollars worth,per the form,significant shareholder equity over billion dollars,and substantial value despite significant continued,tyco earned approximately a billion dollars in and its earnings have climbed steadily since then.this collection of facts does not support a strong inference of imminent bankruptcy.baron smith,cir an event of default is different from an actual default.
further,this case is different from those relied upon by the plaintiffs.here,the defendants were not acting to conceal their own errors or justify their past strategic decisions.compare cabletron,at aldridge,at.in addition,the defendants compensation appears to be largely or otherwise guaranteed,perhaps as an acknowledgment of risk.as to their stock options,it is not at all clear why defendants would prefer postponing profit reducing and stock price reducing to future years when their options would have vested to swallowing the entire bitter pill in.
the dueling inferences,taken as wholes,break down as follows.did the defendants,brought in to clean up a massive and fraud and actively scrutinized by the sec,financial media,and bar,fraudulently commit an accounting violation and fully document their fraud in
