we are asked to decide whether seven individual state court actions,each with fewer than one hundred plaintiffs,should be treated as one mass action eligible for removal to federal court under the class action fairness act of cafa,stat.cafa extends federal removal jurisdiction only to civil actions in which monetary relief claims of or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs claims involve common questions of law or fact.d b i.as neither the parties nor the trial court has proposed jointly trying the claims of one hundred or more plaintiffs in this case,we affirm the district court order remanding each of the seven individual actions to state court.
the dow chemical company dow appeals the district court order remanding the toxic tort claims of west african foreign nationals to state court.plaintiffs allege that they were exposed to a dow product containing dbcp while working on banana and pineapple plantations in the villages of ono and kakoukro in the ivory coast plaintiffs claim to have suffered a host of serious and permanent injuries as a result of exposure to dbcp,including sterility and infertility.on september,plaintiffs filed suit against dow and several other defendants in los angeles superior court,asserting claims for negligence,misbranding,defective design,fraudulent concealment,breach of implied warranties,and battery.they did so in seven separate actions,each of which included fewer than one hundred plaintiffs.
dow subsequently filed a notice of removal to federal court,asserting both federal diversity jurisdiction and jurisdiction under cafa.dow argued,inter alia,that there was complete diversity between plaintiffs and all properly joined defendants that several california defendants amvac chemical corporation,dole food company,dole fresh fruit company,standard fruit and steamship company,and standard fruit company had been fraudulently joined to defeat removal to federal court and that the seven actions filed by plaintiffs,taken together,qualified as a mass action removable to federal court under cafa.cafa defines a mass action as 
any civil action in which monetary relief claims of or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs claims involve common questions of law or fact,except that jurisdiction shall exist only over those plaintiffs whose claims in a mass action satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirements under subsection a.
d b i.the statute specifies that a mass action shall not include any civil action in which ii the claims are joined upon motion of a defendant or iv the claims have been consolidated or coordinated solely for pretrial proceedings.d b ii.
the district court remanded the actions to state court sua sponte,holding that defendants had failed to show that the california companies were fraudulently joined and that removal under cafa was not proper because each of the actions involved fewer than the one hundred plaintiff statutory minimum for a mass action under cafa.the district court specifically rejected defendants argument that the claims should be removable because plaintiffs had strategically sought to avoid federal jurisdiction by filing several separate state court actions in groups fewer than one hundred.emphasizing that cafa specifically excludes actions in which claims have been joined upon motion of a defendant from the definition of a mass action,the court concluded that to allow removal in this case would effect an around the limits congress itself has imposed on removal pursuant to cafa.
on appeal of the district court sua sponte remand orders,a prior panel of this court vacated and remanded,holding that the district court exceeded its authority by ordering a remand sua sponte.see ayemou amvac chemical,cir.plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion to remand their claims to state court,arguing,inter alia,that defendants had failed to demonstrate that plaintiffs claims satisfied the amount in controversy requirement for federal diversity jurisdiction or the amount in controversy requirement for removing a mass action to federal court under cafa.see abrego abrego dow chem,cir.plaintiffs also claimed that none of the state court actions were mass actions under cafa because each of the seven suits involved fewer than one hundred plaintiffs.
the district court granted plaintiffs motion to remand on october,relying almost verbatim on the reasoning contained in its earlier sua sponte orders.dow sought permission to appeal the district court refusal to exercise jurisdiction under cafa pursuant to c this court granted permission to appeal on january,we review the district court remand order de novo.see abrego abrego,at.
the primary issue before us is whether seven individual state court actions,each with fewer than one hundred plaintiffs,should be treated as one mass action eligible for removal to federal court under cafa.to answer this question,we turn to the language of the statute,after first placing that language in context.see dodd united states,d.
congress enacted cafa in to assure fair and prompt recoveries for class members with legitimate claims to restore the intent of the framers by providing for federal court consideration of interstate cases of national importance under diversity jurisdiction and to benefit society by encouraging innovation and lowering consumer prices.cafa,stat.at.as this description of the act purposes makes clear,cafa was designed primarily to curb perceived abuses of the class action device which,in the view of cafa proponents,had often been used to litigate or even national class actions in state courts.see id.at.at the same time,however,section a of the act also extended federal removal jurisdiction to mass actions,which were defined as any civil action except a class action in which monetary relief claims of or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs claims involve common questions of law or fact.cafa a b i,d b i.this mass action provision is at the heart of the current appeal.
although plaintiffs in a mass action,unlike in a class action,do not seek to represent the interests of parties not before the court,cafa provides that a qualifying mass action shall be deemed to be a class action removable to federal court under the act,so long as the rest of cafa jurisdictional requirements are met.see d a.among these requirements,the aggregate amount in controversy must exceed,exclusive of interest and costs,and at least one plaintiff must be a citizen of a state or foreign state different from that of any defendant.see d.subsection d further limits federal removal jurisdiction in a mass action to those plaintiffs whose claims in a mass action satisfy the jurisdictional amount in controversy requirements for federal diversity jurisdiction d b i.
although cafa thus extends federal diversity jurisdiction to both class actions and certain mass actions,the latter provision is fairly narrow.as noted above,cafa mass action provision applies only to civil actions in which the monetary relief claims of or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly.d b i.by its plain terms,d therefore does not apply to plaintiffs claims in this case,as none of the seven state court actions involves the claims of one hundred or more plaintiffs,and neither the parties nor the trial court has proposed consolidating the actions for trial.
w hen the statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,d internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,concluding that plaintiffs claims fall outside cafa removal provisions is not absurd,but rather is consistent with both the rule that plaintiffs,as masters of their complaint,may choose their forum by selecting state over federal court and with the equally presumption against federal removal jurisdiction.see lowdermilk bank ass n,cir.we therefore hold that cafa mass action provisions do not permit a defendant to remove to federal court separate state court actions,each involving the monetary claims of f
