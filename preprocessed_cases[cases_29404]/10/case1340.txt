this is the latest installment in a long running class action lawsuit about conditions inside albuquerque jails.in this iteration of the case,we must answer only a single question does an order withdrawing approval of a class action settlement agreement qualify as a final decision subject to appeal under the answer is no.like an order granting a new trial under,or an order granting relief from a judgment under.b,an order unraveling a class action settlement agreement is anything but a final decision.such an order simply presses the reset button,vacates any prior final decision,and marks the case for renewed litigation.without a final decision amenable to our review under,we must and do dismiss this appeal.
while the history of this dispute is long and complex,for purposes of this appeal a thumbnail sketch will do.in,the plaintiffs sued the city of albuquerque,bernalillo county,and various individuals involved in operating the bernalillo county detention center bcdc.the plaintiffs sought to represent a class of all prisoners who are presently,or will be confined in the bcdc.compl.soon,other members of the class intervened to form a seeking to represent persons with mental developmental disabilities who are now,or in the future will be,detained at bcdc.at.the plaintiffs alleged that the conditions at bcdc were constitutionally deficient due,in large part,to overcrowding.
eventually,after the class and subclass sought and received certification,the parties negotiated a pair of settlement for the class and another for the the court approved in and over which it retained continuing jurisdiction.the parties operated under these agreements until when the county built a new jail,the metropolitan detention center mdc,and transferred all the prisoners from bcdc to mdc.but this transfer only prompted a new dispute.the plaintiffs argued that the settlement agreements should,in effect,transfer with all of the county prisoners to the new mdc and govern the defendants conduct there.for their part,the county and the other defendants opposed extending the agreements to mdc.after much wrangling,the parties eventually reached a new pair of settlement agreements that superseded the deals.by their express terms,the new agreements governed conditions only at mdc.pursuant to.e,the district court gave its approval to these new agreements in june and,as before,retained continuing jurisdiction over their implementation.
the agreements soon ran into trouble of their own.after moving all its prisoners from bcdc to mdc,the county signed an agreement iga with the federal government that allowed federal detainees to be housed at bcdc.under the terms of the iga,the county bore certain contractual responsibilities concerning the care and treatment of federal detainees.at the same time,however,the county was required to operate bcdc but was allowed instead to contract out operational obligations to a private company,cornell corporation.according to the plaintiffs,however,the county misrepresented this arrangement to them by suggesting that cornell alone bore contractual duties to the federal government.and it was only because of this alleged misrepresentation,the plaintiffs say,that they agreed to restrict the coverage of the settlement agreements to the mdc facility rather than to insist on a deal that continued to address the treatment of prisoners in the bcdc facility.
after the plaintiffs claimed they learned the true nature of the county role in the iga,they brought the issue to the district court attention.many motions and responses and arguments followed,all of which culminated in the district court march,order finding that the county had misrepresented to the plaintiffs its iga interactions with the federal government.based on this finding,the district court withdrew its rule e approval of the settlement agreements and gave the plaintiffs permission to rescind those agreements,which the plaintiffs proceeded to do.shortly after issuing its decision,the district court judge found that she needed to recuse from the case and the matter was assigned to a new judge.
the defendants now seek to appeal the district court march,order.in their appeal,the defendants raise a host of arguments for reversal,including a contention that the district court judge should have recused herself before issuing the march,order and so allowed another judge to consider the plaintiffs complaint that they had been misled.but before the defendants can get to any of that,they bear the burden of establishing this court authority to hear their appeal.this burden,the defendants say,they can carry for a variety of reasons the march,order they seek to challenge came after a final judgment the order is appealable under the collateral order doctrine and the order implicates the jurisdictional authority of the district court.we address each of these theories in turn.
the courts of appeals are creations of congress and the boundaries of their jurisdiction are staked by statute.when it comes to when federal appellate courts may take a case,congress has said that we may usually hear appeals only from final decisions of the district courts of the united states.and a final decision does not normally occur until there has been a decision by the district court that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.van cauwenberghe biard,quoting catlin united states.a final decision is,put differently,one by which the district court disassociates itself from a case.swint chambers cnty.comm n,mohawk,carpenter.
undergirding the final decision rule is congress implicit judgment that the district judge is best positioned to bear primary responsibility for policing the tactics and maneuvers of the litigants in ongoing that the district judge can better exercise this responsibility if appellate courts do not regularly intervene and the district judge rulings before he or she has reached a final decision on a particular matter.better to wait until the district judge has made up his or her mind than to intervene when things remain in flux and the district court could still reverse course and provide the very relief a complaining party might seek to achieve in an appeal.see,koller,united states wampler,cir.
the defendants say their appeal satisfies the final decision rule because the district court order and perhaps its order approving the parties settlement agreements were final judgments for purposes of.in the defendants view,because an appealable final decision or decisions preceded the march,order,this makes the march,order a final decision,too.put simply,in the defendants estimation,any order is automatically subject to appellate review.
this is mistaken.while the defendants are correct that a final judgment is the paradigmatic final decision appealable under,see midland asphalt united states,it does follow from this fact that every case with a final judgment in it is appealable.the defendants are too quick to generalize and in doing so run afoul of the logical fallacy of accident.see generally nicholas bunnin jiyuan yu,the blackwell dictionary of western philosophy.just because all the people you met lately are kind does mean all people are kind.in much the same way,just because final judgments can be appealed does mean everything in every case that has a final judgment may be appealed.
fact is,every decision must be assessed on its own terms to determine whether it is a final decision amenable to appeal.the plain language of tells us as much,authorizing this court to entertain only final decisions that is,decisions that are themselves any old decision in any case where a final judgment happens to be knocking about.and while it is surely true that many orders qualify as final decisions on their own terms,not every order does.see moore federal practice.
the nature of the defendants appeal in this case illustrates as much.before this court,the defendants seek to challenge only the march,order,not the or orders that,they contend,constitute final judgments the defendants arguments before us thus are aimed at attacking any final judgment.just the opposite,in fact the defendants seek the benefit of those putative final judgments,challenging only the march,order that effectively undid them.so it is that,when assessing our authority to hear this appeal,our focus naturally turns,as it must,to the district court order that the defendants appeal seeks to attack,not other orders the appeal does seek to upset.
properly framed,then,this appeal raises the question whether an order withdrawing a settlement approval is an appealable final decision.and the answer to that question must be no.a district court order in these circumstances does disassociate the court from the case it does end the litigation on the merits.just the opposite the order ensures litigation on the merits will continue in the district court.if the and orders approving the parties settlement agreements amounted to final judgments,the march,order was their antithesis,obliterating any finality the case might have once enjoyed,vacat ing the judgment and set ting the stage for further trial court proceedings.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,fed.prac.proc,ed.wright miller.the district court challenged order essentially indicates that any prior final decision is defunct,gone,and further litigation on the merits must resume,and the usual rule that we must not interfere with ongoing district court proceedings governs.
that this is so even the defendants can not help but confirm backhandedly,complaining to us as they do that the district court march,order means they will face the very serious and unwholesome prospect of protracted litigation of a class action lawsuit.aplt.br.in supp.of appellate jurisdiction at.whether or not the renewed proceedings in district court will be unwholesome or protracted we do know.but the defendants are surely right that,under the order terms,they face more litigation on the merits in the district court.and that irrepressible fact dictates our conclusion that the march,order is no final decision.
our holding finds compelling parallels in other contexts.in a pair of decisions for this court,judge brorby has explained that an order granting a motion under.b reopening a judgment and an order declining to enter a proposed consent decree are not appealable under.this is because in both situations the district court order ensures that litigation on the merits will continue in the district court.utah kennecott,cir see also stubblefield windsor cap,cir.likewise,we have long held that a district court order granting a new trial pursuant to.is an appealable final decision for the same reason.see,delano kitch,f d,cir kanatser chrysler,f d,cir see also allied chem.daiflon.a final appealable judgment may well already exist in a case before a motion under either rule or rule b is filed.but the fact a preexisting judgment exists does mean an order granting relief under those provisions is itself also appealable.far from it,such orders generally are appealable because,just as here,they set aside or undo a judgment and so settle nothing with finality except the fact that more litigation is on the way.
rather than focus on these parallels,defendants ask us to look to an unpublished and so decision,roose patrick,app x cir,that,they say,should lead us to conclude all orders are appealable final decisions.examining roose,however,confirms the opposite conclusion.after the district court entered a judgment dismissing her case,karen roose filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.id.at.the district court denied the motion and roose sought to appeal this order.id.we permitted the appeal only because the court order finally decided the amended complaint issue and no further proceedings were contemplated in the district court.id.at.in this way,roose is similar to the situation where a district court denies a motion to reopen a final judgment under rule b,or where it denies a motion for a new trial under rule we said usually qualify as final decisions for purposes of because they usually signal that the district court business is done,that it has disassociated itself from the case,that we may act without stepping on the district court toes.see,stubblefield,at see also wright miller at the general rule that appeal can be taken from final denial of a motion to vacate a judgment is well settled.but none of this speaks to the converse situation now before us,where a order grants relief vacating a judgment.indeed,roose only serves to highlight the profound analytical difference between orders that decline to undo the judgment a situation which usually marks the end of the parties road in district court and those that grant such relief and so signal only that litigation in the district court is far from done.
while the district court march,order may not disassociate the district court from the case,the defendants reply that it does at least finally decide that the district court earlier and decisions are final.put differently,the defendants argue that the march,order deprives them of the repose secured by the parties earlier settlement right to avoid trial or at least renewed litigation.and this right,they say,will be if appellate review is deferred.
but that is not enough.many interlocutory orders can be characterized as final in the sense that they irretrievably decide a question about the scope and duration of the district court proceedings.should this deposition proceed should that interrogatory be allowed how about this or that question in the district court decisions on any of these questions can be final in the sense that they are definitive and not practically reviewable later.but they rarely qualify as final appealable decisions for purposes of because they do not signal the litigation is over neither do they disassociate the district court from the case.to decide such questions would require us to do exactly what congress has told us not to ourselves in the job of policing the parties tactics and maneuvers in ongoing district court litigation.neither,in any event,are the district court decisions themselves always as final as they seem the parties remain free to seek,and in most cases the district court remains free to revisit and reconsider,interlocutory rulings on questions like whether a deposition should be allowed or a settlement agreement disallowed.to be a final decision in the relevant sense for,then,it is generally not enough that a decision might seem at one point to irretrievably decide the scope and duration of litigation in the district court usually it must end that litigation.
the defendants urge that a contrary result is compelled by cohen beneficial industries loan,which held that certain otherwise interlocutory orders can qualify for appeal under when they concern some collateral issue and have practically final effects on the parties.id.at.the undoing of a settlement agreement is not among those matters appealable under cohen,however.
neither can our conclusion on this score come as a surprise.we said as much long ago,in desktop direct,digital equipment corp,cir.there,a party attempted to appeal a district court order rescinding a final judgment that was predicated on a settlement agreement between the parties.the district court had rescinded the final judgment because,much as here,the parties settlement agreement had been induced by a misrepresentation.id.at.before this court,the putative appellant argued that,unless its appeal was heard immediately,it would forever lose the to it by the parties settlement to endure further litigation in the district court.id.at.writing for this court,judge logan declined to permit an appeal under cohen.id.at.the supreme court then granted certiorari and proceeded to affirm judge logan decision unanimously.digital equip.desktop direct.in doing so,the supreme court explained that congress final decision rule would end up a pretty puny one if immediate appellate review,whether under cohen or otherwise,were available every time a party claimed that some interest,such as the right not to stand trial,would be irretrievably lost due to an erroneous district court decision.id.at.so it is that,as desktop direct held and we reaffirm today,a settlement agreement promise
