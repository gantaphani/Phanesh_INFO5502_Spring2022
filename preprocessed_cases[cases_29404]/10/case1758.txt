discussion 
challenge to motion order not cognizable 
in their appeal,maughan and brown maughan challenge the order granting google motion essentially on three grounds google failed to prove that section,subdivision b,the express motion exclusion for class actions and actions in the public interest private attorney general,was inapplicable to this action google did not carry its burden to show their claims were based on an issue of public interest and arose from protected speech or petitioning activity and maughan and brown maughan demonstrated their claims had the requisite minimal merit,because the trial court erred in determining that google search results do not necessarily convey a defamatory meaning and that their claims were barred by the communications decency act of cda.we conclude their challenge to the motion order is not cognizable on this appeal from the judgment.

that the trial court included no ruling on google request for attorney fees and costs in the motion does not compel a contrary conclusion on the theory that the order on the motion was simply an interim order.google failure to prompt the court to rule on its request and obtain such a ruling amounted to a forfeiture of its request.see people hill th,d.the order granting the motion therefore was final when made,and thus appealable.

order granting as fees and costs not abuse 
google contends the trial court abused its discretion in reducing the attorney fees and costs sought by google in its motion for attorney fees and costs under the statute.we disagree.
these unchallenged facts were set forth in the trial court order granting google motion for attorney fees and costs as the prevailing defendant on its motion,google sought in attorney fees and costs,consisting of as fees and as costs in connection with that motion,plus as fees and costs in connection with its separate motion for fees and costs.although four attorneys worked on the slapp motion,google seeks to recover fees earned only by partner timothy alger,who bills at the rate of per hour and senior associate lesley williams,who bills at the rate of per hour.
the court granted google motion for fees and costs but reduced the amount awarded to after explaining this court routinely deals with attorneys fee requests in complex cases and other contexts such as in class actions and discovery motions.as such,this court has experience with how much time attorneys should be spending and typically do spend on difficult and complex matters.this court believes that a reasonable time spent on the slapp motion and the instant motion for fees and costs is,as maughan and brown maughan have suggested,approximately hours or one attorney work week.averaging the billing rate of the two attorneys who worked on the motion results in per hour.per hour multiplied by hours amounts to.adding a reasonable figure for costs the court believes that is a generous and reasonable award of attorneys fees and costs given the circumstances in this action.
abuse of discretion is the standard applicable to review of an attorney fees award.ketchum moses cal th,d.we therefore decline google invitation to apply the substantial evidence rule.lenk,th,d a challenge in an appellate court to the sufficiency of the evidence is reviewed under the substantial evidence rule.

goggle has failed to carry its burden to show the trial court award of as attorney fees and costs constituted an abuse of discretion.although cast as a challenge for abuse of discretion,google position is essentially that the trial court ruling is not supported by substantial evidence.goggle contends the superior court decision to award in fees and costs based on the unsupported claim of maughan and brown maughan counsel,and in the face of a detailed evidentiary showing by google,was arbitrary and capricious and the award should be reversed because it was unsupported by substantial evidence and beyond the bounds of reason.google further contends that its evidentiary showing established the baseline for any award of fees,and the court below was required,in departing from that baseline,to do so based on a careful evaluation of google a wholesale rejection of the evidence in favor of the and unsupported claim of opposing counsel.google also contends there is an utter lack of substantial evidence for the court award because maughan estimate of time spent by his lawyers is not the kind of substantial evidence required for a proper calculation of fees under the statute,subd.c 
in its reply brief,google continues its challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the award of fees and costs by arguing the trial court reliance on the estimated figure put forth by counsel for maughan and brown maughan in his declaration was outrageous in that there was no documentary support whatsoever for that estimate.google also renews its claim that the substantial evidence rule governs and that the fee award was not supported by substantial evidence.although in its opening brief google contends the trial court abused its discretion by failing to use a lodestar analysis of google actual fees and costs,google concedes in its reply brief that the court touched on the lodestar factors in its decision 
contrary to google claim,the trial court did not abuse its discretion by arbitrarily applying these lodestar adjustment factors.initially,we point out the trial court did not,as asserted by google,arbitrarily use maughan counsel claimed expenditure of time as the yardstick for an award of fees and then put window dressing on its decision by discussing google evidence of actual fees and costs.the court expressly found maughan and brown maughan counsel who,by this court and google own admission,are capable lawyers with an impressive track record,and whose brief was of equal caliber to google vis a vis the slapp hearing,spent only hours between one partner and one associate.in evaluating the attorney hours claimed by google counsel,the trial court took into account not only this factual finding but also the court own experience and expertise in handling complex civil cases.
in this regard,the court found i n order to have charged in fees for the slapp motion the firm must be claiming over hours of work.this seems excessive especially since google counsel acknowledge that they are old hats at slapp motions and experts in defamation and the cda.such a motion should not have been such a monumental undertaking.applying the factors suggested by google in niederer ferreira d,this court finds the fee request excessive.
additionally,the trial court found the time sheets attached to the motion are somewhat vague in their descriptions of what precisely defense counsel was doing for the claimed amount of time.defense counsel disputes that it is seeking hours of time as claimed by maughan and brown maughan but offers this court no total number of hours it did spend on the slapp motion.
the court further found that it had to factor in some type of efficiency analysis for these reasons.this case had been active for approximately months at the time of the slapp motion.there was no discovery taken or other motion practice.indeed,under the slapp statute all proceedings are stayed once a n slapp motion is filed.the court file reflects very few court hearings on this matter.it is hard to believe that counsel for google spent approximately four work weeks preparing the slapp motion.fn.omitted.the litigation may have been difficult from the court perspective given the newly developed area of law vis a vis the cda but from google perspective,google counsel is clearly on the cutting edge of such jurisprudence and the firm has handled some of the only cases interpreting the cda.accordingly,counsel was presumably up to speed on the subject as well as being well versed in slapp motion litigation.in a footnote,the court stated google makes much of the detailed factual record that had to be developed for the motion regarding how google works.while helpful,it simply did not merit the time expended.
in addressing the difficulty issue,the trial court announced it had trouble believing that these slapp experts reasonably needed to spend hours researching the relevant law and drafting the slapp motion.the court noted that c ounsel for google spends a large portion of its brief convincing the court that they are experts in this type of case.they have represented lycos in one of the only cases to interpret the cda.counsel has expertise in defamation law and has litigated slapp motions to date.
on the issue of the monetary value of the action,the trial court found i t is unclear how much money would have been involved in the litigation.the court notes that the main relief sought by maughan and brown maughan appeared to be injunctive relief,namely,to compel google to stop the alleged misrepresentation.google contends the trial court unreasonably discounted the amount of money involved in the litigation by characterizing the requested relief as primarily injunctive.we disagree.although the complaint sought monetary damages,including punitive damages and attorney fees,the lawsuit was essentially a putative class action,and at this early stage of the proceedings,it would be speculative to place any dollar amount on the alleged damages.
the trial court awarded fees and costs for both google slapp motion and the instant motion for fees and costs.we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in this regard for reasons we shall explain.initially,we note the omission from the trial court order of an allocation of the specific amount of fees and costs attributable to each motion is inconsequential.a statement of decision is not required regarding an award of attorney fees pursuant to a motion.see,maria riles cal d,see also melnyk robledo d.not incumbent upon the trial court to specify each and every item in defendant memorandum with which the court found fault.
we determine that google forfeited any claim on appeal to additional fees and costs in making the fees and costs motion by failing specifically to argue its claim.see,wint fidelity casualty cal d,it is counsel duty by argument and citation of authority to show in what respects rulings complained of are erroneous mansell board of administration th,d i t is established that an appellate brief should contain a legal argument with citation of authorities on the points made.if none is furnished on a particular point,the court may treat it as waived,and pass it without consideration.citation.this court is not inclined to act as counsel for appellant and furnish a legal argument as to how the trial court rulings constituted an abuse of discretion.citation.
additionally,a review of the record establishes that google request for fees and costs incurred in making the fees and costs motion was unsupported by the requisite evidence necessary for the court to exercise its discretion.
google sought an award of attorney fees and costs regarding its motion in the amount of,and in connection with its fees and costs motion in the amount of a total of.in its motion for an award of fees and costs,however,google specifically acknowledged the actual fees and costs relating to this motion are not yet known,but google estimates that fees will be in the amount of,including the preparation of a reply and appearance at a hearing.as support,google relied on paragraph of the march,declaration of timothy alger,an attorney for google.alger stated that he prepared the motion for attorney fees and costs and that p reparation of the motion required about hours of my time,and i anticipate that preparation of a reply will require about four hours of my time,and preparation for and attendance at a hearing on the motion will require another four hours of time.at my regular billing rate,google will incur fees for hours of time in the amount of.google presented nothing more,such as timesheets or other evidence setting forth the breakdown of time in relation to services provided by alger as to preparation of the fees and costs motion,preparation of a reply,or time spent at the hearing.
in view of the foregoing,we conclude google failed to carry its burden to establish the trial court abused its discretion,namely,that its decision was arbitrary,irrational,or beyond the bounds of reason.we therefore affirm the order granting google as attorney fees and costs under the statute.

google requests costs and attorney fees on appeal.this request is denied because there is no prevailing party on appeal.in any action subject to subdivision b,a prevailing defendant on an motion shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney fees and costs,subd.c.although we affirm the judgment against maughan and brown maughan,google did not prevail on appeal because we also affirm the judgment regarding the award of attorney fees and costs under the statute.accordingly,we conclude there is no prevailing party.
disposition 
the judgment is affirmed.each party shall bear own costs on appeal.
i agree with the majority conclusion that the challenge to the motion order is not cognizable on this appeal,but dissent from those parts of the opinion affirming the award of attorneys fees and refusing to award additional fees on appeal.because my view of the attorneys fee issue is based in large part on the complexity of this case and the concomitant exposure to google,the majority statement of facts is insufficient to make my i thus offer a bit more detail.
mark maughan and brown maughan the firm is included in my references to maughan filed this class action against google,seeking damages and injunctive relief for libel,products liability,and unfair business practices on the ground that a google search for mark maughan accountancy or a variation on that theme generates a list of websites suggesting he was disciplined by the california board of accountancy for gross negligence and accepting a contingent fee for the preparation of tax returns,which he says are veritable scarlet letters in the accounting world.maughan concedes he has been disciplined for other wrongful conduct,and that the allegedly libelous search results showed his name and,separated by ellipses,statements describing misconduct by other accountants in a listing of disciplinary actions created by the board of accountancy.
google responded with a special motion to strike code civ,and for attorneys fees over maughan opposition,the motion was granted,the trial court finding that google statements were made in a public forum about a matter of public interest computerxpress,jackson th,d damon ocean hills journalism club th,d,that this action was not brought solely for the benefit of the public interest,and that it was unlikely that maughan would ultimately prevail on any of his claims because they were barred by the immunity provision of the communications decency act of c batzel smith cir,carafano,cir,and because,as a matter of law,search engine results are not reasonably understood as conveying a defamatory meaning knievel espn cir,forsher bugliosi cal d,
google then filed a motion for attorneys fees in which it asked for fees of and costs in the amount of.maughan opposed the motion,contending his lawyers had spent significantly less time but produced an equally valuable product of work,approximating their lawyers time at hours,and suggesting without any evidentiary support that google claim was vastly over the top and patently unreasonable.the trial court bought maughan opposition hook,line and sinker,fixing google fees at based on hours at per hour,and its costs at only,a total of.
maughan did not appeal from the order granting google special motion to strike but did appeal from the judgment of dismissal,contending the motion should have been denied.google challenged the appeal as untimely and on the merits,to challenge the trial court reduction of its fees and costs,and requested fees on appeal.as noted at the outset,i agree with the majority conclusion that maughan challenge to the order is not cognizable on this appeal from the judgment,but it is my view that google fees and costs should not have been reduced at all,and that google is entitled to its fees and costs as the party prevailing on this appeal.i would reverse the award of attorneys fees and costs but otherwise affirm the judgment.
i agree with google that the trial court abused its discretion by reducing its fee award to less than of the amount requested or,for that matter,at all.
google motion for fees and costs established the following uncontroverted facts.
the case was factually and legally complex,and the magnitude of risk to google was substantial.google search engine operates on a computer algorithm that responds to query terms provided by google users.the search engine the computer performs all required tasks finding,ranking,and excerpting documents in a fraction of a second,making no judgment about the documents it finds on the web,all of which are created by others.no human edits the results before they are delivered to the google user.maughan sought an injunction that would have required google to employ humans to review and edit the computer work,a process that would have slowed the present system to a crawl and placed google at a profound competitive disadvantage.maughan also sought compensatory and punitive damages for himself and a class of thousands.
for these reasons,google retained experienced and qualified lawyers quinn emanuel urquhart oliver hedges,llp with expertise about both the substantive and procedural issues raised by maughan complaint.quinn emanuel billing rates are comparable to those charged by comparable california law firms as shown by google evidence,a survey published in the national law journal in december.in drafting the motion and the reply to maughan opposition,quinn emanuel had to address three major points the application of the statute to maughan claims the immunity granted by the communications decency act,and the law of defamation as applied to search engine results.
in support of its motion,google presented quinn emanuel invoices,redacted as necessary to protect google privilege,and explained that the invoices covered a demurrer and a motion to strike the class and representative allegations as well as the motion.google did not ask for fees for work performed on the other matters,only for the hours spent by two lawyers timothy alger,a partner who bills at the rate of per hour,and lesley williams,an associate who bills at the rate of an hour on the then discounted by percent the hours devoted to issues that overlapped the other motions.thus,although google was billed a total of,it sought only about percent of that sum,or.the same formula was applied to google costs,so that the total was discounted by percent to.google asked for an additional,an estimate of the fees and costs it incurred in making the motion for fees.
in his opposition to google motion for fees and costs,maughan claimed that,b y any reasonable attorney standards including the attorneys at girardi keese who spent significantly less time but produced an equally valuable product of work both the time spent and the amount calculated are unreasonable.maughan took issue with google arbitrarily applied percent but did not suggest an alternative approach,and offered nary a word about google costs.at the heart of the opposition is maughan comparison to the hours supposedly spent by his lawyers in comparison,maughan attorneys,who defense counsel states were also capable lawyers with an impressive track record for class action litigation,spent significantly less time and incurred significantly less costs and fees in preparing the same amount of work which was of equal caliber.while i agree that girardi keese are capable lawyers with an impressive track record in litigation i would limit it to class actions,i found no evidence supporting maughan opposition.
first,the declaration by john girardi states only this i estimate that the amount of time spent by firm associate joseph schwar and myself,on the thorough and complete representation of our client,was hours.although the opposition was clearly unsuccessful,the court was moved to comment that both google and maughan oppositions sic were well researched and well briefed.maughan achieved this end with a diligent use of resources.google claim for hours is vastly over the top and is patently unreasonable.emphasis added.no time records are attached,no explanation is given for girardi estimate,and maughan does say how much he spent on costs.
second,the opposition to the motion was not comparable to the motion itself.
the motion.of necessity,google motion explained the intricacies of its search engine operation and the damaging effect of the injunctive relief sought by maughan complaint discussed the law,the communications decency act immunity,and the law of defamation and in support of its immunity and defamation arguments explained in detail the difference between a search engine and an information content provider as relevant to these issues in a declaration,daniel dulitz a google software engineer detailed the service provided by google and explained how it works and how to interpret its search results,emphasizing that e very aspect of google search process,from the time a query is sent by a user web browser to the time the results are displayed on the user screen,is performed by computer hardware and software and is completely automated.no human at google ranks web pages,finds query terms,summarizes documents,or manipulates search timers.the query terms are selected by the user.the web pages in goggle database are created by the developers of those sites,stored without substantive alteration in google database,and made available to google users for searching via google search engine technology.a google query is usually processed in less than half a second 
google also established that its search engine results were authored by others,not google,and that google computers merely extract search terms through an automatic process,without human intervention.google terms of service notice to its users makes this clear the sites displayed as search results or linked to by google services are developed by people over whom google exercises no control a search using google services may produce search results and links to sites that some people find objectionable,inappropriate,or offensive.we can not guarantee that a google search will not locate unintended or objectionable content and assume no responsibility for the content of any site included in any search results or otherwise linked to by google services.in another declaration,timothy alger a quinn emanuel partner authenticated copies of printouts of web pages posted by the california board of accountancy certified by the board custodian of records to establish the discipline imposed on maughan and the postings on the board website.
the opposition to the motion.maughan opposition focused on the manner in which maughan came upon the allegedly defamatory google search results but offered nary a word about the nature of a search engine or any of the information put forth in goggle moving papers.on the law,maughan opposition discussed the general rules applicable to run of the mill motions,insisted that an injunction was necessary without any discussion of the effect it would have on google automated search engine,and relied on inapposite authorities to suggest that,contrary to all the evidence including his own,google is an internet content provider.the evidentiary support for maughan opposition consisted of his own declaration explaining the discipline imposed on him by the california board of accountancy and the manner in which he found the allegedly defamatory google search results.other printouts of google search results are authenticated by maughan lawyer schwar,and publication for the libel cause of action is established by a declaration from aaron greenwood to the effect that he was shocked when he saw the search result 
in its reply its motion for fees,google neatly summarized maughan position this way after launching a class action lawsuit that attacked the very manner in which google does business,and seeking a broad injunction and tort damages on behalf of unknown thousands of people,maughan faced with a mandatory fee say s never mind,and attempt s to belittle the litigation.this contention is especially disingenuous given that google fully informed maughan of its defenses and its intention to bring an motion.maughan knowingly assumed the risk that he would have to pay for google successful effort to dispose of this case.that maughan counsel now asserts that he spent minimal time on the lawsuit establishes only that the action was brought without reasonable inquiry into its factual and legal basis.it does not warrant a reduction in google fees.
as google pointed out,maughan did not dispute quinn emanuel billing rates,only the number of hours spent on the motion enhanced by a conclusory assertion that some of the work could have been done by a less experienced and less expensive associate.although he had copies of quinn emanuel invoices,maughan did not identify any item as unnecessary,and he did not suggest an alternative formula other than the accepted lodestar used by the number of hours by the hourly rates to arrive at a more reasonable fee.
the trial court acknowledged that google sought fees for only two lawyers alger at per hour and williams at per hour,and acknowledged that google had discounted the lawyers time and all costs by percent to the extent their work was relevant to the other pending motions,but rejected google request for for fees and for costs.instead,the court looked at google time sheets,described them as somewhat vague in their descriptions of what precisely defense counsel was doing for the claimed amount of time ignoring the fact that the invoices had been redacted to delete privileged information,found that hours seem ed excessive especially since google counsel acknowledge that they are old hats at slapp motions and experts in defamation and the communications decency act.such a motion should not have been such a monumental undertaking.
the court gave lip service to the factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee request the nature of the litigation and its difficulty the amount of money involved in the litigation the skill required and employed in handling the litigation the attention given to the case the attorney success,learning,age and experience in the particular type of work demanded the intricacy and importance of the litigation the labor and necessity for skilled legal training and ability in trying the case and the amount of time spent on the case niederer ferreira d.but in the end simply accepted maughan suggestion that he should have to pay for more than the time girardi keese estimated it spent,and that maughan should have to pay at the rates billed by google lawyers.the court gave google hours at per hour plus a fraction of its costs.
i agree with google that the trial court abused its discretion,and that there is no substantial evidence to support its order.press lucky stores,cal d,the starting point of every fee award must be a calculation of the attorney services in terms of the time he has expended on the case,and the exercise of the court discretion in awarding attorney fees must bear some reasonable relationship to the lodestar figure of time spent and hourly compensation flannery california highway patrol th,d the trial court exercise of discretion must be based upon a proper utilization of the lodestar method in re cortez cal d,judicial discretion implies the absence of arbitrary determinations,capricious dispositions,and whimsical thinking church of scientology wollersheim th,d,disapproved on another point in equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,fn,d,upholding a fee award under the statute because it was supported by substantial evidence and there was no evidence to the contrary tuchscher development enterprises,san diego unified port dist.th,d same braun chronicle publishing th,d same.

this was not a small case with minimal risk.to the contrary,the complaint raised significant free speech issues involving a search engine immunity for republication of content originally published by interactive computer services,plus additional issues about the nature of defamation in this context,and the relief sought went to the heart of google ability to provide instantaneous search results without human intervention.as the trial court conceded,the litigation was difficult from the court perspective given the newly developed area of law the communications decency act,and the probability of an appeal was apparent from the outset if not to the trial court,certainly to the parties so that a thorough defense and complete evidentiary record had to be presented by google.for these reasons,i believe the trial court analysis was flawed.
the nature of the litigation and its difficulty.the trial court said it was hard to believe that counsel for google spent approximately four work weeks preparing the slapp motion,and then discounted the detailed factual record that had to be developed for the motion regarding how google works,finding it helpful but concluding it simply did not merit the time expended.i disagree.daniel dulitz declaration certainly aided my understanding of the issues,and i know from my own experience how many lawyer hours it takes to translate an expert technical jargon into an explanation that can be absorbed by a judge.niederer ferreira,supra,d at.judges may rely on their own experience and knowledge,as lawyers and as judges,in determining the reasonable value of the attorney services.
in the same vein,the trial court conceded that this litigation may have been difficult from the court perspective,but then used quinn emanuel expertise as a reason for reducing its fee,finding that google counsel is clearly on the cutting edge of such jurisprudence and the firm has handled some of the only cases interpreting the communications decency act.accordingly,counsel was presumably up to speed on the subject as well as being well versed in slapp motion litigation.hence,the court must factor in some type of efficiency analysis.the trial court was mistaken.from the record,it appears that no court had previously been asked to decide whether the communications decency act of protects search engine providers,or whether internet search results can support a defamation are close cases,but none directly on point.the motion was not a project.of course,there is also the fact that maughan was represented by one of the preeminent plaintiff firms in town,capable lawyers with an impressive track record for class action litigation who had to know their presence would justifiably provoke a full court press.
the amount of money involved in the litigation.the trial court ignored the significance of this litigation to google,finding only that it was unclear how much money would have been involved in the litigation because the main relief sought by maughan appeared to be injunctive relief that would make google stop the alleged misrepresentation.the court was mistaken.maughan asked for both compensatory and punitive damages for himself and for a class consisting of all persons in california who must be licensed by the state of california in order to carry out the regular functions of their business or profession,and of whom a registry is maintained by the state of california or any of its agencies which is accessible to the public through google search engine software.medical doctors.dentists.podiatrists.phys
