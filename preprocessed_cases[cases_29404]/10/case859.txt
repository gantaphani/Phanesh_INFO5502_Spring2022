when a person is arrested in illinois,he or she is arraigned,and when possible,the court releases the detainee either on bail or on personal recognizance.see illinois bond statute,ilcs own recognizance bailable offenses.in people purcell,the illinois supreme court held unconstitutional the part of this statute that governs bail for capital defendants.id.at.this holding has no effect on the present case.in addition,illinois sheriffs are entitled to charge detainees an administrative fee for the privilege of posting a percent bond with the sheriff rather than,say,the county clerk.ilcs fee act.the fee is,unless the county justifies a higher fee through an acceptable cost study,id.at.
the present appeal is a sequel to an earlier one we heard,in which a putative class of former arrestees challenged those administrative fees on a variety of constitutional grounds.see payton county of kane,cir payton i.in our earlier decision,we held that the named plaintiffs had standing to sue the particular counties in which they had been detained that there was no standing bar to the proposed class actions against dupage and kane counties and that before the court could decide whether the suit could proceed against the other counties plaintiffs had named,it had to resolve the question of class certification.on remand,the district court first dismissed of the counts in the fourth amended complaint,which named as defendants illinois counties and relevant officials.it preserved only the claim that the fee act violates the equal protection clauses of the united states and illinois constitutions,for the reason that the bond fee is not the same throughout the state.next,the court found that a statewide class action was not warranted because of lack of typicality.see.a.without a statewide class,the court found,the named plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue the remaining claim against the other counties apart from dupage and kane and their officials.the court accordingly entered judgment under rule b permitting all of the case except the claims against dupage and kane counties to be appealed immediately.
plaintiffs urge strenuously that the district court dismissal of the counts flouted this court opinion in payton i,which they read as a definitive holding that they had stated a claim for purposes of rule b.they also argue that the court erred in denying the motion for class certification and in granting summary judgment for the county defendants and associated officials.in our view,however,plaintiffs have read too much into our earlier opinion.we conclude that the district court properly followed our mandate,that it correctly dismissed the counts at issue here,and that it did not abuse its discretion in denying class certification.we therefore affirm.
with respect to the plaintiffs challenge to the district court ruling on the motion to dismiss,our review is of course de novo.county of mchenry ins.of the west,cir.our review of the court decision to deny class certification is for abuse of discretion.mace van ru credit,cir.as the background facts in this case are uncontested,we proceed immediately to a consideration of the plaintiffs arguments on appeal.
we first take up the counts that were dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.because there is some duplication of theory among those counts,we have grouped them here into five different categories.
count i excessive bail 
the fourth amended complaint,which is the one that now governs the case,alleges in count i that the fee act violates both the eighth amendment prohibition on excessive bail and the rule of art.i,of the illinois constitution,which guarantees bail except in cases of serious offenses where a court determines that there is a risk to public safety.the district court rejected the eighth amendment argument on the ground that the fee here was a de minimis administrative charge that could not,as a matter of law,be deemed excessive.it found that it was immaterial that this fee is paid upon release from custody,rather than upon the return of the deposit following appearance at trial,as in schilb kuebel,d.the court also pointed out that illinois arrestees have alternatives to paying the fee.for example,they may pay the clerk rather than the sheriff,in which case the fee does not apply.illinois judges have the power to adjust bail to compensate for the fee,if this would make a meaningful difference.moreover,arrestees may seek bail reduction to free up funds to pay the fee.the district court did not address the state constitutional argument separately,nor has anyone done so in the briefs before this court.that argument is therefore waived.
as the district court recognized,the supreme court decision in schilb has some bearing on this case.there,the court upheld an earlier illinois bail law that permitted the court clerk,upon the conclusion of the trial,to retain as bail bond costs percent of the specified bail or percent of the amount actually deposited.schlib,who had posted to secure bonds of and on two charges,was acquitted at trial on one and convicted on the other.when his bond was returned,the clerk deducted for administrative costs.schlib sued,claiming that the statute permitting this fee violated both the due process and the equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment.the supreme court was unpersuaded.it held that the right to be free from a minor administrative cost like this was not fundamental and thus that rational basis review applied.from that,it was an easy step to uphold illinois decision to impose the fee,as well as its decision not to impose a fee in the distinguishable circumstances of release on personal recognizance and payment of the full amount of the bail.see at.the court noted that it did not have any question about the eighth amendment before it.id.at.
the eighth amendment issue came before the fifth circuit in the case of broussard parish of orleans,cir.for guidance,that court turned first to the supreme court decision in stack boyle.there,the court held that 
l ike the ancient practice of securing the oaths of responsible persons to stand as sureties for the accused,the modern practice of requiring a bail bond or the deposit of a sum of money subject to forfeiture serves as additional assurance of the presence of an accused.bail set at a figure higher than an amount reasonably calculated to fulfill this purpose is excessive under the eighth amendment.
id.at.the fifth circuit also looked to the supreme court later decision in united states salerno,d,which dealt with the constitutionality of federal bail reform legislation.in that opinion,the court underscored the fact that the amount charged for bail depends on what is at stake 
nothing in the text of the bail clause limits permissible government considerations solely to questions of flight.the only arguable substantive limitation of the bail clause is that the government proposed conditions of release or detention not be excessive in light of the perceived evil.of course,to determine whether the government response is excessive,we must compare that response against the interest the government seeks to protect by means of that response.
in broussard,the fifth circuit observed that the case before it concern ed neither the state attempt to deny bail nor an extremely high bail amount.rather,it concerns relatively modest fees imposed,over and above the amount of bail,on all arrestees who exercise bail.at.although the court conceded that the fees did not advance a compelling interest like public safety,it pointed out on the other hand that i t is also clear that the restriction does not implicate the kind of excessiveness of past decisions.id.the deprivation imposed by the fees,in short,was more theoretical than actual,in the absence of any evidence of an arrestee who was otherwise able to make bail but who could not because of the administrative fee.id.
we see the illinois system in much the same way.the arrestees claim that the administrative fees infringe on their federally protected right to bail,and they point to one statement in payton i where we said it is hard to see how they could have failed to state a claim under the notice pleading regime of rule.at.they distinguish schilb on the ground that the fee there was imposed after trial,while theirs is a condition of release.their comment on broussard is that the louisiana statute at issue there provided for remedies and procedures not available under the illinois statute.finally,they complain that the illinois fees are arbitrary,cause a delay in release,are discretionary from county to county,sometimes prevent people from leaving jail,are not returned if one is found innocent,and can not be waived.
the panel expressed interest in the last of these points,and in response to a question from the bench,the parties have filed supplemental memoranda on the question whether illinois law provides a means to waive the administrative fee.that research and our own reveals that at one time,the illinois code of criminal procedure explicitly permitted an incarcerated defendant who owed a fine or costs that he could not pay to file an affidavit to that effect and be released with a waiver of the amount due.see.repealed by,eff.it is unclear,and ultimately not important,whether that former statute would have applied to the fees present here.the county defendants argue that under existing law,there are at least two ways by which an indigent defendant may obtain a waiver of the fee.they rely primarily on illinois supreme court rule b,which permits an indigent person to request and obtain the right to sue or defend without payment of fees,costs,or charges.secondarily,they argue that illinois courts have inherent authority to waive costs for indigent defendants,citing people ex rel.conn randolph,dealing with inherent power to order reimbursement of costs advanced by attorneys for indigent litigants people wilson,d,requiring payment of certain litigation costs for indigent defendant as a matter of inherent power people rhode,d,awarding fees to pay for the services of an investigator to assist an indigent defendant.plaintiffs take issue with this,noting that rule appears in a section of the illinois supreme court rules dealing with civil proceedings,that none of the court rules directly pertaining to bail mention waivers of these fees,and that the inherent power cases are distinguishable.
interesting though this question of state law is,we conclude that we have no need to resolve it here.first,as the district court pointed out,illinois courts enjoy considerable discretion in setting the amount of bond to begin with.the indigent defendant will care about the sum of the amount that must be posted to obtain release and the amount of the administrative fee,not how much each component is.thus,we agree with the district court that even apart from rule and inherent power,the state courts are able to address the problem of the indigent defendant.second,we were told at oral argument that the practice of at least some counties was to release detainees who made bail and then to collect the administrative fee.to the extent that is the case,the fee is not part of the bail at all,and thus the eighth amendment is not implicated by the amount of the fee.we assume for the sake of argument,however,that at least some counties may insist that the fee be paid prior to the detainee release,and we consider the remainder of the plaintiffs arguments in that light.
plaintiffs attacks on the system in illinois fail for several reasons.first,there is no indication that judges set bail at the maximum point that would be,such that the addition of the modest administrative fee tips the balance and makes the bail constitutionally excessive.if,for example,bail of is reasonable,it would be absurd to say that bail of,or,is automatically excessive.second,illinois law permits detainees to file a motion for reduction of bail,ilcs,which could be used if the final number were indeed too high.as for the sentence in payton i that the plaintiffs have highlighted,the short answer is that context matters.we were talking about the individual claims against dupage and kane counties,which are still pending in the district court,and we did not specifically approve of the sufficiency of any particular count of the complaint.moreover,our holding was simply to reverse the district court decision dismissing those claims on the basis of standing.the court was free on remand to consider the sufficiency of the pleadings,once the standing barrier was out of the way.finally,we find the analysis in broussard persuasive,at least on the facial challenge we have here.we note that we do not have before us a particular claim in which someone alleges that a sheriff has refused to release an individual because he or she could not pay the fee.such an as applied case would have to be evaluated on its own facts.
counts ii,iii,and viii due process 
the district court dismissed these counts because it concluded that charging arrestees a fee in exchange for providing a service simply does not implicate the constitution.in addition,it recalled from its excessive bail analysis that the fee is de minimis,that arrestees usually have the alternative of paying their bond to the clerk without the fee assuming that the clerk office is qualification the plaintiffs believe is important,and that arrestees may petition to have their bail reduced.the plaintiffs do see a due process problem here they assert,in count ii,that the counties never established policies,procedures,waivers,hearings,or other process whereby the plaintiffs may secure their release without paying the bond fees,in violation of the federal and state constitutions.count iii makes essentially the same arguments with respect to the arrestees property interest in the bond fee paid to defendants to secure their release and focusing on the lack of procedures for obtaining a refund of the fee paid for those who ultimately are found innocent or otherwise are discharged.count viii adds the allegation that there is no policy or procedure for those who post bond or obtain release on personal recognizance,but do not have enough for the fees,to obtain release.
although some of the arguments plaintiffs are presenting were not before the supreme court in schilb,others were.in schilb,the court found that the administrative fee before it did not offend due process even though it was imposed on both those who were convicted and those who were acquitted.see at.that is enough to dispose of this part of the current plaintiffs claims.in broussard,the fifth circuit found that given that the private interests at stake are not great,that schilb specifically rejected a fundamental rights implication of such fees,and that arrestees have failed to demonstrate any actual deprivation,the louisiana fees do not trigger any heightened level of private interest.at.it found that the state procedures were adequate to protect whatever minimal interest existed,and that the state had a valid claim for administrative fees to defray its costs of running the system.taking all of this into account,it rejected the due process arguments.
the same things can be said of the illinois system before us.we add that nothing in payton i undermines this conclusion.it is important,in this connection,not to confuse standing analysis with analysis on the merits.we found in payton i that the named plaintiffs had standing to litigate whether a due process violation and all the other alleged violations had occurred,not that any particular part of the complaint was vulnerable to a dismissal on rule b grounds.on this appeal,it would have been prudent for the plaintiffs to have said more about mathews eldridge,d the case on which the fifth circuit had relied in broussard,and the case that establishes the general framework for due process analysis,in addition to their brief acknowledgment that it was cited in broussard.
eldridge held that 
identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors first,the private interest that will be affected by the official action second,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedu
