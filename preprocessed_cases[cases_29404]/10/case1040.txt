plaintiffs dean beaver,laurie beaver,steven adelman,abram aghachi,dinesh gauba,kevin kenna,and veronica kenna are the purchasers of condominium units in san diego hard rock hotel condominium project the hard rock project.plaintiffs brought this putative class action against defendants a group of developers and their agents or affiliates who allegedly participated in the sale of the condominium units.plaintiffs claimed,inter alia,that defendants business practices violated california unfair competition law ucl,cal.bus.et.
specifically,plaintiffs alleged that defendants failed to make certain disclosures in the course of the sale transactions,as required by the interstate land sales full disclosure act ilsa,et,which applies in this case by operation of the ucl prohibition against unlawful business practices.cal.bus.
defendants concede that they failed to comply with ilsa disclosure requirements.they instead raise a series of affirmative defenses,contending that ilsa statute of limitations,bars plaintiffs ucl claim ilsa does not apply because plaintiffs condominium units are not considered qualifying lots under ilsa,see b the condominium units are exempt under ilsa improved lot exemption,a and a amendment to ilsa,a,passed after the commencement of the current proceedings,operates to extinguish defendants liability in connection with the condominium sales.
the district court rejected each of these four arguments and granted partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs on the portion of their ucl claim that was premised on the existence of an unlawful business practice under ilsa.nonetheless,the district court certified these four issues for interlocutory appeal,pursuant to b.we granted defendants petition for interlocutory appeal,and we now affirm the district court partial summary judgment order with respect to the certified issues 
facts and prior proceedings 
a.the parties 
the hard rock project,located at fifth avenue in downtown san diego,is a development that includes the hard rock hotel and commercial condominium units.plaintiffs are a group of individual purchasers of condominium units in the hard rock project.defendant rock,llc rock was the developer of the condominium units and sold these units to plaintiffs.defendant mkp operated as the managing member of rock and signed the condominium purchase contracts on rock behalf.rock enlisted the assistance of defendant tarsadia hotels tarsadia in the development and subsequent management and operation of the properties.defendant greg casserly served as tarsadia president,and defendant tushar patel served as tarsadia chairman.
b.the purchase transactions 
plaintiffs purchased the condominium units from rock before construction of the hard rock project was completed.the condominium purchase contracts were signed in may by one set of plaintiffs,and in december by the remaining plaintiffs.these purchase contracts called for estimated completion dates between august and september,and a closing date of no later than december.in addition,the purchase contracts contained clauses specifying that except for delays caused by circumstances beyond seller reasonable control or the failure to complete due to a permitted excuse,seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the construction of the unit by the estimated completion date.
one of the permitted excuses to timely completion was contained in a contingency clause,which gave defendants the unilateral right to terminate the contract if less than of the condominium units were sold or under contract by the closing date.by december,more than of the condominium units at the hard rock project were under contract.
the purchase contracts also required that plaintiffs execute a unit maintenance and operation agreement uma as part of the sale transaction.the uma contained several restrictions on plaintiffs use of the units.the uma limited plaintiffs rights to occupy the condominium units to a maximum of days per year.moreover,the uma mandated that the properties could only be resold as condominium units,required that the properties be managed as part of the hard rock hotel,and granted the hard rock hotel a right of first refusal in the event that a plaintiff wished to sell his condominium unit.plaintiffs also agreed that the hotel would control the room furnishings and other routine housekeeping and maintenance services in the units.
post transaction events 
separately,in,plaintiffs entered into rental management agreements rmas that appointed tarsadia as property manager with the sole and exclusive authority to manage,operate,market and rent the condominium units.the terms of the rma gave tarsadia the right to enter the unit,without notice to owner,from time to time,and at any time,for any purpose set forth in this agreement.
construction of the condominium units was completed around october of.between october and december of,plaintiffs closed escrow on their respective condominium units.plaintiffs contend that they would have cancelled the purchase contracts prior to closing escrow had defendants complied with their disclosure obligations and made plaintiffs aware of their statutory rescission rights under ilsa.
procedural history 
on may,plaintiffs brought a putative class action in california state court against defendants,alleging violations of federal and state laws,including the ucl,in connection with the sale of the condominium units.defendants later removed the action to federal court in the southern district of california under the class action fairness act,d.
plaintiffs claims were predicated,in part,on allegations of unlawful conduct through defendants failure to comply with ilsa.the parties filed for partial summary judgment on those ucl claims arising from defendants failure to comply with ilsa disclosure requirements.the district court initially granted summary judgment to defendants on the basis that plaintiffs ucl claim was,but later reversed its holding after plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration.the district court ultimately issued a new order,allowing plaintiffs ucl claim to proceed and awarding partial summary judgment in plaintiffs favor.
in,while a motion for reconsideration from defendants was pending before the district court,congress passed an amendment to ilsa the amendment,codified at b.this amendment exempts condominium sales from the same ilsa disclosure requirements upon which plaintiffs had predicated their ucl claim.after additional briefing from the parties,the district court concluded that the amendment had no retrospective application in the present action.
nonetheless,the district court certified the issue,as well as other issues of law involved in its partial summary judgment order,for interlocutory appeal pursuant to b.we granted defendants petition for interlocutory appeal.

discussion 
i.the statute of limitations 
the ucl is a california consumer protection statute that broadly proscribes the use of any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.cal.bus.the ucl operates as a statute each of these three adjectives unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent captures a separate and distinct theory of liability.rubio capital one bank,cir quoting kearns ford motor,cir.plaintiffs alleged theories of liability under each of the three prongs,but only moved for partial summary judgment on the ucl unlawful prong.the ucl unlawful prong looks to other sources of substantive law,such as ilsa,to proscribe the kinds of unlawful business practices punishable under the statute.see prakashpalan engstrom,lipscomb and lack,d,cal.in doing so,the ucl borrows violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful practices that the unfair competition law makes independently actionable.cel tech commc ns,cellular,cal citations omitted.
state or federal law 
as a threshold matter,the parties dispute the appropriate limitations period to be applied to a ucl claim premised on a violation of federal law,specifically in this case ilsa.california courts have adopted two principles that inform our analysis.first,as a general matter,the ucl statute of limitations will apply to a ucl claim,even when that claim is based on an underlying law with its own separate statute of limitations.see cortez purolator air filtration prods,cal second,a ucl claim generally accrues when each of the elements of the cause of action is satisfied.see aryeh canon bus.solutions,cal.
in this case,the district court granted partial summary judgment on plaintiffs claim under the unlawful prong of the ucl.plaintiffs claim under this particular prong of the statute is predicated on defendants failure to comply with ilsa disclosure requirements,set forth in a a,a b,and d ilsa includes a statute of limitations,which accrues from the date the purchase contract is signed.were ilsa statute of limitations to apply to plaintiffs ucl claim,their claim would be because it was brought on may,approximately five years after the signing of the purchase contracts in may and december of.the ucl,however,includes a more generous statute of limitations.because plaintiffs have pled a claim under the ucl,this period applies.cal.bus.see cortez,at.
importantly,the ucl statute of limitations is governed by common law accrual rules.aryeh,at.common law rules provide that a cause of action ordinarily accrues when each of the elements of the cause of action wrongdoing,causation,and harm has been satisified.see id.at.therefore,under the ucl statute of limitations,the cause of action accrued when the harm was completed.plaintiffs allege that the harm became complete in the fall of when they were required to close escrow on their respective properties.because plaintiffs suffered cognizable financial harm upon the closing of escrow,we find this calculation of the accrual date to be sound.although the alleged wrongdoing,defendants failure to disclose,occurred at or around the date of contract signing,the financial harm which gives standing to plaintiffs under the ucl occurred at a later date.under the ucl,only the government or a person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result may bring a claim.cal.bus.plaintiffs ucl claim hinges on their lack of awareness of their recission right under c,a right which was not disclosed to plaintiffs prior to closing escrow on their units.
particularly in light of the remedial purposes of the ucl,we agree that plaintiffs claim accrued at the time of injury in fact and not upon the commission of a technical violation of the underlying ilsa disclosure provision.as the appropriate statute of limitations and the accrual date are part and parcel of the same procedural determination,our resolution of both issues is drawn from the same body of law here,state law.as the california supreme court recently confirmed in rose bank of america,a ucl claim based on violations of a federal statute is independently actionable under the ucl,which contains its own distinct and limited equitable remedies,cal.because the ucl statute of limitations and its accompanying accrual rules apply,the district court properly concluded that plaintiffs ucl claim is not.
federal preemption of the state statute of limitations 
the remaining question is whether the application of the ucl more generous statute of limitations period is preempted by federal law.the supremacy clause provides the constitutional foundation for federal authority to preempt state law.see const.art.vi,cl.federal law shall be the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.kurns friction prods.preemption of state law,by operation of the supremacy clause,can occur in one of several ways express,field,or conflict preemption.kurns.at.defendants have argued that the ucl statute of limitations presents a case of conflict preemption.conflict preemption occurs when a state law conflicts with federal law,such that the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.crosby foreign trade council,quoting hines davidowitz.
our preemption analysis is driven by the presumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.wyeth levine,quoting medtronic,lohr.this presumption carries the greatest force when federal legislation encroaches on an area traditionally occupied by the states,such as the field of property law.cts waldburger.the case for federal is particularly weak where congress has indicated its awareness of the operation of state law in a field of federal interest,and has nonetheless decided to stand by both concepts and to tolerate whatever tension there is between them.wyeth,at alteration in original quoting bonito boats thunder craft boats.accordingly,when the text of a clause is susceptible of more than one plausible reading,courts ordinarily accept the reading that disfavors.cts.at quoting altria group,good.
in making their conflict preemption argument,defendants portray ilsa statute of limitations,as a statute of repose,whose purpose was to shield developers and their agents from liability after a strict period of three years.unlike a statute of limitations,a statute of repose reflects a congressional judgment that a defendant should be free from liability after the legislatively determined period of time.see cts corp.at internal quotations omitted.
in support of this argument,defendants point to a distinction between the language of ilsa statute of limitations for disclosure violations,such as the violations alleged in this case,and ilsa separate statute of limitations governing claims alleging fraudulent activity.the text of the limitations statute for ilsa disclosure violations provides that n o action shall be maintained more than three years after the date of signing of the contract of sale or lease.a.the statute of limitations for an ilsa claim alleging fraudulent activity,in contrast,accrues at the time of discovery of such activity.a.this statutory distinction does not indicate that congress wished to turn ilsa limitations period into a statute of repose for disclosure violations.
rather,this distinction merely suggests that congress wished to provide a different accrual period to ilsa claims than to ilsa disclosure provisions.this choice is hardly unusual in light of the fact that fraud,by its very nature,begins unknown to the victim.see d fraud claims do not accrue until the discovery,by the aggrieved party,of the facts constituting the fraud.given that we read ilsa as having a limitations period for disclosure violations,and not a statute of repose,there is no statute of repose that would potentially preempt state consumer protection laws longer limitations periods.
nor does ilsa otherwise preempt plaintiffs ucl claim.crosby instructs us to consider issues of conflict preemption by examining the federal statute as a whole and identifying its purpose and intended effects.at.here,no congressional purpose to preempt the application of state consumer protection statutes can be divined from the text or history of ilsa.to the contrary,ilsa provides that its rights and remedies shall be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may exist at law or in equity.ilsa also contains a saving clause,stating that n othing in this chapter may be construed to prevent or limit the authority of any state or local government to enact and enforce with regard to the sale of land any law,ordinance,or code not in conflict with this chapter.e.moreover,ilsa offers a procedure where state disclosure laws that are substantially equivalent to ilsa disclosure provisions may be formally certified as such to facilitate compliance and enforcement.see.these parts of the statute all expressly allow for states to supplement ilsa provisions with their own requirements.see williamson mazda motors of,u,finding no conflict preemption in light of statutory saving clause that foresees the likelihood of a continued meaningful role for state tort law geier am.honda motor,declining to give broad effect to saving clauses where doing so would upset the careful regulatory scheme established by federal law.
finally,defendants rely on silvas e trade mortg,cir to argue that plaintiffs can not avoid the application of ilsa statute of limitations by invoking the ucl.silvas involved a case of field preemption,in which the court held that the home owners loan act hola,preempted the entire field of lending regulation to the exclusion of any state regulation.silvas,at.in footnote of the opinion,the silvas court commented on an issue that it explicitly stated it was not reaching.id.at.the footnote reads t o take advantage of the longer statute of limitations under the ucl is an attempt to enforce a state regulation in an area expressly preempted by federal law.id.at.this footnote,to the extent it is relevant at all in this case,appears to be limited to cases involving field preemption under hola 
we conclude that defendants fail to overcome the strong presumption against preemption,and that ilsa statute of limitations does not bar plaintiffs ucl claim.
ii.ilsa disclosure provisions 
once plaintiffs have surpassed the statute of limitations hurdle,they must show that ilsa disclosure provisions apply to the condominium units they purchased.collectively,these provisions mandate that sellers file a statement of record with the department of housing and urban development hud provide buyers with a property report include a cure provision in the purchase contracts and offer buyers a right to rescind the contracts when sellers fail to meet these statutory disclosure requirements.a a,a b,and d.
defendants do not dispute that they failed to satisfy ilsa disclosure requirements.rather,they maintain that ilsa is inapplicable,and thus no disclosures are required,because plaintiffs did not have exclusive use of the properties pursuant to b,and because the condominiums were exempted from ilsa requirements pursuant to the improved lot exemption,a.we address each of these arguments in turn.
exclusive use 
ilsa disclosure requirements apply to lots,a term not defined by the statute itself.see.the companion regulations to ilsa,promulgated by hud in,and later adopted by its successor agency,the consumer financial protection bureau,provide that a lot refers to any portion,piece,division,unit or undivided interest in land if the interest includes the right to the exclusive use of a specific portion of the land.b emphasis added see berlin renaissance rental partners,llc,cir.
for decades,a long line of cases has consistently held that condominiums may be considered lots under ilsa.see berlin,at winter hollingsworth,cir.indeed,the application of ilsa to condominiums has been consistent with hud policy since the issue was first raised in the year that ilsa took effect.berlin,at first alteration in original quoting land registration,formal procedures,advert.sales practices,posting of notices of suspension,to be codified at pts.
under chevron,we must defer to an administering agency reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute when that interpretation is the result of the agency formal rulemaking procedures.see chevron,nat.res.def.council.here,the agency regulation requiring exclusive use is a reasonable interpretation of the word lot,and it is entitled to chevron deference.indeed,the agency regulation gives effect to congress purpose in enacting ilsa to protect general interests in realty,which included condominiums.see winter,at.
in,hud issued additional guidance clarifying its earlier definition of exclusive use in the context of lots 
if the purchaser of an undivided interest or a membership has exclusive repeated use or possession of a specific designated lot even for a portion of the year,a lot,as defined by the regulations,exists.for purposes of definition,if the purchaser has been assigned a specific lot on a recurring basis for a defined period of time and could eject another person during the time he has the right to use that lot,then the purchaser has an exclusive use.
to be codified at pts.
because this interpretative guidance was not subject to a formal agency adjudication or rulemaking process,it is entitled to a lesser form of deference under skidmore,according to its power to persuade.see skidmore swift.under skidmore,the persuasiveness of the agency interpretation is determined in part by the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,and its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements.id.here,the agency detailed clarification of the term exclusive use conforms to the historic purposes of ilsa by extending its disclosure protections to certain real estate interests,provided that the owner possesses a right to use the unit on a recurring basis for a defined period of time during the year.moreover,the agency understanding of exclusive use,as demonstrated through the core right of a property owner to eject another person,is fully consistent with the statutory text.as a result,we find the agency gloss on the meaning of exclusive use to be persuasive under skidmore,and entitled to deference on review.
guided by these agency interpretations,we next examine whether plaintiffs had exclusive repeated use of their units.defendants contend that plaintiffs specific purchase contracts did not provide plaintiffs with exclusive use of the condominiums due to a series of use restrictions on the properties.they cite becherer merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,a sixth circuit case,in support of their claim.cir.in becherer,the court held that ilsa disclosure provisions did not apply when buyers purchased commercial condominium units as investment properties that were so laden with use restrictions that the owners could not be said to have had exclusive use of those properties.id.at.specifically,the becherer court relied on facts indicating that,when the units were purchased,they were already restricted for use as a hotel as a business investment,and thus were never available for use at the discretion of the unit owners.id.in particular,the owners in becherer were only given permission to occupy the units for fourteen days per year.id.moreover,their rights to eject tenants were assigned to the property manager through the purchase contracts and so never truly resided with the unit owners.id.
defendants attempt to analogize the facts of the present case to those in becherer.first,defendants point to contractual restrictions that limited plaintiffs rights to stay in the condominiums to a maximum of days per year.in addition,the condominiums could only be resold as condominium units,managed as part of the hard rock hotel,which possessed a right of first refusal in case of sale.these use restrictions were memorialized in the umas.under the terms of the umas,the hard rock hotel also controlled the room furnishings as well as routine maintenance and cleaning services in the units.
nonetheless,the provisions of the purchase contracts did entitle plaintiffs to the use of a specific lot on a recurring basis for a defined period of time.the use restrictions were of a more limited nature than in becherer and,importantly,did not directly interfere with plaintiffs ownership right to eject tenants during the designated period of use.
the hard rock hotel provision of routine maintenance,cleaning,and management services is not dispositive either.in this respect,plaintiffs position is akin to that of an apartment owner who retains exclusive use of the apartment,but contracts with a third party for the provision of room furnishings and maid service,or engages a third party to rent out the unit for a portion of the year.the exclusive use inquiry focuses on the basic right of the owner to eject another person during the time he has the right to use that lot.id.under the terms of the purchase agreements,plaintiffs retain the exclusive use of the units during that defined period of time.id 
finally,defendants point to plaintiffs separate agreements in an rma.the rma delegated to tarsadia the sole and exclusive authority to manage,operate,market and rent the units.the rma also gave tarsadia the right to enter the unit,without notice to owner,from time to time,and at any time,for any purpose set forth in this agreement.these use restrictions were relatively sweeping,permitting tarsadia to vary the frequency and length of the rental of the unit for any reason.
however,the rma was a voluntary agreement that plaintiffs executed in,subsequent to the closing of the condominium sales.as a result,its use restrictions are not determinative of whether plaintiffs had exclusive use under the relevant purchase contracts.becherer,in contrast,involved curtailed rights of ownership to which the buyers had agreed in the original sale contracts,rather than provisions that were voluntarily adopted at a later date.in the present case,plaintiffs could freely choose whether to execute the rma.because the rma was not executed until later,and because none of the use restrictions embedded in the original purchase contract interfered with the owner exclusive use of the property on a recurring basis for a defined period of time,we conclude that plaintiffs units are lots and therefore subject to ilsa disclosure requirements.
b.the improved lot exemption 
defendants argue that even if the condominiums are lots,the improved lot exemption applies.the improved lot exemption provides an exception to ilsa disclosure provisions in cases involving the sale or lease of any improved land on which there is a residential,commercial,condominium,or industrial building or the sale or lease of land under a contract obligating the seller or lessor to erect such a building thereon within a period of two years.a.as the relevant contracts involved the sale of properties under construction,we must determine whether the purchase contracts obligated the seller to complete construction of the condominiums within two years,such that the promise to build was not at the discretion of the seller,or otherwise illusory.see baroi platinum condo,llc,d.
defendants argue that this requirement was met because the purchase contracts provided estimated completion dates that occurred prior to december.the purchase contracts were signed in may and december of.the estimated completion dates for each of the relevant contracts therefore preceded the deadline set by the improved lot exemption.defendants further highlight specific language in the purchase contracts,providing that seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the construction by the estimated completion dates.
importantly,however,the purchase contracts contained a contingency clause that allowed the seller to terminate the contract without liability if less than of the condominium units to be constructed were sold,or under contract to be sold,by the closing date.this provision therefore allowed defendants to potentially rescind the agreements on the closing dates,which took place about one year after plaintiffs signed the purchase contracts.
according to agency regulations,contingency clauses are permissible under the improved lot exemption,so long as they are operative for days or less.see.specifically,hud guidelines clarify that t he presale period can not exceed days from the date the first purchaser signs a contract in the project.
the agency interpretation of the statute is reasonable,as it allows sellers a modest period in which to make a final business determination on whether to construct the property,rather than automatically subject all sellers to ilsa disclosure regime.under these circumstances,the agency reasonably determined that the use of a limited contingency clause would not render the seller commitment to construct illusory.because the regulations promulgated by hud are a reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous provision in a statute hud is charged with administering,we accord it chevron deference on review.see chevron,at.furthermore,the agency interpretive guidelines,setting the beginning of the period as the date of contract signing,are consistent with the timeframes adopted in the rest of the statute,a,and serve as persuasive guidance under skidmore.see skidmore,at.
here,the relevant contingency clause does not limit the cancellation period to days after the signing of the contract,as required by.defendants argue,however,that they never had reason to exercise the contingency clause after this period because the condominium units were nearly all under contract by december.nonetheless,we analyze the rights defendants possessed at the time of the signing of the contracts to determine whether the terms of the contract obligated construction of the properties within two years,pursuant to a.the purchase contract contained a contingency clause that could be invoked at the time of the closing if or more of the units remained unsold.therefore,by its terms,the contract failed to limit the contingency period to days or less,as provided by agency regulation.
accordingly,the improved lot exemption does not extinguish plaintiffs claims because the contingency clause is not limited to a period of days or less and the purchase contracts do not obligate the seller to complete construction within two years pursuant to a.
iii.the amendment 
in september of,during the pendency of the district court proceedings,congress passed an amendment to ilsa,exempting condominium sales from ilsa disclosure requirements,but allowing condominiums to remain subject to ilsa fraud provisions.see,stat.the amendment,codified at b,did not purport to amend the definition of a lot,as that word is used throughout the statute.instead,it created a statutory by including the sale or lease of any improved land on which there is a condominium or the sale or lease of land under a contract obligating the construction of such a building thereon within a period of two years among a list of exemptions to ilsa disclosure provisions.a.
ilsa was designed to regulate unfair practices in the sale of unimproved parcels of land.see winter.it offers procedural safeguards,including disclosures,to protect buyers against unscrupulous developers and their agents.the term lot,as it is used in the statute,has come to include condominiums.see id.at.as discussed earlier,supra section,this reading is the product of a longstanding interpretation of ilsa adopted for decades by the governing agencies and by the courts.see.we regard this agency interpretation of the word lot as a reasonable one and subject to chevron deference on review.
the eleventh circuit reached the same result in winter,finding the agency definition of the word lot to be the only defensible interpretation given subsequent events.winter,at.the court went on to state that 
it is reasonable to conclude,as hud did,that the term lot was used to refer generally to interests in realty.the legislative history supports this construction,employing the terms lot,land,and real estate in discussing the act.this construction is also reasonable in terms of the purpose of the statute.a fraudulent sale of land is not rendered any less fraudulent if the condominium form of ownership is utilized.
moreover,a second clue that ilsa protections extended to condominiums is the specific mention of condominiums in the improved lot exemption,b,which was added in.see id.at.as the winter court reasoned,the fact that congress specifically listed condominiums as among those types of improved lots that may be exempt from ilsa disclosure requirements strongly implies that congress had envisioned condominiums to be within the original scope of the statute.id.at.otherwise,the use of such language in the exemption would be superfluous.see lamie.
cumulatively,therefore,the text and interpretive history of the statute lead to the conclusion that the agency interpretation of lot is reasonable and entitled to deference under chevron.see berlin,at.
a.a substantive change rather than a clarification of the law 
despite this legislative history,defendants claim that the amendment,exempting condominiums from ilsa disclosure provisions,should apply to the present action,w
