background 
the doe plaintiffs are a class of over doj attorneys who seek pay for overtime work and holiday work performed between and.doe united states,doe v.the parties do not dispute that the doe plaintiffs worked overtime and on holidays during this period.id.at.further,there is evidence supporting the doe plaintiffs assertion that doj expected and induced the doe plaintiffs to work overtime and to work on holidays.however,the doe plaintiffs did not receive any written order or approval from doj before performing this work.id.at.even though they did not receive written order or approval,the doe plaintiffs allege that they are entitled to overtime,auo,and holiday pay under fepa because they were expected and induced to work beyond the regularly scheduled work week.
fepa includes specific provisions governing each of the doe plaintiffs three claims.
section a contains the general eligibility requirements for overtime pay under fepa.section a provides in relevant part 
for,and intermittent tours of duty,hours of work officially ordered or approved in excess of hours in an administrative workweek,or in excess of hours in a day,performed by an employee are overtime work and shall be paid for,except as otherwise provided by this subchapter.

pursuant to c,the head of an agency may provide auo pay instead of other forms of premium pay such as overtime pay under section a.section c provides in relevant part 
the head of an agency,with the approval of the office of personnel management,may provide that 
an employee in a position in which the hours of duty can not be controlled administratively,and which requires substantial amounts of irregular,unscheduled overtime duty with the employee generally being responsible for recognizing,without supervision,circumstances which require the employee to remain on duty,shall receive premium pay for this duty on an annual basis instead of premium pay provided by other provisions of this subchapter,except for regularly scheduled overtime,night,and sunday duty,and for holiday duty 
emphases added.the office of personnel management opm has promulgated regulations governing auo payment policy at.sections and set forth rates for premium pay for auo and other payment provisions specific to auo.sections establish criteria for determining which positions meet the statutory requirements for auo pay.
under the regulations,opm requires that agencies determine prospectively which positions meet the criteria for auo pay set forth in sections.specifically,the applicable regulation states 
the head of each agency,or an official who has been delegated authority to act for the head of an agency in the matter concerned,is responsible for d etermining in accordance with section c of title,united states code,and this subpart,which employees shall receive premium pay on an annual basis under or.these determinations may not be retroactive.

b an employee who performs work on a holiday is entitled to pay at the rate of his basic pay,plus premium pay at a rate equal to the rate of his basic pay,for that holiday work which is not 
in excess of hours or 
overtime work as defined by section a of this title.
the regulations governing authorization for holiday pay provide as follows 
a except as otherwise provided in this subpart,an employee who performs holiday work is entitled to pay at his or her rate of basic pay plus premium pay at a rate equal to his or her rate of basic pay for that holiday work that is not in excess of hours.
b an employee is entitled to pay for overtime work on a holiday at the same rate as for overtime work on other days.
c an employee who is assigned to duty on a holiday is entitled to pay for at least hours of holiday work.

on march,in doe united states,doe i,the court of federal claims granted the government motion to dismiss the doe plaintiffs claims for auo pay for lack of jurisdiction under the tucker act in doe i,the court of federal claims began by examining the language of section c,which governs auo pay,and found that the language of the statute was not in and of itself mandatory.id.at.the court found that t he discretion to determine whether an employee will be provided premium pay under this section rests with the head of the agency,with the approval of the office of personnel management.id.turning to the agency policies,the court noted that doj order a concerned premium pay for auo and that attorney was not listed as a covered position in appendix to the order.id.based on the foregoing,the court held that there was no requirement that the agency pay compensation to attorneys and dismissed the doe plaintiffs claim for auo pay.id.at.the court decision dismissing the doe plaintiffs claims for auo pay in doe i has not been appealed previously.
the doe plaintiffs claims for overtime pay under section and holiday pay under section b have already been the subject of several decisions in the court of federal claims and one appeal.on september,the court of federal claims denied the government motion to dismiss the doe plaintiffs claims for overtime pay under section a and holiday pay under section b.doe united states,doe ii.the court then granted the doe plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability and denied the government.doe united states,doe iii.the court held that doj ordered and approved overtime within the meaning of section by expecting and inducing attorneys to work more than forty hours a week.id.at.doe iii makes no mention of holiday pay under section b.however,the motion granted was for summary partial summary judgment.
we granted the government petition for interlocutory appeal,doe united states,doe iv,and reversed the court of federal claims grant of summary judgment in doe iii,doe v,at.the focus of our decision in doe v was the doe plaintiffs claim for overtime pay under section a.in doe v,we examined a long line of cases interpreting the written order requirement for overtime pay under section a.doe v,at.we noted that anderson united states.anderson i,was the first of a line of cases in which the court of claims awarded overtime pay under fepa to employees who had been induced to work overtime without any written order or authorization.doe v,at.we found that the anderson line of cases also suggested that equitable considerations prevented the government from denying overtime compensation where it induced overtime work.id.we then determined that schweiker hansen,d,and office of personnel management richmond,d,effectively overruled anderson i and its progeny.doe v,at.we held that the anderson line of cases is no longer good law and that the written order requirement is not invalid on the ground that it imposes a procedural requirement that limits the right to overtime compensation under the statute or because it is inequitable.id.at.we then held that the written order requirement set forth at c was more than a mere administrative instruction,id.at,and that the regulation was entitled to deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d.doe v,at.after upholding the validity of the regulation,we examined whether the writing requirement had been met by doj actions.id.at.on this point,we found that many of the doe plaintiffs arguments merely repeated their contentions that the written order requirement was invalid or merely an administrative instruction.id.at.we found that the documents that the doe plaintiffs asserted gave them written authorization to work overtime,such as the united states attorney manual,did not actually authorize overtime work.id.at.we also rejected the doe plaintiffs argument that the keeping of two sets of time records,one for pay purposes and one for determining actual hours worked,was evidence of written authorization and approval.id.at.we found instead that these records merely showed that the agency had awareness that attorneys worked extra that they had been authorized to receive overtime pay for working extra hours.id.at.based on the foregoing,we not only reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the doe plaintiffs,but also held that summary judgment should have been granted in favor of the government because the doe plaintiffs overtime was not ordered or approved as required by section a.id.at.although we granted summary judgment on liability,we made no mention in doe v of holiday pay under section b.
pursuant to our direction in doe v,the court of federal claims directed an entry of summary judgment in favor of the government.doe summary judgment order,slip op.at.the doe plaintiffs then filed a motion for reconsideration before the court of federal claims in which they argued that all three of their auo pay,overtime pay,and holiday our decision in doe v.the court of federal claims rejected the argument,holding that the doctrine of the law of the case barred reconsideration of the overtime pay claim and that the holiday pay claim was barred by implication.doe united states,doe vi.thus,the court of federal claims denied the doe plaintiffs motion for reconsideration.id.
the doe plaintiffs now appeal the dismissal of the auo pay claim in doe i and the grant of summary judgment in favor of the government on the overtime and holiday pay claims in the doe summary judgment order.we have jurisdiction over the doe plaintiffs appeal pursuant to a.
discussion 
we review de novo the court of federal claims grant of summary judgment in favor of the government.info.networks united states.we also review de novo the court of federal claims dismissal of a claim for lack of jurisdiction.samish indian nation united states,doe united states.
we begin with the doe plaintiffs claims for overtime pay under section.the doe plaintiffs argue that the court of federal claims erred in dismissing their claims for overtime pay under section because they had an alternative theory of liability that was not addressed in our decision in doe v.they characterize their alternative theory as an as applied challenge to c requirement of written approval for overtime pay.instead of arguing that c is invalid,the doe plaintiffs argue that doj effectively eliminated their ability to acquire a written order or approval for working overtime from a higher level official,as required by the regulation.therefore,they argue,their overtime should be considered authorized and approved.this argument was not foreclosed by doe v,the doe plaintiffs urge,because it was not raised in the certified order for the interlocutory appeal that led to that decision.they argue that doe v only overruled the anderson i line of cases to the extent that the cases held the writing requirement invalid.in contrast,the doe plaintiffs argue that the doe v court said nothing about whether an agency could avoid its obligations under fepa by refusing to implement a reasonable or rational system for obtaining the very writings the court held were required.appellants br.at.thus,the doe plaintiffs contend that cases supporting their as applied challenge,such as adams united states,bilello united states,and anderson united states.anderson ii,remain good law.
the doe plaintiffs also argue that they should be allowed to modify their claims for overtime pay under section because doe v changed the controlling legal standard.the doe plaintiffs argue that the fact that hansen,and richmond,the supreme court cases that overruled anderson i,predate their complaint makes no difference because anderson i was continually relied upon until doe 
the government counters that doe v forecloses any consideration of the alternative arguments presented by the doe plaintiffs.it recites our holding in doe v that no compensation could be awarded for work that was not ordered and approved in strict compliance with section c.at the same time,it argues that the doe plaintiffs are merely repeating the same argument they raised in doe v that the governing opm regulation should be disregarded in light of the government asserted misconduct.in support of this contention,the government recites passages in the doe plaintiffs briefs in the doe v appeal that are nearly identical to passages in the present briefs.contrary to the doe plaintiffs arguments,the government argues,doe v rejected both the anderson notion that a writing requirement was invalid and that equitable considerations,such as the failure to implement a workable system for authorizing overtime,could entitle workers to overtime even without written authorization.appellee br.at citing doe v,at.
the government contends that the doe plaintiffs request that they be allowed to amend their previous arguments to accommodate a new legal standard should not be entertained.the government argues that the doe plaintiffs made the same arguments in their petition for a rehearing in doe v and that because rehearing was not granted in that case,they should not be able to get a rehearing now.further,the government asserts that the denial of the petition for rehearing was correct because doe v did not create a new legal standard.rather,doe v required compliance with c,which has been in effect since.the government argues that the doe v panel considered evidence purportedly showing compliance with section c writing requirement at the doe plaintiffs request.the government contends that the doe v panel rejected the doe plaintiffs argument,foreclosing further consideration of the issue.
we agree with the government that doe v previously determined that the doe plaintiffs do not have a viable claim for overtime pay under section and therefore forecloses the doe plaintiffs current argument that doj system for acquiring written authorization pursuant to section c is unreasonable.this as applied argument is foreclosed by our finding in doe v that anderson i,was overruled by the supreme court decisions in hansen,and richmond.doe v,at.in anderson i,the employer induced employees to work overtime and then refused payment because of a written approval requirement.at.the anderson i court struck down the writing requirement.id.in doe v,we held that anderson i had been overruled to the extent that it held that the opm regulation was invalid because it added a procedural writing requirement to the substantive requirements of fepa or because the result was inequitable.doe v,at emphasis added.in essence,we upheld the writing requirement as valid and stated that any attack to the reasonableness of the writing requirement must fail.the doe plaintiffs argument in this appeal is nothing but an attack on the reasonableness of the writing requirement because the doe plaintiffs merely repeat the arguments that we rejected in doe v.in doe v,they argued that it was inequitable to encourage overtime that was foreclosed by a writing requirement.now they argue that it is inequitable to encourage overtime that was foreclosed by a writing requirement that was practically impossible to meet.the latter is merely an extension of the former,which we have already rejected.see id.
the doe plaintiffs reliance on adams,bilello,and anderson ii,is also misplaced.in doe v,we classified adams as one of the anderson i,line of cases,which was overruled by hansen and richmond.doe v,at.we cited bilello in doe v for the proposition that overtime that was approved only by a supervisor who lacked authority to approve the overtime was not compensable.id.at.thus,our citation to bilello in doe v was not an endorsement of attacks on the reasonableness of agency implementation of a regulation like the one the doe plaintiffs presently challenge.in the anderson ii decision,the court of claims interpreted regularly scheduled broadly to include overtime induced by unauthorized persons because the court was reluctant to impute to the va an intent to frustrate the apparent will of congress that overtime work shall be paid for.at.the doe plaintiffs quote this portion of anderson ii for the proposition that when an agency fails to create a reasonable system for authorizing overtime,courts award overtime pay.in actuality,the anderson ii court stated that when construing the overtime statute regularly scheduled language,it was appropriate to keep in mind the intent of congress to pay for overtime.id.any statutory or regulatory construction argument is foreclosed in the present case,however,by doe v.in doe v we established that opm regulation at c,which requires written approval for overtime pay,is a reasonable interpretation of ordered or approved in,and therefore entitled to chevron deference.doe v,at.the doe plaintiffs are asking us to reevaluate that assessment and therefore their arguments must fail.
finally,doe v does not set forth a new legal standard that might allow the doe plaintiffs to make new arguments before the trial court under that standard.hansen and richmond,which were our bases for finding that anderson i had been overruled,were decided in and,respectively.thus,the doe plaintiffs knew about hansen and richmond before doe v was decided and had their opportunity to mount arguments under the principles of those cases.
turning to the doe plaintiffs claim for auo pay,the doe plaintiffs argue that the court of federal claims erred in doe i when it dismissed their claim for auo pay pursuant to section c for lack of jurisdiction.they acknowledge that the statute governing auo pay contains the discretionary word may.despite this discretionary language,the doe plaintiffs argue that section c is for two reasons.first,they argue that the word may in section c gives the agency the discretion to establish how it will pay overtime,but not whether auo pay will be paid.thus,an agency has the choice to elect to pay either overtime pay under section a or auo pay under c.although the agency can choose between overtime pay and auo pay,according to the doe plaintiffs,the agency must pay for hours worked.the doe plaintiffs second argument as to why section c is is that once doj makes an election to compensate auo,any employee meeting the statutory requirements must be paid.
with regard to the merits of their claim for auo pay,the doe plaintiffs argue that the language of paragraph of doj order a makes auo pay required for all employees whose work requires substantial amounts of irregular or occasional overtime,including attorneys.based on hannon united states,the doe plaintiffs argue that because doj had a policy to provide auo pay,the plaintiffs are entitled to auo pay so long as they qualify under the statute and regulation.they also argue that the list of covered positions in appendix to doj order is and that therefore attorneys are covered despite not being listed.in response to a question on this point at oral argument,the doe plaintiffs filed supplemental briefing.in that briefing,they argue that the appendix list is because,in a memorandum,the assistant attorney general for administration aaga authorized the immigration and naturalization service ins commissioner to extend auo pay coverage from the positions in the list to include immigration officers,as defined in because more positions receive auo pay than those listed in appendix,the doe plaintiffs argue,the list is.
the government responds to the doe plaintiffs jurisdictional arguments by noting that the jurisdictional and merits inquiry converge in this case.even if the court below erred by dismissing on jurisdiction,they argue that dismissal on the merits was required without further hearing.
the government counters the doe plaintiffs arguments on the merits of the auo pay claim by contending that section c gives the head of an agency the discretion to decide if any employee is entitled to auo pay.the government recounts the legislative history of section c and the applicable regulations,which expressly state that auo pay determinations may not be made retroactively.see b.if auo pay can not be awarded retroactively,the government argues,then the agency must use its discretion to prospectively determine which employees will be awarded auo pay.the government argues that doj did not exercise its discretion to give attorneys auo pay.the government turns to appendix to doj order a,which the government notes did not list attorneys as a group authorized to receive auo pay.this list,the government argues,is exclusive because the order sets forth procedures for adding positions to the list.it notes that these procedures were followed when the ins positions mentioned in the aaga memorandum were added to the list.further,the government points out that the aaga memorandum authorized auo pay for immigration officers,as defined in,but specifically exempted general attorneys from coverage.the government also argues that th
