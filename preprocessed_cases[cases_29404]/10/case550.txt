the putative class period for this case spans from may,to january.during that period,munimae was one of the nation largest syndicators of housing tax credits lihtcs.federal tax law provides lihtcs to developers of rental housing.because most developers can not take advantage of these credits,financial services companies,like munimae,organize lihtc investment partnerships lihtc funds to pool and sell the credits to investors.
munimae usually acted as the general partner of its lihtc funds during the class period,and it received syndication and asset management fees for organizing and maintaining them.although its ownership share was generally low,ranging from to,it was typically larger than that of any single investor.prior to,munimae primarily treated these lihtc funds as off balance sheet entities.
in,the financial accounting standards board adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation fin,which addressed the financial reporting requirements of businesses with respect to off balance sheet activity fin defined a new category of entities called variable interest entities vies.under fin,a company must consolidate onto its financial statements the assets and liabilities of a vie if the company is its primary beneficiary,that is,if the company absorbs the majority of the risks and rewards associated with the vie.before the adoption of this revised standard,a company was generally only required to consolidate financial statements if it had a majority voting interest in the entity.
the first quarter of was the first period for which munimae reported compliance with fin.the company then concluded that fin required it to consolidate some but not all of its lihtc funds,which added a net billion in assets and liabilities to the company financial statements.the remaining unconsolidated lihtc funds had net assets of approximately million and liabilities of approximately million.
through mid,munimae continued to represent its compliance with fin in financial reports filed with the sec.pricewaterhousecoopers llp pwc,munimae independent public accountant,certified that those reports had been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap for fiscal years and.between and,the company also made a number of acquisitions and conducted several offerings,including an spo in february.at the end of,melanie lundquist replaced william harrison as the company cfo.
on march,munimae announced that it was restating its financial statements for the period ending on september,as well as fiscal years through.the restatement corrected certain financial reporting errors that were unrelated to fin.munimae issued the restated financial statements in june.
in august,the company disclosed that it had identified material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting,and that,as a result,it would be unable to file timely its second quarter form.a few months later,on september,munimae announced that it was again restating its financial statements for fiscal years through,and for the first quarter of.the company initially informed investors that the second restatement would address three areas accounting for equity commitments related to affordable housing projects the classification of cash flow from tax credit equity funds and accounting for syndication fees.about a month later,however,munimae disclosed that it had not yet reached a conclusion regarding the extent of the second restatement.
on october,munimae announced that it was replacing pwc as the company independent public accountant.the company stated and pwc agreed that for fiscal years and,and through october,there were no disagreements with pwc on any matter of accounting principles or practices,financial statement disclosure or audit scope or procedure which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of pwc would have caused them to make reference thereto in their reports on munimae financial statements.
three months later,the company reported its consecutive increase in its quarterly dividend.in the same announcement,the company revealed that the second restatement would address accounting errors with respect to fin,and that the company would be required to consolidate substantially all of the low income housing tax credit equity funds it has interests in.
on may,munimae disclosed that it would not be able to timely file its k for a s a result of the dedication of significant management resources to restatement efforts.the company noted that since september,it had identified additional material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting,including with respect to its accounting of lihtc funds.
on july,munimae announced that it had hired navigant consulting to assist its internal auditors in the restatement.a month later,it disclosed more details about the scope of the effort,noting that there are approximately people currently working on the restatement,including company employees and consultants.around the same time,lundquist resigned and charles pinckney replaced her as cfo.
munimae held a teleconference on november,to further update investors.the company stated that management planned to ask the board to continue the company longstanding policy of increasing the dividend distribution every quarter,although it warned that it is possible that the dividend payout ratio for the full fiscal year may exceed of the company net cash from operations due to the costs being incurred by the company from the restatement.the company officers declined at that point to estimate the cost of the second restatement,though they acknowledged the costs were substantial.
on january,munimae announced that it was cutting its quarterly dividend by,from to per share.the company attributed the cut to the cost of the company ongoing restatement of its financial statements,the decision to conserve capital given the current volatility in the credit and capital markets,and the desire to dedicate additional capital to the renewable energy finance business.at the same time,the company stated that it did not believe the results of the restatement w ould materially change the previously recorded cash balances of the company and its subsidiaries.id.because the restatement efforts were still ongoing,the company also announced that it anticipated being delisted from the new york stock exchange because it could not meet a nyse deadline for filing its form k.the price of munimae shares dropped,from per share on january,to per share on january,on unusually heavy trading volume.
munimae provided further details to investors regarding the second restatement during a january conference call.with respect to fin,the company disclosed that it had to consolidate lihtc funds,which required it to review separate financial statements.because the company had no automated process in place to review the accounting,this work had to be done manually.acknowledging that these developments were a result of the company mistakes in the first instance,ceo michael falcone expressed his disappointment and embarrassment over the the amount of time and energy and effort it taking us to fix them.the price of munimae shares dropped an additional,to per share,on january,again on unusually heavy trading volume.on april,munimae disclosed that it spent million to complete the second restatement.
shareholders filed multiple lawsuits against munimae,certain of its officers and directors,and the lead underwriters in the spo,alleging violations of federal securities laws.the actions were consolidated in the district of maryland for pretrial proceedings.see in re mun.mortg.equity,llc,sec.derivative,d.plaintiffs filed the operative consolidated amended class action complaint on december.
applying the heightened pleading standards of the private securities litigation reform act pslra,the district court held that plaintiffs exchange act claims failed because the amended complaint did not adequately plead scienter.see in re mun.mortg.equity,llc,sec.derivative,d.the court also dismissed plaintiffs securities act claims with respect to the spo.it found the claim by the statute of repose in of the securities act.see id.at.it also concluded that charles dammeyer,the only named plaintiff asserting securities act claims with respect to the spo,lacked standing to bring a a claim,see id.at,and that the amended complaint failed to adequately plead that the underwriter defendants were immediate sellers,see id.at.
this appeal followed.
we first consider the district court dismissal of plaintiffs claims under b of the securities exchange act of and sec rule for failing to adequately plead scienter.
the purpose of the exchange act and its accompanying regulations is to ensure that companies disclose the information necessary for investors to make informed investment decisions.see taylor first union of,cir.section b of the act prohibits the use of any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the sale of a security in violation of sec rules.see b.rule implements b by making it unlawful,in connection with the sale of a security 
a to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,
b to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading,or 
c to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person.
b.the supreme court has recognized that b provides an implied right of action for purchasers or sellers of securities who have been injured by violations of the statute.see stoneridge inv.partners scientific atlanta,u.
in a typical b action,a private plaintiff must prove six elements a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant scienter a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission economic loss and loss causation.id.
to establish scienter,a plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted with a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.tellabs,at internal quotation marks omitted.at the pleading stage,alleging either intentional or severely reckless conduct is sufficient.see matrix capital,at.in the b context,a reckless act is one that is so highly unreasonable and such an extreme departure from the standard of ordinary care as to present a danger of misleading the plaintiff to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the pslra imposes a heightened pleading standard on fraud allegations in private securities complaints.see teachers ret.of hunter,cir.the complaint must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind with respect to each act that allegedly violated the statute.b.t o the extent a plaintiff alleges corporate fraud,the plaintiff must allege facts that support a strong inference of scienter with respect to at least one authorized agent of the corporation.matrix capital,at internal quotation marks omitted.to allege fraud against an individual defendant,the plaintiff must allege facts supporting a strong inference of scienter as to that person.see id.
evaluating the strength of an inference is necessarily a comparative inquiry.see tellabs,at.a n inference of scienter can only be strong when it is weighed against the opposing inferences that may be drawn from the facts in their entirety.cozzarelli inspire pharm,cir.a court must compare the malicious and innocent inferences cognizable from the facts pled in the complaint,and only allow the complaint to survive a motion to dismiss if the malicious inference is at least as compelling as any opposing innocent inference.zucco partners,llc digimarc,cir.
as applied here,the question is whether the allegations in the complaint,viewed in their totality and in light of all the evidence in the record,allow us to draw a strong inference,at least as compelling as any opposing inference,that the munimae defendants either knowingly or recklessly defrauded investors by issuing false financial statements as to the company compliance with fin,and concealing the cost of correctly consolidating lihtc funds in accordance with that standard.see pub.emps.ret.ass of deloitte touche llp,cir.if we find the inference that defendants acted innocently,or even negligently,more compelling than the inference that they acted with the requisite scienter,we must affirm.id.
we begin by considering whether the facts alleged in the amended complaint give rise to an inference of scienter and,if so,the strength of that inference.although we ultimately evaluate plaintiffs allegations of scienter holistically,we only afford their allegations the inferential weight warranted by context and common sense.matrix capital,at.plaintiffs rely on four categories of allegations as to scienter,to which we now turn.
confidential witness statements 
the amended complaint incorporates information obtained from three confidential witness cw statements.when the complaint chooses to rely on facts provided by confidential sources,it must describe the sources with sufficient particularity to support the probability that a person in the position occupied by the source would possess the information alleged or in the alternative provide some other evidence to support their allegations.teachers,at internal quotation marks omitted.o missions and ambiguities count against an inference of scienter because a complaint factual allegations must be stated with particularity.tellabs,at see also institutional investors grp.avaya,cir noting that courts should steeply discount allegations from confidential sources that lack sufficient indicia of reliability.we present the allegations of each of the confidential witnesses before assessing the strength of the scienter inferences they support.
confidential witness 
served as a staff accountant and later a project manager in munimae internal accounting department.attended accounting meetings with several of the individual defendants.according to,munimae executives considered restating the company financial statements for months prior to the announcement of the first restatement,in march.also asserts that,at some point prior to the first restatement,a pwc partner advised munimae to consolidate the remaining lihtc funds,but certain munimae executives disagreed with that recommendation.specifically,bosses argued with pwc about how to classify the tax credit equity funds and how to determine the percentage of ownership munimae held on each one.
also states that the company was always in a state of some confusion and chaos as a result of munimae rapid expansion.as describes,the company accounting and legal staff was bombarded with documentation as the company expanded but lacked sufficient personnel to handle the paper flow.j.according to,the staff was unprepared professionally for the complex nature of the accounting needed,particularly compliance with fin.
ii.confidential witness 
served as an certified public accountant from late to april.reported directly to lundquist and munimae chief accounting officer,greg thor.asserts that by early,lundquist and thor had concluded that there were widespread problems with the accounting done under former cfo harrison.the problems led thor to review,among other things,the company lihtc fund accounting.according to,by mid at the time of the first restatement,lundquist knew that the primary beneficiary determinations for most lihtc funds were incorrect and that the funds should have been consolidated under fin.also asserts that lundquist and falcone were heavily involved in the restatement effort,with falcone receiving updates regarding the restatement at least on a weekly basis and sometimes on a daily basis.
iii.confidential witness 
finally,was the administrative assistant to munimae head of internal audit,angela barone,from june to june.in that capacity,attended regular meetings to discuss progress on ongoing audit work.according to,at some point,frustration with the progress of fin accounting became a regular subject of discussion at the meetings,and barone communicated that frustration to lundquist and falcone recounts that falcone sent a memo to all munimae employees in fall emphasizing that the auditing staff would be focusing all of its energies on the second restatement.the memo made clear that the related audit work should be made a priority and excuses regarding delays providing the audit department with information would not be tolerated.
iv.inferences from the cw evidence 
we conclude that the confidential witness statements permit an inference that the munimae defendants knew,perhaps as early as mid,that the company was not in compliance with fin,despite their representations to the contrary.the allegations are also consistent with the inference that these defendants knew or at least suspected by fall that consolidating the lihtc funds in accordance with fin would be a difficult and costly undertaking.
nonetheless,we agree with the district court that these allegations do not support a strong inference of wrongful intent.to begin with,the confidential witnesses do not expressly assert that the munimae defendants intentionally or recklessly failed to comply with gaap or their own internal accounting policies during the class period.the statements are also generally vague and conclusory as to the munimae defendants state of mind.
as even the amended complaint concedes,munimae struggled throughout the class period with what its own former accountant described as difficult and complex accounting.this complexity was not helped by an accounting system that was in a constant state of confusion and chaos,in no small part due to the company rapid expansion and inadequate staffing.the munimae defendants may well have been negligent in failing to properly apply fin to their business in the first instance,and then by allowing the company to be overwhelmed by the resulting accounting tsunami.but plaintiffs allegations do not support a powerful and compelling inference that these defendants acted with wrongful intent or severe recklessness.zucco partners,at although the allegations in this case are legion the facts alleged point towards the conclusion that the defendant was simply overwhelmed with integrating a large new division into its existing business.
that munimae officers and outside auditor debated how to account for the lihtc funds in light of fin does not compel an inference of wrongful intent.the more plausible inference is that there was an honest disagreement over the proper application of a challenging new accounting standard.that the munimae defendants were ultimately wrong is not enough to support an inference of scienter.dsam global value fund altris software,cir t he mere publication of inaccurate accounting figures,or a failure to follow gaap,without more,does not establish scienter.quoting in re software toolworks,cir.
as for allegations regarding lundquist knowledge of the fin issues,they too fail to support a strong inference that she or anyone else acted with fraudulent purpose.even if,as plaintiffs allege,lundquist began to suspect a problem with the fin accounting at the time the first restatement began in march,we are not persuaded that she then hatched a plot to defraud the investing public.
to the contrary,we are skeptical that lundquist would sign off on the first restatement in june without addressing fin issues,thus subjecting herself to sec sanctions,if she firmly believed then that the accounting was wrong.a more logical and compelling inference is that lundquist and the other munimae defendants were continuing to assess the scope of the problem before deciding on an appropriate course of action.we also find it significant that it was munimae management and not some outside entity that ultimately disclosed that the company would have to consolidate the remaining lihtc funds in january thus conceding the company earlier error.in our view,this disclosure supports a strong inference that defendants were not acting with scienter but rather were endeavoring in good faith to inform the investing public.matrix capital,at.
finally,we recognize that the fall falcone memorandum,which noted that that the auditing staff intended to focus all of its energies on the second restatement,supports an inference that the munimae defendants could have more promptly anticipated the substantial costs of addressing the company myriad accounting issues.but that is a far cry from concluding that falcone and his fellow defendants resolved then to defraud plaintiffs by hiding the true costs.
in our view,management subsequent disclosures tend to negate an inference of fraudulent purpose.in july and august,the company announced the hiring of an independent consultant to assist with the work of the second restatement,identified the large number of personnel working on the accounting issues,and expressed uncertainty as to the costs of the effort going forward.although these disclosures were perhaps not as timely or as fulsome as plaintiffs would have liked,they give rise to a more compelling inference that the munimae defendants were attempting even if imperfectly to keep the investing public informed,while working strenuously to correct the accounting errors they had discovered.
plaintiffs contend that there were numerous red flags that should have alerted the munimae defendants to the fin accounting problems,and that their failure to timely identify the problems demonstrates a reckless disregard for the accuracy of the company financial statements.specifically,they point to the need for and magnitude of multiple restatements,which involved revising several years financial statements and multiple accounting problems the frequency of accounting meetings involving fin issues the high turnover of cfos during the class period and the firing of pwc.
additionally,plaintiffs emphasize that the individual defendants were the company most senior executives,and that the lihtc funds represented a core operation of the company.because these defendants were directly responsible for the company financial statements and many were heavily involved in the second restatement they must have known,or recklessly failed to realize,that the company was not in compliance with fin.
the presence of red flags,coupled with the breadth and gravity of a company problems,may provide substantial weight to an inference that high level corporate agents must have been aware of the problems.see matrix capital,at.the more significant the error the stronger the inference it supports.see id.at see also in re atlas worldwide holdings.sec,d,when a company is forced to restate its previously issued financial statements,the mere fact that the company had to make a large correction is some evidence of scienter.
while the red flags alleged in the complaint are not insubstantial,they do not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.fundamentally,the fin accounting error itself was not especially obvious,at least with respect to the company financial.in that regard,we note,as did the district court,that munimae ownership interest in the unconsolidated lihtc funds was one percent or less.the cumulative economic impact of all of the restatement adjustments including but not limited to the lihtc fund consolidation was a loss of approximately million in shareholders equity for fiscal year for the same year,munimae adjusted shareholders equity was approximately million.thus,while the effort to complete the restatement proved costly,the practical effect of proper consolidation on the company financial statements was relatively small.
the other potential warning signs also lend themselves to benign interpretations.we view the frequency of accounting meetings as a sign of diligence rather than evidence of a nefarious purpose.zucco partners,at noting that an allegation that top executives attended several meetings to discuss the company financial affairs was not the kind of particular evidence required to support a strong inference of scienter.
a high turnover in cfos can certainly raise suspicion,but the facts alleged here mitigate any concern.harrison left the company in late,well before any officer is alleged to have known about the fin issues.lundquist resigned in july,after the company was required to perform two restatements under her watch,the second of which entailed numerous delays and snowballing costs.while lundquist resignation is evidence of the substantial accounting challenges the company then faced,it does not compel an inference that she and the other individual defendants were bent on committing fraud.see id.at where a resignation occurs slightly before or after the defendant corporation issues a restatement,a plaintiff must plead facts refuting the reasonable assumption that the resignation occurred as a result of the restatement issuance itself in order for a resignation to be strongly indicative of scienter.
nor is pwc october departure particularly telling.the dismissal of an accounting firm around the time of a restatement is not surprising.id.concluding that the resignation of the defendant independent public accountant did not support a strong inference of scienter because the firm had just been partially responsible for the corporation failure to adequately control its accounting procedures.this is especially true on these facts,as munimae was required to execute two restatements while pwc was serving as its auditor.the fact that pwc alerted the company to one of the many issues the restatements ultimately addressed does not mean that the munimae defendants were not justifiably dissatisfied with pwc services generally.any inference of wrongful intent is further weakened by the fact that pwc made clear in a letter to the sec that it had no disagreements with the company on any matter of accounting principle or practice that it felt obligated to report 
finally,and in accordance with several of our sister circuits,we reject plaintiffs contention that the individual defendants must have acted intentionally or recklessly with respect to the fin accounting merely because they were senior executives,and the lihtc funds represented a core business of the company.see,in re suprema specialties.sec,cir a pleading of scienter may not rest on a bare inference that a defendant must have had knowledge of the facts or must have known of the fraud given his or her position in the company.internal quotation marks omitted,abrogated on other grounds by tellabs,at zucco partners,at finding that bare allegations that officers must have have had knowledge of key facts relating to the business core operations are rarely enough to support a strong inference of scienter.to be sure,such allegations are relevant to the court holistic analysis of scienter.but without additional detailed allegations establishing the defendants actual exposure to the accounting problem,the complaint falls short of of the pslra particularity requirements.
insider trading 
plaintiffs also say that company insiders were motivated to conceal munimae accounting problems to improperly benefit from insider trading.allegations of personal financial gain may weigh heavily in favor of a scienter inference.tellabs,at.however,the inferential weight that may be attributed to any claim of motive must be evaluated in context.see id.at.insider trading allegations will only support an inference of scienter if the timing and amount of a defendant trading were unusual or suspicious.teachers,at internal quotation marks omitted.to determine whether an insider sales were unusual in scope we consider factors such as the amount of profit made,the amount of stock traded,the portion of stockholdings sold,or the number of insiders involved.in re suprema specialties,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in this case,the overall value of munimae shares sold during the class period was higher than in previous years.six company insiders sold shares for a total of in gross proceeds during the class period,as compared to the sale of shares and in gross proceeds between june and the beginning of the class period.these numbers are certainly consistent with an inference that the insiders who traded during the class period had a motive to commit fraud.
nonetheless,the inference that the trades were innocent is stronger.the number of insiders who traded during the class period is relatively small,and plaintiffs do not allege that the insiders timed the sales to take advantage of any particular disclosure.teachers,at finding deficient a complaint that,among other things,failed to allege that defendants timed their sales to profit from any particular disclosures.
nor is the extent of any insiders divestiture particularly alarming.former cfo harrison sold of his shares in early december,but that was well before plaintiffs say that any officer of the company knew that the fin accounting was flawed.board chairman mark joseph sold approximately of his shares between late april and early june.some of these sales coincided with the to the company announcement of the first restatement.however,the sales occurred at fairly regular intervals and amounts compared to earlier periods.ceo falcone sold just over of his holdings during the class period,with the bulk of the sales occurring in and mid.falcone sold shares twice in early,but the volume of the trades was not unusual.in short,none of the defendants trading strikes us as suspicious.id.at finding insider sales of,and of defendants holdings unremarkable in context.
the fact that falcone and joseph traded munimae shares under rule plans further weakens any inference of fraudulent purpose.under rule,corporate insiders can set up trading plans to sell company shares at predetermined times and amounts to avoid accusations of illegal insider trading.see c stating that it is an affirmative defense in insider trading cases that the defendant purchases or sales were made pursuant to a written plan for trading securities see also cent.laborers pension fund integrated servs,cir explaining that a trading plan can give rise to an inference that the sales were not suspicious in re worlds of wonder sec,cir same.
joseph rule plan does less to shield him from suspicion because he instituted the plan in march,after the start of the class period.by contrast,falcone created his plan in.nonetheless,joseph entered the plan a year before the complaint alleges that any officer at munimae knew the fin accounting was wrong,and the amended complaint does not allege that joseph traded outside of the plan.thus,although the rule plan does not completely immunize joseph from suspicion,it does mitigate any inference of improper motive surrounding his sales.
an additional problem with the allegations of insider trading relates to the length of the putative class period.the plaintiffs have chosen an inordinately long period of months.see teachers,at describing a month class period as exceedingly long see also in re vantive.sec,cir characterizing a class period of months as unusually long,abrogation on other grounds recognized by south ferry lp,killinger,cir.in our view,alleging such a lengthy class period makes it difficult to infer intent from the mere fact of a stock sale,as it is not unusual for insiders to trade at some point during their tenure with a company.see teachers,at.
d.other allegations of motive 
plaintiffs proffer a number of general business motivations from which they would have us infer fraud.they contend that munimae wanted to artificially inflate the price of its shares to attract investors,fund corporate acquisitions,avoid a default on loan covenants,and obtain favorable loan terms.we decline,however,to infer fraud from financial motivations common to every company.see ottmann hanger orthopedic,cir c ourts have repeatedly rejected these types of generalized motives which are shared by all companies as insufficient to plead scienter under the pslra.
although munimae conducted numerous offerings and acquisitions during the class period,very little of this activity occurred after any officer is alleged to have known that the fin accounting was flawed.it is true that the company was aware that consolidating lihtc funds could affect its debt covenants,as the initial consolidation in would have caused it to default on at least two debt covenants.but munimae disclosed that fact,and it was also able to negotiate waivers on each covenant to avoid default.in short,nothing about the specific facts alleged render munimae general business motivations particularly suspicious.
class period disclosures 
for their part,the munimae defendants assert that their class period disclosures rebut any inference of scienter.it is appropriate to consider such disclosures,which in some contexts will indicate that the defendants were acting in good faith,but in other contexts will indicate that the defendants had knowledge of operational risks suggesting a lack of good faith.matrix capital,at.
we believe munimae made several relevant disclosures during the class period.in announcing its first restatement on march,munimae also alerted investors to the fact that the company suffered from material weaknesses related to the financial reporting process.although only a few material weaknesses were then identified,the company warned that management might identify additional material weaknesses as part of the restatement.id.
over the next two years,the company repeatedly disclosed newly discovered material weaknesses,and reiterated that it might identify additional problems that would render its remedial efforts ineffective.the fact that munimae continued to update investors about newly discovered weaknesses tends to negate an inference that the defendants acted with an intent to defraud.matrix capital,at a disclosure that meaningfully alerts investors to the risk that financial information is not accurate may suggest that the individuals responsible for the disclosure did not knowingly or perhaps not even recklessly misstate the underlying financial information.
munimae also attempted to update investors regarding the escalating cost of the second restatement.although the initial announcement in september identified only a few areas for restatement,the company announced in october that it had not yet determined its full scope.in may,the company disclosed that it was unable to timely file its annual form k for fiscal year because of the dedication of significant management resources to these restatement efforts.on july,the company announced that it had retained navigant consulting to assist in the restatement efforts.in a telephone conference with investors the following month,the company noted that,given the scope of the restatement,it had to bring new and unbudgeted resources online quickly.finally,at a november teleconference,the company informed investors that both the magnitude and cost of the restatement would be very significant.
to be sure,the import of some of munimae disclosures was moderated by the fact that it occasionally buried the information in press releases headlined with favorable news.nonetheless,munimae repeatedly noted the need to restate its financials,the deficiency in its internal controls,and the fact that the restatement would require the company to commit resources far greater than initially anticipated.
not only do these disclosures bolster the inference that the munimae defendants acted in good faith,but they also strengthen the inference that these defendants only realized the fin accounting problems and the cost of fixing them over time.
after evaluating the inferential weight owed to plaintiffs allegations of corporate fraud in light of context and common sense,we must consider whether a reasonable person would regard the inference that defendants knowingly or recklessly misstated or omitted material information at least as strong as the inference that the munimae defendants were merely negligent with respect to those statements.matrix capital,at.to that end,we must evaluate the complaint holistically,recognizing that allegations of scienter that would not independently create a strong inference of scienter might compliment sic each other to create an inference of sufficient strength to satisfy the pslra.id.at.
considered holistically,we conclude that plaintiffs have not satisfied their burden under the pslra.we accept as fact that management regularly discussed fin compliance issues,even before the first restatement,and that by mid,at least lundquist had determined that the company lihtc fund accounting was flawed.we know that pwc recommended that the company reconsider its lihtc fund accounting prior to the first restatement,but that at least some munimae officers disagreed.we acknowledge that in the fall of,the company recognized that correcting various accounting errors would be a management focus for some time.we accept that the munimae defendants had financial motivations albeit universal ones to avoid disclosing the need to consolidate the lihtc funds.and we know that munimae suffered from material weaknesses in its internal controls that,among other things,could have alerted management to problems with the fin accounting.
while this mosaic supports an inference of scienter,we find more compelling the inference that the munimae defendants were,at most,negligent.in,munimae was faced with applying a challenging new accounting standard to its rapidly expanding business,requiring the company to determine whether and how to consolidate a number of lihtc funds that previously were not on the company financial statements.munimae management mistakenly and perhaps negligently failed to have sufficient accounting controls and processes in place to meet this challenge,which,together with other accounting errors over the course of and,required the company to twice restate its financial accounting statements at a substantial cost.in our view,the facts alleged point more convincingly to an inference that munimae was simply in over its head.
although some officers may have believed that munimae accounting was flawed by mid,the evidence suggests that others,at least initially,disagreed.this makes it difficult to infer that the munimae defendants intentionally,or even recklessly,misrepresented the state of the company financial affairs.see metzler inv.gmbh corinthian,cir finding insufficient allegations that point only to disagreement and questioning within the company about a particular accounting practice.and even if some senior officers had concluded by mid that the fin accounting was wrong,that does not establish that they acted with fraudulent purpose to conceal the problems until january.
the strength of the inference with respect to munimae knowledge of the costs of the second restatement is even weaker on the facts alleged.we think it more plausible that the company simply had not reached a conclusion with respect to fin until after it began the second restatement,and that the munimae defendants only gradually became aware of the expense as it was incurred.
the company successive disclosures suggest that its officers attempted to keep investors updated about munimae internal weaknesses.the pattern of disclosures also suggests that management only gradually awakened to the magnitude of the company accounting problems and the cost of fixing them.that the company accounting department during the early part of the class period was chronically understaffed and,at least initially,professionally unprepared for the accounting challenge before it,strengthens the inference that final decisions regarding the fin accounting remained unresolved until late.
on the facts alleged,the inference that the munimae defendants were negligent in discharging their duties may well be compelling.but that is not enough to survive a motion to dismiss in this context.see pub.emps,at.we hold that the district court correctly dismissed plaintiffs claims under the pslra for failing to adequately plead scienter

the amended complaint alleges that certain violated and a because the registration statement and prospectus for the spo incorporated by reference materially misleading statements and omissions.for example,the registration statement incorporated by reference the company quarterly reports from the second and third quarters of,which represented that munimae was in compliance with fin.see.the february,prospectus supplement expressly represented that munimae was in compliance with fin.however,it also noted that d ue to the complexity of fin we can not assure you that further changes in our financial statements will not be required with respect to the application of fin.
the district court found the claim by the securities act statute of repose and dismissed the a claim for lack of standing.we address each issue in turn.
section of the securities act contains a statute of repose.see.it provides 
in no event shall any such action be brought to enforce a liability created under or a of this title more than three years after the security was bona fide offered to the public 
the statute does not define the term bona fide offered to the public,and neither the supreme court nor this circuit has determined the meaning of the phrase.the district court applied the rule accepted by the majority of courts and found that the statute of repose began to run on the date the sec declared munimae registration statement effective,january.because the original complaint in this action was not filed until february,the court concluded that the claim was late.see in re mun.mortg.equity,at.
on appeal,plaintiffs arguments are threefold.first,applying a combination of dictionary and statutory definitions,they say that a bona fide offering occurs only when securities are offered for value in a manner capable of acceptance,and in a way that is open and visible.under this interpretation,the repose period began to run,at the earliest,on february,that is,when munimae issued a prospectus supplement pricing the securities,or on february,when the spo commenced.alternatively,plaintiffs suggest the securities were not bona fide offered until february,the last date of the spo.finally,plaintiffs argue that,even if the general rule is that the statute of repose begins to run on the effective date of the registration statement,we should not apply that rule in this case because there was a significant delay between the effective date and the commencement of the offering.
both the munimae and underwriter defendants respond that the effective date of the spo registration statement constituted the bona fide offering date because it is the date on which all barriers to sale were removed.they also emphasize that most case law defines the effective date of the registration statement as the bona fide offering.
the meaning of bona fide offered to the public in statute of repose is a question of statutory interpretation that we review de novo.see stolz family daum,cir.
we begin by considering whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning.see united states ashford,cir.at first blush,the plaintiffs principal position is appealing.in ordinary usage,bona fide often means as plaintiffs urge genuine.see random house webster unabridged dictionary ed see also black law dictionary ed.sincere genuine.but it can also mean made in good faith and without deception or fraud.random house webster unabridged dictionary see also black law dictionary made in good faith without fraud or deceit.to the extent other courts and authorities have considered the meaning of bona fide in context,they have concluded that congress simply intended to distinguish a true offering from a simulated offering.see stolz,at see also louis loss,joel seligman troy paredes,securities regulation b g i,at ed discussing the dealer exemption under a of the securities act,which also uses the term bona fide offered to the public.
the meaning of the word offer is no more certain.as commonly used,offer can mean both to present for acceptance or rejection and also to propose or put forward for consideration.see random house webster unabridged dictionary.section a of the securities act defines offer to include every attempt or offer to dispose of,or solicitation of an offer to buy,a security or interest in a security,for value.a.but we think it unlikely that congress intended the meaning of bona fide offered in to be coterminous with the definition of offer in a.see morse peat,marwick,mitchell,the term bona fide offered to the public is a term of art and one not necessarily synonymous with the full breadth of the statutory term offer.
because we believe the statutory language is susceptible to more than one meaning,we look beyond the statute for guidance.the second circuit opinion in stolz is the leading authority on the term bona fide offered to the public in.the question in that case was the meaning of that phrase in the context of unregistered securities.but the court examined a number of cases involving registered securities and determined that the date of registration has been treated as the date that starts the running of the repose period.stolz,at.
a majority of courts have followed the stolz guidance,see,armstrong am.pallet leasing,d,in re metro.sec,wl,at,in re countrywide fin.sec,wl,at,and we agree that this approach best reflects congressional purpose.section is violated when a registration statement containing misleading information becomes effective.see a william hicks,civil liabilities enforcement litigation under the act.using the effective date of the registration statement as the bona fide offering date logically links a putative defendant liability to the statutory violation.see fed.hous.fin.agency ubs,wl,at june,recognizing that courts have accepted the effective date as the repose trigger on the ground that the registration statement includes the information upon which the section claim is predicated the alleged falsehood.
using the effective date is also consistent with the purpose of statutes of repose generally.such statutes provide a fixed date readily determinable by the defendant rather than a date determined by the personal circumstances of the plaintiff.caviness derand res,cir see also city of pontiac emps.ret.mbia,inc,cir contrasting a statute of repose,which begins to run from the defendant violation,with a statute of limitations,which can not begin to run until the plaintiff claim has accrued 
plaintiffs object to this view of the statute,pointing to of the securities act,which also uses the term bona fi
