the district court certified a class of former and current employees of security associates,ussa,who allege that ussa committed numerous violations of california labor law.ussa filed a petition to appeal the district court certification order,which we granted.see.f.on appeal,ussa argues that the court erred in certifying the meal break,because the plaintiffs failed to establish questions of law or fact common to the class that predominate over questions affecting only individual members.a,b.we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by certifying the meal break.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
plaintiff muhammed abdullah is a former employee of ussa,a private security guard company ussa provides guards at over locations in california,including hotels,hospitals,warehouses,and construction sites,among other locations.in addition to standing guard at such locations,ussa employees may perform a range of other duties,such as inspecting vehicles,patrolling properties,reacting to patient emergencies,clearing off railroad tracks,and recording damage to vehicles,among many other tasks.a large majority of ussa employees in california work at single post locations,meaning that no other guards are on duty at the same time 
as a condition of employment,all of ussa employees are required to sign meal period agreements.the record contains two versions of such agreements.the first,which was used prior to,provides 
due to the nature of the work i perform as a security guard,and due to the nature of the services provided by security associates,i understand that my work prevents me from being relieved of all duty during my meal period.i am voluntarily agreeing to have my daily meal period on duty.i understand that i will be paid at my regular rate of pay for my on duty meal period.i understand that,if i elect to revoke this agreement,i may do so at any time,provided my revocation is in writing.
the second,which ussa has used since mid,provides 
due to the nature of the work i perform as a security guard,and due to the nature of the services provided by security associates,i understand that i may be prevented from being relieved of duty during my meal period.on this basis,i voluntarily agree to have an meal period that shall be counted as time worked and compensated by security associates.
after five hours worked,the following waiver becomes relevant 
pursuant to paragraph of wage order of the california industrial welfare commission,employee and employer,as evidenced by their respective signatures below,hereby mutually agree to waive the right to an meal period for any hours worked in excess of five total hours in a workday.
i understand that i may revoke this agreement at anytime in writing,and such revocation shall be presented to my supervisor or operations manager at the beginning of the shift on which i first desire to revoke the agreement.i am voluntarily signing this agreement.
flury testified that if an employee refuses to sign the meal period agreement,he or she wo work for us.he further testified that one of the requirements of the job,as evidenced by the waiver,was for ussa employees to eat meals on the job.
the plaintiffs sought to maintain a class action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated,alleging that ussa committed numerous violations of california labor laws,including,inter alia,requiring them to work through their meal periods.of note here,they allege that ussa has a policy of requiring employees to work through their legally mandated meal periods,and is therefore liable for paying premium compensation for missed meal periods pursuant to california labor code and the applicable industrial welfare commission wage order.
the district court certified the class and seven,pursuant to rule b.one of the is the meal break,which is defined as 
a subclass of all of defendant past and present california security employees who worked more than six hours and were not provided a meal break in any work shift from july,through the present,and who were not compensated for such meal break s pursuant to california labor code b.
the district court determined that certifying this was appropriate,g iven ussa uniform policy of requiring the putative subclass members to sign the meal break agreement,as well as the evidence that,in the vast majority of cases,this policy was implemented to require meal breaks be taken.a few months later,the court reached the same conclusion in an order denying ussa motion for reconsideration.having been granted leave to appeal,ussa challenges the district court certification of the meal break on the grounds that the plaintiffs have not established commonality,as required under federal rule of civil procedure a,or predominance,as required under rule b.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court decision to certify a class under rule for abuse of discretion.in re wells fargo home mortg.overtime pay,cir hereinafter in re wells fargo.when reviewing a grant of class certification,we accord the district court noticeably more deference than when we review a denial of class certification.wolin jaguar land rover,llc,cir quoting in re salomon analyst metromedia,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a district court abuses its discretion if it relies on an improper factor,omits a substantial factor,or commits a clear error of judgment in weighing the correct mix of factors.in re wells fargo,at.in addition,an error of law is a per se abuse of discretion.yokoyama midland nat.life ins,cir.we review the district court findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard,meaning we will reverse them only if they are illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the record.united states hinkson,cir.
iii.analysis 
we are concerned here with two overlapping requirements for class certification.first,a party seeking class certification must always show that there are questions of law or fact common to the class.a second,the proposed class must satisfy at least one of the three requirements listed in rule b.wal mart stores,dukes,see also.b.here,the plaintiffs seek certification under rule b,which requires,inter alia,that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.b.thus,rule a asks whether there are issues common to the class,and rule b asks whether these common questions predominate.wolin,f d at.we begin our analysis by considering whether the plaintiffs have satisfied rule a,keeping in mind that this analysis is also relevant to rule b.see id.noting the substantial overlap between the two tests.we then turn to rule b.hanlon chrysler,cir explaining that the requirements of rule a are less rigorous than the companion requirements of rule b.
the supreme court has recently emphasized that commonality requires that the class members claims depend upon a common contention such that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each claim in one stroke.mazza am.honda motor,cir quoting walmart.at internal alteration omitted.put another way,the key inquiry is not whether the plaintiffs have raised common questions,even in droves,but rather,whether class treatment will generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.wal mart.at quoting richard nagareda,class certification in the age of aggregate proof,emphasis added internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.this does not,however,mean that every question of law or fact must be common to the class all that rule a requires is a single significant question of law or fact.mazza,at emphasis added see also meyer portfolio recovery,cir,cert.denied.
here,the district court concluded that a common legal question that is presented and susceptible to determination is whether california nature of the work exception to industrial welfare commission iwc wage order wage order which governs meal periods applies to ussa single guard post staffing model.ussa counters that this question will not generate a common answer,because ussa nature of the work defense requires an individualized,analysis of each employee work history,including a examination of an employee job duties.we therefore begin our rule a analysis by looking to state law to determine whether the plaintiffs claims and ussa affirmative defenses can yield a common answer that is apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.wal mart.at see also amgen connecticut ret.plans trust funds,merits questions may be considered to the extent but only to the extent that they are relevant to determining whether the rule prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.we conclude that they can.
under california law,an employer may not require any employee to work during any meal period mandated by an applicable order of the industrial welfare commission.cal.a wage order,in turn,guarantees certain employees a minute meal period for every five hours of work,tit,subd.a see also cal.a an employer may not employ an employee for a work period of more than five hours per day without providing the employee with a meal period of not less than minutes.the employee must be relieved of all duty during this break if not,the meal period is considered,and counts as time worked.the following three conditions apply to meal periods 
an on duty meal period shall be permitted only when the nature of the work prevents an employee from being relieved of all duty and when by written agreement between the parties an paid meal period is agreed to.the written agreement shall state that the employee may,in writing,revoke the agreement at any time.
tit,subd.a.the parties do not dispute that the putative class members all signed a written agreement which provided that it could be revoked their disagreement turns on whether ussa can defeat class certification by invoking the nature of the work exception to the meal period requirement.we first consider the substantive scope of duties that may qualify for the nature of the work exception,and we then consider two recent state court decisions addressing policies similar to the one in this case.
the california state courts have not addressed the substantive scope of the nature of the work exception the california division of labor standards enforcement dlse,however,has issued several opinion letters addressing when the nature of the work exception may apply the dlse opinion letters,while not controlling upon the courts by reason of their authority,do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.brinker,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.we look to them for guidance on what an employer must show to invoke the exception,as well as examples where dlse has found that it is satisfied 
first,dlse has emphasized that the meal period is a limited alternative to the meal period requirement.dlse opinion letter at.critically,it is not described or defined as a waiver of an meal period,id.emphasis added,but rather as a type of meal period that can be lawfully provided only in those circumstances in which the three express conditions set forth in the regulation are satisfied.id.thus,
i n determining whether the nature of the work prevents an employee from being relieved of all duty,dlse starts with the premise that the general requirement for an meal period is remedial in nature,and any exception to that general requirement must be narrowly construed,so as to avoid frustrating the remedial purpose of the regulation.
dlse opinion letter at.the employer has the burden to establish the facts that would justify an meal period.id.at see also dlse opinion letter at dlse opinion letter at in the view of the division,the onus is on the employer to show that the work involved prevents the employee from being relieved of duty.
second,we can characterize the instances in which dlse has found that the nature of the work exception applies into two categories where the work has some particular,external force that requires the employee to be on duty at all times,and where the employee is the sole employee of a particular employer for example,in its most recent opinion letter,dlse concluded that employees who transport hazardous materials,and are required by federal regulation to attend to their vehicles at all times,are covered by the nature of the work exception.dlse opinion letter at.it emphasized the narrow scope of its conclusion,however,explaining,
w e do not comment upon the application of the meal period requirements for any period of time during which the driver is not engaged in activity that is regulated by the referenced federal regulations it may indeed be the case that drivers may be provided an meal period during these times even though they are otherwise prevented by the nature of their work from taking a meal period during times in which they are engaged in activity otherwise governed by the federal regulations.
id.dlse further allowed for the possibility that another employee might be able to cover the driver,explaining.
also,the nature of the work element may not be satisfied under circumstances where the employer may have another qualified representative reasonably available to perform the attending duties required under federal regulation.for instance,drivers who transport fuel in and around the bay area may likely park their vehicle at one of the company yards and leave such vehicle unattended in compliance with federal law in order to take an meal period.such a driver would not be entitled to an meal period if the nature of his or her work did not prevent the driver from being relieved of all duty.
id in another opinion letter,dlse noted that the nature of the work exception might apply where the position involves the continuous operation of machinery requiring monitoring that is essential to the business of the employer.dlse opinion letter at.
in addition to these jobs,which by their nature require the employee to be present at all times,dlse has also found that the nature of the work exception would apply to an isolated gas station in which only a single employee is present,but only if there was not another employee employed at the worksite.dlse opinion letter at see also dlse opinion letter noting that the nature of the work exception might apply where the employee is the only person employed in the establishment and closing the business would work an undue hardship on the employer.dlse opinion letter at concluding that the nature of the work exception does not apply to shift managers at restaurants,in part because other employees are on duty and could cover for the manager 
with this understanding of the nature of the work defense,we turn to two recent state court decisions that guide our analysis of rule a commonality requirement.first,in brinker,the california supreme court clarified multiple issues of significance to class actions generally and to meal and rest break class actions in particular.at.of particular importance here,the court in brinker held that the california court of appeal had erred in reversing the superior court certification of a class of plaintiffs who alleged that their employer uniformly denied them rest breaks.although the court analysis arose in the context of a representative action under california code of civil procedure,it also spoke to the liability that would arise under such a scenario 
t he court of appeal concluded that because rest breaks can be waived as all parties agree any showing on a class basis that plaintiffs or other members of the proposed class missed rest breaks or took shortened rest breaks would not necessarily establish,without further individualized proof,that brinker violated the labor code and wage order.this was error.an employer is required to authorize and permit the amount of rest break time called for under the wage order for its industry.if it does not if,for example,it adopts a uniform policy authorizing and permitting only one rest break for employees working a shift when two are required it has violated the wage order and is liable 
the theory of liability that brinker has a uniform policy,and that that policy,measured against wage order requirements,allegedly violates the law is by its nature a common question eminently suited for class treatment.
id.at emphasis added.
the california court of appeal subsequently interpreted and applied brinker in a case with strikingly similar facts to the case before us.see faulkinbury boyd.in faulkinbury,the putative class was made up of private security guards whose employer had a uniform policy of requiring all security guard employees to take paid,meal breaks and to sign an agreement by which the employee agreed to such meal breaks.id.at.the court of appeal concluded that the employee liability turned on the issue of whether boyd policy requiring all security guard employees to sign blanket waivers of meal breaks is lawful,id.at,explaining,
brinker leads us to conclude boyd would be liable upon a determination that boyd uniform meal break policy was unlawful t he employer liability arises by adopting a uniform policy that violates the wage and hour laws.whether or not the employee was able to take the required break goes to damages 
id.at emphasis added the court of appeal explicitly rejected the defendant argument that the nature of the work exception applied,concluding that,by requiring blanket meal break waivers in advance from all security guard employees,regardless of the working conditions at a particular station,the defendant itself treated the meal break issues on a classwide basis.id.at see also bradley networkers int l,llc,d,as modified on denial of reh g,the lack of a break policy and the uniform failure to authorize such breaks are matters of common proof,review denied,bufil dollar fin,d,concluding that the plaintiff theory that two circumstances single employee on duty or providing training do not come within the nature of the work exception was a legal question that could be resolved on a basis.of course,we are not bound by the california court of appeal determination under california law that the certified by the district court is amenable to treatment.see.however,insofar as faulkinbury interprets brinker holding regarding the potential liability of an employer under california law,it is directly on point for our analysis.
in light of these state authorities,we conclude that the plaintiffs claims will yield a common answer that is apt to drive the resolution of the litigation,as required by rule a.wal mart.at.first,as the district court explained,the dlse letters make clear that the showing necessary to establish the nature of the work exception is a high one.in order to make such a showing,ussa had to demonstrate not just that its employees duties varied,but that they varied to an extent that some posts would qualify for the nature of the work exception,while others would not.it failed to do so.indeed,ussa sole explanation for why it requires meal periods is that its guards are staffed at locations.it does not argue that any particular posts would qualify for the nature of the work exception absent the staffing model.in fact,when asked if he could think of examples where the nature of the work requires an meal break,flury testified that he could not thus,the crux of the issue is that the class members duties do not allow for a meal break solely because no other guards are available to cover for them during their meal periods.
consider,for example,the illustrative list of duties that ussa has provided to demonstrate the variety of its employees duties 
t he duties performed by security guards include patrolling parking lots checking receipts signing in and out trucks setting up school parking lots and assisting with student and inspecting vehicles restraining unruly patients escorting dead bodies checking the inventory,mileage,and temperature of trucks working undercover to catch shoplifters monitoring psychiatric patients checking in employees and answering phones at a front desk performing surveillance and enforcing hotel quiet hours.
these duties are undoubtedly distinct from one another,but the only reason any of them prevent the employee from taking a meal period is because ussa has chosen to adopt a staffing model.see,tit,subd.a stating that an meal period is permitted only when the nature of the work prevents an employee from being relieved of all duty emphasis added 
on this basis,we conclude that the merits inquiry will turn on whether ussa is permitted to adopt a staffing model that does not allow for meal periods namely,whether it can invoke a nature of the work defense on a basis,where the need for meal periods results from its own staffing decisions.such an inquiry is permissible under brinker and faulkinbury the latter clarified that an employer may be held liable under state law upon a determination that its uniform meal break policy is unlawful,with the nature of the work defense being relevant only to damages.faulkinbury.at.thus,the legality of ussa policy is a significant question of law,mazza,f d at,that is apt to drive the resolution of the litigation in this case,wal mart.at.we therefore hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that rule a was satisfied.
we next turn to rule b,which asks if the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.b emphasis added.although there may be some variation among individual plaintiffs claims,local joint exec.bd.of trust fund las vegas sands,cir emphasis added,rule b predominance criterion is even more demanding than rule a,comcast behrend.a principal purpose behind rule class actions is to promote efficiency and economy of litigation.in re wells fargo,at internal quotation marks omitted.thus,t he predominance analysis under rule b focuses on the relationship between the common and individual issues in the case,and tests whether the proposed class is sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.wang chinese daily news,wl at cir,quoting hanlon,at.here,we conclude that it is.
first,our analysis of the nature of the work exception,supra,drives our conclusion that rule b is satisfied here.erica john fund,halliburton,considering whether questions of law or fact common to class members predominate begins,of course,with the elements of the underlying cause of action.we have concluded that the nature of the work defense can,and will,be applied on a basis in this case.we offer no opinion on whether ussa staffing model will qualify for the nature of the work exception but rule b requires only a showing that questions common to the class predominate,not that those questions will be answered,on the merits,in favor of the class.amgen.at emphasis removed see also united steel,paper forestry,rubber,energy,allied indus.serv.workers int l union,afl cio,clc conocophillips,cir holding that the district court abused its discretion by declining certification based on the possibility that plaintiffs would not prevail on the merits on their on duty theory,where the plaintiffs theory was that certain restrictions on their meal breaks made the meals on duty under california law emphasis removed.and where,as here,there are no relevant distinctions between the worksites,we agree with the district court that the nature of the work inquiry would be a common one,focused on the legality of a staffing model,rather than a inquiry.viewing the meal break claims in this manner undercuts ussa primary argument that individual issues will predominate due to its need to present an individual nature of the work defense for each plaintiff and each worksite.
we are mindful that it is an abuse of discretion for the district court to rely on uniform policies to the near exclusion of other relevant factors touching on predominance.in re wells fargo,at see also wang,wl at vinole countrywide home loans,cir.thus,in in re wells fargo,we held that the district court had abused its discretion when it certified a class of home mortgage consultants hmcs,all of whom wells fargo had classified as exempt from overtime laws,under rule b.at.the district court in in re wells fargo had found that it would need to analyze the job experiences of the individual employees,including the amount of time worked by each hmc,how they spend their time,where they primarily work,and their levels o
