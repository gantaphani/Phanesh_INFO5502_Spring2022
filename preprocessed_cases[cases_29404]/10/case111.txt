this appeal and require us to determine how our recent ruling in kristian comcast,cir in which we determined that specific provisions of comcast standard arbitration agreement with its cable customers had to be severed from the agreement because they prevented its customers from vindicating rights in the arbitral forum provided for in state and federal antitrust to consumer claims that carl anderson brings against comcast,which seeks to compel arbitration under the same arbitration agreement in pursuing his claims,anderson invoked the massachusetts consumer protection act.laws ch,chapter,and various common law tort theories.citing kristian,the district court granted comcast motion to compel arbitration but only after severing provisions in the arbitration agreement prohibiting attorney fees,double or treble damages and a class action remedy in the arbitral forum.it also specified that the arbitrator will have the power to determine the validity and applicability of the agreement statute of limitations.
after carefully analyzing the alleged conflicts between the language of the arbitration agreement and the statutory provisions at issue under the framework established in kristian,we conclude that only the conflict relating to the limitations period raises a question of arbitrability for the court to decide.we therefore vacate that portion of the district court order compelling arbitration of the applicability of the contractual limitations period,and we conclude that the contractual limitations period is invalid as it relates to anderson chapter claim.however,that clause of the arbitration agreement is severable under the terms of the agreement we therefore affirm the order compelling arbitration of anderson claims,absent that limitations clause.we also reverse that portion of the district court order severing the agreement class action provision and its bar on multiple damages awards.those provisions did not pose questions of arbitrability.
the facts in this case are undisputed.carl anderson,a massachusetts resident,has been a cable service customer of comcast corporation since at least may.until,he leased a cable converter box and remote control in connection with his cable subscription even though he owned a television or video cassette recorder.these unnecessary items were billed to him at approximately per month.
in november,anderson filed a putative class action in massachusetts superior court alleging that the imposition of monthly rental fees on customers with equipment violated chapter,in addition to violating general common law tort and contract law principles.chapter provides a cause of action to consumers who have been injured by an u nfair method of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.laws ch.massachusetts courts have interpreted the terms of chapter broadly to include practices that fall within at least the penumbra of some,statutory,or other established concept of unfairness.lambert fleet bank,quoting wasserman agnastopoulos.while asserting no federal causes of action,anderson grounds his chapter unfair trade practice claim on allegations that comcast violated a provision of the federal communications act requiring that a cable operator shall not charge a subscriber for any service or equipment that the subscriber has not affirmatively requested by name,f and failed to comply with regulations issued by the federal communications commission requiring cable providers to unscramble their basic programming signals so they can be received by customers with equipment,a.for the statutory claim,anderson seeks treble damages and attorney fees for the common law claims,he seeks actual damages,punitive damages,and declaratory and injunctive relief.
shortly after anderson filed his action,comcast filed an unopposed petition for removal to federal court on the basis of diversity once in federal court,comcast moved to compel arbitration under the arbitration agreement,which states in part 
if we are unable to resolve informally any claim or dispute related to or arising out of this agreement or the services provided,we have agreed to binding arbitration except as provided below 
in addition to requiring customers to arbitrate their disputes with comcast,the agreement requires that customers contact comcast within a year of injury or waive any claim based on that injury it requires customers to pay certain costs of arbitration,including their attorney fees and it precludes arbitration on a class action basis and denies customers who prevail in arbitration multiple or punitive damages.despite setting extensive limitations on a customer recovery,the contract contains various clauses severing any terms that conflict with applicable law.
anderson objected to the motion,arguing that arbitration under the terms of the agreement would effectively deny to plaintiffs the ability to vindicate their statutory and common law rights.the district court,relying heavily on the framework and analysis of kristian comcast,cir,granted comcast motion to compel arbitration,but only after determining that the agreement provisions barring attorney fees class actions,and multiple damages were invalid and severed as they related to anderson chapter claim.however,it held that the arbitrator had authority to determine whether the agreement limitations period prevented anderson from vindicating his statutory claim under chapter.
in its appeal,comcast argues that the district court erred in concluding that the arbitration agreement bar on class actions and multiple damages awards were invalid as they related to anderson chapter claim,and it urges us to reverse that portion of the district court order severing these provisions from the arbitration agreement.anderson from the district court order compelling arbitration,arguing the court correctly found particular provisions of the arbitration agreement invalid as they relate to his court should have found the entire arbitration agreement unconscionable and therefore unenforceable in addition,he the district court ruling that the validity of the arbitration agreement limitations period should be determined by the arbitrator.he argues instead that the conflict between that limitations period and chapter statute of limitations creates a direct conflict that must be resolved by the court in favor of the longer statutory period.
we consider these claims against the backdrop of a strong policy expressed by congress and repeatedly upheld by the courts.the supreme court has consistently interpreted the federal arbitration act,as an effort to revers e centuries of judicial hostility to arbitration agreements,to allow parties to avoid the costliness and delays of litigation,and to place arbitration agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.scherk,d quoting,footnote omitted see also dean witter reynolds,byrd,d the preeminent concern of congress in passing the act was to enforce private agreements into which parties had entered,and that concern requires that we rigorously enforce agreements to arbitrate.indeed,the supreme court has repeatedly upheld arbitration agreements against a variety of attacks,stating that any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver,delay,or a like defense to arbitrability.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.
despite the court liberal policy favoring arbitration,it has made clear that the question whether the parties have submitted a particular dispute to arbitration,the question of arbitrability,is an issue for judicial determination u nless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise.howsam dean witter reynolds,d quoting at t,commc ns workers of america,d alteration in original.this the question whether the parties have submitted a particular disagreement to arbitration is an issue for judicial based on the presumed intent of the contracting parties favoring judicial determination of such a question.the court refers to this presumed intent as the interpretive rule.see also kristian comcast,cir.but the court has cautioned against an overly expansive application of the interpretive rule 
linguistically speaking,one might call any potentially dispositive gateway question a question of arbitrability,for its answer will determine whether the underlying controversy will proceed to arbitration on the merits.the court case law,however,makes clear that,for purposes of applying the interpretive rule,the phrase question of arbitrability has a far more limited scope.the court has found the phrase applicable in the kind of narrow circumstance where contracting parties would likely have expected a court to have decided the gateway matter,where they are not likely to have thought that they had agreed that an arbitrator would do so,and,consequently,where reference of the gateway dispute to the court avoids the risk of forcing parties to arbitrate a matter that they may well not have agreed to arbitrate.

one of the narrow circumstances that might raise a question of arbitrability involves an allegation by a party to an arbitration agreement that some of the terms in an arbitration agreement conflict with a statutory right that is not waivable by contract.if that claim withstands analysis,the court will have to decide whether the conflict precludes enforcement of the arbitration agreement.see,mitsubishi motors soler,d having made the bargain to arbitrate,the party should be held to it unless the legislature itself has evinced an intention to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue.alternatively,a party may challenge the enforceability of an arbitration agreement claiming that the agreement itself or some of its terms are unconscionable.see id.at c ourts should remain attuned to claims that the agreement to arbitrate resulted from the sort of fraud or overwhelming economic power that would provide grounds for the revocation of any contract.quoting.
anderson primarily raises a vindication of statutory rights argument as a defense to the obligation to arbitrate,claiming that chapter,and a related statute of limitations provision,preclude enforcement of the arbitration agreement.when faced with such a defense to the obligation to arbitrate,we must determine whether that defense poses a question of arbitrability for the court to decide.this question,to which we now turn,is at the heart of our analysis.
we review the district court decision de novo,as it rests entirely on questions of law.stuart united states,cir.we use the framework developed in kristian comcast,cir to first decide whether any of anderson challenges to the arbitration agreement pose questions of arbitrability.
we begin and end our analysis of the arbitration agreement class bar by determining whether a conflict exists between the statute and the agreement.we find no conflict.with respect to class actions,the agreement states 
there shall be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action or consolidated basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public such as a private attorney general,other subscribers,or other persons similarly situated unless your state laws provide otherwise.
in kristian,where we also assessed the validity of comcast bar on class arbitration,neither the state nor federal antitrust statute at issue mentioned the right of plaintiffs to proceed on a class basis.as a result,our analysis focused on whether the nature and purposes of antitrust law suggested a conflict,and we determined that,b ecause the denial of class arbitration in the pursuit of antitrust claims has the potential to prevent plaintiffs from vindicating their statutory rights,id.at,such a conflict did exist.here,however,chapter specifically provides for the class action procedure.it states any persons entitled to bring such action may bring the action on behalf of himself and such other similarly injured and situated persons.laws ch.given this explicit statutory language,the relevant question here is whether chapter class action provision is the kind of provision anticipated by the agreement limiting language,unless your state laws provide otherwise.if so,there is no conflict between the arbitration agreement and the statute because the arbitration agreement,by its terms,permits arbitration to proceed on a class basis in the face of state law providing for such actions.
in these circumstances,we find pacificare health,book,d,instructive.there,the supreme court faced a potential conflict between an arbitration agreement that prohibited punitive damages and statutory language entitling plaintiff to treble damages.reasoning that an arbitrator could interpret the agreement to avoid a direct conflict,by finding that treble damages were not necessarily punitive,the court found no question of arbitrability and compelled arbitration.id.likewise here,to the extent there is any ambiguity as to whether chapter provides otherwise,the arbitrator must interpret the agreement in the first instance.see,at.s ince we do not know how the arbitrator will construe the remedial limitations,the questions whether they render the parties agreements unenforceable and whether it is for courts or arbitrators to decide enforceability in the first instance are unusually abstract t he proper course is to compel arbitration.thus,in light of the unless qualifier in the class action provision,we reject anderson contention that this provision raises a question of arbitrability and leave determination of the class action question in the first instance to the arbitrator.
multiple damages 
the district court determined that the agreement proscription of multiple damages also improperly prevented plaintiffs from vindicating statutory rights under chapter.the relevant language of the agreement states 
in no event shall we or our employees or agents have any liability for punitive,treble,exemplary,special,indirect,incidental or consequential damages resulting from our provision of or failure to provide any equipment or services to you such limitation of liability applies in all circumstances regardless of whether such damages may be available under applicable law,and the parties hereby waive their rights,if any,to recover any such damages.
as a prelude to assessing the district court ruling,we review our approach to this multiple damages prohibition in kristian,at.there,we found a clear conflict between the language of the agreement and the federal antitrust statute,which requires that a plaintiff who established an antitrust injury shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained,a.moreover,taking a preliminary look at whether the remedies provided by the antitrust statute could be contractually waived,we found no ambiguity on the waiver issue that would require deference to the arbitrator.kristian,at.hence,we decided that the remedy stripping provision of the arbitration agreement posed a question of,that the court rather than the arbitrator should decide in the first instance whether the conflict between the arbitration agreement and the statute prevented kristian from vindicating her statutory rights.id.at.
addressing that question which we define as the merits in a vindication of statutory rights defense to a motion to compel arbitration,we first explained why the award of treble damages under the federal antitrust statutes could not be waived.id.we then noted that this unwaivable conflict suggested plaintiffs should prevail on their defense to arbitration.id.at.however,we then focused on a savings clause in the arbitration agreement specifically providing that,if certain remedies could not be contractually waived under applicable law,a plaintiff could retain those remedies under the agreement despite any contractual clauses to the contrary.id.that savings clause,by allowing severance of the prohibition on multiple damages as it related to the federal antitrust claim,effectively removed the conflict between the language of the arbitration agreement and the federal antitrust statute on this issue.id.therefore,we determined that,even though the presence of the damages limitation posed a question of arbitrability,it did not preclude enforcement of the arbitration agreement.id.we thus ruled that the plaintiffs could recover treble damages in arbitration for federal antitrust violations.
when we turned to the state antitrust provision,which specifies that the court may award up to three times the amount of actual damages sustained.laws,ch,we concluded that kristian had not established a question of arbitrability.kristian,at.in reaching that conclusion,we explained that even though massachusetts law used the word may indicating that multiple damages were was still a direct conflict between the statutory provision and the arbitration agreement because the arbitration agreement precluded the exercise of discretion to award treble damages that the statute granted to the decision maker.id.at.we then took a preliminary look at the waiver is,whether a plaintiff such as kristian could contractually waive the right to treble damages under massachusetts law.in that analysis,we determined that massachusetts law on this question of waiver was ambiguous at best because the statute made treble damages discretionary rather than mandatory and because the case law on whether remedies were contractually waivable under the statute was unsettled.id.at.we therefore concluded that the arbitrator would have to decide in the first instance whether there was a conflict between the arbitration agreement and the state law and whether that conflict made the arbitration agreement unenforceable.id.
we now turn to the different damages provision of chapter,which provides that a successful claimant is entitled to money damages,which may include double or treble damages.laws ch,and specifies that recovery shall be in the amount of actual damages or up to three but not less than two times such amount if the court finds a willful or knowing violation of the consumer protection act.id.at emphasis added.we note at the outset that this provision differs significantly from both the federal and state antitrust statutes at issue in kristian because it neither mandates multiple damages in all instances of a violation as does the federal antitrust statute,nor does it make multiple damages discretionary in all cases as does the massachusetts antitrust statute.instead,it requires multiple damages only if a determines that a willful or knowing violation occurred.
apparently conceding that the statute and the agreement conflict,comcast argues that this conflict does not pose a question of arbitrability for two reasons.first,to the extent that the massachusetts legislature made multiple damages permissive rather than mandatory,comcast contends that we must follow our analysis of the state antitrust statute in kristian and find that whether the provision is waivable is ambiguous at best.we would therefore be forced to conclude that this conflict raises no question of arbitrability and that the arbitrator must decide waivability in the first instance.second,to the extent that chapter makes multiple damages mandatory if the arbitrator finds a willful or knowing violation,comcast argues that it remains uncertain whether a conflict between the agreement and the statute will arise in this particular case because such a conflict is dependent upon the arbitrator factual findings.in the face of this factual uncertainty,comcast argues,there is no question of arbitrability for the court to decide.
comcast is correct on both points.we have previously recognized that where the existence of a conflict between a provision in an arbitration agreement and a statute depends upon an arbitrator factual finding relating to the merits of the dispute,no question of arbitrability arises.in kristian,we found that a possible conflict between the agreement limitations period and the statute of limitations posed no question of arbitrability where the plaintiff alleged an ongoing injury because whether plaintiffs in fact suffer from an ongoing injury and whether such injury tolls the statute of limitations would require an examination of the merits of the case,the facts,the province of the arbitrator.at.thus,whether the conflict between the agreement and the statute posed a question of arbitrability depended upon factual determinations within the arbitrator purview.here,with respect to the mandatory application of the multiple damages provision of the statute,there will be a conflict between that portion of the statute and the agreement only if the arbitrator finds a willful or knowing violation of the statute.
on the other hand,if the arbitrator finds a violation of the statute that is not willful or knowing,there will be a direct conflict between the agreement and the multiple damages provision of the statute because a flat prohibition against multiple damages removes even the discretion to award them.see id.at.however,it is ambiguous whether anderson right to a discretionary multiple damages remedy is waivable under massachusetts law for the same reasons it was ambiguous whether the plaintiff in kristian could waive a discretionary treble damages award under the massachusetts antitrust statute.
in summary,despite the direct conflicts between the multiple damages provision of the statute and the multiple damages prohibition in the arbitration agreement,these conflicts do not pose a question of arbitrability because the conflict between the mandatory portion of the statute and the agreement will only arise if the arbitrator makes a factual finding a willful or knowing violation that relates to the merits of the dispute and if the arbitrator finds a violation of the statute that is not willful or knowing,the discretionary award of multiple damages may or may not be waivable under massachusetts law.in the absence of a question of arbitrability,the district court erred in ordering that the multiple damages provision be severed from the arbitration agreement.
statute of limitations 
the question of arbitrability 
although a statute of limitations applies to chapter claims under massachusetts general laws chapter,the arbitration agreement provides you must contact within one year of the date of the occurrence of the event or facts giving rise to a dispute or you waive the right to pursue a claim based upon such event,facts or dispute.an apparent conflict therefore arises from the text of these provisions 
in kristian,as just noted,when we faced a similar conflict between an explicit statutory time limit and the arbitration agreement limitation,we concluded that no question of arbitrability was posed because the question of tolling required an examination of facts relating to the merits of the responsibility that belongs to the arbitrator.kristian,at.comcast suggests that there are equivalent factual disputes in this case regarding when anderson discovered that he was being overcharged and whether comcast fraudulently concealed the charges that might eliminate the conflict by bringing him within the agreement statute of limitations.
this argument is unpersuasive.anderson alleges that he returned his cable box to comcast in but did not file suit until.anderson complaint can only be read as an acknowledgment that he did not comply with the arbitration agreement notice of claim provision.the portions of anderson complaint on which comcast relies in attempting to establish a factual dispute do not purport to make a tolling argument and comcast can not impose one on anderson for its own purposes.we therefore agree that anderson has established a direct conflict between the statutory provision and the agreement.
in the face of this direct conflict,we next make the preliminary waivability inquiry,as we did in kristian,id.at,we assess whether there is ambiguity on the question whether the statute of limitations can be contractually shortened.if there is ambiguity,the waivability question must be determined by the arbitrator in the first instance.for the reasons that we explain more fully below,we find that there is not such ambiguity and we therefore conclude that this conflict between the arbitration agreement and the statute of limitations raises a question of arbitrability.
