in this appeal we consider whether employees who institute a collective action against their employer under the terms of the fair labor standards act of,as amended,et flsa,may at the same time litigate supplemental claims as a class action certified according to federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court thought not it rejected the plaintiffs effort to proceed as a class under rule b on the ground that there is a clear incompatibility between the flsa proceeding and the proposed class action.the problem,as the court saw it,stems from the fact that the flsa requires potential plaintiffs to opt in to participate in an action,while the plaintiffs in a rule b class action are included in the case unless they opt out.trying to use both systems would be rife with complications,it concluded more formally,it held that one could never find the superiority requirement of rule b satisfied if the case also involved an flsa collective action.
the question whether these two distinct types of aggregate litigation may within one case has divided the trial courts in this circuit and elsewhere.in the northern district of illinois alone,compare barragan evanger dog and cat food,f,and ladegaard hard rock concrete cutters,wl,with riddle national sec.agency,wl,mcclain leona pizzeria,and rodriguez v.the texan,wl.as far as we can tell,no court of appeals has yet had occasion to address it.but see wang chinese daily news,cir holding that a district court properly certified a rule b class along with an flsa collective action and properly exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the claim lindsay government employees ins,concluding,in the context of an appeal under rule f,that the flsa does not necessarily preclude an exercise of supplemental jurisdiction over related claims de asencio tyson foods,cir concluding that a district court presiding over an flsa collective action should not have exercised supplemental jurisdiction over parallel claims.
we conclude that there is no categorical rule against certifying a rule b class action in a proceeding that also includes a collective action brought under the flsa.we refer to these as combined actions,rather than hybrid actions,to avoid confusion with other uses of the term hybrid,for cases certified under more than one subsection of rule b.in combined actions,the question whether a class should be certified under rule b will it always the application of the criteria set forth in the rule there is no insurmountable tension between the flsa and rule b.nothing in the text of the flsa or the procedures established by the statute suggests either that the flsa was intended generally to oust other ordinary procedures used in federal court or that class actions in particular could not be combined with an flsa proceeding.we reverse the district court determination and remand for further consideration in accordance with this opinion.
the plaintiffs are former employees of an outback steakhouse in calumet city,illinois.the restaurant is owned and operated by the defendant,os restaurant services,we refer to the defendant as outback throughout this opinion.the employees sued outback on behalf of themselves and all others who had previously worked or were currently employed at the restaurant as hourly or tipped employees.a tipped employee,like a waiter or bartender,is paid a wage,which is less than the minimum wage the expectation is that her earnings for each pay period,including both the base wage and tips,will equal or exceed the minimum wage.
the complaint alleges that outback employee policies run afoul of the flsa,the illinois minimum wage law,ilcs et imwl,and the illinois wage payment and collection act,ilcs et iwpca.specifically,the plaintiffs argue that outback violated the minimum wage and maximum hour provisions of both the flsa and the imwl in three ways by requiring tipped employees to perform tasks during which they could not earn tips by using money that tipped employees were required to deposit in a tip pool to make up for shortages in restaurant cash registers and by demanding that the tipped employees contribute an excessive amount of their tips to the tip pool.the plaintiffs claim under the iwpca is based on their allegation that outback altered entries in its timekeeping system to reflect fewer hours for each person,thereby enabling it to pay its employees for less time than they actually worked.
the plaintiffs moved for conditional approval of a federal collective action under section b of the flsa,b,which authorizes employees to act together to seek redress for violations of the statute minimum wage and maximum hour provisions,see and.the conditional approval process is a mechanism used by district courts to establish whether potential plaintiffs in the flsa collective action should be sent a notice of their eligibility to participate and given the opportunity to opt in to the collective action.see,myers hertz,cir.the plaintiffs proposed that notice be given to anyone who had worked as a tipped employee at outback since.at the same time,they sought certification under rule b of three different classes alleging claims all tipped employees who earned less than minimum wage,in violation of the imwl all tipped employees who worked more than hours per week but were not paid overtime,in violation of the imwl and all employees who by virtue of outback incorrect timekeeping were not paid for some of the time that they worked,in violation of the iwpca.
a magistrate judge recommended that the district court permit the federal collective action to proceed but deny without prejudice certification of the rule b classes.while the judge was satisfied that the numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy requirements of rule a had been met,he had one minor reservation and one major concern about the predominance and superiority requirements for a b class.the minor point related to the predominance requirement the plaintiffs could show,he thought,that common questions predominated with respect to their iwpca theory and two of their three imwl theories,but not for the claim that outback forced tipped employees to perform duties.the more important stumbling block was the requirement that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.b.the judge decided that a rule b class will never be superior when another part of the case is proceeding under flsa section b,because of what he saw as the conflict between the two different forms of aggregate litigation.
the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation.it refused to certify the class because there was clear incompatibility between the opt out nature of a rule action and the opt in nature of a section action.without elaborating why it thought that this was such a severe problem,the court concluded that this conflict automatically meant that the class action device was not a superior mechanism for resolving the plaintiffs claims.it accordingly denied class certification of those theories and permitted the plaintiffs to move forward with their flsa collective action.we granted the plaintiffs petition under rule f for an immediate appeal of the order denying class certification.
outback rests its case for affirming the district court decision exclusively on the argument that the plaintiffs can not satisfy the requirements set out in federal rule of civil procedure b.there are a number of issues that are thus not before us.outback does not complain about the district court decision to permit the plaintiffs to proceed with their flsa collective action nor does it argue that the flsa in any way preempts the state laws that the plaintiffs have invoked nor has it suggested that the district court should have declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims though the district court alluded to this question,and we return briefly to it later.in addition,no one questions whether the plaintiffs have satisfied the four requirements of rule a.this leaves us with the question whether the district court correctly ruled that the requirements of rule b could not be satisfied.
in fact,we can be more specific than that.outback argues that even if we were inclined to reverse the district court determination that class treatment is not a superior mechanism here,we could still affirm on the ground that individual issues predominate over class issues with respect to each of the plaintiffs claims.although appellees are normally entitled to advance any argument that was presented before the district court in support of the order on appeal,see,newsome mccabe,cir,this case is not a good candidate for that approach.while the predominance question was explored before the magistrate judge who was largely persuaded by the plaintiffs position,it is unclear what the district court thought about it.at one point,the court remarked that it was adopting the magistrate recommendation in full.standing alone,that sounds as if the district court was endorsing the magistrate judge predominance analysis.but later,the court said,because the court holds that plaintiffs can not meet the superiority requirements with regard to the state law claims,it need not address whether common issues of fact or law predominate this is not a clear enough ruling from the district court to support affirmance on an alternate ground.as a result,our job in this appeal is further simplified we need address only whether the district court correctly ruled that incompatibility between section b of the flsa and rule b means that plaintiffs trying to pursue both options in a single proceeding will never be able to demonstrate the superiority required by rule b.
we review decisions deferentially,in recognition of the fact that rule gives the district courts broad discretion to determine whether certification of a lawsuit is appropriate.chavez illinois state police,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we will reverse the decision only when we find an abuse of discretion.arreola godinez,cir.if,however,the district court applies an incorrect legal rule as part of its decision,then the framework within which it has applied its discretion is flawed,and the decision must be set aside as an abuse.cooter gell hartmarx.
this appeal requires us to delve into the differences between an flsa collective action and a rule class particular,a class action arising under state laws governing such topics as wages and overtime.section b of the flsa permits an employee to participate in a collective action only if that employee consents in writing to be a plaintiff in the action.see b no employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought see also harkins riverboat services,cir.in contrast,potential members of a rule b class must be given only the opportunity to opt out of the class action they will automatically be included in the class if they do not speak up.see.c b berger xerox.retirement income guarantee plan,cir.
as far as the district court was concerned,this distinction,and this distinction alone,rules out any chance of finding that class treatment under rule b of the claims is a superior way to structure the case.this was not the first time the district court had expressed its view on this subject.see riddle national security agency,wl,at.in both riddle and the present case,the court signaled that it had reached this conclusion as a matter of the interpretation of federal statutes and rules,and not merely an exercise of discretion applicable to any particular proposed class.
before examining the district court analysis in greater detail,we pause briefly to address what appears to be an exception that the district court recognized to its belief that combined actions are impossible.the district court suggested that it might treat combined actions that are first filed in a state court and then removed to federal court differently from comparable cases that originate in federal court.see also id.at.there is no reason for any such distinction,however.an original filing and a proper removal are each appropriate ways to reach federal court.once a suit is removed from state court to federal court,it is governed by the federal court procedures,claiborne wisdom,cir there is no exclusion for rule or for any other rule.if there is a problem with combined actions,as the district court suggested,then the problem exists for all cases within the federal court jurisdiction.
the district court was concerned that the collective action authorized by the flsa would be undermined if supplemental class actions were being pursued in the same case at the same time.by requiring people to opt in to the federal action,congress limited the collective action under the flsa to those who actively sought to assert their federal rights.as we have mentioned,however,rule b uses a default rule of inclusion and demands affirmative action to stay out of the case.the court thus correctly recognized that some of the people included as part of the classes those who did nothing would be excluded from the flsa collective action.the district court thought that this outcome would undermine the intention of congress expressed in the flsa.
in our view,the court jumped too quickly to congressional intent.before taking that step,we must examine the text of the flsa itself.nothing we find suggests that the flsa is not amenable to claims for related relief in the same federal proceeding.section b of the flsa allows employees to bring collective actions to supplement the enforcement powers of the secretary of labor under the statute.see b providing that an employee rights under the subsection terminate upon the filing of a complaint by the secretary of labor see also kendall city of chesapeake,cir.that provision providing that employees may bring actions against their employers makes no mention of state wage and labor laws.in addition,the flsa includes an express savings clause,which provides no provision of this chapter shall excuse noncompliance with any federal or state law or municipal ordinance establishing a higher minimum wage or a shorter maximum work week.a.we agree with the amici who have filed briefs in this case that this language has the effect of preserving state and local regulations.we expect that it would normally be the case that a claim under any such state regulations would be part of the same constitutional case as the flsa claim,and thus that any such state claims would fall within the district court supplemental jurisdiction.see a.
there is ample evidence that a combined action is consistent with the regime congress has established in the flsa.the supreme court early decisions interpreting the flsa led to a great rush of litigation under the statute.see generally roche sperling.congress responded in the act of,stat,as amended,by both eliminating representative actions where employees would designate another to sue on their behalf and by adding the provision to the statute for collective actions brought by employees.the effect was to limit private flsa plaintiffs to employees who asserted claims in their own right and free employers of the burden of representative actions.roche,at.this action was designed to eliminate lawsuits initiated by third parties typically union leaders on behalf of a disinterested employee in other words,someone who would not otherwise have participated in the federal lawsuit.
outback complains that permitting a plaintiff who ends up in only the rule b class because she neither opted out of that class nor opted in to the flsa collective action to proceed as part of the class is in tension with the idea that disinterested parties were not supposed to take advantage of the flsa.but such a plaintiff is doing no such thing.she will not be entitled to a single flsa remedy,because she is not part of the flsa litigating group.the most that one can say is that her state claim has found its way into federal court under the court supplemental jurisdiction.but that is a complaint that could be brought in almost every claim that rests on section jurisdiction.in the case before us,the rule b class and the federal collective action are each comprised of a set of employees assertin
