an employer in california must immediately pay a terminated employee for all of his vested vacation time unless the union representing that employee has negotiated a collective bargaining agreement that otherwise provide s.labor code.we hold that a collective bargaining agreement otherwise provide s and thereby abrogates an employee statutory right under section to immediate payment for vested vacation time only if the agreement clearly and unmistakably waives that right.because the agreement in this case lacked this clarity,celite corporation celite was required to immediately pay terminated employees for all their vested vacation time.we nevertheless reverse the trial court judgment imposing waiting time penalties because celite nonpayment was not willful.
facts and procedural history 
celite mines and manufactures diatomaceous earth in lompoc,california.international chemical workers ufcw local c union represents celite employees.under the collective bargaining agreements in effect between and the agreements,celite granted its employees between one and five weeks of vacation annually.each january,celite calculated a yearly vacation allotment based on each employee length of employment and the number of hours they worked the year before.
under the agreements,employees terminated from celite were entitled to receive whatever vacation allotment is due them upon separation.for years,both celite and the union understood this provision to refer to the vacation allotment as defined above.accordingly,celite paid terminated employees for the vacation time already allotted to them for the year of their termination,but did not pay them the vacation time they had accrued toward the next year allotment.
howard choate choate,billy henry henry,and leroy stricklin stricklin collectively,plaintiffs worked for celite until they were laid off on march.celite immediately paid plaintiffs their vacation allotment for,but did not pay them for vacation time they had accrued toward january allotment between january and march.
plaintiffs thereafter filed a class action against celite seeking the pro rata portion of the january vacation allotment they had earned while employed between january and march,pursuant to section pro rata vacation time thirty days of salary,as waiting time penalties pursuant to section,because celite had willfully refused to pay them immediately for the pro rata vacation time and damages arising from these violations,which they allege violated the unfair competition law,business and professions code section 
the parties made for summary adjudication based on stipulated facts.the trial court denied summary adjudication of plaintiffs vacation pay and unfair competition claims.
the court granted summary adjudication to plaintiffs on their waiting time penalties claim.the court concluded that section obligated celite to pay plaintiffs for their pro rata vacation time immediately upon their termination unless the agreements otherwise provided.the court ruled that the agreements did not waive plaintiffs rights to the pro rata vacation time in clear and unmistakable terms.the court further determined that celite had acted willfully in refusing to pay plaintiffs because celite legal duty to do so was clear and because celite acted unreasonably in believing that the agreements implicit waiver of these rights was valid.the court also rejected celite argument that plaintiffs claims were preempted by the labor management relations act lmra.the court accordingly concluded that celite owed waiting time penalties.
plaintiffs dismissed their unpaid vacation claim because celite eventually paid them for the pro rata vacation time,and dismissed their unfair competition claim to expedite appellate review.the parties also stipulated to class certification for the waiting time penalties claim.the court subsequently entered judgment for plaintiffs.
discussion 
celite argues that it should not be held liable for waiting time penalties because it never owed plaintiffs the pro rata vacation time in the first place even if it did,it did not willfully refuse to pay plaintiffs because it reasonably believed the agreements had waived plaintiffs right to that pay and plaintiffs claims are preempted by the lmra in any event.
celite owed plaintiffs pro rata vacation time 
celite contends that the union waived plaintiffs statutory right under section to the pro rata vacation time.as evidence of this waiver,celite notes that the agreements discuss what vacation pay terminated employees are to receive and limit that pay to the vacation allotment for the year of termination and consistent with the agreements,celite had for decades paid terminated employees only the vacation allotment without any objection from the union.because section empowers a union to waive its members rights to vested vacation time by entering into a collective bargaining agreement that otherwise provide s,celite arguments present two questions for review how clearly must a waiver of rights under section be,and do the agreements here meet that standard we review both questions de novo.coito super.cal th,d,issues statutory construction reviewed de novo roybal governing bd.of salinas city elem.sch.th,d application of law to undisputed facts reviewed de novo.
a.a waiver of rights under section must be clearly and unmistakably stated in the collective bargaining agreement 
once an employer makes vacation pay a term of employment,section entitles terminated employees to immediate payment for any vested vacation time unless a collective bargaining agreement otherwise provide s,suastez plastic dress up cal d,suastez if employer does not offer vacation time,does not apply boothby atlas mechanical,th,d if employer caps vacation accrual,does not override that cap.the parties disagree on what our legislature meant when it required collective bargaining agreements to otherwise provide celite contends that a waiver of the right to payment under section may be inferred from the totality of the circumstances,while plaintiffs defend the trial court ruling that any waiver must be clearly and unmistakably stated in the collective bargaining agreement.we agree with the trial court that section requires any union waiver of its members statutory right to payment under section be made clearly and unmistakably.
three canons of statutory construction dictate this conclusion.first,we are required to construe statutes to avoid absurd consequences.in re greg cal th,d.as it stands now,a collective bargaining agreement validly waives a union member right to litigate federal or state claims in a judicial forum only if the waiver is clear and unmistakable.vasquez super.th,d vasquez under state law penn plaza pyett,d under federal law.the same is true for waivers of substantive rights conferred by federal statute metropolitan edison nlrb,d metropolitan edison and for waivers of public employee rights conferred by california statute oakland unified sch.dist.public employee relations bd.d.
against this backdrop,the totality of the circumstances standard proffered by celite leads to absurd results.because the totality of the circumstances standard looks to evidence such as mutual understanding and past practices beyond the collective bargaining agreement,this standard by definition empowers courts to infer a waiver when the agreement does not clearly and unmistakably memorialize one.consequently,the totality of the circumstances standard would make it easier for unions to waive their members substantive rights than members procedural right to litigate those substantive rights in a judicial forum easier to waive state statutory rights than federal statutory rights and easier to waive private sector employees rights than public employees rights.celite offers no justification for these and irrational outcomes.importantly,these outcomes are avoided entirely if the waiver of union members statutory rights under state law like the waivers of the other rights described above must be clear and unambiguous.
second,we construe ambiguities in labor statutes to be more rather than less protective of employees rights.kirby immoos fire protection
