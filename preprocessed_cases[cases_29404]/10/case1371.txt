plaintiffs,who are hourly employees of defendant federal express corporation,fedex,appeal the district court denial of class certification.they assert claims of breach of contract and unjust enrichment resulting from fedex failure to pay employees for all hours worked.the district court concluded that certification was improper primarily because individualized factual inquiries into whether and how long each employee worked without compensation would swamp any issues that were common to the class.the sole question before this court is whether the district court abused its discretion in declining to certify the class.we hold that the district court acted within the bounds of its discretion and affirm its decision.
background 
in what might be characterized as round two of their litigation against fedex for its compensation practices,plaintiffs allege that fedex has engaged in a pervasive and policy of failing to pay hourly employees for all time worked.previously,the district court denied certification of a nationwide class of fedex employees asserting substantially similar claims in clausnitzer federal express.plaintiffs subsequently brought this suit which attempts to address the defects identified in clausnitzer by limiting the scope of the class to florida employees,adding a claim for quantum meruit,and altering the theory of their breach of contract claim.
plaintiffs seek to certify a class defined as all employees of fedex paid on an hourly basis as nonexempt employees,who were employed in the state of florida,from the maximum time period preceding the filing of this complaint,as permitted by the statute of limitation,until such time as the class period closes.the class includes couriers,service agents,and any other employees who are,or were,required during the class period to punch in and out on a manual time clock,but were paid only from their scheduled start time to their scheduled end time.the class also includes employees who worked during unpaid breaks.
plaintiffs claim that fedex breached their contracts by failing to pay for three categories of time worked the interval between an employee manual punch in time and his scheduled start time the interval between an employee scheduled end time and his manual punch out time and the time worked during unpaid breaks.they also assert a claim for quantum meruit 
a.the contract 
plaintiffs claim that their employment relationship with fedex is governed by an express contract which requires fedex to pay for all time worked.this contract and its terms are allegedly embodied in several documents including a standard written agreement the agreement that every fedex employee signs during the employment application process as well as certain fedex employment manuals.the agreement contains a statement that all terms of my employment except to the extent covered specifically by this contract or any other valid contract between company and me shall be determined and governed by company policies and procedures manual as same may be amended from time to time hereafter 
fedex publishes or otherwise provides employees with a people manual and an employee handbook.both manuals state,it is the policy of fedex to compensate for all time worked in accordance with applicable state and federal law.in the people manual,the next sentence states,except for certain approved preliminary and activities,no employee should perform work off the clock for any reason,whether on their own initiative or at the request of management.each manual contains an express disclaimer that it is not a contract and its provisions should not be read or implied to provide for one furthermore,upon receipt of the employee handbook,each employee signed an acknowledgment that the handbook does not create a contract 
plaintiffs conceded at oral argument that under florida law the manuals do not themselves create a contract.rather,they argue that the agreement signed during the application process creates the contract and that the agreement expressly incorporates the manuals terms.fedex disputes the existence of any express employment contract.however,even if the agreement constitutes an employment contract,fedex contends that under florida law the terms in its policy manuals do not create any contractual rights.
timekeeping 
an understanding of plaintiffs claims requires an understanding of fedex procedures.fedex employs three methods of tracking time.first,employees track their time by entering various codes corresponding to different work activities into a computerized tracking device a tracker.employees manually enter into the trackers their scheduled start times and end times as well as the times at which they start and finish a break.the tracker data is transmitted to fedex payroll database and is used to calculate employee compensation.additionally,as a backup for the tracker data,employees manually write on a time card the time codes for each task,as well as the start and end time for that task.
fedex also requires employees to punch in and out on a manual punch clock before and after their shifts.until the trackers did not automatically time stamp the employees entries,so an employee who was supposed to commence work at but arrived for work at could hide his tardiness by entering an start time into the tracker.thus,fedex claims that the manual punch records were simply used to verify the integrity of time entries that employees entered into the trackers.fedex paid its employees only for the time between the scheduled start and end times as entered into the trackers,which did not necessarily coincide with employees manual punch in and punch out times.the periods of time between the times entered into the tracker and the punch times are referred to as gap periods.thus,if an employee punched in at but entered a start time of into the tracker,there would be a fifteen minute gap period for which the employee would not be paid.additionally,fedex required employees to take an unpaid break the break period during the day,but plaintiffs claim that employees frequently worked during their breaks.plaintiffs seek compensation for work that they performed during gap periods and break periods.
gap periods 
plaintiffs allege that fedex structures employees workloads such that it is usually impossible for its hourly employees to perform all necessary tasks during their scheduled shifts.thus,they argue,fedex requires employees to perform certain work activities during the gap periods.these activities vary according to the job function of the particular employee but include retrieving the tracker and keys to the truck,gathering equipment and supplies,finishing paperwork,and completing closing procedures.for example,plaintiff kenny bosley stated that he spent time gathering his equipment and preparing to work his route during the gap periods.during gap periods,he stated that he performed unpaid duties including logging off from the tracker system,punching out on the time clock,and other unspecified end of day duties.plaintiff larry horton stated that the work he performed during gap periods included getting equipment,truck keys,going to the truck,participating in a meeting if a meeting was scheduled,and other kinds of activities furthermore,plaintiffs allege that from the moment they punched in to the moment they punched out,hourly employees were under the control of fedex,and,if asked to perform a task,they had to do so.
fedex has submitted evidence that employees punched in at different times and for different reasons.for example,one employee stated that she arrived early to avoid traffic or because she had to drop her child off at school.another employee arrived early simply because he did like to rush.after manually punching in,some employees drank coffee,chatted with their,talked on their phones,or simply relaxed.fedex claims,and certain plaintiffs have confirmed,that there was no policy requiring employees to manually punch in until their scheduled start time.as for the gap period,fedex claims that employees who remained punched in after their scheduled stop time did so for a variety of reasons.for example,one employee stated that during the gap period he may have stop ped to talk to coworkers but did not expect to be paid for this time because he was not working.
fedex claims that published policies and procedures established that employees would be paid based on scheduled start and end times,not manual punch times.it has submitted evidence that employees,including plaintiff bosley,understood that they would be paid based on the times entered into the trackers.bosley also stated that he was never directed by fedex managers to work nor did he know of any fedex managers who were aware that he had worked.fedex alleges that if it ever required employees to work outside their scheduled shifts,then the employees were paid for such time.
both parties submitted statistical analysis of fedex time data.plaintiffs expert,richard drogin,studied data that had been obtained from fedex in the previous clausnitzer nationwide class action.he compared tracker data to manual punch records and concluded that employees,on average,had minutes of gap time per shift.fedex expert,michael ward,found that for the gap period,the median amount of time was minutes and the average amount of time was minutes.for the gap period,ward found the median time to be minutes and the average to be minutes.
break periods 
plaintiffs assert that employees regularly worked without compensation during their break periods and that fedex knew or should have known that this was occurring.plaintiffs babineau,bosley,and horton stated that they worked during unpaid breaks,and plaintiffs have submitted declarations from other employees indicating that they regularly worked during breaks.plaintiffs claim that such work can be proven by analyzing tracker records.in addition to recording employees break times entered manually by each employee,trackers are also used to scan packages as they move through the delivery process.these package scans,unlike break time entries,are automatically stamped by the tracker internal clock.thus,plaintiffs claim that determining whether an employee worked during his break is as simple as comparing the break times to package scan times to see if packages were delivered or during the times that an employee entered for his break.
fedex responds that the tracker data are insufficient to prove the existence or extent of work performed during breaks.it argues that the tracker records may not accurately reflect the times at which breaks occurred because employees frequently input their break times into the tracker at the end of the day relying on faulty memories and estimations as to when they actually took their break,employees may have inadvertently created an overlap between the break period they entered into the tracker and the package scan times.to support this assertion,fedex notes that some employees testified that they did not work during their breaks even though their tracker records reflect package scans during breaks.furthermore,while the data show the number of package scans that may have occurred during a recorded break period,they do not show the duration of the work related to those scans.
fedex also argues that if employees did perform work during their breaks,they did so in violation of fedex policies.fedex employee handbook states,employees are not expected to or allowed to work during their meal breaks.fedex points to employee declarations that they did not work during unpaid breaks and that they understood that such work was prohibited by fedex policy.fedex contends that if exigencies requiring an employee to work during a break ever arose,the employee could have obtained approval to work and would have been paid for that work.for example,plaintiff bosley testified that,on occasion,he sought and received management approval to work in lieu of taking a break and that he was paid for his time.on other occasions,he did not obtain approval and therefore did not work during the break.
as to the frequency of interrupted breaks,the parties again present competing expert analyses.plaintiffs expert drogin conducted a study and concluded that package scans occurred during of unpaid breaks.defense expert ward analyzed tracker data and arrived at a rate after excluding scans occurring in the first or last minute of the break period.he also found that a small minority of employees accounted for almost half of the interrupted breaks.

iii.class certification standards 
to obtain class certification under rule,the plaintiffs must meet each of the requirements specified in rule a,as well as at least one of the three subsections of rule b.klay,at.rule a requires plaintiffs to demonstrate that the proposed class satisfies the prerequisites of numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation.valley drug geneva,cir citation omitted.a.plaintiffs seek class certification under rule b.to certify a rule b class,the plaintiffs must demonstrate that questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members predominance and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy superiority.b vega,cir.alternatively,plaintiffs seek certification under rule b a which requires them to show that prosecuting separate actions would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications that would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class.b a.
although the trial court should not determine the merits of the plaintiffs claim at the class certification stage,the trial court can and should consider the merits of the case to the degree necessary to determine whether the requirements of rule will be satisfied.valley drug,at citing.of the southwest falcon,d see also vega,at.it is inescapable that in some cases there will be overlap between the demands of rule a and b and the question of whether a plaintiff can succeed on the merits.huff cass of,cir en banc thus,the principle that district courts should not evaluate the merits of plaintiffs claims should not be talismanically invoked to artific i ally limit a trial court examination of the factors necessary to a reasoned determination of whether a plaintiff has met her burden of establishing each of the rule class action requirements.love turlington,cir see also coopers lybrand livesay,d t he class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff cause of action.the more complex determinations required in rule b class actions entail even greater entanglement with the merits.emphasis and citations omitted.while we avoid merits determinations to the extent practicable,this case does require the court to look beyond the pleadings and examine the parties claims,defenses,and evidence to ensure that class certification would comport with rule standards.
iv.discussion 
while the rule a requirements of numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation must be considered in any class certification decision,the district court assumed for argument sake that plaintiffs had satisfied these requirements.because the propriety of certification hinges on other factors,we accept this assumption and focus on whether certification would comport with rule b.we first evaluate the district court denial of rule b certification of plaintiffs breach of contract and quantum meruit claims.we then consider the denial of certification under rule b a.
the district court concluded that class certification was improper under rule b.to obtain rule b class certification the issues in the class action that are subject to generalized proof and thus applicable to the class as a whole,must predominate over those issues that are subject only to individualized proof.kerr city of west palm beach,cir quotations and citation omitted.common issues of fact and law predominate if they ha ve a direct impact on every class member effort to establish liability and on every class member entitlement to injunctive and monetary relief.klay,at quoting ingram.on the other hand,common issues will not predominate over individual questions if,as a practical matter,the resolution of an overarching common issue breaks down into an unmanageable variety of individual legal and factual issues.andrews am,cir.certification is inappropriate if the plaintiffs must still introduce a great deal of individualized proof or argue a number of individualized legal points to establish most or all of the elements of their individual claims.klay,at citing perez metabolife int l.the predominance inquiry requires an examination of the claims,defenses,relevant facts,and applicable substantive law,to assess the degree to which resolution of the classwide issues will further each individual class member claim against the defendant.id.at quoting castano am.tobacco,cir.
the district court concluded that predominance was not satisfied because adjudication of plaintiffs claims on a class basis would be swamped by individual factual inquiries into the activities of each employee during the gap periods or during breaks.as the gap periods and the break periods raise different issues,we examine the claims for each of these periods in turn.
gap periods 
the district court concluded that individualized proof would be required to determine whether employees were actually working during the gap periods.in reaching this conclusion,it quoted the reasoning of its prior order in clausnitzer,in which it denied certification for a nationwide class.
with respect to gap period work,there are innumerable reasons why an employee may have arrived at the fedex facility early on any given day.while those reasons may in fact relate to completing work,they may also relate to a plethora of activities such as socializing,checking,beating traffic.likewise,the end of day gap periods may also have been the result of employees staying late at the facility to engage in related activities.fedex has offered statements and testimony of a number of employees who have provided such plausible explanations for what occurred during the gap periods.the statistical evidence proffered by plaintiffs does not account for time spent doing activities other than work and can not alone establish that work was performed.permitting these claims to proceed as a class action would deprive fedex of the ability to explore whether an individual employee was engaged in activities during the gap period and would thus limit fedex ability to properly defend the claims.
babineau federal express,slip op.at.quoting clausnitzer,at.
the district court also relied on the strikingly similar case of cornn united parcel service,wl,unpublished,in which plaintiffs made virtually identical claims against fedex competitor,united parcel service ups.there,the plaintiffs alleged that ups did not pay its hourly employees for the time period between punching in and their scheduled start time.id.at.ups presented evidence that employees arrived at different times and often performed a variety of related activities during the gap time,that it had no policy requiring employees to regularly come in prior to their scheduled start times,that it instructed employees not to work prior to their scheduled start times,and that it had paid employees on those occasions where they were required to work outside their scheduled shift.id.at.the cornn court denied class certification on the basis that it could not determine whether a driver performed work during the interval in question without undertaking individualized inquiries that predominate over common questions id.at.
here,the district court reasonably concluded that punch clock records do not provide common proof of any uncompensated work during gap in light of employee testimony regarding the various activities that took place during the gap periods and the various personal reasons that employees listed for coming in early and staying late furthermore,assuming the existence of a contract,the district court acknowledged that fedex may mount an individualized defense that an employee knew of fedex policy prohibiting work and chose to engage in it anyhow in breach of that contract.see babineau,slip op.at citing basco stores,whether employee knew of policy prohibiting work and chose to engage in it anyhow was individualized issue that precluded class certification in breach of employment contract action.
in an attempt to circumvent these individualized issues,plaintiffs assert an alternative theory of their case based on the employment manual provision that fedex will pay its employees for all time worked in accordance with applicable state and federal law.under plaintiffs theory,fedex must pay for all hours worked as that term is defined by federal law,specifically the fair labor standards act flsa and related federal regulations.those regulations state that hours worked includes i n general all periods in which the employee is suffered or permitted to work whether or not required to do so and time given by the employee to the employer even though part of the time may be spent in idleness.thus,according to plaintiffs,it matters not whether an employee was drinking coffee,socializing,or checking his during the gap periods instead of performing activities.rather,an employee is suffered or permitted to work from the moment he punches in,because from that moment hourly employees are under the control of fedex.moreover,under this theory,the fedex policy prohibiting work could not be asserted as an individualized defense,because employees were as soon as they punched in.plaintiffs assert that all individualized issues vanish when the flsa is incorporated into the contract.
the district court was not persuaded that fedex policies and procedures manuals incorporated flsa regulations,reasoning that the regulations were designed to govern minimum wage and overtime to control the terms of employment contracts.however,even assuming that these regulations were incorporated into the alleged contract via the employment manuals,the district court noted that individualized issues might remain.
fedex has highlighted such issues.if the flsa regulations are applicable,then plaintiffs may not only those regulations that work in their favor.another flsa regulation,a,specifically governs situations in which employees punch in early or punch out late.it states in those cases where time clocks are used,employees who voluntarily come in before their regular starting time or remain after their closing time,do not have to be paid for such periods provided,of course,that they do not engage in any work.their early or late clock punching may be disregarded.a.pursuant to this regulation,it would appear that the court would still have to conduct individualized inquiries into whether each employee voluntarily arrived early or stayed late and whether he engaged in any work.
plaintiffs respond that it is a common question of fact as to whether fedex had a policy requiring employees to arrive early or stay late in order to perform tasks without compensation.specifically,they claim that fedex had established unrealistic expectations for its employees which required them to work outside their scheduled shifts in order to complete their assigned tasks.proving the existence of such a policy,they claim,would establish breach of contract liability on a basis.however,we have in the past held that proving the existence of a general policy may not be sufficient to establish that a defendant is liable to individual class members.see klay,at finding that common issues did not predominate in breach of contract class action where allegations of defendants policy to underpay doctors were at best,merely circumstantial evidence tangential
