between and,many online internet advertisers used google,google adwords program,an program through which advertisers would bid for google to place their advertisements on websites.pulaski middleman,llc and several other named plaintiffs pulaski brought this putative class action under california unfair competition and fair advertising laws,alleging that google misled them as to the types of websites on which their advertisements could appear.the putative class initially sought injunctive and restitutionary relief.after google changed certain features of the adwords program,pulaski,upon filing a third amended consolidated class action complaint,abandoned the claim for injunctive relief.the only relief the putative class now seeks is the equitable remedy of restitution.
pulaski appeals the district court denial of class certification.the district court held that on the claim for restitution,common questions did not predominate over questions affecting individual class members.in denying certification,the court reasoned that it was not bound by our decision in yokoyama midland national life insurance,cir.it then explained that determining which class members are entitled to restitution and what amount each class member should receive would require individual inquiries that permeate the class claims.
pulaski argues that the district court erred in failing to follow yokoyama.as explained below,we agree.we therefore reverse the denial of class certification and remand for further proceedings.
background 
this case concerns google adwords program,an program through which google served as an intermediary between website hosts and advertisers.through adwords,internet advertisers provided advertisements to google and its third party partners.to participate,advertisers entered variables into the adwords interface on google website,including the maximum price per ad they would be willing to pay and their overall budget.they also selected which categories of websites they wanted to display the ad.afterwards,using an algorithm,adwords determined the online placement and price of the ad.thus,during the class period,advertisers did not know in advance exactly where their ads would appear.
advertisers paid a particular price to google each time an internet user clicked on their displayed ad.the price of a particular click depended on several factors the maximum bids of other adwords customers for clicks based on the same search term,a quality score of the advertisement,and a smart pricing discount applied to the website where the ad had been placed.google created and instituted smart pricing,an price adjustment,to adjust the advertiser bids to the same levels that a rational advertiser would bid if the rational advertiser had sufficient data about the performance of ads on each website.smart pricing is a ratio calculated by dividing the conversion for the website by the conversion rate for the same ad.
there are several categories of websites in play.during the class period,an advertiser using adwords could request that its ads appear on search feed sites,content network sites,or both.search feed sites display adwords ads along with search results after a user searches for information using a particular search term.after entering a particular term,a user would be presented with both ordinary search results and ads related to the search term.content network websites,on the other hand,are full content sites,that publish information independent of search results.ads would appear on these sites if the ad keywords matched those of the website.
there are other categories of sites that did not appear in the adwords registration process parked domains and error pages.parked domain pages are undeveloped domains whose pages appear when users type generic terms into a web browser.these are pages of ads without content.error pages appear when a person inputs an unregistered web address,or something other than a web address,into a web browser address bar.typing this information into an address bar used to result in error messages,but during the class period inputting this information resulted in error pages that offered ads.even though only search feed and content network websites were listed in the adwords registration process,adwords ads appeared on both parked domains and error pages.
pulaski alleges that google misled advertisers,violating california unfair competition law ucl,cal bus.et and california fair advertising law fal,et,by failing to disclose the placement of adwords ads on parked domains and error pages.the putative class consists of a ll persons or entities located within the united states who,from july,through march,had an adwords account with google and were charged for clicks on advertisements appearing on parked domain error page websites,with exclusions pulaski,on behalf of the putative class,seeks restitution of moneys google wrongfully obtained from the putative class.
pulaski moved for class certification pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure rule for a rule b class.pulaski proposed three different methods for calculating restitution,all of which were based on a but for or loss calculation the difference between what advertisers actually paid and what they would have paid had google informed them that their ads were being placed on parked domains and error pages.the first approach is based on google smart pricing formula as described above.the amount of restitution owed a class member would be the difference between the amount the advertiser actually paid and the amount paid reduced by the smart pricing discount ratio.the second method is the content pricing approach which factors in the lower bidding that would have occurred had advertisers been allowed to bid separately on parked domains and error pages.search feed clicks were priced higher than content network clicks,which in turn were considered more desirable than parked domains and error pages.accordingly,where the same ad appeared both in the search feed and on content network websites,those content network ad prices could serve as a conservative price for search feed clicks on parked domains and error pages.the third method is the full refund approach,in which advertisers would receive full refunds for clicks on ads placed on parked domains and error pages.because some methods may work better than others for certain subsets of class members,pulaski presented these methods as possibly complementary.
in ruling on the class certification motion,the district court initially found that the proposed class satisfied all of the criteria under rule a numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequate representation.the court next turned to the predominance inquiry under rule b.on that issue,it found that,even assuming the plaintiff class could prevail on liability,common questions did not predominate on the issues of entitlement to restitution and amount of restitution due each class member.
first,the court expressed concern that individual questions may arise in ascertaining entitlement to restitution.it observed that the question of which advertisers among the hundreds of thousands of proposed class members are even entitled to restitution would require individual inquiries.in particular,the court was concerned with how to systematic ally identify and exclude from plaintiffs proposed class the many advertisers who have no legal claim to restitution because they derived direct economic benefits from ads placed on parked domains and error pages.
second,the court identified individual questions that would arise in determining the amount of restitution owed to the class and individual class members.the court explained that our decision in yokoyama,which held that damages calculations alone can not defeat class certification,did not control the outcome of this issue because yokoyama cited to decisions that mentioned a workable method for calculating monetary recovery.here,the court held that the plaintiffs had not proposed a method that was workable.the court explained that different costs for each advertiser,each ad,and each click,overlaid with an auction process,make it more difficult to calculate what adwords customers would have paid but for the alleged misstatements or omissions.it concluded that pulaski proposed methods were insufficient to account for all of the intricacies involved,including benefits received from parked domain and error pages.
concluding that individual questions predominated on the issue of restitution,the court denied pulaski motion for class certification without addressing whether class treatment was a superior method for resolving the dispute as required by rule b.thereafter,pulaski filed a motion for reconsideration,which the district court denied.

ii.standard of review 
a district court class certification ruling is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see parra bashas,cir.a district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.united states.hinkson,cir en banc quoting cooter gell hartmarx.w hen an appellant raises the argument that the district court premised a class certification determination on an error of law,our first task is to evaluate whether such legal error occurred.yokoyama,at.if the district court determination was premised on a legal error,we will find a per se abuse of discretion.id.otherwise,we will proceed to review the district court class certification decision for abuse of discretion as we have always done.id.
iii.discussion 
to obtain certification,a putative class must satisfy four prerequisites 
the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable there are questions of law or fact common to the class the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.
rule a.additionally,the proposed class must qualify as one of the types of class actions identified in rule b.here,pulaski sought to certify a class under rule b.under rule b,the court must find that questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.
pulaski must affirmatively demonstrate compliance with the rule.wal mart stores,dukes.the question of certification requires a rigorous analysis.id.courts may have to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question.id.
the district court denied certification because it found that the putative class did not meet the predominance requirement.it explained that questions regarding which advertisers are entitled to restitution in the first instance,and the amount of restitution owed to each advertiser,both defeat predominance.we disagree.
entitlement to restitution is a separate inquiry from the amount of restitution owed under california ucl and fal.to the extent that the district court rested its holding that common questions do not predominate on the putative class entitlement to restitution,it committed legal error.
the ucl prohibits any unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent business act or practice.the fal prohibits untrue or misleading statements in the course of business.this language is broad and sweeping to protect both consumers and competitors by promoting fair competition in commercial markets for goods and services.kwikset,cal th.
to state a claim under the ucl or the fal based on false advertising or promotional practices,it is necessary only to show that members of the public are likely to be deceived.in re tobacco ii cases,cal th,see also stearns ticketmaster,cir holding that a district court erred in denying class certification by requiring individualized proof of reliance and causation,and remanding in light of in re tobacco ii cases,cert.denied.this inquiry does not require individualized proof of deception,reliance and injury.in re tobacco ii cases,cal th at stearns,at same.i n effect,california has created what amounts to a conclusive presumption that when a defendant puts out tainted bait and a person sees it and bites,the defendant has caused an injury restitution is the remedy.stearns,at 
under the ucl 
any person who engages,has engaged,or proposes to engage in unfair competition may be enjoined in any court of competent jurisdiction.the court may make such orders or judgments,including the appointment of a receiver,as may be necessary to prevent the use or employment by any person of any practice which constitutes unfair competition,as defined in this chapter,or as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property,real or personal,which may have been acquired by means of such unfair competition.
this language,as well as nearly identical language under the fal,see,grants a court discretion to order restitution.cortez purolator air filtration prods,cal th.
thus,a court need not make individual determinations regarding entitlement to restitution.instead,restitution is available on a classwide basis once the class representative makes the threshold showing of liability under the ucl and fal.accordingly,the district court erred in holding that such individual questions would predominate.
we held in yokoyama that damage calculations alone can not defeat certification.at.by concluding that it was not bound by yokoyama under the circumstances presented in this case,the district court erred.
yokoyama concerned the hawaii deceptive practices act,haw.stat.we concluded that the district court erred when it held that this law required individualized showings of reliance because hawaii courts caselaw look ed to a reasonable consumer,not the particular consumer.id.at.as we noted,the case,at the liability stage,would not require the to parse what oral representations each broker made to each plaintiff.id.at.rather,the liability portion would be uniform,as it will focus on the standardized written material given to all plaintiffs to determine whether those materials are likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.id.because it committed legal error,its denial of class certification was a p er s e a buse of d iscretion.id.
the district court in yokoyama also erroneously concluded that the damages calculation involved highly individualized and determinations,a conclusion to which the district court premise of subjective reliance may have contributed.id.in examining predominance for class certification purposes,the district court had considered factors such as 
the financial circumstances and objectives of each class member their ages the indexed annuity product iap selected any changes in the fixed interest rate for that particular iap the performance of the selected index any changes in the index margin for that particular iap any cap on the indexed interest the length of the surrender periods whether the individual had undertaken or wanted to undertake an early withdrawal of funds any benefit the individual policy holder derived from the form of the annuity itself,including the of credited interest and the actual rate of return on the iap.
id.at.we held that,even though all these variables impacted damages calculations,the individualized calculations did not defeat predominance.id.at see also stearns,at we have held that the mere fact that there might be differences in damage calculations is not sufficient to defeat class certification.citing yokoyama.
google argues that comcast behrend,called yokoyama holding into question.there,in analyzing a putative antitrust class,the court held that the plaintiffs proposed damages model fell far short of establishing that damages are capable of measurement on a classwide basis.id.at.the district and circuit courts had failed to inquire into whether the model translated the legal theory of the harmful event into an analysis of the economic impact of that event.id.at emphasis omitted.the court reasoned that a model purporting to serve as evidence of damages in a class action must me
