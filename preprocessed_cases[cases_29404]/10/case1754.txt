discussion 
standard of review 
we review the trial court ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings de novo and decide independently whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action,accepting the allegations as true and liberally construed in plaintiff favor.see shea homes limited partnership.county of alameda th,d heredia farmers ins.exchange d.
aron has standing to file a complaint under the ucl and the clra.
to have standing to assert a claim under the ucl,a plaintiff must have suffered injury in fact and have lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition.bus,see also californians for disability rights mervyn,llc cal th,d,holding that proposition applies to pending cases.to have standing to assert a claim under the clra,a plaintiff must have suffer ed any damage as a result of the practice declared to be unlawful,subd.a.
aron alleges injury in fact in that he suffered economic loss by being required to purchase excess fuel,because there was no accurate measuring device to determine the actual amount required to return the truck at its rental fuel level.therefore,the only way to avoid the imposition of charge was to overfill the fuel tank.he further alleges that the use of the fuel gauge as the instrument of measurement is neither accurate nor in accordance with california law regarding weights and measurements.because the allegations set forth a basis for a claim of actual economic injury as a result of an unfair and illegal business practice,aron has standing.
is not protected by the safe harbor provision of section,subdivision n 
asserts that the legislature has expressly authorized its challenged practices.it relies on section,subdivision n,which provides a rental company may charge for an item or service provided in connection with a particular rental transaction if the renter could have avoided incurring the charge by choosing not to obtain or utilize the optional item or service.items and services for which the rental company may impose an additional charge,include charges for refueling the vehicle at the conclusion of the rental transaction in the event the renter did not return the vehicle with as much fuel as was in the fuel tank at the beginning of the rental.asserts that this section both applies to it,and provides a safe harbor for its practices is incorrect.
the scope of the ucl is broad,as it defines unfair competition to include any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.bus.t he legislature intended by this sweeping language to permit tribunals to enjoin wrongful business conduct in whatever context such activity might occur.indeed the section was intentionally framed in its broad,sweeping language,precisely to enable judicial tribunals to deal with the innumerable new schemes which the fertility of man invention would contrive.citation.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.however,although the ucl is broadly written to permit courts to restrain dishonest or unfair business dealings,its scope is not unlimited.courts may not simply impose their own notions of the day as to what is fair or unfair.specific legislation may limit the judiciary power to declare conduct unfair.if the legislature has permitted certain conduct or considered a situation and concluded no action should lie,courts may not override that determination.when specific legislation provides a safe harbor,plaintiffs may not use the general unfair competition law to assault that harbor.id.at,d.
