facts and proceedings below 
a.the carter and fahmie actions 
on december,ten individuals led by saundra carter filed a class action complaint against the city of los angeles for violations of the unruh civil rights act and disabled persons act,alleging city sidewalks lacked wheelchair ramps or cutouts.in their first amended complaint,which is operative,the carter plaintiffs sought injunctive relief and minimum statutory damages of per violation of civil code sections and.
on december,nicole fahmie filed a class action complaint against the city of los angeles for violations of the unruh civil rights act and disabled persons act,alleging,among other things,that city curbs lack ramps or cutouts.fahmie sought injunctive relief,compensatory damages and trebled damages.
neither the carter nor fahmie action alleged federal claims under the ada or section.the actions were eventually consolidated.
b.the willits action 
on august,mark willits,a quadriplegic,judy griffin,who has muscular dystrophy,and brent pilgreen,also a quadriplegic,all of whom use motorized wheelchairs for mobility,and communities actively living independent and free,an independent living center plaintiffs,filed a representative action against the city of los angeles and its mayor and council members in federal court alleging causes of action pursuant to the ada,section,the unruh civil rights act and the california disabled persons act.the willits action.the federal plaintiffs alleged the city systemically and pervasively discriminated against persons with mobility disabilities by denying them meaningful access to the city curb ramps,sidewalks,crosswalks,pedestrian crossings,and other walkways.they sought declaratory relief,preliminary and permanent injunctions for the class,and,on behalf of willits,griffin and pilgreen individually,monetary damages 
on december,the district court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the federal plaintiffs state law claims in the willits action,and dismissed them,and also dismissed all individual defendants,leaving only the city of los angeles as a defendant.the court then refused to dismiss plaintiffs claims under the ada and rehabilitation act,characterizing them as claims for only equitable remedies under the ada,such as injunctive relief.the record does not disclose why the federal plaintiffs damages claims were stricken.willits city of los angeles,no.cv cbm dist.court,central district.
on january,the district court certified a representative class defined as follows all persons with mobility disabilities who have been denied access to pedestrian rights of way in the city of los angeles as a result of defendants sic policies and practices with regard to its pedestrian rights of way and disability access.the class is certified for injunctive and declaratory relief only.the class claims are count i alleging violations of the ada and count ii alleging violations of the rehabilitation act of plaintiffs complaint.the court waived notice of certification to the class members.
carter and fahmie settlement 
in april,the carter and fahmie actions settled.the settlement class was defined as all persons with any disability who at any time prior to april,through the term of the settlement years accessed or attempted to access a city sidewalk but were impeded by lack of a curb ramp or curb cut.
pursuant to the settlement agreement,the city of los angeles agreed to install up to curb ramps in the first year after settlement,at a cost of up to million.after the first year,the city agreed to spend up to million per year remediating curbs,contingent on the availability of certain types of funds,and to complete remediation,without limit as to cost,as to every curb identified as being in a transition area,which was defined as comprising major commercial corridors,bus routes,and public buildings.the city agreed to conduct a citywide survey to assess curb locations requiring remediation,form an advisory committee to evaluate and make recommendations to the city about future curb appropriations,and periodically report to class counsel regarding settlement implementation status,with ongoing court jurisdiction.
plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against the city for injunctive or declaratory relief or statutory damages but not compensatory damages that are based on conduct or conditions preceding entry of judgment.this would include release of appellants federal claims and state law damages claims.
the settlement agreement provided that the settlement class would be certified in accordance standards applicable under the federal rules of civil procedure,rule b rule b,and that no class member would be permitted to opt out.the agreement further provided that notice of the settlement would be made by distribution to ten organizations serving disabled persons and by publication.
objections to the settlement and final approval 
prior to the hearing on final approval,individual class members objected to the settlement.their main objection was that the settlement set no mandatory minimum city expenditure,instead making expenditure contingent on future tax revenue availability,did not require that enough curb cut or ramps be installed,and set no date for full compliance with disability access laws.objectors also argued the settlement gave class members no money payments and no ability to opt out to seek statutory damages in another forum.
on january,the trial court issued a page order granting final approval of the settlement.in the order the court outlined settlement terms,found them to be reasonable,and addressed the objectors arguments.as to objectors arguments that the settlement was meager and inadequate,the court reviewed the city obligations under the settlement,finding them to be substantial,and noted that it would be a risky and time consuming proposition for class representatives to pursue litigation to obtain a better result.regarding the non provision,the court stated the settlement was equitable and not for a money judgment,so t he requirement that class members be permitted to opt out does not apply.the court also said,statutory damages are a long shot and the right to them highly questionable because no california court has considered a municipal entity to be liable under the unruh civil rights act or the disabled persons act,and none likely would.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
general class action principles and standard of review 
under section of the code of civil procedure,a class action is authorized when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court.drawing on the language of code of civil procedure section and federal precedent,our supreme court has articulated clear requirements for the certification of a class.the party advocating class treatment must demonstrate the existence of an ascertainable and sufficiently numerous class,a community of interest,and substantial benefits from certification that render proceeding as a class superior to the alternatives.brinker restaurant superior court cal th,sav on drug stores,superior court cal th,sav on.
the purpose of the ascertainability question is to give notice to putative class members as to whom the judgment in the action will be res judicata so they will have an opportunity to opt out of the class.bufil dollar financial group,th.the doctrine of res judicata rests upon the ground that the party to be affected,or some other with whom he is in privity,has litigated,or had an opportunity to litigate the same matter in a former action in a court of competent jurisdiction,and should not be permitted to litigate it again to the harassment and vexation of his opponent.public policy and the interest of litigants alike require that there be an end to litigation.citizens for open access.tide,seadrift th.r es judicata benefits both the parties and the courts because it seeks to curtail multiple litigation causing vexation and expense to the parties and wasted effort and expense in judicial administration.mycogen monsanto cal th.after the members of the class have been properly notified of the action,they are required to decide whether to remain members of the class represented by plaintiffs counsel and become bound by a favorable or unfavorable judgment in the action,whether to intervene in the action through counsel of their own choosing,or whether to opt out of the action and pursue their own independent remedies,such as negotiation with defendants,initiation of their own action,or intervention in some other action.home sav.loan superior court d,accord,weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group.the critical reason for notification of members of the class on whose behalf a class action has been brought is that notification makes possible a binding adjudication and an enforceable judgment with respect to the rights of the members of the class.absent such notification no member of the class need be bound by the result of the litigation.home sav.loan,supra,at.

approval of class action settlements 
the parties agree that the trial court ruling is subject to an abuse of discretion standard of review.w hether a settlement was fair and reasonable,whether notice to the class was adequate,whether certification of the class was proper,and whether the attorney fee award was proper are matters addressed to the trial court broad discretion.wershba apple computer,th,citing dunk ford motor th dunk.a reviewing court has characterized appellate review of class action settlements as gross at best and,given that so many imponderables enter into the evaluation of a settlement citation,an abuse of discretion standard is singularly appropriate.eleven owners for fair franchising southland th.
when class certification is deferred to the settlement stage,a more careful scrutiny of the fairness of the settlement is required.the fairness of a settlement of a legal dispute is like the adequacy of the consideration supporting a contractual promise a matter best left to negotiation between the parties.a settlement is a contract,and normally the test for the fairness of a contract is strictly procedural were the parties competent adults duly apprised of the basic facts relating to their transaction the problem in the setting,and the reason that judicial approval of the settlement of such an action is required,citation,is that the negotiator on the plaintiffs side,that is,the lawyer for the class,is potentially an unreliable agent of his principals.mars steel continental illinois bank trust cir.this makes it imperative that the district judge conduct a careful inquiry into the fairness of a settlement to the class members before allowing it to go into effect and extinguish,by the operation of res judicata,the claims of the class members who do not opt out of the settlement.ibid.the inquiry must be especially careful and penetrating in a case such as this where class certification is deferred to the settlement stage.ibid.but because so many imponderables enter into the evaluation of a settlement,we continue to review the trial court decision to approve a settlement in such a case under the abuse of discretion standard.
upon certification of a class the court must make an order determining whether notice to class members is necessary and whether class members may exclude themselves from the action.cal.rules of court,rule,subd.c.approval of a class action settlement requires the trial court preliminary approval of the proposed settlement dissemination of notice to class members,if necessary,informing them of the proposed settlement and their right to object to the action and a final fairness hearing where class members may be heard regarding the fairness,adequacy and reasonableness of the settlement.cal.rules of court,rule,subds.d g.to approve the settlement,the court must determine that the agreement is not the product of fraud or overreaching by,or collusion between,the negotiating parties,and that the settlement,taken as a whole,is fair,reasonable and adequate to all concerned.dunk,supra,th at.

c.the settlement was fair 
appellants argue the trial court lacked basic information to determine the range of plaintiffs potential recovery at trial,and the carter fahmie settlement is unfair because it guarantees funding for installation of only curb ramps during the first year of the settlement and makes curb remediation in years two through of the settlement contingent on availability of funds.appellants argue curb ramps constitutes less than one percent of the city own estimate of curb ramps it needs to install to comply with title ii of the ada.the arguments are without merit.
the record discloses that the settlement was a product of extensive research and investigation of the conditions of curbs in los angeles.the settlement judge and trial court were well aware of the state of los angeles curbs and had the added benefit of objectors presentation on that topic at the fairness hearing.the city estimate that curb ramps need to be installed to comply with the ada was made in a memorandum no evidence suggests this number is current.on the contrary,respondents presented evidence that the city has required private property owners to construct or repair curb cuts when performing construction and has itself constructed at least curb cuts since the late.in addition,the settlement agreement calls for a comprehensive survey of los angeles city streets to determine where curb cuts are needed.
furthermore,we would be in no position to overrule the trial court determination that installation of curb cuts in the first year of settlement is reasonable even if substantial research on the issue had been lacking.appellants acknowledge the city has no obligation to install a curb cut on every corner.under title ii of the ada,the standard for compliance is program access,that is,when viewed in its entirety,the city system of sidewalks and pedestrian walkways must be readily accessible to and useable by individuals with disabilities.a a,subd.b.the number of curb cuts to be installed in the first year of settlement is significant,and when we consider that the curbs first remediated will be those chosen by class members themselves,and will therefore presumably address members most immediate and pressing concerns,the possibly small proportion of initial fixes fades in importance.
we also agree with the trial court that the contingent funding provisions covering years two through of the settlement are facially reasonable.when a city has constructed curb ramps where necessary to provide access along routes,has allocated funding and established a schedule for future curb ramp construction,and is addressing the particular intersections identified by plaintiffs as well as other intersections in accordance with ada priorities,it is in compliance with its title ii obligations.schonfeld city of carlsbad.
appellants argue the settlement guarantees less curb ramp installation than the city is already performing,as evidenced by a bureau of street services report that the city installs from to per year.whether a settlement requires more or less performance than a defendant is already providing voluntarily is irrelevant to whether the settlement is fair.the question is how many curbs will be guaranteed under the settlement,not how many were installed last year or how many the city intends to install voluntarily next year.that the city may not be obligated under the settlement to do more than it would do on its own goes to the value of the settlement to the city,not its fairness to plaintiffs.
appellants argue the trial court improperly devalued their claims when it expressed doubt that the city pedestrian rights of way and curb ramps were covered by title ii of the ada or could be the subject of a private right of action.the point is irrelevant,as the reasonableness of the settlement stands on its own,independent of any concept of claim valuation.
we further note that of the class members appellants claim exist,only objected.this small percentage indicates the settlement was fair.considering there was arm length bargaining adequate investigation and discovery by experienced counsel and a small percentage of objectors,we conclude the settlement was presumptively fair,adequate and reasonable,a presumption objectors have failed to overcome.see dunk,supra,th at kullar foot locker retail,th.
certification of an non opt out class violated due process 
one aspect of the settlement agreement here gives us pause,in that the agreement provided the parties agree that the settlement class shall be certified in accordance with the standards applicable under rule b rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure and that,accordingly,no settlement class member may opt out of any of the provisions of this agreement.this provision is troubling for two reasons.strictly speaking,parties to an agreement can not logically bind nonparties with a provision stating the parties agree the nonparty can not deny the agreement.so the provision is of no effect absent some mechanism by which nonparties are made party to the agreement,an order certifying the class.the non provision is of no force absent such an order.in that respect,then,the non class is best evaluated for whether certification was proper,not whether the settlement was fair.
the second problem with the settlement is it purports to bind the court to a particular sort of certification.this the parties can not do.it is for the trial court,not the parties,to determine whether and in what manner a matter is best certified.the question is whether a non class should have been certified pursuant to rule b.we conclude it should not.
rule b classes 
california law does not address when a trial court should afford class members a right to opt out.bell am.title ins.d.we therefore look to federal law for guidance.green obledo cal d.the united states supreme court has recently provided guidance about rule b classes that is directly on point here.
rule b permits class treatment when the defendant has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.claims for individualized relief do not satisfy the rule.wal mart stores,dukes,wal mart.the key to the b class is the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.citation.in other words,rule b applies only when a single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class.it does not authorize class certification when each individual class member would be entitled to a different injunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant.similarly,it does not authorize class certification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary damages.ibid.
classes certified under rule b share the most traditional justifications for class treatment that the relief sought must perforce affect the entire class at once.wal mart,supra.at.for that reason,rule b provides no opportunity for class members to opt out,and does not oblige the trial court to notify class members of the action.ibid.
individualized monetary claims therefore do not belong in a rule b class.the procedural protections attending other types of classes predominance,superiority,mandatory noti
