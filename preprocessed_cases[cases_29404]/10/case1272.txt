proposed class representatives of vietnamese bank depositors seek to recover the dollar value of bank deposits made in saigon,south vietnam,before april.on appeal,they challenge the district court orders dismissing as their complaint against citibank,citibank,the chase manhattan bank chase,and chiao tung bank chiao tung.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm,discussing many of the heretofore unaddressed issues raised by this case.
after several years of conflict,saigon,the capital of the republic of vietnam south vietnam,was surrendered unconditionally to the democratic republic of vietnam north vietnam on april.the history of these events has been chronicled elsewhere by the federal courts.see,trinh citibank,cir vishipco line chase manhattan bank,cir.thus,it suffices to mention here that,during the unrest immediately preceding the regime change,several foreign banks closed the branches they had been operating in saigon.
lien huynh,tuoi pham foster,and other proposed class members appellants allege that,at the time of these unannounced closures,each proposed class representative had south vietnamese piastres on deposit at the saigon branch of a foreign bank.the alleged balance of each named plaintiff account as of april ranges from to at an exchange rate of piastres to the dollar.
some years later,on september,appellants filed their first amended complaint in los angeles county superior court seeking to recover the dollar value of their bank deposits from seven banks.among those banks were the three banks party to the instant appeal citibank,and chase,both banking corporations headquartered in new york,as well as chiao tung,a taiwanese banking corporation.
citibank removed the case to federal court on october.before the district court,citibank and chase jointly moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,claiming that the action was by the new york statute of limitations governing claims arising from contract and fraud.separately,chiao tung moved to dismiss the complaint as barred by the statute of limitations under california,vietnamese,and taiwanese law.in support of its motion,chiao tung requested that the district court take judicial notice of the statutes of limitations in both taiwan and vietnam,providing declarations in support thereof.no other evidence of foreign law was offered before the district court.
the district court granted both motions,and this timely appeal followed.
the case before us presents an intertwined issue of statute of limitations and choice of law questions,which we review de novo.see oja army corps of engineers,cir statute of limitations questions jorgensen cassiday,cir choice of law.accepting as true the allegations in the complaint,as we must when reviewing a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,mir little of mary,cir,we must determine whether the running of the statute is apparent on the face of the complaint.jablon dean witter,cir see also supermail cargo,united states,cir a complaint can not be dismissed unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would establish the timeliness of the claim.
addressing a similar question in cruz united states,d,the district court adopted the following analytical framework 
first,the court must decide what rule governs the selection of the statute of limitations.second,the court must apply that rule to determine which jurisdiction limitations law applies.third,and finally,the court must determine whether plaintiffs claims fall within the relevant limitations period.
id.at.we endorse and apply this approach.
chase removed this action to federal court pursuant to,which invests in the federal courts original jurisdiction over cases arising out of foreign banking transactions to which a corporation is a party.therefore,our jurisdiction is not based on diversity of citizenship.in this context,federal common law rules apply.see chuidian philippine bank,cir holding that,where jurisdiction is not premised on diversity of citizenship,federal common law governs schoenberg exportadora de sal,de,cir same.
federal common law follows the approach outlined in the restatement second of conflict of laws.id.accordingly,barring exceptional circumstances,we consider the following factors 
the forum will apply its own statute of limitations barring the claim.
the forum will apply its own statute of limitations permitting the claim unless 
a maintenance of the claim would serve no substantial interest of the forum and 
b the claim would be barred under the statute of limitations of a state having a more significant relationship to the parties and the occurrence.
restatement second of conflicts of law.the formulation of this rule is intended to reflect the general principles stated in restatement second of conflicts of law.see restatement second of conflicts of law.
applying,we must first consider whether applicable california forum appellants claims.we conclude that california law does not bar appellants claims against citibank or chase,but it does bar the claims against chiao tung.
under the california code of civil procedure there is no time limitation on an action brought to recover bank deposits.however,a borrowing statute limits that broad rule where,as here,the circumstances giving rise to the cause of action occurred outside of the state 
when a cause of action has arisen in a foreign country,and by the laws thereof an action thereon can not there be maintained against a person by reason of the lapse of time,an action thereon shall not be maintained against him in this state 
california borrowing statute,in turn,includes an exception providing that,if one is a citizen of th e state who has held the cause of action since it accrued,will not prevent his or her claim.
appellants complaint indicates that most named plaintiffs are residents of california.therefore,reading the complaint with the required liberality,see jablon,at,many of the proposed class members may be citizens of california who could benefit from the borrowing statute citizen of the state exception.this exception has been read to apply only where the plaintiff was a citizen at the time his or her claim accrued.see,cossman daimlerchrysler,th,d,flowers carville,cir.thus,whether appellants can avail themselves of the,thereby,escape a potential foreign statute of limitations on when california law deems the cause of action to have accrued.
we have never considered,under california or any other law,when a claim for a return of a bank deposit starts to accrue.relying on edelmann chase manhattan bank,cir and garcia chase manhattan bank,cir,appellants urge that their claims accrued upon their formal demand for payment.that demand occurred,they argue,only when they filed the complaint.see edelmann,at holding that the statute of limitations on the parent bank indebtedness begins to run from the date of demand garcia,at concluding that in the absence of an unequivocal repudiation,the statute of limitations did not begin to run until a demand was made.neither edelmann nor garcia,each addressing the issue under the laws of new york,is instructive with respect to the laws of california.
in california,we know of few cases discussing either demand or accrual in relation to a cause of action to recover a bank deposit.despite the dearth of case law,which is natural given that there is no statute of limitations on such claims,it appears that california does not subscribe to the demand requirement promulgated by garcia and edelmann 
w here a right has fully accrued,except for some demand to be made as a condition precedent to legal relief,which the claimant can at any time make,if he so chooses,the cause of action has accrued for the purpose of setting the statute of limitations running.otherwise,he might indefinitely prolong his right to enforce his claim or right by neglecting to make the demand until it suited his convenience so to do.
taketa state bd.of equalization,d,internal quotation marks omitted.instead,the statute of limitation begins to run when the individual could have made a demand.see,carrasco greco canning,d,people honey lake valley irr,miguel miguel,cal,that a cause of action for money payable on demand accrues with the inception of the obligation and without the necessity for any demand hardly requires the citation of authority.
in apparent conflict,several california cases indicate that appellants cause of action accrued not when a demand could have been made but when a demand was made.see union tool farmers merchants bank of los angeles,cal,recognizing the general rule that there is no default on the part of the bank,and hence no accrual of a cause of action against it to recover the balance of a general deposit until its payment is demanded or there is some act on the part of the bank dispensing with such demand.glassell devl.citizens.bank of los angeles,cal,zuck culp,cal.
we need not attempt to resolve this potential conflict here because,even were we to conclude that the latter cases governed,it is absolutely clear that california law imposes limits on appellants freedom to choose when to make their demand 
n o one can suspend the running of the statute of limitations indefinitely and thereby defeat its purpose by unreasonably delaying the making of a demand or by unreasonably delaying the doing of some other act a party can not by his own negligence,or for his own convenience,stop the running of the statute.
fidelity guaranty,d,internal quotation marks omitted see also phillis city of santa barbara,d,o ne can not postpone the running of the statute of limitation by failing for an unreasonable period to thus assert his right,and unless the demand is made within such period the cause of action is barred.rather,the of the demand requirement is that the demand must be made within a reasonable time after it can lawfully be made.stafford oil tool,d,see also vickrey maier,cal,bogart george porter,cal,phillis.at brock indem,d,ilse burgess,d.
at the very least,the complaint demonstrates that appellants continually have known about appellees alleged refusal to return their deposits since.indeed,the complaint alleges that a fter the fall of the government in saigon,defendants continually represented and continue to represent to plaintiffs that they were released from their obligations yet,appellants offer no explanation why they failed to seek redress.thus,the three decade delay does not appear reasonable 
moreover,the same cases acknowledging the demand requirement for bank deposits explain that the statute of limitations begins to run not only when demand is made but also when there is some act on the part of the bank dispensing with such demand.glassell,at citing cases see also union tool,at.therefore,w here the bank,either in terms or in effect,has denied liability to the depositor for the amount in question the demand requirement is inapplicable and the statute of limitations is set in motion.glassell,at see also union tool,at.we are convinced that the closure of the banks,followed by their continual representations to appellants that the banks were released of their obligations in terms and in effect constituted such a denial of liability dispensing with the demand requirement.see mitchell beckman,cal,holding that a bank defaulted on deposits only when it closed its doors,and by its acts spoke as significantly as words to that effect we refuse to pay any one.it is useless to present your or demand.
thus,whether or not there is a demand requirement under california law,appellants cause of action accrued no later than april,when they allege that citibank,chase,and chiao tung ceased operations in saigon.appellants were not citizens of california at that time so they are subject to california borrowing statute.therefore,whether appellants action is barred by california law is dependent on the law of vietnam where the cause of action arose.
in determining whether appellants claims would be barred in vietnam,we are faced with divergent interpretations of vietnamese law.properly in the record on appeal is an expert declaration analyzing vietnamese law,accompanied by translations of the relevant legal texts,offered by chiao tung before the district court.that declaration concludes that appellants claims are barred by vietnamese law.appellants request that we take judicial notice of its opposing expert declaration,which was not before the district court.that declaration concludes that either vietnamese law does not bar appellants claims or the statute of limitations has been tolled for depositors who left vietnam.
we need not resolve these conflicting interpretations of vietnamese law.it is rarely appropriate for an appellate court to take judicial notice of facts that were not before the district court.flick liberty mut.fire ins,cir.rather,an appellant must bear the burden of a factual record that is incomplete on the issues he raises.united states elias,cir internal quotation marks omitted citation omitted.these principles counsel powerfully against noticing appellants declaration because they did not object to or even address chiao tung request for judicial notice.
we will not reward appellants on appeal for their lack of diligence before the district court,so we are left with only chiao tung interpretation of vietnamese law.under that interpretation,the vietnamese statute of limitations bars appellants causes of action.thus,we conclude that the dismissal of the complaint against chiao tung was proper.
in their separate motion to dismiss,however,citibank and chase did not raise vietnamese law,nor did they offer any interpretation thereof under the,therefore,federal common law of the forum determines the standards of proof of the content of foreign law,as well as the effect of a party failure to show the content of foreign law.restatement second of conflict of laws.accordingly,we return to california law and conclude that citibank and chase can not benefit from arguments they did not make and evidence they did not offer.rather,where foreign law is applicable but it is neither pled nor proven,california permits the court to apply the law of california.cal.gagnon.desert inn,cal d,ferrell.enthusiasts,d.
as discussed above,california does not impose a statute of limitations on actions to recover bank deposits,so appellants actions against citibank and chase are not in the forum state.that conclusion,however,does not end our analysis.if the action is not barred by the law of the forum state,we must,nevertheless,ask whether the forum state has a substantial interest in the claim and whether the laws of any other jurisdiction with a more significant relationship to the parties bars the action.restatement second of conflict of laws.
primarily,appellants argue that california has a substantial interest in this action because all but two of the proposed class representatives,as well as the worlds sic largest expatriate community of vietnamese,reside in california as noted above,only one of these california residents was a resident of the state at the time his cause of action accrued.yet,california courts have consistently declined to recognize residence as a source of governmental interest on the grounds that consideration of this factor would encourage forum shopping.mcghee arabian am.oil,cir citing cases see also cossman daimlerchrysler,th,d,giest sequoia ventures,th,d.there is every indication,then,that california itself would disclaim interest in the action.reich purcell,cal d,concluding california was disinterested in a dispute where its only connection was plaintiff residence.
moreover,the fact that most appellants and,apparently,most vietnamese expatriates living in the united states reside in california carries little weight in our substantial interest analysis.california is merely the current residence of certain appellants and the place where,cognizant of the favorable statute of limitations,they happened to seek performance.the state had no connection with this case when appellants made their deposits or when the banks ceased operations in saigon nor was there any reasonable expectation at the time the causes of action accrued that the banks would perform in california the alleged contracts were executed in vietnam with chase and citibank,both headquartered in new y
