gerald smith,in his capacity as plan trustee for the bankruptcy estate of boston chicken,and various related entities the trustee filed an action alleging a variety of claims.later,the trustee filed motions seeking district court approval of settlements reached with certain of the defendants and requesting bar orders enjoining the defendants from asserting certain claims against the settling defendants.over objection of some of the defendants,the district court granted the approval motions resulting in this appeal.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to.we hold that we have appellate jurisdiction and affirm.
the trustee second amended complaint complaint asserts separate claims under state and federal law against certain of boston chicken former officers and directors,attorneys,auditors,and investment bankers.the complaint refers to scott beck,saad nadhir,and mark stephens,who were officers directors of boston chicken,as the individual defendants.defendants merrill lynch,merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,deutsche banc securities,deutsche banc brown,and morgan stanley,are the underwriter defendants.the defendants other than the individual defendants and pricewaterhousecoopers which was boston chicken auditor are the professional defendants.
the complaint alleges the following core facts.boston chicken was insolvent from its inception,which the defendants knew or should have known.rather than acknowledge this fact and seek bankruptcy protection,the defendants sought to keep the firm afloat for various reasons retaining their corporate positions,salaries and fees,preserving the value of their investments in boston chicken and related entities.this was accomplished by,among other things,misrepresenting not necessarily intentionally the firm financial condition to its outside directors and investors who participated in the firm various securities offerings.the individual defendants,as corporate officials,had the authority to implement this plan the professional defendants,as advisors to the firm and underwriters of its securities,provided the services and resources necessary to make it happen.accordingly,the complaint alleges in part that the individual defendants breached the fiduciary duties they owed to boston chicken and made false and misleading misrepresentations to boston chicken board of directors.the complaint also alleges that the professional defendants are liable for breach of certain contracts with boston chicken,breach of fiduciary duties owed to boston chicken and professional malpractice.
furthermore,the complaint charges that had these misrepresentations and breaches not occurred,the funds obtained through the capital markets might not have been forthcoming,and the outside directors might have chosen to enter bankruptcy at an earlier date.in that situation,boston chicken assets would not have been squandered on an unviable business plan or on the defendants compensation and fees,and the firm would not have been encumbered with additional debt obligations that it had no realistic chance of repaying.in summary,the complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in a course of conduct that plunged boston chicken deeper and deeper into insolvency.
in october,boston chicken and various related entities filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code.in may,the bankruptcy court confirmed boston chicken third amended plan debtor plan,under which certain of boston chicken assets were sold to the mcdonald corporation,boston chicken was dissolved,and the trustee was appointed as the representative of the bankruptcy estates.the trustee commenced a number of lawsuits,all of which are now consolidated into one proceeding in the united states district court for the district of arizona the trustee action.
before boston chicken had entered bankruptcy,over securities class actions were filed in the united states district court for the district of colorado.the class actions,which alleged various claims under state and federal securities laws and were based largely on the same conduct at issue in the trustee action,were later consolidated into one proceeding in colorado the class action.the class action was transferred to the united states district court for the district of arizona in november and consolidated with the trustee action for discovery and pretrial purposes only in march.however,in may the consolidation order was vacated and the class action was transferred back to colorado,while the trustee action remained in arizona.the class action remains in colorado,and is not before us.
during,the trustee reached settlements with three of the defendants in the trustee action collectively,including the trustee,the settling parties bell boyd lloyd bb l and pedersen houpt p h,both of which served as counsel to boston chicken,and stephens,one of the individual defendants.the trustee filed joint motions with each of the settling defendants seeking district court approval of these three settlements approval motions.the proposed orders submitted with the approval motions contained provisions enjoining the defendants from pursuing certain claims against the settling defendants bar orders,as well as provisions reducing any future judgment rendered in the trustee action against the defendants by the pro rata share of fault attributable to each settling defendant judgment reduction credits.
nadhir,peer pedersen another of boston chicken directors,and the underwriter defendants collectively,the defendants,as well as certain other parties,objected to the approval motions.their objections generally were not,however,focused on the fairness of the settlements or the terms of the proposed orders.rather,they objected principally because each approval motion sought findings of fact,a bar order,and a permanent injunction against the defendants,even though,they asserted,the district court lack ed jurisdiction to do anything more than to dismiss the plan trustee claims.
the defendants presented two arguments in support of this jurisdictional challenge.first,they contended that the trustee was in effect asserting claims of boston chicken creditors,which it lacked standing to do under caplin marine midland grace trust,d.this same argument had been presented to the district court in connection with a motion to dismiss an earlier version of the complaint,but was rejected.see smith ex rel.estates of boston chicken arthur andersen llp,d.second,they argued that the securities litigation uniform standards act of slusa deprived the district court of subject matter jurisdiction over the trustee action.this argument,too,had already been rejected by the court in several different contexts.
the district court held two hearings on the approval motions.the first,held on august,addressed the trustee settlements with bb l and stephens.the district court approved the settlements and overruled the jurisdictional objections.later,the district court entered an approval and bar order with respect to the bb l settlement in the form proposed in the bb l approval motion.the district court did not enter an approval and bar order regarding the stephens settlement.however,the record contains a minute entry dated august,indicating that the stephens approval motion was granted.
a hearing on the p h settlement was set for august.on that day,p h filed a reply in support of its approval motion,which argued that the objecting defendants themselves had no standing to challenge the proposed settlement because a defendant,in general,lacks standing to object to a partial settlement.waller fin.of,cir.this was the first time the settling parties had challenged the defendants standing on this ground.at the hearing,the district court ruled that the defendants have no standing to object to the approval motion,overruled the defendants jurisdictional objections,and granted the approval motion.the court later entered an approval and bar order regarding the p h settlement.
the defendants appealed from effectively all the orders of the district court related to the three settlements,and we consolidated their appeals.
the defendants raise the same jurisdictional objections based upon caplin and slusa that they raised in response to the approval motions.however,the settling parties argue that we may not reach the defendants objections because appellate jurisdiction does not exist over this appeal and the defendants lack standing to object to the settlements.we first address our appellate jurisdiction,and then the defendants standing.
a provides appellate jurisdiction over i nterlocutory orders of the district courts granting injunctions.each of the two approval and bar orders entered by the district court permanently enjoins the defendants from asserting certain claims against the settling defendants.although no approval and bar order was entered in relation to the stephens settlement,a minute entry indicates that the stephens approval motion,which sought entry of a bar order,was granted.because the defendants appeal from the specific entry of a requested injunction,we have jurisdiction pursuant to section a.paige california,cir see also fdic geldermann,cir because the district court bar order expressly enjoins the defendants from suing the settlors for contribution or indemnity,it is an interlocutory order granting injunctions under a alterations in original.
however,the defendants do not directly challenge the injunctions.they do not argue,for example,that the district court abused its discretion by entering the bar order.resolution trust rice in re consol.pinnacle sec.litig.resolution trust litig,cir.rather,they are using this appeal from the injunctions to challenge the trustee standing and the district court subject matter jurisdiction.the question therefore arises whether we have pendent appellate jurisdiction over these issues.
under a,we may exercise interlocutory appellate jurisdiction over the district court injunction and pendent jurisdiction over any otherwise ruling that is inextricably intertwined with or necessary to ensure meaningful review of the order properly before us on interlocutory appeal.hendricks bank of,cir citations omitted alterations in original.as in hendricks,we need not decide whether the trustee standing and slusa issues are inextricably intertwined with the injunctions,because we conclude that review of these two defenses is necessary to ensure meaningful review of the district court injunction.id.alterations in original,quoting swint chambers county comm n,d.
we have stated that r esolution of subject matter jurisdiction is necessary to ensure meaningful review of the district court interlocutory rulings because if appellate courts lack jurisdiction,they can not review the merits of these properly appealed rulings.meredith oregon,cir,amended by cir see also hendricks,at wong ins,cir.here,the defendants characterize their arguments based upon caplin as challenges to the trustee article iii standing those arguments therefore implicate the district court subject matter jurisdiction.see cetacean cmty.bush,cir a suit brought by a plaintiff without article iii standing is not a case or controversy,and an article iii federal court therefore lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the suit.similarly,the defendants slusa arguments challenge the district court subject matter jurisdiction over the claims in the trustee action.we therefore have pendent jurisdiction over both of these issues,which call into question the district court authority to rule on a party motion for a n injunction.hendricks,at emphasis in hendricks,quoting meredith,at.
the settling parties argue that the defendants do not have standing to challenge the settlements because a defendant,in general,lacks standing to object to a partial settlement.waller,at citations omitted.we review this issue de novo.see id.
in waller,we explained that there is a recognized exception to the general principle barring objections by defendants to permit a defendant to object where it can demonstrate that it will sustain some formal legal prejudice as a result of the settlement.id.at citations omitted.it is well established that such prejudice exists where a settlement purports to strip a defendant of a legal claim or cause of action,an action for indemnity or contribution for example.id.citations omitted see also weinman fid.capital appreciation fund in re integra realty,cir in re vitamins antitrust class actions,eichenholtz brennan,cir agretti anr freight,cir alumax mill,congress fin,cir.
the defendants contend that they have suffered prejudice because,among other reasons,they are enjoined from pursuing indemnification,contribution,and certain other claims.furthermore,they argue that the judgment reduction credits do not fully eliminate this prejudice.
in opposition,the settling parties contend that the defendants waived these arguments by failing to raise them in the district court.we disagree with this contention for two reasons.first,nadhir counsel did argue at the august,hearing on the p h settlement that the defendants had standing because the settlement stripped them of indemnity and contribution claims.although the defendants did not make one of the particular arguments they advance here,that the judgment reduction credits do not fully extinguish any harm caused by the bar orders,we will not preclude them from bolstering their defense to the settling parties challenge to their standing.see lake lake,cir where defendant raised issue of personal jurisdiction in district court and plaintiffs responded,defendant could not prevent plaintiffs from arguing that issue on appeal or strengthening their argument.
second,although we usually do not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal,there are exceptions to this rule.for example,we will consider such an issue where there are exceptional circumstances why the issue was not raised in the trial court.united states,cir see also united states antonakeas,cir.we conclude that exceptional circumstances exist in this case.the settling parties did not cite the general rule,stated in waller,that defendants lack standing to challenge partial settlements until august,which was the day of the hearing on the p h settlement and one week after the hearing on the bb l and stephens settlements.it is therefore unsurprising that the defendants did not invoke the formal legal prejudice exception to the general rule prior to that time.given the settling parties own torpor in challenging the defendants standing,we will permit the defendants to argue that the judgment reduction credits do not eliminate the prejudice caused by the bar orders.to hold otherwise would create an incentive for a party to withhold its challenges to its opponent standing until the last possible moment and then contend that its opponent waived any response to those challenges by not anticipating and countering them in the district court.
the settling parties also argue that the defendants waived the argument that they have standing to challenge the settlements by not making that argument in their opening briefs.however,we may consider an issue not raised in the appellant opening brief if it is raised in the appellee brief.see,koerner grigas,cir united states,cir.that is the case here.we therefore now proceed to consider the defendants arguments that they have standing.
as explained above,one exception to the general rule that defendants lack standing to challenge settlements is that standing exists where the settlement purports to strip the defendant of a legal claim or cause of action,an action for indemnity or contribution for example.waller,at citations omitted.the settling parties contend,in effect,that there is an exception to this exception,under which a defendant who is subject to a bar order will nonetheless lack standing if the settlement includes a judgment reduction credit reducing any subsequent judgment against the defendants by the proportion of fault attributable to the settling defendants.in support of this argument,the settling parties cite zupnick fogel,cir and school district of lancaster lake asbestos of quebec in re school asbestos litigation,cir.
neither zupnick nor school asbestos litigation holds that a judgment reduction credit always eliminates any formal legal prejudice caused by a bar order.indeed,the same court that decided school asbestos litigation held in a later case that defendants did have standing to object to a settlement where the district court had imposed a bar order,see eichenholtz,at,even though the settlement agreement contained a proportionate fault judgment reduction provision similar to that involved here,see id.at.we interpret zupnick and school asbestos litigation as standing for the proposition that a judgment reduction credit may divest defendants of standing if it is written in such a way as to ameliorate any harm caused by other provisions in the settlement agreement.see zupnick,at no standing where settlement agreement fully protect ed the defendants contribution and indemnity rights by providing that plaintiffs and the class agree to reduce or satisfy any judgment obtained either by settlement or after trial against defendants,or any of them,to the extent necessary to extinguish any claims of such defendants for indemnity or contribution from the settling defendant,as may be determined by the court or jury sch.asbestos,at similar.we will therefore examine the specific provisions at issue to decide whether the defendants have standing.
the p h approval and bar order provides in part emphasis added 
the parties are permanently barred and enjoined from asserting or continuing to prosecute,either directly or in any other capacity,any and all claims as defined in the settlement agreement whether directly,indirectly,derivatively,representatively,or in any other capacity excluding claims to enforce the terms of the settlement agreement,against p h.the released claims are compromised,settled,and released as against p h by virtue of this approval and bar order.
by virtue of the good faith nature of the settlement agreement approved by this court,p h is discharged from all released claims for contribution,indemnification or the like that have been or may later be brought by or on behalf of any of the parties based upon,relating to or arising out of the released claims as defined in the settlement agreement.accordingly,the other defendants are permanently barred,enjoined and restrained from asserting or continuing to prosecute any such claim,however styled,whether for contribution,indemnity or otherwise,and whether arising under state,federal or common law against p h,based upon,arising out of,or related to the claims.
with respect to any judgment that might be entered on any cause of action or claim in this action,or any pending future adversary proceeding,contested matter or civil action in which the trustee is also a party,in which there is or may be a determination of fault on the part of p h,including but not limited to a determination of fault based on joint and several liability,the parties shall receive a pro rata judgment reduction credit.in recognition of the settlement payment,and in light of the parties intent to provide p h with comprehensive,full and complete finality with regard to any and all claims that could be asserted against p h as a result of his conduct or prior dealings with the debtor or the debtors respective bankruptcy estates,any resulting judgment reduction credit shall be applied so as to preclude recovery by any party for any amount of pro rata fault attributable to p 
similar language is contained in the bb l approval and bar order and the proposed form of order submitted by stephens.
we conclude that the judgment reduction credit does not eliminate the formal legal prejudice caused by the bar orders.the defendants are enjoined from asserting any claim for contribution,indemnity or otherwise that is based upon,arising out of,or related to the released claims.although the judgment reduction credit,which is equal to any amount of pro rata fault attributable to the settling defendants,might offset the defendants loss of potential contribution claims,it is not clear that it would compensate them for the elimination of indemnity or other claims.
that the defendants have not articulated the precise nature of the indemnity or other claims they are barred from asserting does not demonstrate a lack of formal legal prejudice.we are not reviewing an order entering summary judgment or dismissing a complaint,where a more searching inquiry into the factual and legal basis of a claim might be productive.rather,we are determining whether the defendants have standing,and we have stated that a defendant has standing where a settlement purports to strip it of a legal claim or cause of action.waller,at.the plain language of the approval and bar orders extends beyond contribution claims,and we can not conclude at this stage that the language precluding indemnity or other claims,which the settling parties requested the district court to include in the approval and bar orders,is of no practical effect.moreover,the defendants have had little opportunity to identify in concrete terms the exact ways in which the bar orders prejudice them because the settling parties did not assert challenges to the defendants standing under waller until the day of the hearing on the p h settlement.we hold that the defendants had standing to object to the settlements.
we turn now to the merits of the defendants challenges to the district court jurisdiction.we first address their attacks on the trustee standing,and then consider their slusa arguments.
the defendants contend that the trustee lacks standing to assert the claims in the trustee action pursuant to the supreme court caplin decision.we review this issue de novo.see williams cal.bank,cir.
we emphasize that the only issue before us is whether the district court had authority to grant the approval motions.the defendants argue that such authority was absent because caplin divests the trustee of standing caplin and its progeny establish constitutional principles of standing and therefore implicate subject matter jurisdiction,see city of sausalito,cir explaining that standing involves both article iii limitations and limitations,and that the standing inquiry is not whether there is a case or controversy under article iii,and thus does not go to our subject matter jurisdiction and since the requirements of article iii have not been met,the district court not only lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the trustee claims,but could not even grant the interlocutory approval motions.
we address first the issue of the trustee standing and then address the defendants principal objections.
a bankruptcy trustee is the representative of the bankrupt estate,and has the capacity to sue and be sued.see.among the trustee duties is the obligation to collect and reduce to money the property of the estate.id.the property of the estate includes all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case,id.a,including the debtor causes of action.united states whiting pools,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,u nder the bankruptcy code the trustee stands in the shoes of the bankrupt corporation and has standing to bring any suit that the bankrupt corporation could have instituted had it not petitioned for bankruptcy.shearson lehman hutton,wagoner,cir citations omitted.
however,i t is well settled that a bankruptcy trustee has no standing generally to sue third parties on behalf of the estate creditors,but may only assert claims held by the bankrupt corporation itself.id.citation omitted see also steinberg buczynski,cir t he trustee is confined to enforcing entitlements of the corporation.he has no right to enforce entitlements of a creditor.this principle derives from the supreme court decision in caplin,in which the court concluded that a reorganization trustee under chapter x had no standing under the old bankruptcy act to assert,on behalf of the holders of the debtor debentures,claims of misconduct against a third party.williams,at see also rochelle marine midland grace trust,cir stating that caplin held that a reorganization trustee has no standing to maintain an action on the part of any person or entity other than his debtor corporation.as we explained in williams,the holding of caplin remains valid under the current version of the bankruptcy code,and is equally applicable to both reorganization and liquidation trustees.see at.
although the line between claims of the debtor,which a trustee has statutory authority to assert,and claims of creditors,which caplin bars the trustee from pursuing,is not always clear,the focus of the inquiry is on whether the trustee is seeking to redress injuries to the debtor itself caused by the defendants alleged conduct.see,scholes lehmann,cir explaining that a bankruptcy trustee may sue only to redress injuries to the debtor in bankruptcy.if the debtor suffered an injury,the trustee has standing to pursue a claim seeking to rectify such injury.but,w hen a third party has injured not the bankrupt corporation itself but a creditor of that corporation,the trustee in bankruptcy can not bring suit against the third party.steinberg,at.
here,the trustee alleges that the defendants breached contracts with or duties owed to boston chicken,and that if they had not concealed boston chicken financial condition from its outside directors and the investing public,the firm might have filed for bankruptcy more promptly.in that situation,additional assets might not have been spent on a failing business.this allegedly wrongful expenditure of corporate assets qualifies as an injury to the firm which is sufficient to confer standing upon the trustee.see official comm.of unsecured creditors lafferty,cir p rolonging an insolvent corporation life through bad debt may cause the dissipation of corporate assets.th is harm can be averted,and the value within an insolvent corporation salvaged,if the corporation is dissolved in a timely manner,rather than kept afloat with spurious debt.therefore,we conclude that the trustee has standing.
unpersuaded,the defendants present a host of challenges to the trustee standing,all of which suffer from a common defect a failure to refute the argument that the trustee is seeking to redress injuries suffered by boston chicken as a result of the defendants alleged conduct.we address their principal arguments in turn.
the defendants first argue that our decision in williams compels the conclusion that the trustee lacks standing because the creditors are the real parties in interest in the trustee action.in williams,we held that a trustee lacked standing to assert claims that had been assigned to the trustee by the debtor investors because,among other reasons,the assignments notwithstanding,the investors plainly remain ed the real parties in interest in the trustee actions.williams,at.here,in contrast,the trustee is not attempting to assert claims that were assigned to him by boston chicken creditors,but rather seeks to rectify injuries to boston chicken itself.nothing in williams suggests that creditors are the real parties in interest in an action pursuing compensation for injuries to the corporate debtor.
second,the defendants argue that if boston chicken took on more debt than it could repay,it is boston chicken ones who actually lost that money by lending it to boston chicken who were injured.in their view,the additional debt that boston chicken incurred and can not now repay as a result of the defendants alleged conduct does not establish a harm to boston chicken remediable by the trustee.in response,the trustee argues that he has alleged a cognizable harm to boston chicken.he invokes the deepening insolvency theory,exemplified by the third circuit decision in lafferty,under which an insolvent corporation is deemed to suffer a distinct and compensable injury when it continues to operate and incur more debt.kittay atl.bank in re global serv.group llc,see also lafferty,at stating that deepening insolvency refers to an injury to the debtors corporate property from the fraudulent expansion of corporate debt and prolongation of corporate life.
we need not make any general pronouncements on the deepening insolvency theory,not least because it is difficult to grasp exactly what the theory entails.see limor buerger in re,pointing out the lack of definition of the developing theory of deepening insolvency and discussing cases and commentary.we do,however,agree with the third circuit observation in lafferty that prolonging an insolvent corporation life through bad debt may dissipate corporate assets and thereby harm the value of corporate property.at.thus,we agree that the complaint states a cognizable harm to boston chicken when it alleges that the defendants prolonged the firm existence,causing it to expend corporate assets that would not have been spent if the corporation had been dissolved in a timely manner,rather than kept afloat with spurious debt.id.in so holding,we do not opine whether the incurrence of additional debt that can not be repaid,in and of itself,constitutes a corporate injury remediable by a trustee.we rely only on the dissipation of assets in reaching the conclusion that boston chicken was harmed.
it is,of course,true that the dissipation of assets limited the firm ability to repay its debts in liquidation.acknowledgment of this fact is not,however,a concession that only the creditors,and not boston chicken itself,have sustained any injury.instead,it is a recognition of the economic reality that any injury to an insolvent firm is necessarily felt by its creditors.see brandt hicks,muse in re healthco int l,in complaining that directors authorized a transaction which unduly weakened healthco,the trustee is not asserting the claim of creditors.he alleges healthco was the victim of poor management causing damage to the corporation which necessarily resulted in damage to its creditors by diminishing the value of its assets and increasing its liabilities.thus,for example,if corporate directors mismanage an insolvent firm and cause it injury,the creditors will feel that injury indirectly.see prod.res.group,llc nct group,stating that even when acts of mismanagement occur when the firm is insolvent,they operate to injure the firm in the first instance by reducing its value,injuring creditors only indirectly by diminishing the value of the firm and therefore the assets from which the creditors may satisfy their claims.the existence of such indirect injury to creditors notwithstanding,it is axiomatic that a trustee has authority to bring actions against the debtor officers and directors for breach of duty or misconduct.koch ref.farmers union cent,cir,citing pepper litton.see also.world exposition fed.ins,cir mixon anderson in re ozark rest.equip,cir delgado oil torres,cir.moreover,neither our own decision in williams,nor any of the other decisions upon which the defendants principally rely,see breeden kirkpatrick lockhart llp in re bennett funding group,cir hirsch arthur andersen,cir hutton hadley,cir mixon,are inconsistent with this analysis,as none of these decisions hold that conduct causing an insolvent debtor corporation to expend its assets injures only the creditors and not the corporation.
third,the defendants point out that if the trustee succeeds in holding the defendants liable and distributes the recovery to boston chicken creditors,some creditors might make out better than if they had brought their own direct fraud claims against the defendants,while others might fare worse.this may be true,but it is irrelevant to the question of the trustee standing.as nadhir himself explains in his brief,this supposed disparity is simply a function of the reality that any recovery in the trustee action would be distributed to creditors according to the priority schedule set forth in the bankruptcy code.this does not show that boston chicken itself was not injured by the defendants conduct.
fourth,the underwriter defendants argue that the trustee is asserting claims barred by caplin because the trustee damage claim here is measured in terms of boston chicken unpaid debt at the time of its bankruptcy filing,instead of any actual harm to the corporation.in response,the trustee cites dicta in several cases suggesting that the amount of debt incurred following a false representation of solvency may be a valid measure of harm.see.dep t of ins.chase bank of.ass n,cir tabas greenleaf ventures,in re flagship healthcare.we need not and do not expr
