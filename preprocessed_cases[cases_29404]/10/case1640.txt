civil code section requires,before a notice of default may be filed,that a lender contact the borrower in person or by phone to assess the borrower financial situation and explore options to prevent foreclosure.here is the exact,operative language from the statute a mortgagee,beneficiary,or authorized agent shall contact the borrower in person or by telephone in order to assess the borrower financial situation and explore options for the borrower to avoid foreclosure.there is nothing in section that requires the lender to rewrite or modify the loan.
in this writ proceeding,we answer these questions about section,also known as the perata mortgage relief 
a may section be enforced by a private right of action yes.otherwise the statute would be a dead letter.
b must a borrower tender the full amount of the mortgage indebtedness due as a prerequisite to bringing an action under section no.to hold otherwise would defeat the purpose of the statute.
c is section preempted by federal law,we must emphasize,it is not preempted because the remedy for noncompliance is a simple postponement of the foreclosure sale,nothing more.
d what is the extent of a private right of action under section to repeat the right of action is limited to obtaining a postponement of an impending foreclosure to permit the lender to comply with section.
e must the declaration required of the lender by section,subdivision b be under penalty of perjury no.such a requirement is not only not in the statute,but would be at odds with the way the statute is written.
f does a declaration in a notice of default that tracks the language of section,subdivision b comply with the statute,even though such language does not on its face delineate precisely which one of the three categories set forth in the declaration applies to the particular case at hand yes.there is no indication that the legislature wanted to saddle lenders with the need to custom draft the statement required by the statute in notices of default.
g if a lender did not comply with section and a foreclosure sale has already been held,does that noncompliance affect the title to the foreclosed property obtained by the families or investors who may have bought the property at the foreclosure sale no.the legislature did nothing to affect the rule regarding foreclosure sales as final.
h in the present case,did the lender comply with section we can not say on this record,and therefore must return the case to the trial court to determine which of the two sides is telling the truth.according to the lender,the borrowers themselves initiated a telephone conversation in which options were discussed,and there were many,many phone calls to the borrowers to attempt to discuss options.according to the borrowers,no one ever contacted them about nonforeclosure options.the trial judge,however,never reached this conflict in the facts,because he ruled strictly on legal grounds namely that section does not provide for a private right of action and section is preempted by federal law.as indicated,we have concluded otherwise as to those two issues.
i can section be enforced in a class action in this case not under these facts.the operation of section is highly,and the details as to what might,or might not,constitute compliance can readily vary from lender to lender and borrower to borrower.
ii.background 
in december,terry and michael mabry refinanced the loan on their home in corona from paul financial,borrowing about.in april,paul financial assigned to aurora loan services the right to service the loan.in this opinion,we will treat aurora as synonymous with the lender and use the terms interchangeably 
according to the lender,in the mabrys missed their august loan couple called aurora on the telephone to discuss the loan with an aurora employee.the discussion included mention of a number of options to avoid foreclosure,including loan modification,short sale,of foreclosure,and even a special forbearance.the aurora employee sent a letter following up on the conversation.the letter explained the various options to avoid foreclosure,and asked the mabrys to forward current financial information to aurora so it could consider the mabrys for these options.
according to the lender,the mabrys missed their september payment as well,and aurora sent them another letter describing ways to avoid foreclosure.aurora employees called the mabrys many times to discuss the situation.the mabrys never picked up.
it is undisputed that later in september,the mabrys filed chapter bankruptcy and aurora did not contact the mabrys while the bankruptcy was pending.see automatic stay.the mabrys had their chapter case dismissed,however,in late march.
according to the lender,aurora once again began trying to call the mabrys,calling them numerous times,including three times on different days.meanwhile,in the mabrys sent an authorization to discuss the loan with their lawyers.
according to the lender,finally,in june,the mabrys sent two faxes to aurora,the aggregate effect of which was to propose a short sale to the mabrys attorney,moses hall,for.if accepted,the short sale would have meant a loss of over on the loan.aurora rejected that offer,and an attorney in hall law office proposed a sale price of,which would have meant a loss to the lender of about.
it is undisputed that on june,aurora recorded a notice of default.the notice of default used this obviously form language the beneficiary or its designated agent declares that it has contacted the borrower,tried with due diligence to contact the borrower as required by california civil code section,or the borrower has surrendered the property to the beneficiary or authorized agent,or is otherwise exempt from the requirements of section.aurora sent six copies of the recorded notice of default to the mabrys home by certified mail,and the certifications showed they were delivered.
it is also undisputed that on october,the mabrys filed a complaint in orange county superior court based on aurora alleged failure to comply with section.
according to the borrowers,no one had ever contacted them about their foreclosure options.michael mabry stated the following in his declaration we have never been contacted by aurora nor sic any of its agents in person,by telephone or by first class mail to explore options for us to avoid foreclosure as required in cc.
the complaint sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the foreclosure sale then scheduled just a week away,on october.based on the allegation of no contact,the trial court issued a temporary restraining order,and scheduled a hearing for october.
but exactly one week before the october hearing,the mabrys filed an amended complaint,this one specifically adding class action allegations and seeking injunctive relief for an entire class this new filing came with another request for a temporary restraining order,which was also granted,with a hearing on that temporary restraining order scheduled for october albeit the order was directed at aurora only.
the first restraining order was vacated on october,the second on october.the trial judge did not,however,resolve the conflict in the facts presented by the pleadings.rather he concluded the action is preempted by federal law there is no private right of action under section statute can only be enforced by members of pooling and servicing agreements and the mabrys were required to at least tender all arrearages to enjoin any foreclosure proceedings.
the mabrys filed a motion for reconsideration and a third request for a restraining order based on supposedly new law.the new law was a now court of appeal opinion which,let us merely note here,appears to have been quite in regards to any issue which the trial judge had just decided.so it is not surprising that the requested restraining order was denied.the foreclosure sale was now scheduled for november.six days before that,though,the mabrys filed this writ proceeding,and two days later this court stayed all proceedings.we invited amicus curiae to give their views on the issues raised by the petition,and subsequently scheduled an order to show cause to consider those issues.
iii.discussion 
private right of action.preliminary considerations 
a private right of action may inhere within a statute,otherwise silent on the point,when such a private right of action is necessary to achieve the statute policy objectives,cannon university of chicago,implying private right of action into title ix of the civil rights act because such a right was necessary to achieve the statute policy objectives basic levinson,implying private right of action to enforce securities statute.
that is,the absence of an express private right of action is not necessarily preclusive of such a right.there are times when a private right of action may be implied by a statute,siegel american savings loan d,before we reach the issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies,we must determine,therefore,whether plaintiffs have an implied private right of action under hola.
california courts have,of recent date,looked to fireman fund ins.companies cal d for guidance as to whether there is an implied private right of action in a given statute.in,for example,the presence of a comprehensive administrative means of enforcement of a statute was one of the reasons the court determined that there was no private right of action to enforce a statute,subd.h regulating general insurance industry practices.see,supra,cal d at.
there is also a shalal approach,embodied in middlesex ins.mann d,middlesex.the middlesex opinion itself copied the idea from the restatement second of torts,section.the approach looks to whether a private remedy is appropriate to further the purpose of the legislation and is needed to assure the effectiveness of the provision.middlesex,supra,d at.
obviously,where the two approaches conflict,the one used by our high court in trumps the middlesex approach.but we may note at this point that as regards section,there is no alternative administrative mechanism to enforce the statute.by contrast,in,there was an existing administrative mechanism at hand by way of the insurance commissioner available to enforce section,subdivision h of the insurance code.
there are other corollary principles as well.
first,california courts,quite naturally,do not favor constructions of statutes that render them advisory only,or a dead letter,petropoulos department of real estate th,people stringham d.our colleagues in division one of this district nicely summarized this point in goehring chapman university th,the question of whether a regulatory statute creates a private right of action depends on legislative intent in determining legislative intent,w e first examine the words themselves because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent the words of the statute should be given their ordinary and usual meaning and should be construed in their statutory context these canons generally preclude judicial construction that renders part of the statute meaningless or inoperative.italics added.
second,statutes on the same subject matter or of the same subject should be construed together so that all the parts of the statutory scheme are given effect.lexin superior court cal th.this canon is particularly important in the case before us,where there is an enforcement mechanism available at hand to enforce section,in the form,as we explain below,of section.ironically though,the enforcement mechanism at hand,in direct contrast to the one in,is one that strongly implies individual enforcement of the statute.
third,historical context can also shed light on whether the legislature intended a private right of action in a statute.as noted by one federal district court that has found a private right of action in section,the fact that a statute was enacted as an emergency statute is an important factor in determining legislative intent.see ortiz accredited home lenders,d,agreeing with argument that the california legislature would not have enacted this urgency legislation,intended to curb high foreclosure rates in the state,without any accompanying enforcement mechanism county of san diego state of california th,admitting that private right of action might exist,even if the legislature did not imply one,if compelling reasons of public policy required judicial recognition of such a right.section was enacted in as a manifestation of a felt need for urgent action in the midst of a cascading torrent of foreclosures.
finally,of course,there is recourse to legislative history.alas,in this case,there is silence on the matter as regards the existence of a private right of action in the final draft of the statute,and we have been cited to nothing in the history that suggests a clear legislative intent one way or the other.see generally jones construction superior court th,emphasizing importance of clear intent appearing in legislative history.to be sure,as we were reminded at oral argument,an early version of section had an express provision for a private right of action and that provision did not make its way into the final version of the statute.and we recognize that this factor suggests the legislature may not have wanted to have section enforced privately.
on the other hand,the bottom line was an outcome of silence,not a clear statement that there should be no individual enforcement.and silence,as this court pointed out in jones,has its own implications.there,we cited professor eskridge work on statutory interpretation see eskridge,the new textualism,hereinafter eskridge on textualism to recognize that ambiguity in a statute may itself be the result of both sides in the legislative process agreeing to let the courts decide a point i f there is ambiguity it is because the legislature either could not agree on clearer language or because it made the deliberate choice to be effect,the only intent is to pass the matter on to the courts.jones,supra,th at.as professor eskridge put it elsewhere in his article the vast majority of the court difficult statutory interpretation cases involve statutes whose ambiguity is either the result of deliberate legislative choice to leave conflictual decisions to agencies or the courts.eskridge on textualism,supra,ucla.at.
we have a concrete example in the case at hand.amicus curiae,the california bankers association,asserts that if section had included an express right to a private right of action,the association would have vociferously opposed the legislation.let us accept that as true.but let us also accept as a reasonable premise that the sponsors of the bill,senate bill would have vociferously opposed the legislation if it had an express prohibition on individual enforcement.the point is,the bankers did not insist on language expressly or even impliedly precluding a private right of action,or,if they did,they did get it.the silence is consonant with the idea that section was the result of a legislative compromise,with each side content to let the courts struggle with the issue.
with these observations,we now turn to the language,structure and function of the statute at issue.
operation of section 
section is one of a series of detailed statutes that govern mortgages that span sections to.within that series is yet another long series of statutes governing rules involving foreclosure this second series goes from section,and then follows with sections through there is no section yet.
section concerns the crucial first step in the foreclosure process the recording of a notice of default as required by section.just plain section one has no lower case letter behind it.
the key text of section key because of the substantive obligation it imposes on says that a lender can not file a notice of default until the lender has contacted the borrower in person or by telephone.thus an initial form letter wo do.to quote the text directly,lenders must contact the borrower by phone or in person to assess the borrower financial situation and explore options for the borrower to avoid foreclosure.the statute,of course,has alternative provisions in cases where the lender tries to contact a borrower,and the borrower simply wo pick up the phone,the phone has been disconnected,the borrower hides or otherwise evades contact 
the contrast between section and one of its,section,is also significant.by its terms,section operates substantively on lenders.they must do things in order to comply with the law.in hohfeldian language,it both creates rights and corresponding obligations 
but consider section,which does not operate substantively.section merely expresses the hope that lenders will offer loan modifications on certain terms by contrast,section requires a specified course of action.there is a reason for the difference,as we show in part,dealing with federal preemption.in a word,to have required loan modifications would have run afoul of federal law.
as noted above,other steps in the foreclosure process are set forth in sections through l.the topic of the postponement of foreclosure sales is addressed in section.
subdivision c a of section sets forth the grounds for postponements of foreclosure sales one of those grounds is the possibility that any court of competent jurisdiction may issue an order postponing the sale.section and section,subdivision c a,when read together,establish a natural,logical whole,and one wholly consonant with the legislature intent in enacting to have individual borrowers and lenders assess and explore alternatives to foreclosure if section is not complied with,then there is no valid notice of default,and without a valid notice of default,a foreclosure sale can not proceed.the available,existing remedy is found in the ability of a court in section,subdivision c a,to postpone the sale until there has been compliance with section.reading section together with section,subdivision c a gives section real effect.the alternative would mean that the legislature conferred a right on individual borrowers in section without any means of enforcing that right.
by the same token,compliance with section is necessarily an individualized process.after all,the details of a borrower financial situation and the options open to a particular borrower to avoid foreclosure are going to vary,sometimes widely,from borrower to borrower.section is not a statute,like subdivision h of section of the insurance code construed in,which contemplates a frequent or general business practice,and thus its very text is necessarily directed at those who regulate the insurance industry.insurance code section,subdivision h begins with the words,knowingly committing or performing with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice any of the following unfair claims settlement practices see generally,supra,cal d.
rather,in order to have its obvious goal of forcing parties to communicate the statutory words are assess and explore about a borrower situation and the options to avoid foreclosure,section necessarily confers an individual right.the alternative proffered by the trial by the servicer of pooling the facially unworkable problem of fitting individual situations into collective pools.
the suggestion of one amicus that the legislature intended enforcement of section to reside within the attorney general office is one of which we express no opinion.our decision today should thus not be read as precluding such enforcement by the attorney general office.but we do note that the same problem would dog attorney general enforcement of the statute.to be sure which is why the possibility should be left open,there might,ala insurance code section,subdivision h,be lenders who systematically ignore section,and their general business practice would be susceptible to some sort of collective enforcement.even so,the attorney general office can hardly be expected to take up the cause of every individual borrower whose diverse circumstances show noncompliance with section 
application 
we now put the preceding ideas and factors together.
while the dropping of an express provision for private enforcement in the legislative process leading to section does indeed give us pause,it is outweighed by two major opposing factors.first,the very structure of section is inherently individual.that fact strongly suggests a legislative intention to allow individual enforcement of the statute.the statute would become a meaningless dead letter if no individual enforcement were allowed it would mean that the legislature created an inherently individual right and decided there was no remedy at all.
second,when section was enacted as an urgency measure,there already was an existing enforcement mechanism at.there was no need to write a provision into section allowing a borrower to obtain a postponement of a foreclosure sale,since such a remedy was already present in section.reading the two statutes together as allowing a remedy of postponement of foreclosure produces a logical and natural whole.
tender full amount of indebtedness no 
the right conferred by section is a right to be contacted to assess and explore alternatives to foreclosure prior to a notice of default.it is enforced by the postponement of a foreclosure sale.therefore it would defeat the purpose of the statute to require the borrower to tender the full amount of the indebtedness prior to any enforcement of the right that the right to be contacted prior to the notice of default.case law requiring payment or tender of the full amount of payment before any foreclosure sale can be postponed,arnolds management eischen d,it is settled that an action to set aside a trustee sale for irregularities in sale notice or procedure should be accompanied by an offer to pay the full amount of the debt for which the property was security.arises out of a paradigm where,by definition,there is no way that a foreclosure sale can be avoided absent payment of all the indebtedness.any irregularities in the sale would necessarily be harmless to the borrower if there was no full tender.see miller starr,cal.real estate ed.by contrast,the whole point of section is to create a new,even if limited right,to be contacted about the possibility of alternatives to full payment of arrearages.it would be contradictory to thwart the very operation of the statute if enforcement were predicated on full tender.it is well settled that statutes can modify common law rules,evangelatos superior court cal d,noting that civil code sections to had modified traditional common law doctrine of joint and several liability.
preempted by federal law long 
as relief under section is limited to just.historical context 
a remarkable aspect of section is that it appears to have been carefully drafted to avoid bumping into federal law,precisely because it is limited to affording borrowers only more time when lenders do not comply with the statute.to explain that,though,we need to make a digression into state debtors relief acts as they have manifested themselves in four previous periods of economic distress.
the first period of economic distress was the depression of the that played a large part in engendering the united states constitution in the first place.as chief justice charles evans hughes would later note for a majority of the united states supreme court,there was widespread distress following the revolutionary period and the plight of debtors,had called forth in the states an ignoble array of legislative schemes for the defeat of creditors and the invasion of contractual obligations.home building and loan ass blaisdell,blaisdell.consequently,the federal constitution of contains the contracts clause,which forbids states from impairing contracts.see siegel,understanding the nineteenth century contract clause the role of the distinction and takings clause jurisprudence,fn.although debtor relief legislation was frequently enacted in the confederation era,it was intensely opposed.it was among the chief motivations for the convening of the philadelphia convention,and the constitution drafted there was designed to eliminate such legislation through a variety of means.
the second period of distress arose out of the panic of,which prompted,in,the illinois state legislature to enact legislation severely restricting foreclosures the legislation gave debtors months after any foreclosure sale to redeem the property and prevented any foreclosure sale in the first place unless the sale fetched at least of the appraised value of the property.see bronson kinzie bronson blaisdell,supra,at.in an opinion,the main theme of which is the interrelationship between contract rights and legal remedies to enforce those rights see generally bronson,supra,at,the bronson court reasoned that the illinois legislation had effectively destroyed the contract rights of the lender as regards a mortgage made in.see id.at the obligation of the contract,and the rights of a party under it,may,in effect,be destroyed by denying a remedy altogether.
the third period of distress was,of course,the great depression of the.in,the minnesota legislature enacted a mortgage moratorium law that extended the period of redemption under minnesota law until.see blaisdell,supra,at.the high court majority found this law required debtors,in applying for an extension of the redemption pay the reasonable value of the income of the property,or reasonable rental value if it did produce income.id.at.the legislation was famously upheld in blaisdell.in distinguishing bronson,the blaisdell majority made the point that the statute did not substantively impair the debt the way the legislation in bronson had the statute,said the court,does not impair the integrity of the mortgage indebtedness.id.at.the court went on to emphasize the need to pay the fair rental value of the property,which,it noted,was the equivalent of possession during the extended period.
finally,the fourth period was within the living memory of many readers,namely,the extraordinary inflation and high interest rates of the late.that period engendered fidelity federal savings loan association de la cuesta de la cuesta.many mortgages had still have what is known as a clause.as it played out in the,the clause effectively required any buyer of a new home to obtain a new loan,but at the high market interest rates.to circumvent the need for a new high rate mortgage,creative financing was invented where a buyer would assume the obligation of the old mortgage,but that required the clause not be enforced.
an earlier decision of the california supreme court,wellenkamp bank of america cal d,had encouraged this sort of creative financing by holding that clauses violated california state law as an unreasonable restraint on alienation.despite that precedent,the trial judge in the de la cuesta case edward wallin,who would later join this court held that regulations issued by the federal home loan bank board,by the authority of the home owners loan act of preempted state law that invalidated clause.a california appellate court in the fourth district in an opinion by justice marcus kaufman,who would later join the california supreme court reversed the trial court.the united states supreme court,however,agreed with judge wallin determination,and reversed the appellate judgment and squarely held the state law to be preempted.
the de la cuesta court observed that the bank board regulations were plain even the california appellate court had been required to recognize that.de la cuesta,supra,at.on top of the express preemption,congress had expressed no intent to limit the bank board authority to regulate the lending practices of federal savings and loans.id.at.further,going into the history of the home owners loan act,the de la cuesta court pointed out that mortgage lending practices are a critical aspect of a savings and loan operation,and the home loan bank board had issued the regulations in order to protect the economic solvency of such lenders.see id.at.in what is perhaps the most significant part of the rationale for our purposes,the bank board had concluded that the clause is an important part of the mortgage contract,consequently its elimination would have an adverse effect on the financial stability of federally chartered lenders.id.at.for example,invalidation of the clause would make it hard for savings and loans to sell their loans in the secondary markets.ibid.
with this history behind us,we now turn to the actual regulations at issue in the case before us.
the hola regulations 
under the home owner loan act of et the federal office of thrift has issued section of title of the code of federal regulations,a regulation that itself delineates what is a matter for federal regulation,and what is a matter for state law interestingly enough,section is written in the form of examples,using the ejusdem generis approach of requiring a court to figure out what is,and what is not,in the same general class or category as the items given in the example.
on the preempted side,section includes 
terms of credit,including amortization of loans and the deferral and capitalization of interest and adjustments to the interest rate b 
balance,payments due,or term to maturity of the loan b and,most importantly for this case,
the processing,origination,servicing,sale or purchase of,or investment or participation in,mortgages.b,italics added.
on the other side,left for the state courts,is real property law.c.
we agree with the mabrys that the process of foreclosure has traditionally been a matter of state real property law,a point both noted by the united states supreme court in bfp resolution trust,and academic commentators,alexander,federal intervention in real estate finance preemption and federal common law,historically,real property law has been the exclusive domain of the states,including at least one law professor who laments that diverse state foreclosure laws tend to hinder efforts to achieve banking stability at the national level.see nelson,confronting the mortgage meltdown a brief for the federalization of state mortgage foreclosure law pepperdine,noting that mortgage foreclosure law varies from state to state,and advocating federalization of mortgage foreclosure law.by contrast,we have not been cited to anything in the federal regulations that govern such things as initiation of foreclosure,notice of foreclosure sales,allowable times until foreclosure,or redemption periods.though there are commentators,like professor nelson,who argue there should be.
given the traditional state control over mortgage foreclosure laws,it is logical to conclude that if the office of thrift supervision wanted to include foreclosure as within the preempted category of loan servicing,it would have been explicit.nothing prevented the office from simply adding the words foreclosure of to section b.
d.the extent of section 
more time and only more time 
state law should be construed,whenever possible,to be in harmony with federal law,so as to avoid having the state law invalidated by federal preemption.see greater westchester homeowners city of los angeles cal d,california arco distributors,atlantic richfield d.
we emphasize that we are able to come to our conclusion that section is not preempted by federal banking regulations because it is,or can be construed to be,very narrow.as mentioned above,there is no right,for example,under the statute,to a loan modification.
a few more comments on the scope of the statute 
first,to the degree that the words assess and explore can be narrowly or expansively construed,they must be narrowly construed in order to avoid crossing the line from state foreclosure law into federally preempted loan servicing.hence,any assessment must necessarily be on the order of,why ca you make your payments the statute can not require the lender to consider a whole new loan application or take detailed loan application information over the phone.or,as is unlikely,in person.
second,the same goes for any exploration of options to avoid foreclosure.exploration must necessarily be limited to merely telling the borrower the traditional ways that foreclosure can be avoided,deeds in lieu,workouts,or short sales,as distinct from requiring the lender to engage in a process that would be functionally indistinguishable from taking a loan application in the first place.in this regard,we note that section directs lenders to refer the borrower to the telephone number made available by the united states department of housing and urban development hud to find a housing counseling agency.the obvious implication of the statute referral clause is that the lender itself does not have any duty to become a loan counselor itself.
finally,to the degree that the assessment or exploration requirements impose,in practice,burdens on federal savings banks that might arguably push the statute out of the permissible category of state foreclosure law and into the federally preempted category of loan servicing or loan making,evidence of such a burden is necessary before the argument can be persuasive.for the time being,and certainly on this record,we can not say that section,narrowly construed,strays over the line.
given such a narrow construction,section does not,as the law in blaisdell did not,affect the integrity of the basic debt.lopez world savings loan th section preempted state law that capped payoff demand statement fees.
e.the wording of the declaration 
okay if not under penalty of perjury 
in addition to the substantive act of contacting the borrower,section requires a statement in the notice of default.the statement is found in subdivision b,which we quote here b a notice of default filed pursuant to section shall include a declaration that the mortgagee,beneficiary,or authorized agent has contacted the borrower,has tried with due diligence to contact the borrower as required by this section,or that no contact was required pursuant to subdivision h.italics added.
the idea that this declaration must be made under oath must be rejected.first,ordinary english usage of the word declaration imports no requirement that it be under oath.in the oxford english dictionary,for example,numerous definitions of the word are found,none of which of require a statement under oath or penalty of perjury.in fact,the second legal definition given actually juxtaposes the idea of a declaration against the idea of a statement under oath a simple affirmation to be taken,in certain cases,instead of an oath or solemn affirmation.oxford english dict.ed at.
second,even the venerable black law dictionary does define declaration to necessarily be under oath.its very first definition of the word is a formal statement,proclamation or announcement,esp.one embodied in an instrument.black law dict.ed at.
third,if the legislature wanted to say that the statement required in section must be under penalty of perjury,it knew how to do so.the words penalty of perjury are used in other laws governing mortgages,subdivision b the declaration provided for in this section shall be signed by the mortgagor or trustor under penalty of perjury.
and,to our point about the inherent individual operation of the very structure of subdivision b belies any insertion of a penalty of perjury requirement.the way section is set up,too many people are necessarily involved in the process for any one person to likely be in the position where he or she could swear that all three requirements of the declaration required by subdivision b were met.we note,for example,that subdivision a requires any one of three entities a mortgagee,beneficiary,or authorized agent to contact the borrower,and such entities may employ different people for that purpose.and the option under the statute of no contact being required per subdivision h further involves individuals who would,in any commercial operation,probably be different from the people employed to do the contacting.for example,the person who would know that the borrower had surrendered the keys would in all likelihood be a different person than the legal officer who would know that the borrower had filed for bankruptcy.
the argument for requiring the declaration to be under penalty of perjury relies on section of the code of civil procedure,but that reliance is misplaced.we quote all of section in the margin essentially the statute says if a statement in writing is required to be supported by sworn oath,making the statement under penalty of perjury will be sufficient.the key language is whenever,under any law of this state made pursuant to the law of this state,any matter is required to be evidenced by the sworn declaration in writing of the person making the same such matter may with like force and effect be evidenced by the unsworn declaration in writing of such person which recites that it is declared by him or her to be true under penalty of perjury italics added.the section sheds no light on whether the declaration required in section,subdivision b must be under penalty of perjury.
f.the wording of the declaration 
okay if it tracks the statute 
in light of what we have just said about the multiplicity of persons who would necessarily have to sign off on the precise category in subdivision b of the statute that would apply in order to proceed with foreclosure contact by phone,contact in person,unsuccessful attempts at contact by phone or in person,bankruptcy,borrower hiring a foreclosure consultant,surrender of keys,and the possibility that such persons might be employees of not less than three entities mortgagee,beneficiary,or authorized agent,there is no way we can divine an intention on the part of the legislature that each notice of foreclosure be custom drafted.
to which we add this important point by construing the notice requirement of section,subdivision b,to require only that the notice track the language of the statute itself,we avoid the problem of the imposition of costs beyond the minimum costs now required by our reading of the statute.
noncompliance before foreclosure 
sale affect title after foreclosure sale no 
a primary reason for california comprehensive regulation of foreclosure in the civil code is to ensure stability of title after a trustee sale.melendrez d i investment,th,comprehensive statutory scheme governing foreclosure has three purposes,one of which is to ensure that a properly conducted sale is final between the parties and conclusive as to a bona fide purchaser internal quotations omitted.
there is nothing in section that even hints that noncompliance with the statute would cause any cloud on title after an otherwise properly conducted foreclosure sale.we would merely note that under the plain language of section,read in conjunction with section,the only remedy provided is a postponement of the sale before it happens.
lender compliance in this case 
somebody is not telling the truth and it the trial court job to determine who it is 
we have already recounted the conflict in the evidence before the trial court regarding whether there was compliance with section.rarely,in fact,are stories so diametrically opposite according to the mabrys,there was no contact at all.according to aurora,not only were there numerous contacts,but the mabrys even initiated a proposal by which their attorney would buy the property.
somebody not telling the truth,but appellate courts do not resolve conflicts in evidence.trial courts do.butt state of california cal th,fn.moreover,diaz and bezemek concede the proffered evidence is disputed appellate courts will not resolve such factual conflicts.this case will obviously have to be remanded for an evidentiary hearing.
is this case suitable for 
class action treatment no 
as we have seen,section contemplates facts.one borrower might not pick up the telephone,one lender might only call at the same time each day in violation of the statute,one lender might incorrectly try to get away with a form letter,one borrower might,like the old twilight zone pitchman episode,try to keep the caller on the line but change the subject and talk about anything but alternatives to foreclosure,one borrower might,as aurora asserts here,try to have his or her attorney do a deal that avoids foreclosure,etcetera.
in short,how in the world would a court certify a class consider that in this case,there is even a dispute over the basic facts as to whether the lender attempted to comply at all.we do not have,under these facts at least,a question of a clean,systematic policy on the part of a lender that might be amenable to a class action or perhaps enforcement by the attorney general.this case is not one,to be blunt,where the lender admits that it simply ignored the statute and proceeded on the theory that federal law had preempted it.we express no opinion as to any scenario where a lender simply ignored the statute sort of scenario is why we do not preclude,a priori,class actions and have not expressed an opinion as to whether the attorney general or a private party in such a situation might indeed seek to enforce section in a class action.
consequently,while we must grant the writ petition so as to allow the mabrys a hearing on the factual merits of compliance,we deny it insofar as it seeks reinstatement of any claims qua class action.by the same token,in light of the limited right to time conferred under section,we also deny the writ petition insofar as it seeks reinstatement of any claim for money damages 
iv.conclusion 
let a writ issue instructing the trial court to decide whether or not aurora complied with section.to the degree that the trial court order precludes the assertion of any class action claims,we deny the writ.if the trial court finds that aurora has complied with section,foreclosure may proceed.if not,it shall be postponed until aurora files a new notice of default in the wake of substantive compliance with section.
given that this writ petition is granted in part and denied in part,each side will bear its own costs in this proceeding.
all further undesignated statutory references will be to the civil code.we will quote relevant portions of the text of section in part.of this opinion.
we do not address the content of any legislation that may now be making its way through the legislature which may amend,supplement or otherwise modify section.
aurora loan services will be referred to as aurora.we also do not burden readers with the technical distinctions in mortgage law between mortgagors,mortgagees,trustors,or trustees.for purposes of this case,there are only two categories,lenders and borrowers.
which is interesting by itself.the original complaint was clearly drafted to be a class action vehicle.the caption listed what appear to be pretty much everybody in the real estate financing business in california,but the text of the original complaint merely asserted that the defendants in the case were doing business as primary real estate lenders.it contained none of the allegations one typically sees in class action pleadings.
by foreclosure in this opinion,we mean nonjudicial foreclosure,which is overwhelmingly preferred by all,they do have to hire any lawyers to effect it.
