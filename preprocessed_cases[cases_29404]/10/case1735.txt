plaintiffs appeal from a judgment entered after the trial court sustained defendants demurrer without leave to amend.plaintiffs allege that defendant merit property management,wrongfully charged certain fees in connection with the transfer of title for home purchases.we find the facts alleged fail to state a claim on which relief can be granted,and therefore the trial court properly sustained defendants demurrer.because plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that further amendment will cure the complaint deficiencies,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying further leave to amend,and we affirm.
merit property management,merit is in the business of managing residential common interest developments,typically known as homeowner associations associations.some homeowners belong to more than one association,because their home resides in both a master and sub association.associations enter into written contracts with merit to provide management services.
in april,plaintiffs william berryman and betty berryman,as trustees of the berryman family trust collectively plaintiffs or the berrymans sold a home located in two associations managed by merit.they allege that merit charged them in document fees and in transfer fees for each association,of which was paid by the buyers.these fees were not remitted to the associations,but retained by merit.
in march,plaintiffs filed a putative class and representative action against merit,several other entities that appear to be related,and doe defendants.alleging nine separate causes of action,the gravamen of the complaint was that merit wrongfully charged homeowners such as the berrymans document and transfer fees upon the purchase or sale of their residence.plaintiffs alleged these fees were in excess of those permitted by statute,specifically civil code section subsequent statutory references,unless specified,are to the civil code.
the complaint thus alleged merit had violated section and was liable under any number of theories,including violation of business and professions code section,et the unfair competition law or ucl,section,et the consumer legal remedies act or clra,money had and received,breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud,negligence and negligence per se,and several equitable claims.plaintiffs also sought class certification.
merit filed a demurrer and motion to strike,but on the day before the hearing was set plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint.the first amended complaint again cited section,asserting this limited the amount merit could charge.the same nine causes of action were alleged.merit again demurred and the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.
plaintiffs then filed a second amended complaint sac,alleging the same nine causes of action.the gravamen of the complaint was also the same.with regard to the document fees,plaintiffs alleged that merit routinely charged sellers for documents that had not been requested,regardless of whether merit actually provided them.with regard to the transfer fees,plaintiffs alleged the fee of per association was improper because it was not authorized by statute or by the contract between merit and the association.plaintiffs further alleged that merit concealed the true nature and amount of these fees,both with regard to the homeowners to whom they were charged and to the associations.
again merit demurred,and this time the trial court sustained the demurrer without further leave to amend,entering judgment in merit favor on december.plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration,attaching their proposed third amended complaint,which deleted all references to section.the court denied reconsideration and entered an amended judgment in favor of merit.plaintiffs now appeal the court ruling sustaining the demurrer to the sac.they argue it properly states a cause of action,or in the alternative,that they should be permitted another opportunity to amend the complaint.
discussiona.standard of review 
in reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer,we are guided by rules.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.citation.blank kirwan cal d.we review the trial court decision de novo.mccall pacificare of,cal th,d.
b.the underlying statutory scheme 
the common interest development act the act et governs homeowner associations.the act consolidated the statutory law governing condominiums and other common interest developments common interest developments are required to be managed by a homeowners association,subd.a,defined as a nonprofit corporation or unincorporated association created for the purpose of managing a common interest development,subd.a,which homeowners are generally mandated to join citation.villa de las palmas homeowners terifaj cal th,d,fn.omitted.
associations may hire managing agents to conduct operations.a managing agent is not a employee of the association,but is a person or entity who,for compensation or in expectation of compensation,exercises control over the assets of a common interest development,subd.b.
one task that managing agents may perform is facilitating the transfer of ownership when a residence in an association is sold.a seller is required to provide rather extensive documentation regarding the association,and at the seller request,the association must provide these documents to the seller within days of a written request,subds.a,b.the association may charge a reasonable fee for this service based upon the association actual cost to procure,prepare,and reproduce the requested items,subd.b.
with respect to the transfer of title,section,subdivision c states,in relevant part,that neither an association nor a community service organization or similar entity may impose or collect any assessment,penalty,or fee in connection with a transfer of title or any other interest except for the following a an amount not to exceed the association actual costs to change its records in this case,plaintiffs are essentially arguing that merit,like the association referred to in section,can not charge a fee greater than its actual cost to reproduce documents or to transfer title records.
c.the brown decision and its application 
in,this court decided brown professional community management,th,d brown.in that case,a homeowner against her association and its management company,alleging that the fees the management company charged for providing collection services to the association were illegal.the trial court had sustained the defendants demurrer to brown complaint,which alleged that the fees violated section,giving rise to claims under the clra and for negligence,among others.id.at,d.
the decision began by noting the language of section,which states an association shall not impose or collect an assessment or fee that exceeds the amount necessary to defray the costs for which it is levied.citation.brown,supra,th at,d.the court rejected brown argument that this restriction also applied to management companies the statute prohibits an association from charging fees or assessments in excess of the costs for which the fee or assessment is charged.as noted ante,an association is a defined term under the act,and the definition requires the association to be a nonprofit entity.in contrast,the act imposes separate duties on a managing agent.see.and those statutory duties are owed to the association and its board of directors,not to individual owners of separate property interests in the common interest development.significantly,the act does not require a managing agent to be a nonprofit entity.it is clear,both from the definitions in the act and from the separately imposed duties,the legislature meant association,when it used that term,and it meant managing agent,when it used that term.id.at,d.
the same reasoning applies to the instant case.like the language in section,section statute permits an association to charge a reasonable fee for this service based upon the association actual costs,subd.b.further,an association may charge a fee for transfer of title in an amount not to exceed the association actual costs,subd.c a.these limitations,like those in section,apply to the association,not its managing agent,for the same reasons.
the brown court then went on to construe the statute thus,we understand the section prohibition,which runs expressly against an association,to mean,for example,that fees or assessments levied against homeowners for the purpose of defraying the cost of mowing the grass in the common areas,or of painting the association clubhouse,or of replacing the deck of the association swimming pool,or any other of the myriad of the association management and maintenance responsibilities,may not exceed the cost to the association for providing those services.brown,supra,th at,d.
as the court noted,the costs incurred by the association,for which it levies an assessment or charges a fee,necessarily include the fees and profit the vendor charges for its services.while section prohibits an association from marking up the incurred charge to generate a profit for itself,the vendor is not similarly restricted.plaintiff would have it that no vendor selling its services to an association could charge a fee,or,indeed,continue in business as a enterprise.that can not be the law.brown,supra,th at,d.
the same logic applies to section.as in brown,an association costs for purposes of the statute include the fees and profit the vendor charges for its services.brown,supra,th at,d.as the court noted in brown,the statutory language prevents associations from charging inflated fees for documents and for transfer of title and using those fees for other purposes it does not constrain the amount a managing agent may charge for these services.competitive forces,not the statute,will constrain the vendors fees and charges.ibid.this is no different with respect to section,and plaintiffs arguments to the contrary are entirely unpersuasive indeed,there is no way we could logically reach a different conclusion without contradicting brown,and as its holding stands on firm ground both logically and legally,we decline to do so.
d.the gravamen of plaintiffs claims 
despite using slightly different language,each of plaintiffs nine causes of action is predicated on the notion that merit practice of charging document and transfer fees is impermissible,based either on merit contract with each association or on section.if this fundamental assumption is untrue,plaintiffs claims can not stand.
throughout its briefs and in the court below,plaintiffs repeatedly stated that merit charges are unauthorized that is,not specifically permitted by statute or contract.the implication,however,that a business must have statutory or contractual authorization for providing a service to a third party and charging a fee for that service,is fundamentally flawed.indeed,it is up to plaintiffs to demonstrate why a statute or a contract prohibits merit from doing so.
as discussed above,we reject plaintiffs assertion that section renders the document and transfer charges unlawful.in addition to relying on section,plaintiffs also assert that the management contracts limit the amount merit may charge for documents and transfer fees.no management contract is attached to the sac,which alleges both that the contract does not permit merit to charge such fees at all,but even if it did,both the management contracts and civil code limit merit charges to for only the actual cost to the client associations.the sac also alleges that merit charges for documents are limited to cents per page for copying.
the problem with these allegations is that plaintiffs are not parties to the contract with associations are.even assuming the allegations are true,plaintiffs are at best incidental beneficiaries and have no standing to recover under the contract.southern cal.gas abc construction d.by the same logic,plaintiffs can not use the contracts to bootstrap liability under other theories,such as the ucl,clra or common law theories such as negligence.permitting such recovery would completely destroy the principle that a third party can not sue on a contract to which he or she is merely an incidental beneficiary.
as we address plaintiffs claims below,we shall try to prevent repeating these points.to the extent a cause of action relies on either violation of section or breach of the contracts between merit and the associations,the claim can not be maintained.
e.the ucl claims 
the ucl is codified in business and professions code section et.the ucl prohibits any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.because business and professions code section is written in the disjunctive,it establishes three varieties of unfair or practices which are unlawful,or unfair,or fraudulent.podolsky first healthcare th,d.an act can be alleged to violate any or all of the three prongs of the,unfair,or fraudulent.
the unlawful prong of the ucl 
under its unlawful prong,the ucl borrows violations of other laws and makes those unlawful practices actionable under the ucl.lazar hertz th,d.thus,a violation of another law is a predicate for stating a cause of action under the ucl unlawful prong.in attempting to state a claim under this prong of the ucl,the sac provides a laundry list of state and federal statutes merit allegedly violated.these include theft by false pretenses,federal mail and wire fraud,breach of warranty of authority,and several parts of the act,and business and professions code.
while purporting to incorporate its factual allegations by reference,the sac nonetheless fails to plead facts to support its allegations that merit has violated each of these statutes.for example,with respect to penal code section,we are unable to find factual allegations asserting reliance or false pretense the allegation that the fees are unauthorized is a legal conclusion.with regard to mail and wire fraud,the sac does not allege facts supporting a specific intent to defraud or use of the federal mail or telephone wires to do so.
with respect to the purported breach of the warranty of authority,plaintiffs assert this means that merit warrants to sellers that it has the authority from its associations to impose document and transfer fees.the restatement,however,defines such a breach as making a contract or representation on behalf of another whom he has no power to bind.rest d agency.the sac alleges that the management contracts state merit is to act on the association behalf with respect to transferring ownership and that such charges,which shall be reasonable fees as allowed within the c ivil c ode shall be charged to the owner.as the sac expressly alleges that merit has an agent authority in this matter,it fails to allege a violation of the breach of the warranty of authority.
with respect to section,plaintiffs claim merit violates this statute by retaining funds that belong to the associations.yet there is nothing pled to support the implied assertion that the document and transfer fees belong to the associations,rather than to merit for performing the service.
we have already rejected plaintiffs contention that merit conduct violates section,and we shall address the claim under the clra separately below.
the unfair prong of the ucl 
under the ucl,a n act or practice is unfair if the consumer injury is substantial,is not outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition,and is not an injury the consumers themselves could reasonably have avoided.daugherty american honda motor,th.
plaintiffs argue they have sufficiently alleged a claim und
