introduction 
plaintiff and appellant dana bruns plaintiff brought an action in the orange county superior court in.there were various amendments and substitutions of parties.the trial court stayed proceedings and then lifted the stay for discovery.it then stayed proceedings pending resolution of an appeal in another case.there were further stays of discovery and a stay of all proceedings in connection with a petition for coordination with other cases.the petition for coordination was granted and the case transferred to the los angeles superior court.plaintiff obtained a default as to certain defendants.proceedings were again stayed,with that stay lifted only for purposes of serving unserved parties.ultimately the discovery stay was lifted.
the trial court granted a motion to dismiss the action pursuant to code of civil procedure section which requires dismissal of an action not brought to trial within five years of the commencement of the action.the trial court,under section,subdivision b excluded from the computation of time when an action must be brought to trial,only periods when the entire action was stayed.the trial court did not rule on the alternative motion to dismiss under section for the failure of plaintiff to serve a party with a summons and complaint.discretionary dismissal under section,subdivision a was not raised in the trial court.
on appeal from the judgment entered in the dismissal order,we hold that a partial stay of an action constitutes a stay of the prosecution of the action within the meaning of section,subdivision b,and therefore,the trial court erred in dismissing the action under section.as discussed in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we remand the matter to the trial court to rule on the motion brought under section to serve timely the summons and complaint.
background 
on february,plaintiff brought an action in orange county superior court on behalf of herself and a putative class of others similarly situated,against defendant and respondent exchange,ecx,flagstar bank,clayton shurley texas bbq,and does through,inclusive,for allegedly sending unsolicited advertisements to telephone facsimile machines in violation of the telephone consumer protection act of tcpa,section b c.through subsequent amendments ending in a fifth amended complaint and substitutions for fictitiously named defendants,plaintiff added causes of action for violation of california unfair competition law ucl bus,et and negligence,and named additional defendants and respondents csb partnership csb perez,llc csb hinckley,llc csb mccray,llc csb ellison,llc csb humbach,llc chris tad enterprises csb defendants clayton shurley dba clayton shurley texas bbq clayton shurley real bbq,elliot mccrosky dba california homefinders and e n financial daniel quon daniel quon,and,on may,on a petition for coordination by defendants,and kevin katz who,apparently,is no longer a party to this action,plaintiff case was transferred to the superior court in los angeles county for coordination with other cases.
on may,the trial court,judge william mcdonald,imposed a discovery stay and ruled that plaintiff eight pending discovery motions were rendered moot by the stay.the trial court minute order states,discovery is ordered stayed until the entry of cmo case management order.ecx notice of ruling states,all discovery,discovery issues and motions are stayed pending further order of the court on june,the trial court entered a case management order that states,in part,on may,this court stayed discovery pending entry of a case management order the stay on discovery is hereby lifted.the trial court june,minute order states that two motions to compel discovery set for june,were moot and,thus,vacated.on july,the trial court further clarified its prior orders with respect to the reopening of discovery.the trial court ruled that,except for certain identified interrogatories,all discovery,if deemed necessary or advisable to the propounding party,would need to be.all previous discovery motions remain vacated and moot as a result of this ruling.
on june,the trial court stayed this action for all purposes pending resolution of the appeal in kaufman acs systems,th,d,which case addresses,in relevant part,whether a plaintiff has a private right of action for a violation of the tcpa in state court.on october,after the court of appeal opinion in kaufman acs systems,that recognized such a cause of action id.at,d,the trial court lifted the stay in this action.
on december,the trial court held a review hearing at which it ordered that all discovery is stayed.on january,the trial court lifted the stay.
on january,the trial court set a hearing for march,on the petition for coordination and ordered,all hearings,orders,motions,discovery or other proceedings are hereby stayed in all cases subject of sic the petition for coordination until a determination whether coordination is appropriate.on april,the trial court granted the petition for coordination.on may,this case was assigned to judge charles mccoy of the los angeles superior court.the assignment order states,immediately upon assignment,the coordination trial judge may exercise all the powers over each coordinated action of a judge of the court in which that action is pending.
on january,plaintiff obtained entry of ecx default.on january,plaintiff obtained entry of csb partnership default.on november,upon motions,the trial court set aside the entry of defaults against ecx and csb partnership.
on august,judge mccoy issued an order setting the initial status conference for august.in the order,judge mccoy also ordered,to facilitate the orderly conduct of this action,all discovery,motion and pleading activity is temporarily stayed pending further order of this court.at the initial status conference on august,judge mccoy ordered,the stay is lifted for the sole purpose of serving any unserved parties.further,judge mccoy set october,for hearing any motions re lifting stay so as to enforce existing judgment.judge mccoy never did lift the august,stay.
on april,los angeles superior court judge carolyn kuhl,to whom this case was reassigned effective january,entered a discovery order that required,among other things,that respondents respond to specified interrogatories and document requests.judge kuhl set a deposition date for,and permitted other depositions to be scheduled,but did not otherwise lift the stay imposed on august.on july,judge kuhl lifted the stay on discovery,and ordered that the parties may conduct open discovery.
on november,the csb defendants,except for csb partnership,filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff fifth amended complaint on the ground that plaintiff failed to serve the csb defendants other than csb partnership with a summons and complaint within three years of the commencement of the action as required by section,and on the ground that plaintiff failed to bring her action to trial within the statutory period as required by sections and.csb partnership and apparently all other defendants except flagstar bank subsequently joined this motion to dismiss the action 
on november,ecx moved to dismiss plaintiff fifth amended complaint pursuant to sections and,subdivision b on the ground that plaintiff failed to bring her action to trial within the statutory period.it appears that all defendants joined ecx motion the trial court granted respondents motion to dismiss under sections and,ruling that plaintiff failed to bring her action to trial within the required time.
in ruling on respondents motion to dismiss plaintiff fifth amended complaint,the trial court under section,subdivision b,excluded certain time periods.it ruled that the period from may,when there was an order staying discovery to june,was included within the period within which plaintiff was to bring her action to trial,because significant litigation activity occurred during the period.the trial court ruled,it was not impossible,impracticable or futile to progress toward bringing this action to trial pursuant to section c.in making its ruling,the trial court also rejected plaintiff argument that the may,stay was lifted on july,rather than on june.
the trial court excluded from the period within which plaintiff was to bring her action to trial the period from june,when there was an order staying proceedings pending an appeal in another case,to october.the trial court ruled that the period from december,when there was an order staying discovery,to january,was included within the period within which plaintiff was to bring her action to trial because it was not impossible impracticable or futile to make progress toward bringing this action to trial pursuant to section c.in its ruling,the trial court noted that in her opposition to the petition for coordination,plaintiff stated that her case has been aggressively litigated,with extensive discovery and law and motion undertaken.activities in the bruns action are largely completed.
the trial court excluded from the period the period from january,when all proceedings were stayed pending resolution of the petition to coordinate proceedings,until may.the trial court noted that the periods during which ecx and csb partnership were in default overlapped with other periods that it had excluded from the period within which plaintiff was to bring her action to trial.the trial court ruled that the periods that did not overlap with other excluded periods were included within the period because counsel for the defaulting respondents claimed not to have been served with the operative complaint and offered to stipulate to set aside the defaults,and plaintiff counsel chose not to agree to the stipulation,thus rejecting a means of continuing with the action.in addition,the trial court ruled it was not impossible,impracticable,or futile to bring plaintiff action to trial during the period of the defaults,as other litigation activity continued.
the trial court excluded from the period,the period from august,when the trial court ordered a temporary stay to august,when the trial court lifted the stay solely for purposes of serving unserved parties.in so ruling,the trial court rejected plaintiff contention that the stay remained in effect until the trial court lifted the discovery stay on july,instead ruling that judge mccoy lifted the stay at the initial status conference on august.the trial court determined that the period expired on october,and because the trial had not been set by that date dismissed the action.
plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.pursuant to a request from this court,the parties addressed the consequences of the trial court failure to rule on the motion to dismiss under section.
discussion 
dismissal under sections and for plaintiff failure to bring her action to trial within the period 
plaintiff contends that the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing her action under sections and for failure to bring the action to trial within the period.plaintiff contends that various periods of time should have been,but were not,excluded from the period such that her action should not have been dismissed.we agree.

application of relevant legal principles 
an action must be brought to trial within five years after a plaintiff commences an action against a defendant.an action is commenced within the meaning of section upon the filing of the plaintiff original complaint.bank of america superior court d.the time requirements for bringing an action to trial are mandatory and are not subject to extension,excuse,or exception except as expressly provided by statute,subd.b.in computing the time within which an action must be brought to trial pursuant to this article,there shall be excluded the time during which any of the following conditions existed a the jurisdiction of the court to try the action was suspended.b prosecution or trial of the action was stayed or enjoined.c bringing the action to trial,for any other reason,was impossible,impracticable,or futile.the trial court shall dismiss an action that is not timely brought to trial,subd.a.
on january,the trial court ordered that all hearings,orders,motions,discovery or other proceedings are hereby stayed in all cases subject of sic the petition for coordination until a determination whether coordination is appropriate.the petition for coordination was granted and this case was transferred to judge mccoy.on august,judge mccoy ordered that all discovery,motion and pleading activity was stayed.on august,judge mccoy ordered the stay lifted for the sole purpose of serving any unserved parties.judge mccoy did not lift the august,stay.neither did judge kuhl,except that on july,she lifted the stay only on discovery.thus,there was in effect a stay as to any trial,and that stay was never removed.it might be argued that the august,stay constitutes a stay of the trial of the action under section,subdivision b that was never removed.but the parties do not make such an argument,and it appears that what occurred was a stay under section,subdivision b of the prosecution of the action rather than a stay or enjoinder of the trial of the action.
the parties disagree on whether discovery stays constitute stays of the prosecution of the action under section,subdivision b.we have found no case that defines the term prosecution as it is used in subdivision b of section.in melancon superior court cal d,however,our supreme court stated that the taking of depositions constitutes a step in the prosecution of an action.id.at.the supreme court based this statement on its earlier holding in ray wong earle anthony,cal,in which it stated,the term prosecution is sufficiently comprehensive to include every step in an action from its commencement to its final determination.melancon superior court,supra,cal d at.we construe melancon superior court and ray wong earle anthony,as standing for the proposition that the prosecution of an action is a broad concept encompassing all of the various steps in an action,including,but not limited to,pleading,discovery,and law and motion.each of the various steps in an action constitutes prosecution of that action.
stays of prosecution under section,subdivision b 
plaintiff argues that a partial stay,such as a stay of discovery,is a stay of the prosecution of an action covered by subdivision b of section respondents argue that subdivision b of section excludes only those stays that concern the prosecution of the entire action,not stays that concern only certain aspects of the prosecution of an action.we agree with plaintiff.
in holland dave altman center d,the court of appeal addressed the meaning of the term stay in subdivision b of section and stated,the parties cite no reported decisions construing the term stay as used in section,and we have found none.the term,however,appears to have a commonly understood meaning as an indefinite postponement of an act or the operation of some consequence,pending the occurrence of a designated event.thus,in people santana d,a case involving the stay of a sentence,the court concluded that a stay is a temporary suspension of a procedure in a case until the happening of a defined contingency.black law dictionary ed page defines the term as a suspension of the case or some designated proceedings within it.we agree with the view expressed in holland dave altman center that a stay within the meaning of subdivision b of section includes a temporary suspension of a procedure in a case or a suspension of designated proceedings within a case.
that a stay of certain types of proceedings within an partial stay of an a stay of prosecution under subdivision b of section,is consistent with the general policy favoring trial over dismissal for failure to prosecute an action in ocean services ventura port dist.th,d,the court of appeal stated,code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,provides that the period shall be tolled if p rosecution or trial of the action was stayed or enjoined.the statute is unconditional and is intended to have uniform application.this is consistent with the treatment given other statutory excuses it increases certainty and minimizes the need for a judicial hearing to ascertain whether or not the statutory period has run.cal.law revision com.it also is consistent with the general policy favoring trial over dismissal.holland dave altman center d.it would be unfair to force a party to request a trial when it has been deprived of an element of pretrial proceedings.the suggestion that this interpretation is flawed because it requires the implicit addition of a word to the statute partial before the word stay equally applies to respondents interpretation that is necessarily premised on the implicit addition of the word entire before the word stay.
plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in failing to exclude,under section,subdivision b,three periods from the period within which plaintiff was to bring her action to trial the period from may,to july,the period from december,to january,and the period from august,to july.
may,to july,days 
as set forth above,on may,the trial court issued a minute order staying discovery until the entry of a case management order.on june,the trial court entered a case management order that,in part,lifted the may,discovery stay.on july,the trial court further clarified its prior order with respect to reopening discovery and ordered that except for certain interrogatories,all prior discovery,if deemed necessary or advisable,would have to be and that all prior discovery motions remained vacated.because a discovery stay is a stay of prosecution under section,subdivision b,the trial court should have excluded the days from may,to june,from the period within which plaintiff was to bring her action to trial.
plaintiff contends that the trial court june,case management order that states,on may,this court stayed discovery pending entry of a case management order the stay on discovery is hereby lifted did not lift the may,discovery stay.instead,plaintiff contends that the trial court intended the stay to continue beyond june,and that the discovery stay was not lifted until the trial court order on july.as support for this contention,plaintiff notes that the notice of ruling for the may,hearing states,all discovery,discovery issues and motions are stayed pending further order of the court at the june,hearing,the trial court simultaneously entered the case management order and vacated two discovery motions pursuant to the may,order and,on july,the trial court ordered that all discovery that had been propounded prior to the stay would have to be.
plaintiff is mistaken.the trial court entered a discovery stay on may,and ordered that stay lifted on june.that the trial court vacated two discovery motions and lifted the discovery stay on the same date and later clarified that its prior order lifting the discovery stay required that previous discovery be does not manifest the intent to continue the stay.
december,to january,days 
on december,the trial court held a review hearing at which it stayed all discovery.on january,the trial court lifted the stay.the trial court should have excluded the days from december,to january,from the period within which plaintiff was to bring her action to trial because,as we have held,a discovery stay is a stay of prosecution under section,subdivision b.
august,to july,days 
on august,judge mccoy set an initial status conference for august.in that order,judge mccoy ordered,to facilitate the orderly conduct of this action,all discovery,motion and pleading activity is temporarily stayed pending further order of this court.at the initial status conference on august,judge mccoy ordered,the stay is lifted for the sole purpose of serving any unserved parties.judge mccoy also set october,for hear ing any motions re lifting stay so as to enforce existing judgment.
in discussing this time period in its ruling on respondents motion to dismiss plaintiff fifth amended complaint,the trial court ruled that judge mccoy lifted the august,stay on august.the trial court said,however,as discussed above,that further order came when judge mccoy held an initial status conference on august,and lifted the stay.the prior discussion to which the trial court apparently refers is to its earlier comments in its order the court gave its further order and the temporary stay was lifted when the court held its initial status conference on august.ecx supplemental brief,notice of lodgment,exh.ccc,minute order at the stay is lifted for the sole purpose of serving any unserved parties.therefore,only the period from august,the date of judge mccoy initial status conference order temporarily staying proceedings,to august,the date of the initial status conference when judge mccoy lifted the temporary stay,counts to toll the statutory period.this prior discussion confirms that judge mccoy lifted the stay only for a very narrow serve any parties.moreover,the preceding paragraph in judge mccoy minute order demonstrates that judge mccoy did not lift the august,stay in its entirety.in that paragraph,judge mccoy set october,for motions to lift the stay to enforce an existing judgment.if judge mccoy had entirely lifted the august,stay,there would have been no need to set such a hearing date.
on april,the trial court entered a discovery order requiring,among other things,that respondents respond to specified interrogatories and document requests the commencement of a deposition for,and the permission that other depositions be scheduled.the trial court did not otherwise lift the discovery stay imposed on august.on july,the trial court lifted the stay on discovery,and ordered that the parties may conduct open discovery.accordingly,because the august,stay was not lifted until july,and a partial stay is a stay of prosecution of the action under section,subdivision b,the trial court should have excluded the days from august,to july,from the period within which plaintiff was to bring her action to trial.
the trial court active management of litigation 
respondents contend that the stays at issue under section,subdivision b may,to june,december,to january,and august,to july,part of the trial court active management of plaintiff action and,thus,should be included within the period.in support of their argument,respondents rely on california rules of court,rules a and b rule a provides,a complex case is an action that requires exceptional judicial management to avoid placing unnecessary burdens on the court or the litigants and to expedite the case,keep costs reasonable,and promote effective decision making by the court,the parties,and counsel.rule b provides,in part,the coordination trial judge must assume an active role in managing all steps of the pretrial,discovery,and trial proceedings to expedite the just determination of the coordinated actions without delay.that these periods were part of the trial court active management of plaintiff action,respondents contend,is demonstrated by the fact that substantial litigation activity such as discovery and the filing of pleadings and during these periods.
although discovery was conducted during the period after judge mccoy august,order that included a stay of all discovery,that discovery was limited.judge mccoy august,order lifted the stay for the sole purpose of serving any unserved parties and did not permit discovery,and judge kuhl april,discovery order required and permitted only certain discovery.it was not until july,that judge kuhl lifted the stay on discovery,and ordered that the parties may conduct open discovery.although within the stay period,there was limited discovery,status conferences,and certain activity,the fact remains that judge mccoy august,order lifted the stay for a limited purpose and respondents have not identified any subsequent from judge kuhl july,lifted the stay.the stay order prevented plaintiff from fully conducting all of the pretrial activities to which she was entitled.that certain activity specifically authorized by the trial court occurred,does not alter that fact.thus,prosecution of the action was stayed.
respondents contention that the periods contested under subdivision b of section were subject to the trial court active management of plaintiff action and,thus,should be included within the period is unavailing.respondents cite no case,rule of court,or code of civil procedure section that exempts a trial court actions in actively managing a complex or coordinated action from the provisions of subdivision b of section.when a trial court issues a partial as a stay of its active management of a complex or coordinated action,thus impeding a plaintiff prosecution of the action,the period of such impediment is excluded from the period under section,subdivision b 
respondents further contend that any argument that the trial court active management of plaintiff action prevented plaintiff from bringing her action to trial should be rejected because the plaintiff in amkraut pacific coast office products,an action coordinated with plaintiff action here,brought that action to trial within the period even though the action was filed nearly nine months after plaintiff here filed her action.plaintiff does not argue that the trial court active management of her action prevented her from timely bringing her action to trial.plaintiff argues that the trial court should have excluded the contested periods from the period because these periods were stays within the meaning of subdivision b of section.moreover,the ability of another party in a different,coordinated action to move successfully to certify a class and to bring that action to trial more expeditiously than plaintiff did here may have been the result of any number of factors not before us,such as less complex pleadings,less discovery,fewer discovery disputes,or fewer defendants.what transpired in a different action,even if coordinated,has no bearing on the application of sections and to this action.as shown here,trials of coordinated actions may occur separately.rule b.
respondents finally contend that if plaintiff was dissatisfied with the trial court active management of her action,she was under a duty to challenge the status quo or alert the trial court to the potential running of the period.but if the periods discussed above are excluded from the period under subdivision b of section,as they should be,there was no impending running of the period about which plaintiff should have alerted the trial court.
impossible,impracticable,or futile under section,subdivision c 
the plaintiff has the burden of proving that it was impossible,impracticable,or futile to bring an action to trial within the period in sections and.tamburina combined ins.of america th,d.the impossibility,impracticability,and futility exceptions to the dismissal statute must be interpreted liberally,consistent with the policy favoring trial on the merits.baccus superior court d.t he critical factor in applying these exceptions is whether the plaintiff exercised reasonable diligence in prosecuting her case.thus,the dismissal statute may not be applied if plaintiff is unable to bring her suit to trial due to causes beyond her control,nor should it penalize conduct that is entirely reasonable.taylor hayes d.sanchez city of los angeles th,d for the tolling provision of section to apply,there must be a period of impossibility,impracticability or futility,over which plaintiff had no control.
the determination whether it was impossible,impracticable,or futile to bring a case to trial within a given time period is generally fact specific,depending on the obstacles faced by the plaintiff in prosecuting the action and the plaintiff exercise of reasonable diligence in overcoming those obstacles.citation.howard thrifty drug discount stores cal th,d.an action is not tolled for delays that a plaintiff,with reasonable diligence,might have avoided.lauriton carnation d.in lauriton carnation,the plaintiff claimed that it was impossible,impracticable,or futile for him to prosecute his action during his bankruptcy.ibid.the court of appeal rejected the plaintiff tolling claim because the plaintiff could have sought relief from the bankruptcy court to prosecute his action.ibid.because the plaintiff failed to use every reasonable effort to bring his action to trial,the court of appeal held,the plaintiff did not exercise reasonable diligence in prosecuting his case.ibid.
plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in failing to exclude,under section,subdivision c,three periods from the period within which plaintiff was to bring her action to trial plaintiff contends that the trial court should have excluded the period from march,to may,the period from may,to august,and the period during which ecx and csb partnership were in default from january,to november.in contrast to the periods plaintiff contends should have been excluded under,subdivision b,these periods are not periods during which a stay was imposed.instead,they are periods during which plaintiff contends she could not prosecute her action due to some cause beyond her control that made it impossible,impracticable,or futile to bring her action to trial,subd.c.
march,to may,days 
on march,and,plaintiff served demands for inspection of documents,special and form interrogatories,and requests for admissions on defendants not parties to this appeal.thereafter,plaintiff filed motions to compel responses to her discovery.on may,the trial court imposed a discovery stay and ruled that eight of plaintiff pending discovery motions were rendered moot by the stay.on june,the trial court lifted the may,discovery stay and ruled that plaintiff two remaining motions to compel were moot and ordered them vacated.on july,the trial court,clarifying its prior order reopening discovery,ruled that,except for certain identified interrogatories,all previously propounded discovery would have to be,and all discovery motions remained moot and vacated.
discovery is an essential component of bringing an action to trial.plaintiff commenced her action on february,and first propounded discovery on march.plaintiff could not have begun discovery any earlier and,thus,was reasonably diligent in prosecuting her action.taylor hayes,supra,d at.the trial court orders of may,and june,as clarified by the trial court july,order,rendered nugatory plaintiff discovery activity during the period from march,to may,prior to the stay.the trial court actions were beyond plaintiff control sanchez city of los angeles,supra,th at,d,and the delay in discovery brought about by the trial court orders was not a delay that plaintiff,with reasonable diligence,might have avoided lauriton carnation,supra,d at.
respondents acknowledge that the trial court orders voided plaintiff discovery during the contested period,but argue that other litigation activity was conducted during the period,including other discovery.respondents point out that during the contested period,ecx answered plaintiff interrogatories on april,csb partnership responded to plaintiff first set of document requests on may,and csb partnership produced responsive documents on may.the discovery to which respondents refer was responded to prior to the trial court orders.that other litigation activity,including certain discovery,was conducted during the period of march,to may,does not change the fact that the trial court orders,in effect,rendered all of plaintiff from discovery already completed at the time of the trial court.the trial court action eliminated what was done during an earlier period obviously it was impossible for plaintiff to conduct discovery during a period that had already passed.
citing gentry nielsen d.and tejada blas d,respondents argue that the period for bringing an action to trial is not extended for discovery disputes.although plaintiff motions to compel responses to discovery were filed during the period in question and ordered vacated by the trial court,the basis for plaintiff contention that the period from march,to may,should have been excluded from the period is not that a discovery dispute prevented her from conducting the discovery during that period rather it is that the trial court orders,in effect,nullified her discovery.
because plaintiff acted with reasonable diligence and could not have avoided the delay in discovery,plaintiff met her burden her of proving that it was impossible,impracticable,or futile with respect to the discovery at issue during the days from march,to may.tamburina combined ins.of america,supra,th at,d.accordingly,the trial court should have excluded that period from the period within which plaintiff was to bring her action to trial.
may,to august,days 
on may,judge mccoy was designated as the judge for coordination proceedings.in support of plaintiff opposition to respondent motion to dismiss the fifth amended complaint,plaintiff counsel submitted a supplemental declaration in which he declared that he contacted the trial court on may,following judge mccoy appointment to inquire about resetting for hearing discovery motions that had been filed but not yet been heard.plaintiff counsel was told that the trial court was awaiting the transfer of court files for the various actions and could not do anything until it had the files.
plaintiff counsel declares that on june,he called the trial court to determine if the file for plaintiff action had been received.plaintiff counsel was told that the file had not yet arrived.plaintiff counsel intended to with the trial court but did not do so after receiving a copy of a letter dated july,from counsel for a plaintiff in a coordinated action not a party to this appeal to the trial court that noted that the preferred time for holding a preliminary trial conference after judge mccoy designation had passed citing former rule a and requested that judge mccoy set a hearing for a pending motion for preliminary injunction.on august,judge mccoy issued the initial status conference order that stayed plaintiff action pending further order of the court.plaintiff counsel declares that based on his conversations with the trial court,he understood that the actions coordinated before judge mccoy were in abeyance pending transfer of the files.
we agree with plaintiff that the trial court held her action in abeyance pending receipt of her court file and the court files of the other coordinated actions.plaintiff was reasonably diligent in prosecuting her action during this period,contacting the trial court on may,to schedule a hearing of discovery motions and contacting the trial court again on june,to determine if the trial court had received her court file.taylor hayes,supra,d at.plaintiff inability to proceed with her discovery motions during this time was beyond her control sanchez city of los angeles,supra,th at,d,and the delay in discovery brought about by the absence of her court file was not a delay that plaintiff,with reasonable diligence,might have avoided lauriton carnation,supra,d at.
we disagree with plaintiff,however,as to the period during which the abeyance in her action tolls the period.the text of section impels the view that there must be a causal connection between the circumstance upon which plaintiff relies and the failure to satisfy the requirement.bringing the action to trial must be impossible,impracticable,or futile for the reason proffered.sierra nevada hospital,superior court d.addressing a claim of tolling under subdivision c of section see also sanchez city of los angeles,supra,th at,d.because plaintiff counsel was unaware until may,that the trial court would take no action with respect to plaintiff case because it did not have plaintiff court file,there was no causal connection between the abeyance in her action from may,to may,and plaintiff failure to bring her action to trial within five years.
because plaintiff acted with reasonable diligence and could not have avoided the abeyance in her action during the period from may,to august,plaintiff met her burden her of proving that it was impossible,impracticable,or futile to bring the discovery motions at issue during this period.tamburina combined ins.of america,supra,th at,d.accordingly,the trial court should have excluded the period from may,to august,from the period within which plaintiff was to bring her action to trial.
january,to november,days 
plaintiff obtained entry of ecx default on january,and csb partnership default on january.on november,the trial court set aside the entry of both defaults.in support of her contention that the trial court should have excluded the periods during which ecx and csb partnership were in default from the period within which she was to bring her action to trial,plaintiff relies on howard thrifty drug discount stores,supra,cal th,d.in howard thrifty drug discount stores,the california supreme court stated that the exception to the period for impossibility,impracticability,or futility almost invariably applies when a default judgment has been entered in favor of the plaintiff,effectively bringing the litigation to a standstill.id.at,d.the supreme court further stated,in the context of a default judgment,courts have held that a reasonable period of time between the defendant default and the entry of the default judgment should also be excluded from the calculation of the period.id.at,d.
plaintiff reliance on howard thrifty drug discount stores,supra,cal th,d,is misplaced.in howard thrifty drug discount stores,the supreme court discussed a situation in which a default judgment is entered and litigation is thereby effectively brought to a standstill.id.at,d.here,plaintiff did not obtain a default judgment against ecx or csb partnership it only obtained entry of the defaults.the supreme court in howard thrifty drug discount stores also stated that a plaintiff must exercise reasonable diligence in overcoming obstacles.id.at,d,see also lauriton carnation,supra,d at.an action is not tolled for delays that a plaintiff,with reasonable diligence,might have avoided.plaintiff took no steps to obtain entry of default judgments and,thus,was not reasonably diligent in the prosecution of her action.plaintiff contends that she was prevented from obtaining default judgments by the various stays the trial court imposed and by the abeyance in her action which essentially covered the period from just after the entry of default against csb partnership until the trial court set aside entry of the defaults.it remains,however,that plaintiff could have sought relief from the trial court to obtain entry of default judgments but chose not to do so.because plaintiff failed to exercise reasonable diligence to overcome the obstacles preventing entry of default judgments,the trial court properly rejected plaintiff contention that the period during which ecx and csb partnership were in default should have been excluded from the period within which plaintiff was to bring her action to trial.as we discuss,some of this period is excluded for other reasons.
calculation of the period 
the trial court ruled that three periods of time for a total of days should be excluded from the period within which plaintiff was to bring her action to trial.these periods are the days from june,to october,the days from january,to may,and the days from august,to august,respondents agree with the trial court that these three periods should be excluded from the period.the trial court added the additional days to the end of the period that would have elapsed on february,had the period not been tolled for any period,and concluded that the period expired on october.because plaintiff had not moved to specially set her action for trial,and the trial did not commence within the period as calculated by the trial court,the trial court granted respondents motions to dismiss that were filed on november.
in addition to the time periods the trial court excluded from the period,the trial court also should have excluded,the period from march,to may,the period from may,to june,the period from december,to january,the period from may,to august,and the period from august,to july,when added to the days the trial court excluded from the period,these additional periods provide plaintiff sufficient time within which to bring her action to trial,and there was no need for plaintiff to request a trial date or to move to specially set her action for trial 
disposition 
the judgment is reversed,and the matter remanded to the trial court to rule on the section issues.plaintiff is awarded her costs on appeal.
the issue in this case is simple is a coordinated complex action stayed or its progress enjoined within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,subdivision b because it is subject to now well established case management practices my answer is,no.
i respectfully disagree in two respects with the position of plaintiff,dana bruns.first,i disagree with her argument that the los angeles superior court proceedings were stayed except for a few days after the case was initially assigned to judge charles mccoy.it was never stayed by judge carolyn kuhl.second,even if there were something akin to a partial stay,this case was not stayed or enjoined as that language is used in section,subdivision b.thus,i would affirm the dismissal pursuant to section.
