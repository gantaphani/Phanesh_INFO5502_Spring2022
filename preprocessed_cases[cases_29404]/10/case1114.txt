ii.discussion 
a party seeking class certification must satisfy the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure a and the requirements of at least one of the categories under rule b.the district court held that rule a had been satisfied and certified the class under rule b.in the alternative,it held that the class could be certified under rule b.wang,at.we reverse the district court certification under rule b for purposes of monetary relief in light of wal mart.we remand for the district court to reconsider its analysis under rules a and b,and to examine whether the rule b class certification may continue for purposes of injunctive relief.
rule a ensures that the named plaintiffs are appropriate representatives of the class whose claims they wish to litigate.wal mart.at.the rule requires a party seeking class certification to satisfy four requirements numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation.id.the rule provides 
one or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all members only if 
the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable 
there are questions of law or fact common to the class 
the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class and 
the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.
a.class certification is proper only if the trial court has concluded,after a rigorous analysis,that rule a has been satisfied.wal mart.at quoting general telephone of southwest falcon.cdn challenges the district court finding that the commonality requirement of rule a was satisfied.cdn does not challenge other rule a findings of the district court.
plaintiffs argue that cdn has waived its right to challenge the district court commonality finding because its opening brief,filed before the supreme court decision in wal mart,discussed the existence of common questions only in arguing against rule b certification.cdn did not argue the issue of commonality in its discussion of rule a.generally,an issue is waived when the appellant does not specifically and distinctly argue the issue in his or her opening brief.united states brooks,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,we may consider new arguments on appeal if the issue arises because of an intervening change in law.see randle crawford,cir.we conclude that the court decision in wal mart presents a sufficiently significant legal development to excuse any failure of cdn to discuss the commonality requirement of rule a in its opening brief.further,any potential prejudice to plaintiffs is cured by the fact that both parties were able to address the commonality issue under rule a in their supplemental briefs submitted after the supreme court remand.
the district court held that the commonality requirement was satisfied because of numerous common questions of law and fact arising from cdn alleged pattern of violating state labor standards.at.however,as the supreme court noted in wal mart,any competently crafted class complaint literally raises common questions.wang.at alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.what matters to class certification is not the raising of common questions even in droves but,rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.id.alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.dissimilarities within the proposed class may impede the generation of common answers.id.if there is no evidence that the entire class was subject to the same allegedly discriminatory practice,there is no question common to the class.ellis costco wholesale,cir.
wal mart was one of the most expansive class actions ever.wal mart.at.the class was a nationwide class of approximately million current and former female wal mart employees alleging that the discretion exercised by their local supervisors over pay and promotion matters violate d title vii by discriminating against women.id.the supreme court noted that the plaintiffs in wal mart wish ed to sue about literally millions of employment decisions at once.id.at.in order to show that examination of the class claims would produce a common answer to the crucial question of why each employee was disfavored,the plaintiffs needed to present significant proof that wal mart operated under a general policy of discrimination.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.wal mart publicly announced policy forbade discrimination.in the view of the court,the only countervailing evidence of a general policy of discrimination offered by plaintiffs was worlds away from significant proof.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
wal mart reiterated that the rigorous analysis under rule a sometimes requires the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest
