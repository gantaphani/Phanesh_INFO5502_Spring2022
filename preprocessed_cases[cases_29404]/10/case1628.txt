we agree with the trial court.a settlement in a prior suit precludes subsequent litigation on the same cause of action.res judicata bars not only issues that were raised in the prior suit but related issues that could have been raised.here,plaintiff attempted a second time to recover civil penalties for alleged labor code violations.but he could have sought to expand the scope of the prior action to include his additional penalty claims.in the alternative,he could have opted out of the class.instead he reaped the benefits of the settlement in the prior action and then promptly filed this suit,seeking more penalties.we conclude res judicata applies and affirm.

prior class action 
on february,jennifer augustus and eleazer hernandez filed a class action against american commercial security services acss,a wholly owned subsidiary of abm industries,alleging that acss had failed to pay its employees overtime compensation see,and had violated the unfair competition law bus,augustus american commercial security services,no.augustus.the complaint sought penalties under labor code section a first amended complaint complaint followed,adding a cause of action for failure to pay wages for a split shift see,tit,subd.c.
augustus was brought on behalf of a class of similarly situated current and former acss security guards.the augustus plaintiffs and putative class members were represented by roxborough,pomerance nye and benjamin lee.
the parties in augustus participated in mediation and reached a tentative settlement subject to the approval of the superior court.under the terms of the proposed settlement,acss would contribute up to million to compensate class members and representatives,pay attorney fees and costs,and cover expenses associated with class administration.of the total amount,the parties allocated to be paid as civil and statutory penalties.the proposed settlement agreement obligated the parties to obtain an order preliminarily approving the settlement subject only to the objections of class members and final review by the court.
on august,the superior court,judge david minning presiding,issued an order granting preliminary approval of the augustus settlement agreement.the court found that the notice of proposed class action settlement and final fairness and approval hearing notice fully and accurately inform ed the class members of all material elements of the proposed agreement,of the class members right to be excluded from the class,and of each class member right and opportunity to object to the settlement.italics added.the notice also constituted the best notice practicable under the circumstances and is in full compliance with the laws of the state of california,the federal rules of civil procedure,to the extent applicable,the united states constitution,and the requirements of due process.a class member who filed a timely objection could appear at the final fairness and approval hearing and present oral argument and evidence supporting the objection.the settlement agreement defined the class as a ll current and former security officers employed by acss who worked in the state of california anytime between february,and the date of the preliminary approval of this settlement agreement,august.the court granted conditional certification of the provisional settlement class.
the order also recited t he agreement was the product of serious,informed,negotiations conducted at arm length by the parties.in making this preliminary finding,the court considered the nature of the claims,the amounts and kinds of benefits paid in settlement,the allocation of the settlement among the class members,and the financial condition of the parties t he terms of the agreement have no obvious deficiencies and do not improperly grant preferential treatment to any individual class member.accordingly,the court preliminarily finds that the agreement was entered into in good faith 
on october,the notice was mailed to putative class members,explaining the terms of the proposed settlement.the recipients had days to request exclusion from,or to opt out of,the class opted out.no one objected to the settlement.
the final fairness and approval hearing was held on february.at the conclusion of the hearing,judge minning issued an order granting final approval of the settlement agreement.the order recited with this final approval of the proposed settlement,it is hereby ordered that the claims defined more fully in the settlement agreement and below,are forever barred.the claims include claims for unpaid wages,interest,penalties and fees,including but not limited to overtime,split shift premiums,work and wai t ing time penalties for class members who were terminated from employment with defendant on or after february,up to and including august,italics added the trial court certified a class in accordance with the class definition in the settlement agreement.the order also stated a full opportunity has been afforded to the settlement class members to participate in this hearing,and all settlement class members and other persons wishing to be heard have been heard.accordingly,the court determines that all class members who did not timely submit an form are bound by this order.finally,the order provided that after all amounts had been paid pursuant to the settlement agreement,the case would be dismissed with prejudice.
in its final form,the settlement agreement stated now therefore,in consideration of the mutual covenants,promises and warranties set forth herein,the class representatives,the settlement class and the defendant agree that this action,and any claims,damages,or causes of action arising out of the facts and allegations set forth in the action,including those set forth in the first amended complaint,related to pay for all time allegedly worked but not compensated,including,but not limited to,work,overtime,split shift premiums,any alleged failure to make wage payments in a timely manner,and any applicable penalties including but not limited to those under california labor code section shall be settled and compromised as between the class representatives,the class members and defendant,subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this agreement.this agreement specifically excludes,however,the right of any settlement class member to recover wages under california labor code section for alleged missed meal rest periods,as well as any corresponding claims for penalties resulting from untimely payment of such wages prior to february,as explained in further detail below.italics added.
the agreement continued in consideration of the monetary sum provided by defendant and upon final approval of this agreement by the court,the settlement class and each of the class members hereby waive,fully release and forever discharge the releasees from any and all claims,debts,liabilities,demands,obligations,damages,action or causes of action of any kind,whether known or unknown,which have been or could have been asserted against the releasees arising out of or related to all claims for wages,overtime pay,pay for all time allegedly worked but not compensated,and all other claims of any kind for wages,penalties,interests,costs and attorneys fees arising from the alleged violation of any provision of common law,california law federal law which were or could have been raised as part of the plaintiffs claims,including but not limited to claims under california labor code section s,and,and business and professions code sections et except as to such rights or claims as may be created by this agreement,with the express exclusion of claims raised in and arising from augustus american commercial security services,et,case no.bc,davis american commercial security services,case no.cgc hall and waite american commercial security services,case no.bc,which have been consolidated with each other in los angeles superior court and are pending before the honorable peter lichtman and batiz and heine american commercial security services,et,case no.vap,currently pending in federal district court in riverside,california meal and rest period cases,and with the express exclusion of claims for waiting time penalties for those class members whose employment terminated prior to february.italics added omitted.
releasees meant acss,its affiliates,subsidiaries,parent,and assigns,and all of their present,former and future officers,directors,shareholders,employees,agents,attorneys,insurers,and representatives up until the present time.
further,the settlement agreement provided that class members expressly waive any right or claim of right to assert hereafter that any claim,demand,obligation,cause of action has,through ignorance,oversight,or error,been omitted from the terms of this agreement n othing in this agreement shall be construed to waive any right that is not subject to waiver by private agreement,including without limitation any claims arising under state unemployment insurance or workers compensation laws or california labor code section,entitling an employee to indemnification for business expenses and losses.
on april,the augustus suit was dismissed with prejudice.there was no appeal.
present action 
on april,carlos villacres,represented by the initiative legal group,filed this action against his former employer,abm security services,and two related companies,abm industries and ssa security,defendants.defendants were related to acss,the employer in augustus,and,together with acss,constituted a single employer for purpose of this action.the title page of the complaint contained the caption class action and stated villacres had brought the action individually and on behalf of all other members of the public similarly situated.the proposed class consisted of nonexempt or hourly employees who were employed by defendants from march,until the resolution of the case.
under the heading class action allegations,the complaint alleged that there was a community of interest in the litigation and that the class was easily ascertainable.the action allegedly satisfied the class action requirements of numerosity,typicality,adequacy,and superiority.see weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group,to.the complaint sought civil penalties under the paga for a violation of the labor code.
in a first amended complaint complaint filed on april,villacres dropped all references and allegations concerning a class action,and alleged he was bringing the action as an individual on behalf of himself and other aggrieved employees.see arias superior court cal th,paga suit is a representative action and need not be brought as a class action.villacres sought civil penalties under the paga for alleged labor code violations related to paying overtime compensation see,furnishing employees with complete wage statements see,subd.a,providing meal and rest periods see,indemnifying employees for business expenses and losses see,and paying wages on a timely basis see.for each labor code violation,villacres sought paga penalties of per employee per pay period for the initial violation and per employee per pay period for each subsequent violation.see,subd.f all undesignated section references are to that code.the complaint also sought attorney fees under the paga.see,subd.g.
before filing suit,villacres complied with the paga notice and administrative exhaustion requirements.see.
defendants employed villacres from march,to april.he was a member of the class in augustus.he did not opt out of the class,object to the settlement,or seek to intervene in the suit.
on april,defendants filed a motion for summary judgment,contending the doctrine of res judicata barred this action based on the settlement and the dismissal with prejudice in augustus.villacres filed opposition,arguing the paga claims in this action were not asserted in augustus,nor were several of the underlying labor code violations 
the trial court,judge peter lichtman presiding,heard the motion on july,and took the matter under submission.by minute order dated july,judge lichtman granted the motion,relying primarily on the language in the augustus settlement agreement releasing all claims for wages and penalties.the trial court also found that the claims at issue in this action fall into the category of claims that could have been asserted in the augustus matter.villacres appealed.
discussion 
summary judgment is appropriate if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.
a defendant seeking summary judgment has met the burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action once the defendant burden is met,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of fact exists as to that cause of action in reviewing the propriety of a summary judgment,the appellate court independently reviews the record that was before the trial court we must determine whether the facts as shown by the parties give rise to a triable issue of material fact in making this determination,the moving party affidavits are strictly construed while those of the opposing party are liberally construed.we accept as undisputed facts only those portions of the moving party evidence that are not contradicted by the opposing party evidence in other words,the facts alleged in the evidence of the party opposing summary judgment and the reasonable inferences therefrom must be accepted as true.buxbaum aetna life casualty th,italics added.
res judicata 
the doctrine of res judicata rests upon the ground that the party to be affected,or some other with whom he is in privity,has litigated,or had an opportunity to litigate the same matter in a former action in a court of competent jurisdiction,and should not be permitted to litigate it again to the harassment and vexation of his opponent.public policy and the interest of litigants alike require that there be an end to litigation.citizens for open access.tide,seadrift th.r es judicata benefits both the parties and the courts because it seeks to curtail multiple litigation causing vexation and expense to the parties and wasted effort and expense in judicial administration.mycogen monsanto cal th.
under the doctrine of res judicata,a valid,final judgment on the merits is a bar to a subsequent action by parties or their privies on the same cause of action in california,a cause of action is defined by the primary right theory.the most salient characteristic of a primary right is that it is indivisible the violation of a single primary right gives rise to but a single cause of action.in particular,the primary right theory provides that a cause of action consists of a primary right possessed by the plaintiff,a corresponding duty devolving upon the defendant,and a delict or wrong done by the defendant which consists of a breach of the primary right if the matter was within the scope of the action,related to the subject matter and relevant to the issues,so that it could have been raised,the judgment is conclusive on it the reason for this is manifest.a party can not by negligence or design withhold issues and litigate them in consecutive actions.hence the rule is that the prior judgment is res judicata on matters which were raised or could have been raised,on matters litigated or litigable amin khazindar th,citations omitted.
the fact that different forms of relief are sought in the two lawsuits is irrelevant,for if the rule were otherwise,litigation finally would end only when a party ran out of counsel whose knowledge and imagination could conceive of different theories of relief based upon the same factual background.u nder what circumstances is a matter to be deemed decided by the prior judgment obviously,if it is actually raised by proper pleadings and treated as an issue in the cause,it is conclusively determined by the first judgment.but the rule goes further.if the matter was within the scope of the action,related to the and relevant to the issues,so that it could have been raised,the judgment is conclusive on it despite the fact that it was not in fact expressly pleaded or otherwise urged a n issue may not be thus split into pieces.if it has been determined in a former action,it is binding notwithstanding the parties litigant may have omitted to urge for or against it matters which,if urged,would have produced an opposite result interinsurance exchange of the auto.club superior court d,citations italics omitted.
in california the phrase cause of action is often used indiscriminately to mean counts which state according to different legal theories the same cause of action but for purposes of applying the doctrine of res judicata,the phrase cause of action has a more precise meaning the cause of action is the right to obtain redress for a harm suffered,regardless of the specific remedy sought or the legal theory common law or statutory advanced t he cause of action is based upon the harm suffered,as opposed to the particular theory asserted by the litigant even where there are multiple legal theories upon which recovery might be predicated,one injury gives rise to only one claim for relief.hence a judgment for the defendant is a bar to a subsequent action by the plaintiff based on the same injury to the same right,even though the plaintiff presents a different legal ground for relief.thus,under the primary rights theory,the determinative factor is the harm suffered.when two actions involving the same parties seek compensation for the same harm,they generally involve the same primary right.boeken philip morris usa,cal th,citations omitted.
as far as its content is concerned,the primary right is simply the plaintiff right to be free from the particular injury suffered it must therefore be distinguished from the legal theory on which liability for that injury is premised even where there are multiple legal theories upon which recovery might be predicated,one injury gives rise to only one claim for relief.the primary right must also be distinguished from the remedy sought the violation of one primary right constitutes a single cause of action,though it may entitle the injured party to many forms of relief,and the relief is not to be confounded with the cause of action,one not being determinative of the other.crowley katleman cal th,citations omitted accord,weikel tcw realty fund ii holding th.

here,the parties dispute whether augustus and the present action involve the same cause of action and whether villacres was in privity with the augustus plaintiffs.
identity of issues 
in augustus,the complaint alleged the employer had failed to pay overtime compensation,failed to pay wages for a split shift,and violated the unfair competition law.it also sought civil penalties under section.see fn,ante.
villacres brought this action against the same employer,seeking civil penalties under the paga based on the employer alleged failure to pay overtime compensation and its alleged violation of other labor code provisions.
in september,the legislature enacted the paga,declaring that adequate financing of labor law enforcement was necessary to achieve maximum compliance with state labor laws,that staffing levels for labor law enforcement agencies had declined and were unlikely to keep pace with the future growth of the labor market,and that it was therefore in the public interest to allow aggrieved employees,acting as private attorneys general,to recover civil penalties for labor code violations,with the understanding that labor law enforcement agencies were to retain primacy over private enforcement efforts under this legislation,an aggrieved employee may bring a civil action personally and on behalf of other current or former employees to recover civil penalties for labor code violations of the civil penalties recovered,percent goes to the labor and workforce development agency,leaving the remaining percent for the aggrieved employees.arias superior court cal th,citations fn.omitted see generally franco athens disposal,th.if an employee prevails in a paga action,he or she is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs,subd.g.
the legislature has made clear that an action under the paga is in the nature of an enforcement action,with the aggrieved employee acting as a private attorney general to collect penalties from employers who violate labor laws.such an action is fundamentally a law enforcement action designed to protect the public and penalize the employer for past illegal conduct.restitution is not the primary object of a paga action,as it is in most class actions.before the paga was enacted,an employee could recover damages,reinstatement,and other appropriate relief but could not collect civil penalties.the labor and workforce development agency collected them.the paga changed that.franco athens disposal,supra,th at.
in bringing such an action,the aggrieved employee acts as the proxy or agent of state labor law enforcement agencies,representing the same legal right and interest as those agencies,in a proceeding that is designed to protect the public,not to benefit private parties 
a cause of action is transferable,that is,assignable,by its owner if it arises out of a legal obligation or a violation of a property right the paga does not create property rights or any other substantive rights.nor does it impose any legal obligations.it is simply a procedural statute allowing an aggrieved employee to recover civil labor code otherwise would be sought by state labor law enforcement agencies t he right to recover a statutory penalty may not be assigned therefore,under the paga an aggrieved employee can not assign a claim for statutory penalties because the employee does not own an assignable interest.amalgamated transit union,local,superior court cal th,citations omitted.
the paga declared purpose is to supplement enforcement actions by public agencies,which lack adequate resources to bring all such actions themselves in a lawsuit brought under the act,the employee plaintiff represents the same legal right and interest as state labor law enforcement,recovery of civil penalties that otherwise would have been assessed and collected by the labor workforce development agency the employee plaintiff may bring the action only after giving written notice to both the employer and the labor and workforce development agency arias superior court,supra,cal th at,citations omitted.
the paga is limited to the recovery of civil penalties,subds.a,f,subd.a,caliber bodyworks,superior court th,franco athens disposal,supra,th at.some labor code provisions establish penalties that are not expressly denominated civil penalties and are therefore not subject to the paga.if a penalty under the labor code is not a civil penalty,it is commonly called a statutory penalty.for instance,section,subdivision a,requires an employer to pay an employee wages immediately upon discharge.in addition to the recovery of unpaid wages,section imposes a statutory penalty of one day wages for each day that the wages remain unpaid,not to exceed days.and section authorizes the labor commissioner to impose a civil penalty in the form of waiting time pay for the same statutory violation.but only the recovery of the civil penalty falls within the paga.see caliber bodyworks,superior court,supra,th.
the paga also distinguishes between a provision of the labor code that provides its own civil penalty and a provision with no specified penalty.the paga provides the applicable civil penalty if a particular labor code provision does not specify one.compare,subd.a referring to any provision of this code that provides a civil penalty with,subd.f establishing civil penalties under paga for all provisions of this code except those for which a civil penalty is specifically provided.although both types of civil penalties are recoverable under the paga,the amount of the penalty may differ.for example,a failure to pay overtime compensation is subject to the civil penalty provided in section,namely,per employee per pay period for an initial violation,and a penalty of per employee per pay period for each subsequent violation,subd.a.in contrast,the failure to indemnify employees for business expenses and losses,is subject to the civil penalty set forth in the paga.see,subd.f caliber bodyworks,superior court,supra,th at fns.ruiz paladin group,no.cv rzx wl,pp.under the paga,the civil penalty for an initial violation is per employee per pay period,and the penalty for each subsequent violation is per employee per pay period.thus,a plaintiff in a paga suit must identify the civil penalties available under the paga default provision as opposed to the civil penalties authorized by the underlying labor code provision.see franco athens disposal,supra,th at amaral cintas.th,fn.
defendants urge us to adopt a categorical rule that employees must assert all known labor code violations and paga penalties in a single suit,at least where the violations are related to wages.we acknowledge that courts have recognized a primary right to be employed balasubramanian san diego community college dist.th,a primary right to be paid for services rendered maduro antonio de gastaneta cir,thomas blue cross and blue shield cir,and a primary right to be paid under a contract mcnulty copp d.
for his part,villacres contends each labor code violation and each corresponding paga penalty constitute a separate primary right.under this approach,villacres could have subdivided this dispute into six labor code actions,each with its own separate paga action,for a total of suits.as villacres sees it,an employer failure to pay overtime compensation,violates the primary right to premium pay the failure to provide meal periods,violates the primary right to consumption,while the failure to provide rest periods violates the primary right to elimination see california manufacturers industrial welfare com.d,and the failure to provide a complete wage statement violates the primary right to a full explanation of gross and net wages.thus,each labor code provision involves a distinct primary right.
in addition,villacres contends the recovery of unpaid wages for the violation of a labor code provision does not involve the same primary right as the recovery of a civil penalty under the paga for the same violation compensation for a labor code violation serves the private interest of the aggrieved employee,but a penalty under the paga serves a public interest similar to that of other law enforcement statutes.see arias superior court,supra,cal th at amalgamated transit union,local,superior court,supra,cal th at franco athens disposal,supra,th at.res judicata may not apply if the subsequent action seeks to vindicate a public interest and the prior action served only a private interest.overseas motors,import motors limited,fn.findings made in arbitration involving purely private contract dispute were not binding in subsequent antitrust action pursued by plaintiff acting as private attorney general on behalf of public.thus,the failure to pay overtime compensation could give rise to two lawsuits one to recover unpaid wages and another to recover the corresponding paga penalties.
defendants counter that villacres position would lead to an absurd result and contravene the fundamental purpose of res judicata an employer would be subject to an endless series of class actions,each focusing on the violation of a different labor code provision or a paga penalty.further,while it is true that the paga serves the public interest by discouraging employers from violating the law see franco athens disposal,supra,th at,the same can be said of the penalties sought in a case like augustus see murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th,mamika barca th.
we need not decide whether,as defendants argue,the primary rights theory treats all labor code violations and paga penalties as a single cause of action or whether,as villacres contends,every labor code violation and paga penalty involves a separate primary right.the disposition in this case does not turn on such broad propositions.instead,we focus on the specific circumstances of this litigation.
as it turns out,villacres response to the notice in the augustus class action proves determinative.after the members of the class have been properly notified of the action,they are required to decide whether to remain members of the class represented by plaintiffs counsel and become bound by a favorable or unfavorable judgment in the action,whether to intervene in the action through counsel of their own choosing,or whether to opt out of the action and pursue their own independent remedies,such as negotiation with defendants,initiation of their own action,or intervention in some other action.home sav.loan superior court d,accord,weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial,supra.the critical reason for notification of members of the class on whose behalf a class action has been brought is that notification makes possible a binding adjudication and an enforceable judgment with respect to the rights of the members of the class.absent such notification no member of the class need be bound by the result of the litigation.home sav.loan,supra,at.
in response to the notice,villacres could have objected to the proposed settlement on the ground it should have included additional labor code violations and corresponding paga penalties,sought to intervene in augustus to pursue the same goal,or opted out of the settlement and preserved his right to bring an independent action.see home sav.loan superior court,supra,d at accord,weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial,supra,cohelan on california class actions ed,newberg on class actions ed,discussing objections newberg on class actions,supra,at discussing intervention cal.rules of court,rule a.
if,through objection or intervention,villacres effort to add his paga claims in augustus had caused a conflict of interest between class members,the superior court could have attempted to resolve that issue.as explained by our supreme court when the vast majority of a class perceives its interest as diametrically opposed to that of the named representatives,a trial court can not equitably grant the named plaintiffs the right to pursue the litigation on behalf of the entire class the trial court can permit the plaintiffs to represent a smaller class if the minority can meet the requirements for class certification by showing an ascertainable class and a community of interest which is not coextensive with the larger class.
if the vast majority of the class do not oppose the suit,the minority may have its views presented either as a subclass or as interveners.richmond dart industries,cal d,citations omitted.
m ost differences in situation or interest among class members should not bar class suit.if the factual circumstances underlying class members claims differ,or if class members disagree as to the proper theory of liability,the trial judge,through use of techniques like subclassing or intervention,may incorporate the class differences into the litigative process,and give all class members their due in deciding what is the proper outcome of the litigation.even if differences among class members are more fundamental,having to do with the type of relief which should be sought or indeed with whether the class opponent ought to be held liable at all,judicial accommodation appears to provide a sufficient mechanism for the protection of absentee interests.so long as a dispute concerns the outcome of litigation,the trial judge is in a position to isolate the differing positions,judge their validity in light of the substantive law governing the case,and shape the outcome of the suit to give the various class interests the weight to which the law entitles them.
when a class contains various viewpoints,the courts may ensure that these viewpoints are represented by allowing them to join as interveners or as additional representatives of subclasses within the full class this would ensure that the trial court was fully aware of the differing views within the class.additional protection is afforded to absent class members by the provisions which allow a class member to opt out of the class if he or she does not wish to be bound by the result of the suit.richmond dart industries,supra,cal d at,citations omitted accord,cohelan on california class actions,supra.
a trial court may decline to modify a class or alter a settlement if,for example,an objection or a motion to intervene would result in undue delay or prejudice.see cohelan on california class actions,supra.in that regard,an erroneous ruling may be corrected on appeal.see cho seagate technology holdings,th,newberg on class actions,supra,at.
as an alternative to objecting or intervening in augustus,villacres could have easily preserved his paga claims by opting out of the class.yet,he took no action in response to the notice.he remained silent,stayed in the class,accepted the benefits of the settlement,and filed a paga suit as soon as augustus was dismissed.
under the doctrine of res judicata,i f the matter raised in the subsequent suit was within the scope of the prior action,related to the subject matter and relevant to the issues,so that it could have been raised,the judgment is conclusive on it despite the fact that it was not in fact expressly pleaded or otherwise urged.amin khazindar,supra,th at,last italics in original accord,busick workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,interinsurance exchange of the auto.club superior court,supra,d at chin et,cal.practice guide employment litigation the rutter group,newberg on class actions,supra,at witkin,cal.procedure ed.judgment.
that principle applies in the unique circumstances of this case.villacres could have attempted to assert his paga claims as a member of the class in augustus.defendants employed him for only one month,from march,to april.he was terminated four months before judge minning preliminarily approved the proposed settlement agreement in augustus and months before the settlement received final approval.the claims in augustus,like villacres paga claims here,required proof of a labor code violation augustus included a claim for failure to pay overtime compensation,villacres paga claims in this case included the same claim.in addition,villacres alleged the failure to pay wages on a timely basis,the failure to pay an additional hour of wages if employees were denied a meal or rest period,subd.b the failure to indemnify employees for business expenses or losses,and the failure to provide complete wage statements,subd.a.further,like villacres paga claims,augustus involved the recovery of penalties under the labor code,specifically,labor code section.see fn,ante.simply put,villacres paga claims were within the scope of the augustus litigation and were related to the subject matter and issues in that action the payment of wages and penalties by the same employer.this is evident from the class action ascertainability,numerosity,typicality,adequacy,and appeared in villacres original complaint.see pt,ante.those allegations indicated that,as far as villacres was concerned,his paga claims could have been asserted in augustus.in other words,with respect to villacres paga claims,the class members in augustus and the aggrieved employees in this case shared a community of interest with no insurmountable conflicts of interest.
consequently,villacres paga claims could have been raised in the prior action for purposes of res judicata.see zabel cohen,suit seeking unpaid salary and bonuses barred by res judicata because employee could have sought that relief in prior suit alleging other wage claims both suits involved same injury to employee,namely,insufficient remuneration in re northwest airlines,alg wl,pp.employee bankruptcy claim seeking wages,sick leave pay,and vacation pay barred by res judicata because that relief could have been sought in prior civil action for wrongful discharge wang prudential insurance of america,wl,pp,employee action for compensation barred by res judicata because that relief could have been sought in prior action alleging discriminatory termination see generally amin khazindar,supra,th at busick workmen comp.appeals,supra,cal d at interinsurance exchange of the auto.club superior court,supra,d at.because villacres did not raise his paga claims in objection,intervention,or by way of opt out of the class,this suit is barred by res judicata.
villacres could not partake of the augustus settlement proceeds,which included an amount for penalties,and then bring an action for additional penalties.see united states banco d,government suit to forfeit funds held by bank precluded subsequent suit by government to impose penalties on bank oberstar cir,after individual appealed government order prohibiting him from participating in activities of insured depository institutions,government could not obtain additional order imposing monetary penalty on him davis sun oil,plaintiffs failure to raise basis for penalties in prior suit barred subsequent action to recover penalties.

nor did the settlement agreement in augustus waive defendants res judicata defense.that agreement stated t he class members hereby fully release the employer from any and all claims,debts,liabilities,demands,obligations,damages,action or causes of action which have been or could have been asserted against the employer arising out of or related to all claims for wages,overtime pay,pay for all time allegedly worked but not compensated,and all other claims of any kind for wages,penalties,interests,costs and attorneys fees arising from the alleged violation of any provision of california law federal law which were or could have been raised as part of the plaintiffs claims.italics added.as recited in the trial court order granting final approval of the settlement i t is hereby ordered that the claims defined more fully in the settlement agreement are forever barred.the claims include claims for unpaid wages,interest,penalties and fees,including but not limited to overtime,split shift premiums,work and wai t ing time penalties.italics added.thus,the trial court expressly recognized that the settlement agreement released claims in addition to claims for unpaid wages,interest,penalties and fees,including but not limited to overtime,split shift premiums,work and wai t ing time penalties.indeed,that is the effect of a standard general release,as we now discuss.

reduced to its essence,the augustus settlement agreement released all claims of any kind for penalties arising from the alleged violation of any provision of common law,california law federal law which were or could have been raised as part of the plaintiffs claims.italics added.this provision constitutes a standard general release,barring any claims based on conduct occurring before its effective date.in basis technology,the court noted the provision for mutual releases contemplated all claims that were brought,or that could have been brought,or that have been threatened to be brought,by either party against the other.it resembled the typical general release used by experienced counsel to resolve litigation,at accord,dupuy mcewen cir,the plaintiffs had expressly released the defendant from all claims which arose or could have been raised in the suit that was a general release.
in augustine medical progressive dynamics,the parties agreed to release any and all claims that were or could have been asserted by the plaintiff in the present lawsuit.id.at,italics omitted.nevertheless,the plaintiff filed a subsequent suit against the defendant.the defendant prevailed on summary judgment based on the release.as the court of appeals explained our interpretation of the language of the settlement agreement is consistent with judicial interpretation of general releases in settlement agreements.both parties agree that their settlement provided a general release containing very broad language,such as release and forever discharge,any and all manner of action or actions,relating to any acts,omissions or statements made by the defendant,and including,but not limited to,any and all claims that were or could have been asserted by the plaintiff in the present lawsuit.general language such as these phrases have consistently been held by the courts to constitute a waiver of all claims based upon events occurring prior to the date of the release.id.at,italics added accord,imprimis investors llc united states,release of all claims asserted or that could have been asserted in the actions bars claims based upon events occurring prior to the date of the release university of hawaii hawaii d,release of claims that were asserted or could have been asserted in the complaint,executed by parties in resolving university professor suit for mistreatment,barred his action for wrongful suspension and termination because,at time of first suit,university had threatened to suspend and terminate him cole powell d,settlement agreements releasing federal discrimination claims that were or could have been alleged in the underlying case are routinely enforced republic ins.davis systems of pitt,affirming grant of defendant motion for summary judgment,barring subsequent suit where release in prior action covered any and all actions,cause of action,and claims,including,but not limited to,all matters which have been raised or which could have been raised,in the action italics omitted.

the augustus settlement agreement recognized a limited exception for additional litigation,specifying a list of existing cases that involved alleged meal and rest period violations.villacres not among them.there was no general exception for meal and rest period violations that would permit villacres to seek applicable paga penalties.review of the circumstances confirms our interpretation that the release was designed to extinguish all claims extant among the parties.i t is significant that the parties were able to,and did,fashion language memorializing their agreement to preserve identified claims from the operation of the release when such was their intention winet price th,italics added.
t he release of all claims and causes of action must be given a comprehensive scope.if courts did not follow this rule,it would be virtually impossible to create a general release that actually achieve d its literal purpose,and language releasing all claims would be inherently misleading,causing unfair surprise to parties that offer payment on the reasonable expectation that all claims are settled,only later to face continuing litigation moreover,if courts did not enforce general releases,an employer seeking a comprehensive settlement,would have to struggle to enumerate all claims the employee might plan to allege.the employer would never be able to know for sure that it had thought of every claim,and therefore it would never be able to put a definitive end to the matter.employers would then be disinclined to enter into settlements,because certainty as to the full extent of liability is one factor that motivates employers to choose settlement over litigation.jefferson department of youth authority,supra,cal th at,citations omitted,italics added.
in short,the release in the augustus settlement agreement does not permit villacres to escape the bar of res judicata.see waisbein ubs financial services,no.wl,pp.fn.release in action barred subsequent paga suit seeking penalties for labor code meal and rest alleged in prior action.if villacres thought the release was too broad,he could have sought to remedy that problem through objection or intervention,and if not satisfied with the result,he could have appealed.see toms allied bond collection agency,cir,froeber liberty mutual ins.p d.alternatively,he could have simply opted out of the class and rendered the scope of the release irrelevant in this action.
villacres relies on consumer advocacy group,exxonmobil,supra,th,for the contention the augustus settlement agreement did not bar paga claims.his reliance is misplaced.there,an organization known as communities for a better environment sued exxonmobil under the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of act health,alleging exxonmobile had contaminated sources of drinking water by leaking toluene and benzene.that action settled,resulting in an agreement releasing a ny and all claims that could have been asserted in this action arising out of any alleged discharge or release of benzene toluene.consumer advocacy group,at.in a separate suit,another organization,consumer advocacy group cag,alleged that exxonmobil had violated the act by contaminating drinking water sources with toluene,benzene,and lead.exxonmobil moved for summary judgment in the cag suit,invoking the doctrine of res judicata based on the prior settlement.
the trial court granted the motion.the court of appeal reversed,stating cag distinguishes the primary right at issue by pointing out that its complaint alleged violations based on benzene,toluene and lead,while the complaint and settlement in the other action concerned benzene and toluene,but not lead.exxonmobil responds by asserting that the primary right at issue is the leaking of petroleum products into water sources,rather than the leaking of any particular gasoline constituent.but the settlement is specific in covering only benzene and toluene it does not contain language permitting a broader application.
exxonmobil argues,t he settlement agreement in the other action specifically encompasses the release of all gasoline constituents,which includes lead.the general language of the agreement does not specifically encompass all gasoline constituents.
w e are not holding that a single settlement agreement can not resolve claims relating to all gasoline constituents.instead,we conclude that this settlement does not do so.
while exxonmobil is not entitled to a ruling that cag entire action is barred by res judicata,this is only because the other suit did not resolve claims relating to lead.consumer advocacy group,exxonmobil,supra,th at,italics added.
consumer advocacy group is inapposite.the language of the augustus settlement agreement is significantly broader than the narrow release in consumer advocacy group.in augustus,the parties released all claims of any kind for wages,penalties,interests,costs and attorneys fees arising from the alleged violation of any provision of california law federal law which were or could have been raised as part of the plaintiffs claims.italics added.thus,t he essential and explicit purpose of the settlement agreement in augustus was to resolve the disputes between the parties.citizens for open access.tide,seadrift,supra,th at.
villacres also argues the augustus settlement agreement could not release paga claims or an employee claim to indemnification for business expenses and losses,because those claims involve unwaivable statutory rights.see edwards arthur andersen llp cal th,franco athens disposal,supra,th at,see also.but defendants did not entice or force villacres or other class members to waive future claims or,for that matter,to waive any claims without compensation.to the contrary,in augustus,the parties amicably resolved past alleged violations,and defendants compensated the class members for those claims.a release of that nature is legally distinguishable from an unlawful waiver of statutory rights.see chindarah pick up stix,th,settlement of bona fide wage dispute does not violate statute prohibiting release of unwaivable pay claims.were it otherwise,a suit alleging a wage claim could be resolved only through a dispositive motion or a trial.nor does villacres contend his paga claims are based on labor code violations that occurred after the period covered by the augustus settlement agreement he was terminated on april,four months before the end of the class period in augustus.
we therefore conclude this suit alleges the same cause of action asserted and settled in augustus.
villacres argues he was not in privity with the augustus plaintiffs.we disagree.he was a member of the class in augustus.in that capacity,the doctrine of res judicata applied to him,and he is bound by the augustus settlement agreement.see louie bfs retail commercial operations,llc th,johnson american airlines,supra,d at.t he preclusive effect of judgments depends not on whether the action is brought on behalf of the general public,but on whether those sought to be bound by a judgment are named parties,are in privity with named parties,or are members of a class certified under class action procedures.arias superior court,supra,cal th at,fn,italics added.in augustus,the superior court certified a class that included villacres as a member.
on a similar point,villacres contends the state of california is,as a legal matter,the actual plaintiff here.not so.the paga authorized villacres to file this action on behalf of himself and other current or former employees,subd.a.the act empowers or deputizes an aggrieved employee to sue for civil penalties as an alternative to enforcement by the state.dunlap superior court th,see,subd.a.a paga claim can only be filed where the state has made an affirmative decision not to pursue the matter,either by deciding not to investigate at all or by investigating and then deciding the employer should not be cited and subjected to penalties.waisbein ubs financial services inc,supra,wl,at see.the paga is a powerful tool for aggrieved employees.franco athens disposal,supra,th at,italics added.
policy considerations 
we would decline to apply res judicata if injustice would result or if the public interest requires that relitigation not be foreclosed.dunkin boskey,supra,th at.but we discern no public policy reason for refusing to invoke the doctrine of res judicata.precluding the present suit by villacres will not result in any manifest injustice to him or those he seeks to represent or in any adverse impact upon the public we are convinced,based upon the particular and rather unique circumstances presented to us,that the claims asserted by villacres in the present case were commendably advanced during negotiation and approval of the settlement agreement in augustus.citizens for open access.tide,seadrift,supra,th at.to allow the multiplicity of suits villacres proposes would unnecessarily burden the courts and deny the settling defendant in augustus the finality for which it bargained.
in sum,defendants have made a prima facie showing that villacres paga claims constitute the same cause of action alleged and settled in augustus,and villacres,as a member of the class in augustus,was in privity with the augustus plaintiffs.villacres has not created a disputed issue of material fact on either point.accordingly,the trial court properly applied the doctrine of res judicata and granted defendants motion for summary judgment.
disposition 
the order and judgment are affirmed.
the augustus class action ended with a settlement agreement,approved by judge minning,that released all claims that could have been raised as part of the plaintiffs claims.in the villacres action,judge lichtman granted summary judgment on the ground that villacres claims fell into the category of claims that could have been asserted in the augustus matter.the sole issue on appeal is whether a triable issue exists as to the scope of the release.it is ultimately a matter of contract interpretation.
comparing the lawsuits 
the augustus plaintiffs alleged their employers failed to compensate employees for overtime and split shifts,in violation of labor code sections and undesignated statutory references are to this code and section of title of the california code of regulations,and by doing so also violated the unfair competition law.they sought damages,interest,attorney fees and costs,civil penalties under section,an injunction,and such other relief as the court may deem appropriate.the case settled,defendants agreeing to set up a million maximum general pool of unpaid overtime wages from which to pay per week of employment to those with valid claims,and a maximum penalty pool from which to pay per week of employment.defendants also agreed to pay plaintiffs attorney fees and costs up to and in incentive awards to the class representatives.
in exchange,defendants were released from liability on any and all claims or causes of action of any kind which have been or could have been asserted against the releasees arising out of or related to all claims for wages,overtime pay,pay for all time allegedly worked but not compensated,and all other claims of any kind for wages,penalties,interest,costs and attorneys fees arising from the alleged violation of any provision of common law,california law federal law which was or could have been raised as part of the plaintiffs claims italics added.
notice of the settlement was sent to the putative class.the content of the notice is not in the record.the class administrators received claim forms.the record does not indicate how much was paid on these claims,but the maximum payout per class member would have been in unpaid overtime wages and in penalties per year worked and multiplied by,respectively.
in its order preliminarily approving the settlement the trial court found the class notice fully and accurately informed the class of all material elements of the proposed settlement agreement.in its order granting final approval,the trial court characterized the released claims as claims for unpaid wages,interest,penalties and fees,including but not limited to overtime,split shift premiums,work,and wai t ing time penalties no mention was made of the release of claims that could have been raised as part of the plaintiffs claims.
in this action,plaintiff alleged defendants failed to pay overtime wages,provide complete wage statements,provide meal or rest periods or compensation in lieu thereof,reimburse him for the cost of a uniform it required him to purchase,or pay wages on a timely basis.he sought damages,interest,attorney fees and costs,civil penalties under the paga,and such other relief as the court may deem appropriate.
the villacres trial court action 
defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing plaintiff causes of action had been raised and settled in augustus.this is so,they argued,because plaintiff claims and the augustus claims all involved infringement of the same primary to pay wages in essence,defendants argued all employment claims involve the same primary right to receive compensation for thus constitute one cause of action.
in opposition,plaintiff argued his claims relating to meal periods,rest periods,unreimbursed business expenses,and wage statements presented different causes of action from the augustus plaintiffs claims for unpaid overtime and split shifts.though admitting his overtime claim was duplicative,he nevertheless argued it was not barred by res judicata because it involved a different primary of a paga action.
in their reply,defendants maintained that all claims without limitation had been released.
the trial court granted defendants motion for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiff claims could have been asserted in the augustus matter.the trial court cited no evidence for this finding,and indeed there was none,as defendants had not argued plaintiff claims could have been raised in augustus they argued the claims were actually raised there,because all employment compensation claims constitute one cause of action.
on appeal,defendants continue to maintain that all employment compensation claims constitute the same cause of action.
plaintiff overtime claim is barred 
no triable issue exists as to whether plaintiff cause of action for failure to pay overtime is barred by res judicata because the augustus plaintiffs sued on the same cause of action,settled the lawsuit,and obtained a stipulated judgment.
the doctrine of res judicata operates to bar multiple litigation arising out of the same subject matter of a prior action as between the same parties or parties in privity with them.gates superior court d,frommhagen board of supervisors d.the doctrine has two effects.first,where the causes of action and the parties are the same,a prior judgment is a complete bar in the second action.this is fundamental and is everywhere conceded.sutphin speik cal d.in its secondary aspect res judicata has a limited application to a second suit between the same parties,though based on a different cause of action.the prior judgment is not a complete bar,but it operates as an estoppel or conclusive adjudication as to such issues in the second action as were actually litigated and determined in the first action.todhunter smith cal.this aspect of the doctrine of res judicata,now commonly referred to as the doctrine of collateral estoppel,is confined to issues actually litigated.clark lesher cal d,sutphin speik,supra,cal d.
california law defines a cause of action by focusing on the primary right at stake if two actions involve the same injury to the plaintiff and the same wrong by the defendant then the same primary right is at stake even if in the second suit the plaintiff pleads different theories of recovery,seeks different forms of relief adds new facts supporting recovery.citations.a cause of action is based upon the nature of a plaintiff injury.the cause of action,as it appears in the complaint when properly pleaded,will therefore always be the facts from which the plaintiff primary right and the defendant corresponding primary duty have arisen,together with the facts which constitute the defendant delict or act of wrong.citation.citation.tensor group city of glendale th.
a stipulated judgment is res judicata as to those issues it embraces.ellena california d,california state auto.bureau superior court cal d,a stipulated judgment may properly be given collateral estoppel effect,at least when the parties manifest an intent to be collaterally bound by its terms.avery avery cal d,a judgment entered on stipulation has the same effect as if the action were tried on its merits.
because plaintiff was a member of the augustus class and did not opt out,he is bound by the judgment in that lawsuit and his cause of action for failure to pay overtime is extinguished.it does not matter that he employs a different mechanism,the paga,to enforce the right to overtime or that he seeks different penalties than were sought in augustus.a cause of action is defined by the parties rights,not by the mechanism by which those rights are enforced or the remedies sought.
plaintiff claims are not barred 
plaintiff claims regarding wage statements,meal and rest periods or compensation in lieu of them,expense reimbursement,and the timeliness of wages the claims are not barred by res judicata because they involve neither the same causes of action as were asserted in augustus nor the same issues that were actually litigated and determined in that action.
different causes of action 
that plaintiff claims do not involve the same causes of action as the augustus plaintiffs overtime and claims should be plain.a cause of action is identified by examining one party right and the other obligation.an employee right to receive premium payment for overtime stems from the legislature determination that too much work in a day or week can be harmful.stats,ch.numerous studies have linked long work hours to increased rates of accident and injury,and f amily life suffers when either or both parents are kept away from home for an extended period of time on a daily basis.it is not the same as his or her right to receive wages promptly,to receive detailed and accurate wage data,to be reimbursed for required expenses,or to receive meal and rest breaks.see california manufacturers industrial welfare com.d,purpose of wage data requirement is to help employee in the resolution of disputes and dealings with the irs purpose of meal and rest period requirements is to promote employee health and welfare.
defendants argument that plaintiff claims were largely the same as those presented in augustus and that both lawsuits were triggered by the infringement of the same primary to pay therefore meritless.
different issues 
the question remains whether issues as opposed to causes of action in this lawsuit were actually litigated and determined augustus.the scope of issues actually litigated and determined is defined by the stipulated judgment.ellena california,supra,d at res judicata effect extends only to those issues embraced within the consent judgment.
in a stipulated judgment,or consent decree,litigants voluntarily terminate a lawsuit by assenting to specified terms,which the court agrees to enforce as a judgment.citations.s tipulated judgments bear the earmarks both of judgments entered after litigation and contracts derived through mutual agreement consent decrees have attributes both of contracts and of judicial decrees a dual character that has resulted in different treatment for different purposes.citation.t he issue before us is not whether we can label a consent decree as a contract or a judgment,for we can do both.citation.california state auto.bureau superior court,supra,cal d at.a stipulated judgment is indeed a judgment entry thereof is a judicial act that a court has discretion to perform.although a court may not add to or make a new stipulation without mutual consent of the parties citation,it may reject a stipulation that is contrary to public policy citation while it is entirely proper for the court to accept stipulations of counsel that appear to have been made advisedly,and after due consideration of the facts,the court can not surrender its duty to see that the judgment to be entered is a just one,nor is the court to act as a mere puppet in the matter.citation.id.at.
a class action settlement,where a class representative purports to settle third party claims,is subject to particular scrutiny,because the trial court,as guardian of the class,must independently satisfy itself that the consideration received for a release of class claims is reasonable in light of the magnitude of the release.clark american residential services llc th,kullar foot locker retail,th.
the augustus settlement released all claims that could have been raised as part of the plaintiffs claims.we must determine the meaning of the quoted phrase to define the extent to which the release operates as an estoppel.
t he interpretation of a release or settlement agreement is governed by the same principles applicable to any other contractual agreement.general motors superior court th.interpretation of a contract,including resolution of any ambiguity,is solely a judicial function.mackinnon truck ins.exch.cal th.the primary goal of contract interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intent of the parties,bank of the west superior court cal th.that intent is to be determined solely from the written provisions of the contract if possible,bank of the west,at aiu ins.superior court cal d,but also considering the circumstances under which the contract was made and the matter to which it relates.american alternative ins.superior court th.specific language must be interpreted in context and with regard to its intended function and the structure of the agreement as a whole,la jolla beach tennis club,industrial indem.cal th,mirpad california ins.guarantee th.contractual language is ambiguous if it is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation in the context of the policy as a whole.american alternative,supra,th at.in determining whether an ambiguity exists,a court should consider not only the face of the contract but also any extrinsic evidence that supports a reasonable interpretation.id.at.
the phrase could have been raised as part of the plaintiffs claims is similar in wording to the well established res judicata principle that a judgment is binding not only as to a claim actually raised,but also as to those matters that might have been raised in support of the claim actually raised,price sixth dist.agricultural cal,pacific mut.life ins.mcconnell cal d,amin khazindar calapp th.in other words,when an issue has been litigated all inquiry respecting the same is foreclosed,not only as to matters heard but also as to matters that could have been heard in support of or in opposition thereto e ven tho the causes of action be different,if the second action involves a right,title or issue as to which the judgment in the first action is a conclusive adjudication,the estoppel so far as that right,title or issue is concerned must likewise extend to every matter which was or might have been urged to sustain or defeat the determination actually made.citation.price sixth dist.agricultural cal.
the question is whether the phrase could have been raised as part of the plaintiffs claims means the same thing in the augustus settlement as it would in the res judicata context.though no party submitted evidence on the issue which itself necessitated that defendants motion for summary judgment be denied,substantial evidence suggests the augustus parties intended to release only claims that related to the plaintiffs overtime and split shift claims.first,as noted,the release language mirrors the phrasing of the res judicata precept.this commonality itself suggests the augustus parties intended the release to preclude,in accordance with res judicata principles,only claims that had already been asserted or those that could have been asserted to support claims already asserted.if the parties had intended a broader release they could have released all claims,or even all claims that could have been raised in the augustus litigation,not merely claims that could have been raised as part of the plaintiffs claims.
second,the fund created by the settlement was designated for payment of unpaid overtime wages.no mention was made of payment for other claims.
third,when characterizing the release,judge minning said it pertained to claims for unpaid wages,interest,penalties and fees,including but not limited to overtime,split shift premiums,work,and wai t ing time penalties he said nothing about a release of other labor code claims.
fourth,the parties had good reason to install a limited needed court approval of the settlement.class representatives have no standing to release all claims,and overbroad general releases should be avoided.any
