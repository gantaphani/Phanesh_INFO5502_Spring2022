plaintiffs and appellants past and present area sales managers asm employed by defendant and respondent the may department stores company respondent,alleged both individual and claims for failure to pay overtime compensation,conversion,violation of the unfair practices law bus,et,and violation of the labor code private attorneys general act of,et.based on the doctrine of collateral estoppel,the trial court sustained without leave to amend respondent demurrer to the complaint class action allegations and this appeal followed 
appellants seek reversal of the order,claiming that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is inapplicable to an order denying class certification in another lawsuit brought by other plaintiffs because absent putative class members are not bound prior to the certification of a class.alternatively,appellants contend that the doctrine of collateral estoppel was erroneously applied to the facts of this case.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
this lawsuit was initially filed in september.it is one of several lawsuits filed by appellants counsel against respondent on behalf of asm who were classified as exempt employees,and thus not paid overtime wages,although they worked more than hours per week.
the gorman case 
in july,appellants counsel filed a class action against respondent in los angeles county superior court gorman,gorman.the purported class in gorman consisted of approximately current and former employees of defendant robinsons department stores within the states of california,arizona and nevada,holding the position of a salaried manager designated by robinsons as an area sales manager within the last three years.the claims arose out of the alleged illegal designation of area sales managers as exempt employees and the failure of defendants,and each of them,to pay area sales managers overtime compensation.the complaint alleged failure to pay overtime compensation in violation of the labor code,unfair business practices bus,et,fraud,and negligent misrepresentation,and prayed for compensatory damages and injunctive relief.generally,it claimed that the asm performed many of the same functions as the nonexempt employees,but were told that they were not entitled to overtime pay.
the trial court denied class certification in gorman in december,stating that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate a community of interest or an ascertainable class and that the proposed class representatives were unsuitable because they had unsatisfactory employment histories.
the duran case 
in september,appellants counsel,in association with other attorneys,filed another class action in san bernardino county superior court against respondent on behalf of asm,alleging causes of action for failure to pay overtime wages,unlawful business practices,and conversion duran,duran.the complaint in duran alleged that all asm performed the same duties and the job is a standardized one completely lacking in independent discretion.
after an evidentiary hearing,the trial court denied a motion to certify the class in duran with respect to the labor code and conversion causes of action.the court of appeal affirmed the order in an unpublished opinion filed april.duran.the court of appeal opinion held that the declarations submitted in support of the motion established that the class members interests were so dissimilar that it would not be proper to certify plaintiffs as class representatives for a class whose members are so dissimilar in their interests.common questions of fact could not predominate.
in september,appellants counsel filed the present complaint on behalf of current former asm employees against respondent.it alleged that respondent intentionally and improperly designated them as exempt to avoid payment of overtime wages and other benefits.
respondent demurred to the third amended complaint tac based on the grounds that an order denying certification of the same class was issued in duran and thus appellants were barred from relitigating the issue under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.in addition,respondent claimed that the claims arising before february were barred by the statute of limitations.
the demurrer was argued on may,and taken under submission.on june,the court issued an order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend as to the class action allegations and with leave to amend as to the claims arising before february.the trial court order stated,inter alia,two cases preceded the filing of this case,gorman and duran.both cases sought to certify a class of current and former asms of plaintiffs argue that under federal law,the denial of class certification is never binding on absent putative class members defendant reply persuasively refutes plaintiffs argument plaintiffs do not argue that defendant failed to establish the required elements for application of collateral estoppel except privity defendants persuasively respond to plaintiffs argument 
the court also ordered all proceedings stayed once appellant filed a notice of appeal from the order on the demurrer.
contentions on appeal 
appellants contend that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer because the class allegations can not be resolved by way of a demurrer the gorman and duran cases had no plaintiffs in common with this case and thus the refusal in those cases to certify the class is not binding the principles of res judicata are inapplicable to this case respondent issue preclusion argument was rejected in the duran case by the court of appeal for the fourth appellate district and respondent demurrer was frivolous and based upon authority.
discussion 
a.the resolution of class certification on demurrer 
code of civil procedure section authorizes a class suit where a party can establish an ascertainable class and a community of interest.the community of interest requirement is satisfied by a showing of predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.drug stores,superior court cal th,d,lockheed martin superior court cal th,d.
class actions will not be permitted where there are diverse factual issues to be resolved,even though there may be many common questions of law.citation.a class action can not be maintained where each member right to recover depends on facts peculiar to his case.basurco century ins.th,d acree general motors acceptance th,d.
when an appellate court reviews a ruling on demurrer,its only task is to determine whether the complaint states a cause of action.moore regents of university of california cal d.an appellate court must affirm if the trial court decision to sustain the demurrer was correct on any theory.hendy losse cal d,d.kennedy baxter healthcare th,d.
trial courts properly and routinely decide the issue of class certification on demurrer.when class certification is challenged by demurrer,the trial court must determine whether there is a reasonable possibility plaintiffs can plead a prima facie community of interest among class members citation.the ultimate question in every case of this type is whether,given an ascertainable class,the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.citations.if the ability of each member of the class to recover clearly depends on a separate set of facts applicable only to him,then all of the policy considerations which justify class actions equally compel the dismissal of such inappropriate actions at the pleading stage.citation.newell state farm general ins.th,d,quoting silva block th,d.
it may be proper at the pleading stage to strike class allegations if the face of the complaint and other matters subject to judicial notice reveal the invalidity of the class allegations.canon,superior court th,d.an evidentiary hearing on the appropriateness of class litigation is not necessary unless there is a reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can establish a community of interest and ascertainable class.ibid.
b.the effect of the duran ruling 
duran case 
the duran complaint defined the potential class as all current and former employees of,holding the position of a salaried manager designated by,as an area sales manager,and who worked more than eight hours in any given day more than forty hours in any given week,during the period september,to the present and who were not paid overtime compensation pursuant to applicable cal.labor code requirements.
similarly,the tac in this case defines the potential class as all current and former employees of respondent,holding the position of a salaried manager designated by respondent as an area sales manager sometimes referred to herein as asm,and who worked more than eight hours in any given day more than forty hours in any given week and who were not paid overtime compensation pursuant to applicable cal.labor code requirements.
the complaint in duran alleged that asm should not have been classified as exempt employees because they spent more than percent of their time on nonmanagerial tasks and thus are entitled to overtime pay.the duran plaintiffs contended that all asm perform the same standardized work as dictated by.they claimed asm lack discretion and independence in merchandising,hiring,and supervising decisions.the declarations submitted by each of the parties from plaintiff and from defendant,in addition to excerpts from numerous depositions ranged from those who worked only on nonexempt tasks to those who regarded their work as executive and discretionary in nature.the court of appeal held that i f a similar split in opinion exists among asms,it would not be proper to certify plaintiffs as class representatives for a class whose members are so dissimilar in their interests.common questions of fact could not predominate among the asms.
in this case,as in duran,the tac alleges that respondent required the asm to work more than hours per week,but they were all classified as exempt and received no overtime pay.appellants contend they spend more than percent of their time performing nonexempt duties,that their job duties are standardized,and that they lack discretion or independent judgment in merchandising,hiring,and supervising decisions.
collateral estoppel 
collateral estoppel is a doctrine which prevents relitigation of issues previously argued and resolved in a prior proceeding.lucido superior court cal d.in order to apply this principle the issue must be identical to that decided in the prior proceeding the issue must have been actually litigated in the prior proceeding the issue must have been necessarily decided in the prior proceeding the decision must have been final and on the merits and preclusion must be sought against a person who was a party or in privity with a party to the prior proceeding.castillo city of los angeles th,d,citing lucido,supra.
i n deciding whether to apply collateral estoppel,the court must balance the rights of the party to be estopped against the need for applying collateral estoppel in the particular case,in order to promote judicial economy by minimizing repetitive litigation,to prevent inconsistent judgments which undermine the integrity of the judicial system,or to protect against vexatious litigation.clemmer hartford insurance cal d.
the initial question we must answer is the following what is the precise nature of appellants right at issue here our decision will not eliminate appellants substantive right to bring their lawsuit.instead,it could potentially deny them the ability to serve as a representative of other litigants.the distinction may be crucial when we balance appellants due process rights against the competing interests promoted by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.if the right to proceed as a class plaintiff is a property right,we must keep in mind the general principle in jurisprudence that one is not bound by a judgment in personam in a litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process.hansberry lee.hansberry.
appellants assert the right to be a class representative is inextricably tied to the right to pursue a personal claim.they argue that the power of the class action lawsuit provides the individual plaintiff with the means to successfully combat a social injustice that might otherwise go unabated.they conclude that a due process right to be a class representative must be recognized in light of the fact that the mere assertion of class allegations causes a defendant to recognize greater potential risk in an individual litigant claims,a substantive effect.
respondent argues that the interest in the right to sue as a class is not a protected property right.it argues while the courts have recognized that class actions facilitate the court ability to manage a lawsuit and achieve substantial justice in a particular case,the tool is subject to appropriate limitations.
in comparing other forms of representative lawsuits,our supreme court has reached the same conclusion.in hogan ingold cal d,the court discussed the rights of a shareholder who complained that limitations placed on her ability to bring a derivative suit deprived her of a valuable property right.the court wrote this contention can not be sustained a person has no property right in being appointed or in acting on his own nomination as a guardian ad litem.he may nominate himself but he can not compel the court to accept his nomination he has no property right to be accepted by the court to institute and maintain an action in the right of another on terms beyond the control of the court or the legislature.id.at.
in californians for disability rights mervyn,llc cal th,d,referring to the right under business and professions code section to bring lawsuits as a representative of the public,the court cited hogan and affirmed its holding that the interest in suing on another behalf is not a property right beyond statutory control.id.at,d.
appellants give no reason why a class plaintiff has any greater right to serve as a representative than a shareholder in a derivative action or a representative of the public in an unfair competition suit.that appellants can not is not surprising.there is no such right.we conclude that there is a distinction between using a prior ruling to bar a litigant from receiving a hearing on the merits and applying a prior decision to prevent a litigant from proceeding as a class representative.
nonetheless,appellants assert that the holding in duran can not bar their attempt to certify a class.they claim i t is an established rule of law that,in an action not certified as a class,the outcome of that action is binding only on the named parties.they urge that is the rule throughout the entire country regarding the res judicata effect of denial of certification on absent putative class members.in particular,appellants cite bittinger tecumseh products cir,bittinger.appellants overstate their case.
in bittinger,plaintiffs,acting individually and on behalf of a class of former employees,filed suit.the court granted defendant motion for summary judgment,but did not reach the question of class certification.bittinger,supra,at.bittinger,who was not an original plaintiff,brought suit on behalf of the same class.the trial court dismissed the class claims,relying on the doctrine of res judicata.the appellate court reversed,concluding that bittinger could not be bound by the prior decision.
bittinger does not assist appellants because the court did not hold that absentee class members may never be bound by a prior ruling denying class certification.nor did the court hold that class certification was necessary to bind absent class members.the case merely affirmed the basic principles of issue preclusion.in order to prevent the relitigation of an issue,that issue must have been decided in the prior proceeding,and the class issue was not decided in the first action.the other cases cited by appellant provide no support for their view.none of the cases deals with the question whether a court may enforce a prior class decision on litigants in a subsequent action.
