background 
commonwealth is a debt collection agency located in california.it sends automated debt collection notices to persons who bounce checks made payable to retail stores.plaintiffs are a class of california residents who received form debt collection letters from commonwealth.the class action complaint alleged that commonwealth form letters did not conform to the requirements of the federal fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,et,and california civil code.the parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge for all purposes,see c,and the plaintiff class was certified.
following extensive discovery and a motion for partial summary judgment,the magistrate judge found that defendants had blatantly violated explicit provisions of the fdcpa and california civil code.irwin mascott,d.the fdcpa prohibits,inter alia,the threat to take any action that is not intended to be taken.many of commonwealth form letters included a threat that commonwealth would bring suit against the debtor.indeed,many letters included a sample complaint.with respect to the vast majority of debts for which it sent letters,however,commonwealth violated because it did not truly intend to sue the debtors.california civil code a permits a creditor to collect a service charge of and treble the amount of the bounced check if the creditor sends the debtor a certified letter giving him or her thirty days to pay the amount due.if the debtor pays the amount of the check within thirty days,he or she must also pay the service charge and the cost of mailing the certified letter,but is not liable for treble damages.these are the only remedies available to a creditor when a california resident bounces a check.id.h.commonwealth violated by mailing letters by ordinary mail that immediately demanded treble damages,interest,and an amount greater than the cost of postage as the cost of mailing.
the magistrate judge granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiff class and permanently enjoined commonwealth,its subsidiaries,principals,officers,agents,employees,successors,and assigns from sending unlawful collection letters the injunction.commonwealth changed some of its practices in response to the injunction,but also continued to violate it in several ways.in late,the plaintiff class moved for a finding that defendants had violated the injunction and consequently were in contempt,and requested prospective remedies in anticipation of further violations.defendants argued that they had substantially complied with the injunction,but the magistrate judge found otherwise.see general signal donallco,cir substantial compliance is a defense to an action in civil contempt.
the magistrate judge declined to punish defendants for their past transgressions but,rather,gave them one last chance to comply with the injunction.accordingly,he entered an order the prospective order advising defendants that certain specific practices violated the injunction,ordering them to distribute a copy of the injunction to all commonwealth employees,and specifically providing that any future violations of the injunction would lead to a sanction of to be paid to the plaintiff class for each version of offending letter that had been sent.defendants did not appeal the prospective order,and the parties subsequently settled the class action.because of the settlement,an appeal of the underlying injunction was withdrawn.the settlement provided that defendants were obliged to continue to obey the injunction,and that plaintiffs were authorized to enforce it.
despite the provision in the prospective order stating that further noncompliance would result in monetary sanctions,commonwealth continued to send demand letters that violated the injunction.in addition,when one class member refused to pay the unlawful extra charges demanded by commonwealth,it reported the unpaid charges to a credit reporting agency.in early,plaintiffs moved for contempt sanctions.this motion was brought against commonwealth,defendant browning,and hyde.
hyde,though not a party,was commonwealth vice president of operations.he was the primary officer charged with overseeing the content and mailing methods of its collection letters.he was also intimately involved with the class action litigation.he submitted two declarations to the magistrate judge in opposition to plaintiffs motion that led to the prospective order,submitted a declaration in opposition to plaintiffs subsequent motion for contempt sanctions,and sat for two depositions.apart from browning,hyde was the only commonwealth employee who submitted a declaration in opposition to plaintiffs motions for sanctions and prospective relief.
in his declarations,hyde stated that he had worked for commonwealth since and had received notice of the injunction.he also signed an acknowledgment of receipt form indicating that he had received a copy of the injunction and the fdcpa.in his declarations,hyde described,in detail,the modifications and revisions he had made to commonwealth form demand letters in response to the injunction,and stated that he had instructed all of commonwealth debt collectors to comply with the injunction.he also stated that he was personally responsible for checking the amounts demanded on the approximately twenty letters sent each day.
after hearing oral argument,the magistrate judge found commonwealth,browning,and hyde to be in contempt of the injunction and the prospective order,and ordered them to pay,costs,and attorneys fees to the plaintiff class.defendants and hyde appeal,asserting that they had substantially complied with the magistrate judge orders.hyde also appeals on the separate ground that the magistrate judge lacked jurisdiction over him.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction over hyde 
we first decide whether the magistrate judge had jurisdiction over hyde.before a magistrate judge can adjudicate a civil action such as the one before us,the parties must consent to his or her exercise of jurisdiction.c see in re marriage of nasca,cir parties consent must be explicit,clear and unambiguous.we review de novo the issue of whether the magistrate judge had jurisdiction over hyde.see,united states real,cir whether magistrate judge has jurisdiction to enter default judgment in civil forfeiture action is reviewed de novo bingman ward,cir whether magistrate judge has jurisdiction to impose criminal contempt sanction is reviewed de novo.the question in this case is whether,in the absence of his own explicit consent,hyde may nonetheless be deemed to have consented to the exercise of jurisdiction by the magistrate judge.
