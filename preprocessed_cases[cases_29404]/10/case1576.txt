introduction 
plaintiffs filed a wage and hour class action lawsuit against telecom network services alleging,among other things,violation of meal and rest break requirements and failure to pay overtime.the proposed class consisted of approximately tower technicians,most of whom were hired and paid by staffing companies that contracted with tns.the remainder of the technicians approximately of the proposed class were hired and paid by tns directly.plaintiffs alleged that tns was the employer of both categories of technicians and moved to certify their claims.
the trial court denied the motion,concluding that,even if it assumed tns was the employer of every class member,plaintiffs could not establish tns liability through common proof because the technicians worked under a diversity of workplace conditions that enabled some of them to take meal and rest breaks and the staffing companies that hired and paid many of the tns technicians had adopted different meal,rest break and overtime policies throughout the class period.we reverse the order and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
background facts 
telecom network specialists tns provides personnel services to the telecommunication industry.tns customers,which include t mobile and ericsson,own cell phone towers or supply cell phone equipment.tns,in turn,locates skilled technical laborers to perform installation,maintenance and repair of equipment at its customer cell sites.tns retains its technicians either by hiring them directly,or through staffing agencies which locate and hire technical personnel.under its agreements with these staffing agencies,tns pays each agency an agreed upon hourly rate for each hour of labor worked by the technician the agency,in turn,pays the technician a separate hourly rate 
on june,plaintiff lorenzo benton filed a class action complaint against tns alleging numerous violations of california wage and hours laws,including failure to pay overtime labor code,tit,subd.failure to provide adequate meal and rest breaks,tit,subds.failure to furnish accurate wage statements and maintain accurate payroll records,tit,subd.and unfair business practices.bus.
the operative second amended complaint,filed in,alleged that every technician hired to perform work for tns c ustomers,either directly or through staffing companies,were tns employees,regardless of whether they may have also been the employees of the staffing companies or the label tns or any other entity purported to apply to those persons such as independent contractor or otherwise.the complaint further alleged that n either tns nor its agents paid overtime or had any policy of providing meal breaks or rest breaks to the workers as required by california law.
plaintiffs class action allegations stated that they sought to represent a class consist ing of all persons who provided skilled technical labor for the benefit of tns c ustomers through tns where the work was performed in california within the c lass period the complaint alleged that there were numerous questions of law and fact common to the class,including,in part w hether tns was the employer of the c lass m embers w hether tns provided meal and rest breaks in accordance with california law and w hether the c lass m embers were denied premium wages for overtime worked in violation of california law.
plaintiffs motion for class certification 
plaintiffs motion and supporting evidencea.summary of plaintiffs argument 
on april,plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification asserting that the principle sic issue presented in the suit was whether tns is the class members all other issues in the case flow closely from this one.plaintiffs contended that this princip al issue could be determined on a basis through common proof demonstrating tns exerted exclusive control over all its technicians,including those who were referred to tns by a staffing company contractor technicians 
in support,plaintiffs cited to evidence that,in their view,showed tns treated its direct hire technicians and contractor technicians in the same manner tns told contractor technicians what job site to attend and what work to perform while on the job site,contractor technicians worked under the exclusive control of tns supervisors contractor technicians were required to enter their hours into tns trinity time keeping system,which then had to be approved by tns supervisors and the staffing companies did not have any personnel at the tns job sites and performed no supervisory functions regarding the work that contractor technicians performed for tns.
plaintiffs also argued that tns liability for violating meal and rest period requirements could be determined on a basis.plaintiffs contended that,under the applicable wage order,tns was obligated to adopt a policy authorizing and permitting all of its technicians to take their meal and rest breaks.they further asserted that the evidence showed tns had failed to adopt any such policy.plaintiffs raised similar arguments regarding their overtime claims,asserting that common proof could be used to determine whether tns had violated overtime laws by failing to ensure its staffing companies had paid the contractor technician overtime.
summary of evidence filed in support of motion for certification 
plaintiffs motion was supported by more than declarations from putative class members deposition testimony from two tns employees and six staffing company employees numerous documents,including various tns employee handbooks and several master services agreements that tns had entered into with its staffing companies and a declaration from plaintiffs counsel.
the content of the plaintiffs class member declarations only one of which was from a direct hire technician was essentially identical.the declarants each stated that,after being hired by a staffing company,they were told to contact tns to obtain information about their assignment.once the contractor technician made the initial contact at tns,the working conditions were controlled exclusively by tns.the technicians assignments were distributed by a tns supervisor,who told the technicians where to go and what work needed to be performed when they arrived.the technicians generally travelled from cell site to cell site,working either alone or with a team of other technicians.the work generally consisted of performing installation,upgrading,testing and maintenance of cellular telephone sites in the field according to the direction of tns.according to the declarants,once they had received their assignment from tns,the staffing company did not provide any instructions,direction or supervision regarding either what work to do or how to perform it 
on the issue of rest periods,each of the declarants asserted no one at tns ever told me what a rest break or meal break was,or whether i was permitted or entitled to take breaks,or when to take breaks,or anything else about breaks.the technicians reported that although they were occasionally able to take breaks,they were rarely able to take an uninterrupted minute rest break,or a minute meal period.the inability to take uninterrupted breaks was caused,in part,by the technicians schedules and the nature of the cellular communications business.the declarants explained that tns sought to avoid disruptions in cell service and therefore required its technicians to complete their job assignments as quickly as possible frequently,work had to be completed during a maintenance window that ran between and a,when customer demand for service coverage is lowest.tns placed considerable pressure on technicians to finish the work within the window and not to go into the peak service hours.thus,it was usually not practical to take either rest or meal breaks while the work was ongoing.this was particular true when a technician was working alone 
the declarants also stated that the staffing companies did not have any way of knowing if technicians were taking meal and rest periods.each declarant also alleged that he or she had not considered any information the staffing company had provided regarding break periods,explaining regardless of any policies regarding breaks that the staffing company might have had,i was being directly told what to do and supervised by tns and i never considered whether the staffing company wanted me to take breaks 
the declarants also reported that they were required to enter their hours into a tns system called trinity.a tns supervisor was required to approve the technician reported time before it was finalized and reported to the staffing company.the trinity system did not record whether technicians had taken rest or meal breaks,nor were technicians told to record when they had missed a break 
plaintiffs also submitted excerpts from depositions of two individuals tns had designated as persons most knowledgeable see code of civil,jeffrey ellis,who provided testimony about tns practices regarding contractor technicians and neal gee,who provided testimony about tns practices regarding direct hire technicians.ellis had worked for tns since and supervised technicians in california between and,and again in.as a supervisor,he was responsible for creating a work schedule,deploying technicians and ensuring the quality of the technicians work.ellis stated that tns maintained ultimate control of the work sites and was responsible for the final quality of the work.ellis reported that,while on the job sites,tns treated its direct hire technicians and contractor technicians in exactly the same way both groups of technicians performed the same work,attended the same meetings and used the same type of equipment.ellis also stated that a supervisor would not be able to distinguish a direct hire technician from a contractor technician based on their duties.
ellis testified that the technicians normally worked alone at a cell site.when asked what instruction he would give worker s as far as meal breaks and rest breaks,ellis stated i would not tell them you need to take a lunch now.they are in charge at the site t hey take their breaks,and they take their lunches when they take them.ellis was also asked what he did to ensure technicians working in the field took a minute meal period for every five hours of work.in response ellis stated,a t the time i was out there,i was unaware that that was a california law requirement,adding,b ut as far as lunches and breaks,technicians understood that was all right and decided on an individual basis on how to take their meals.ellis explained that he first learned about california meal and rest period requirements through this lawsuit,which was not common knowledge within the company.after learning about california meal and rest period requirements,ellis began informing technicians that they needed to read wage and hour posters that appeared at some of the tns job sites and take their required meal and rest breaks.ellis did not know if any other tns supervisors or managers told technicians that they were entitled to meal and rest periods.
ellis also stated,however,that in the president and vice president of tns informed supervisors that technicians should start recording their meal periods into the notes section of trinity.in,ellis received an email from management reminding supervisors to tell their technicians that they were required to comply with this requirement.
neal gee testified that,prior to,tns hired very few technicians directly,relying primarily on contractor technicians.gee authenticated tns employee handbooks from,and and confirmed that tns provided a handbook to all of its direct hire technicians.each of the handbooks contained an identical meal and rest period breaks section stating your supervisor will inform you when meals or breaks are to be taken and will designate the area to be used.short rest breaks will usually be paid time and may be interrupted as necessary.you must remain on tns premises when taking a tns paid break.meal periods are usually time therefore you should not work during that time.during exceptionally busy times,it may be necessary to shorten or interrupt scheduled lunch periods gee also testified that contractor technicians did not receive an employment manual or any other documents describing any kind of policies and procedure s they were supposed to do or not do.gee also reported that,currently,all its technicians were required to record their meal and rest break periods in the notes section of trinity.
plaintiffs also submitted deposition testimony from six different staffing company employees,which showed that some of the companies had adopted meal and rest break policies and others had not.all of the staffing company employees,however,indicated that their company had no way of knowing whether the contractor technicians were taking breaks when they were working on tns jobs.several of the staffing company employees also stated that their company had no supervision,control or involvement in the activities of contractor technicians who were working on a tns project.
the documentary evidence plaintiffs submitted in support of their motion included numerous different master service agreements msas that tns had entered into with its staffing companies between the years of and.although the terms of the msas were largely consistent,the wording of some provisions differed.each of the msas stated that tns had agreed to pay the staffing company a fixed,hourly rate for each contractor technician time the staffing company,in turn,was solely responsible for compensating the contractor technician.the msas required the staffing company to submit weekly invoices,which were to be supported by copies of trinity time sheets,approved by tns designated site manager.the hourly rate that tns paid to the staffing company did not have an overtime component,meaning that it paid the same hourly rate to the staffing company regardless of how many hours the technician worked during that time period.
all of the msas provided that tns was responsible for accepting or rejecting the w ork performed by the contractor technician and retained sole discretion to remove any contractor technician from the work site.msas entered into in or before further provided that tns was entitled to designate a site manager to maintain control of the work site and required that contractor technicians follow his direction at all times.
msas entered into in and included a provision stating that the staffing company would notify employees in writing of their rights and responsibility under applicable state and federal wage and hour laws including but not limited to,where applicable,any entitlement to overtime double time,and any entitlement to meal and rest periods msas entered into in and contained a similar provision under which the staffing company coveted to comply with all applicable federal and state wage and hour laws.msas entered into in and contained no reference to compliance with wage and hour laws.
plaintiffs also submitted a declaration from their attorney indicating that she had reviewed payroll records that several staffing companies had produced during discovery.the attorney stated that,based on her review,it appear ed that six staffing companies paid overtime rates in accordance with california law.the payroll records provided by other staffing companies appear ed to show that either the staffing company did not pay overtime rates or underpaid overtime required by california law.
tns opposition and supporting evidence 
in its opposition,tns asserted that class certification was improper because the evidence showed that common issues do not predominate.according to tns,the evidence showed that the putative class members performed different types of work under very diverse working conditions,they were not uniformly classified as employees,they worked for a variety of companies with diverse overtime and pay and payroll reporting practices,and with no or different meal and rest period policies that were implemented at various times during the class period.
tns argued that whether it qualified as a joint employer of the contractor technicians could not be determined through common proof because the evidence showed technicians were subject to varying levels of control and supervision.tns contended that technicians normally worked alone,without any supervision and that many felt as if they were their own supervisors.tns further asserted that each of the named plaintiffs had personally admitted in deposition testimony that they had little interaction with tns supervisors during their activities.
tns also argued that,even if its status as a joint employer could be determined on basis,common issues did not predominate as to whether tns was liable for alleged missed meal and rest periods.tns contended that,in brinker restaurant superior court cal th brinker which had been decided one week before tns filed its opposition the california supreme court clarified that to establish liability for a missed break s,the employee must show that he was forced to forego his break,as opposed to merely showing that he did not take it regardless of the reason.in tns view,brinker demonstrated that its liability c ould not be established without individual trial to determine whether and why each class member did not take a break on any particular day.
tns also argued that the court should deny certification of the break claims because plaintiffs had not identified any uniform policy or practice regarding meal and break periods rather,according to tns,the parties evidence showed that the staffing companies had a variety of different policies regarding meal and rest periods,thereby demonstrating that no uniform policy was applied on a basis.tns further contended that the evidence showed that many technicians worked with limited supervision,and therefore had the ability to take breaks whenever they wanted some technicians had been informed of their meal and rest period rights through a tns supervisor or a staffing company and although some technicians took breaks,others chose to skip them in an effort complete their assignments more quickly.
tns raised similar arguments regarding plaintiffs overtime claim,asserting that plaintiffs evidence showed that some staffing companies had a policy of paying overtime,while others did not.tns argued that,in light of this evidence,an individualized inquiry w ould be required to determine,with respect to each and every staffing company,whether they paid recorded overtime in compliance with california law.
in support of its opposition,tns provided declarations from putative class members nine direct hires and six contractors that described the different types of work that tns technicians performed.according to the declarations,technicians normally worked at either a cell site or a switch station.the cell sites were indoor or outdoor shelters that housed cell phone antennas and electronic telecommunication equipment.the sites were located in a wide range of geographic locations,including rooftops,office buildings and remote outdoor areas.the technicians work at the cell sites consisted of installing new telecommunications equipment,loading communications software and testing new equipment.the amount of time the technicians spent at each site differed depending on the nature of the assignment some days technicians worked at a single cell site,and other days they traveled to many different sites.technicians also worked at different times of the day some technicians worked during the daytime,while others worked at night,during the maintenance window.tns declarations explained that,in contrast to cell sites,switch stations were located in office buildings owned by tns customers.technicians would frequently stay at the same switch station for several weeks installing and testing new equipment that was not yet in service.
tns declarations also described the technicians experiences with meal and rest periods.all of the declarants indicated that because they normally worked without supervision,they were able to take breaks whenever they wanted.the technicians stated that they took meal and break periods when they felt they were needed,and that tns had never discouraged or prevented technicians from taking breaks.although some of the declarants stated that tns did not provide any information regarding rest and meal periods,one technician stated that tns made it clear that he was entitled to meal and rest breaks.several other technicians stated that they had become aware of their meal and rest break rights either through their staffing company or through wage and hour posters that were located at some of the job sites.three of the declarants,all of whom had been hired by tns between and which was four to five years after the case was filed,reported that their tns supervisors had told them to take their meal and rest periods.
finally,each tns declarations indicated that technicians who reported working more than hours in a week,or hours in a day,had received overtime pay.
trial court proceedings on plaintiffs motion for certification 
prior to the hearing on plaintiffs motion,which was held on may,the trial court issued a tentative ruling denying certification.the tentative order explained that,even if the court assumed tns was the joint employer of the contractor technicians,certification was improper because the evidence showed that some technicians worked under conditions that permitted them to take breaks,while others did not and some of the staffing companies had adopted proper overtime and meal and rest period policies,while others had not.in the court view,this evidence showed that substantial,individual inquiry would be necessary to determine whether tns was liable to the class.
at oral argument,plaintiffs counsel argued that the staffing companies meal and break policies were irrelevant because the unrefuted evidence is that those staffing companies had no knowledge or control of whether any of those policies were or could be carried out at the work site.in response,defense counsel argued that,under brinker,supra,cal th,tns was only obligated to provide its workers the opportunity to take breaks and that plaintiffs had provided no evidence of a policy denying or discouraging meal and rest periods.defense counsel further asserted that the evidence showed some class members were informed of their meal and rest period rights,while others were not,and that some class members had taken their meal and rest periods,while others had not.
plaintiffs counsel disagreed with tns interpretation of brinker,asserting that tns failure to adopt any policy authorizing and permitting technicians of their meal and rest breaks constituted a violation that could be properly certified.the court,however,disagreed,explaining that it did not believe that an employer failure to adopt a policy authorizing meal and rest breaks constituted a violation.rather,the court believed that,under brinker,the employer was merely required to provide its employees liberty to take meal and rest periods the court further explained that the parties evidence demonstrated there was no uniformity as to whether class members had been provided such liberty in this case.
following the hearing,the court entered a written order adopting its tentative ruling denying plaintiffs motion for certification.the order explained that,even if the court assumed tns wa s the of all class members,th e group of workers wa s too diverse for class treatment in two different ways.the order first explained that the parties evidence showed that class members were governed by diverse management policies.more specifically,the court found that the staffing companies who provided workers to tns had adopted a variety of different policies regarding rest and meal periods.the order cited evidence indicating that some of the staffing companies had adopted meal and rest period policies while others had not.
the second reason the court provided in support of denial was that the physical workplace situations of class members are diverse.according to the order,the parties evidence showed that c ell sites differ one from another,and all cell sites differ from switch stations.at many of these places,the putative class members effectively worked as their own bosses when it came to meal and rest breaks.in other words,no one was around to tell them when to work or when to break they were at liberty to do as they pleased.whether there were break violations turns on specific details about what happened at each specific site 
in summarizing its ruling,the court order explained that the evidence shows t here is no single way to determine whether tns is liable to the class for failure to provide breaks.some workers did not get breaks.other workers were on their own and at complete liberty to take breaks as they pleased,with no time or management pressure.the order also stated that the same holds true for the proposed overtime class.
plaintiffs filed a timely appeal of the court order denying certification.see richmond dart industries,cal d,a decision by a trial court denying certification to an entire class is an appealable order.
discussion 
legal principles regarding class certification and standard of review 
class actions are statutorily authorized when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court code civ.ghazaryan diva limousine,th,ghazaryan.the party seeking certification has the burden to establish,among other things,that common issues predominate in the litigation.see drug stores,superior cou rt cal th.
the certification question is essentially a procedural one that does not ask whether an action is legally or factually meritorious.citation.a trial court ruling on a certification motion determines whether the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.citations,supra,cal th at.on the issue whether common issues predominate in the litigation,a court must examine the plaintiff theory of recovery and assess the nature of the legal and factual disputes likely to be presented.citation.in conducting this analysis,a court must examine the allegations of the complaint and supporting declarations citation,and consider whether the legal and factual issues they present are such that their resolution in a single class proceeding would be both desirable and feasible.as a general rule if the defendant liability can be determined by facts common to all members of the class,a class will be certified even if the members must individually prove their damages.citation.bradley networkers international th,bradley.
a trial court is generally afforded great latitude in granting or denying class certification,and we normally review a ruling on certification for an abuse of discretion.citation.this deferential standard of review,however,is inapplicable if the trial court has evaluated class certification using improper criteria or an incorrect legal analysis a trial court ruling supported by substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous legal assumptions were made.citations.ghazaryan,supra,th at.in conducting our review,we must examine the trial court reasons for denying class certification.citation.we consider only the reasons cited by the trial court for the denial,and ignore other reasons that might support denial.citation.jaimez daiohs usa,th,jaimez.
summary of applicable wage and hour requirements and recent case law addressing wage and hour certification motions 
summary of applicable wage and hour rules and statutes 
plaintiffs sought certification of two subclasses of claims violation of meal and rest period provisions and failure to pay overtime.california meal and rest break rules,as well as rules governing overtime pay,are contained in wage orders issued by the industrial welfare commission iwc on an basis.bradley,supra,th at see also brinker,supra,cal th at.the telecommunications employees in this case are covered by wage order wage order,which is codified in the california code of regulations at title,section.see bradley,supra,th at.
the rest period provisions of the wage order require that every employer authorize and permit all employees to take rest periods,which shall be based on the total hours worked daily at the rate of ten minutes net rest time per four hours or major fraction thereof,tit,subd.a.rest periods are to be counted as hours worked and employers are required to pay one hour of pay at the regular rate for each workday that the rest period is not provided,tit,subds.a b.

recent case law addressing wage and hour certification motions 
in,the california supreme court granted review in brinker superior court previously published at d review granted october,which addressed numerous issues regarding the scope of an employer meal and rest break obligations and the criteria used to assess motions seeking to certify wage and hour claims.following its grant of review in brinker,the court granted review of several additional cases involving wage and hour certification issues cases and ordered that they be held pending its decision in brinker.among those cases were bradley superior court and faulkinbury boyd associates,both of which had affirmed a trial court order denying certification of meal,rest break and overtime claims.see bradley,supra,th at faulkinbury boyd associates th,faulkinbury describing procedural history.
several weeks before the trial court entered its order denying certification in this case,the supreme court issued its decision in brinker,supra,cal th.shortly thereafter,the court remanded bradley and faulkinbury to the court of appeal with directions to vacate the prior decisions and reconsider the cause s in light of brinker.bradley,supra,th at faulkinbury,supra,th at.following remand,the bradley and faulkinbury courts each issued published decisions holding that,under the analysis set forth in brinker,the trial court had erred in denying class certification.because brinker,bradley and faulkinbury are highly relevant to the issues presented here,we summarize them at length.
brinker superior court 
in brinker,supra,cal th,plaintiffs sought class certification of various wage and hour claims on behalf of restaurant employees governed by wage order the plaintiffs motion requested certification of several subclasses,including a class alleging employees were not provided their required minute rest breaks a class alleging employees were not provided timely and sufficient meal breaks bradley,supra,th at.the trial court granted the motion,but the court of appeal reversed.the supreme court granted review to resolve uncertainties in the handling of wage and hour class certification motions.brinker,supra,cal th at.
plaintiffs rest break claim asserted that defendant had adopted a uniform,unlawful policy that provided employees a single minute rest break for every four hours worked.plaintiffs contended that this policy violated wage order rest period rules,which required a minute rest break per four hours or major fraction thereof,except where the employees total daily work time totaled less than three and hours.brinker,supra,cal th at.under plaintiffs theory,the defendant policy unlawfully denied a rest period to employees who had worked more than three and hours,but less than four hours,and unlawfully denied a second rest break period to employees who had worked more than six hours,but less than eight hours.
although the trial court ruled plaintiffs rest break claim was amenable to class treatment,the court of appeal disagreed,explaining,in part,that because rest breaks can be waived any showing on a class basis that plaintiffs or other members of the proposed class missed rest breaks or took shortened rest breaks would not necessarily establish,without further individualized proof,that the defendant violated wage order.brinker,supra,cal th at.stated more simply,the court ruled that,to establish liability under the applicable rest period provisions,each class member would have to demonstrate he or she missed or took shortened break periods as a result of defendant allegedly unlawful policy,rather than as a result of waiver,which would require substantial individual inquiry.
the supreme court began its analysis by clarifying the scope of the rest period requirements,which require an employer to provide minutes rest for shifts from three and to six hours in length,minutes for shifts of more than six hours up to hours,minutes for shifts of more than hours up to hours.brinker,supra,cal th at.the court further held that the trial court had properly certified plaintiffs rest break claim because c lasswide liability could be established through common proof that the defendant uniform rest break policy violated those requirements.id.at.
in reaching its holding,the court rejected the court of appeal reasoning that the defendant would only become liable only upon a showing that each class member missed his or her break period as a result of the allegedly unlawful policy,rather than through waiver an employer is required to authorize and permit the amount of rest break time called for under the wage order for its industry.if it does not if,for example,it adopts a uniform policy authorizing and permitting only one rest break for employees working a shift when two are required it has violated the wage order and is liable.no issue of waiver ever arises for a rest break that was required by law but never authorized if a break is not authorized,an employee has no opportunity to decline to take it.as plaintiffs pleaded and presented substantial evidence of a uniform rest break policy authorizing breaks only for each full four hours worked,the trial court certification of a rest break subclass should not have been disturbed.ibid.
the court further explained that although it had,at the parties request,agreed to address the scope of an employer rest break duties,the preferred practice was to determine class certification independent of threshold questions disposing of the merits.brinker,supra,cal th at.the court concluded that,for the purposes of deciding the certification issue,it was sufficient that plaintiffs theory of liability that defendant has a uniform policy,and that that policy,measured against wage order requirements,allegedly violates the law is by its nature a common question eminently suited for class treatment.ibid.
the court also addressed plaintiffs meal break claims,which had two components the defendant had allegedly failed to ensure that work stops for the required thirty minute meal period brinker,supra,cal th at and the defendant had allegedly failed to provide a second meal period no later than five hours after the end of the first meal period.on the first claim,the court agreed with defendant contention that an employer is obligated only to make available meal periods,with no responsibility for whether they are taken.ibid.the court explained that,to discharge its meal period obligations,the employer need only relieve its employees of all duty,relinquish control over their activities and permits them a reasonable opportunity to take an uninterrupted minute break,and not impede or discourage them from doing so t he employer is not obligated to police meal breaks and ensure no work thereafter is performed.id.at.
the court also rejected the second part of plaintiffs claim,clarifying that an employer only obligation is to provide a first meal period after no more than five hours of work and a second meal period after no more than hours of work.brinker,supra,cal th at.thus,for example,contrary to the plaintiffs reading of the meal requirements,an employee who was provided a meal period during the first hour of an eight hour shift was not entitled to a second meal period.
on the issue of certification of the meal break claim,the court elected to remand the question to the trial court,concluding that the trial court order may have been influenced by the erroneous legal assumption that employees are entitled to a meal period every five hours.brinker,supra,cal th at.the court explained that because its ruling had changed the legal landscape,the prudent course was to remand the issue to the trial court in light of the clarification of the law id.at.
bradley superior court 
in bradley,supra,th,plaintiffs sought to certify a class of telecommunications technicians whose job duties were similar if not identical to the duties of the purported class members at issue in this case.the defendant,networkers international,contracted with telecommunication companies to supply skilled laborers to install and service cell sites in southern california.id.at.to fulfill these contracts,networkers retained approximately field technicians to provide repair and installation services at the cell sites.ibid.each technician was required to sign a standardized independent contractor agreement containing language reflecting an independent contractor relationship.because networkers characterized the technicians as independent contractors,it did not pay premium wages for overtime or establish a policy requiring meal or rest breaks.id.at.at some point in,networkers reclassified its technicians as employees and began paying them overtime the company did not,however,implement a meal or rest break policy.
in,plaintiffs filed a class action alleging networkers violated wage and hour laws by,among other things,failing to pay overtime and failing to adopt a policy providing its technicians rest and meal breaks.in support of their motion for certification,plaintiffs submitted numerous class declarations asserting that the technicians job duties and working conditions differed substantially from the job description set forth in networker standardized independent contractor agreement.each declarant also denied having been paid overtime or receiving meal or rest breaks.in addition to the declarations,plaintiffs submitted discovery responses in which networkers admitted that it did not pay overtime to its technicians members until the reclassification it did not have a rest or meal break policy or maintain records of rest or meal breaks and because it did not supervise its technicians,it did not know whether the workers took rest or meal breaks,nor did it know the extent or frequency of such breaks.bradley,supra,th at.
the trial court denied certification for two reasons.first,it explained that individual issues predominated as to whether each class member qualified as an independent contractor.bradley,supra,th at.second,the court concluded that certification was improper because,to establish networkers liability,each technician would have to individually demonstrate the actual existence of damages the manner of incurring damages.ibid.in its initial now vacated opinion,the court of appeal affirmed,ruling that although substantial evidence did not support the trial court finding that individual issues would predominate the question whether class members qualified as independent contractors,there were reasonable grounds for the trial court to conclude that determining the existence and amount of damages for each class member would require individual inquiry into which employees had missed breaks and whether those missed breaks were the result of networkers lack of a break policy.id.at,explaining reasoning set forth in its vacated opinion.
on remand from the supreme court,however,the court of appeal concluded that,under the analysis set forth in brinker,the trial court had improperly focused on individual issues related to damages,rather than on the plaintiffs theory of liability.bradley,supra,th at.according to the court,brinker had clarified that in ruling on the predominance issue in a certification motion,the court must focus on the plaintiff theory of recovery and assess the nature of the legal and factual disputes likely to be presented and determine whether individual or common issues predominate.id.at.the court further explained that plaintiffs theory of recovery wa s based on networkers uniform lack of a rest and meal break policy and its uniform failure to authorize employees to take statutorily required rest and meal breaks.the lack of a break policy and the uniform failure to authorize such breaks are matters of common proof.although an employer could potentially defend these claims by arguing that it did have an informal or unwritten meal or rest break policy,this defense is also a matter of common proof.id.at.
bradley further explained that brinker had expressly rejected that evidence showing some employees took rest breaks and other employees were offered rest breaks but declined to take them made class certification inappropriate.bradley,supra,th at.rather,brinker made clear that when an employer has not authorized and not provided meal rest breaks,the employer has violated the law and is liable.id.at.according to the court,under brinker logic,the fact that an employee may have actually taken a break or was able to eat food during the work day would only be relevant to determining individual damages,which was not a sufficient basis for denying class certification.id.at.
the court applied similar analysis to plaintiffs overtime claim,concluding that whether networkers had violated wage and order laws by failing to pay its technicians overtime prior to could be determined on a basis.the court rejected networkers argument that certification was improper because the amount of overtime pay damages would require individualized analysis as to the number of hours technicians worked each day.bradley,supra,th at.as with the meal and rest break claim,the court concluded that such issues were only relevant to determining the existence and amount of each class member damages.
faulkinbury superior court 
in faulkinbury,supra,th,plaintiffs sought to certify a wage and hour class action on behalf of current and former security guards.plaintiffs asserted that the defendant had violated meal and rest period requirements by forcing its employees to sign an agreement stating that the nature of their work required them to take their meal periods and failing to authorize or permit rest breaks.defendant,however,argued that its break policy was proper under the nature of the work exception,which permits meal periods when the nature of the work prevents an employee from being relieved of all duty and when by written agreement between the parties an paid meal period is agreed to,tit,subd.a.id.at.the defendant further contended that determining whether it was liable for meal and rest break violations would require individualized inquiry into whether each employee had actually taken meal breaks and missed rest breaks as the result of the defendant policies.id.at.the trial court denied certification,concluding that plaintiffs claims turned on individual issues regarding the circumstances of each security officer employment conditions.
in its opinion,the appellate court affirmed the order denying certification.on plaintiffs meal break claim,the court concluded that even if the defendant uniform meal break policy was unlawful,the defendant would only become liable upon an individualized showing that each security guard actually took meal periods.see faulkinbury,supra,th at explaining the reasoning set forth in its vacated opinion.similarly,on plaintiffs rest break claim,the court ruled that the defendant liability for failing to authorize and permit rest breaks could not be established without individual inquiry into whether each employee had been provided the opportunity to take rest periods.in support,the court noted that several putative class members had provided declarations indicating that they had been relieved of their duties to take rest breaks,or were otherwise able to take rest breaks during periods of inactivity.id.at.
upon remand from the supreme court,the appellate court concluded that brinker had rejected the mode of analysis set forth in its original opinion.as to plaintiffs meal break claim,the appellate court explained that brinker clarified that the defendant liability would attach upon a determination that defendant uniform meal break policy was unlawful whether or not the employee was able to take the required break goes to damages,and t he fact that individual employees may have different damages does not require denial of the class certification motion.citation.faulkinbury,supra,th at.
the court reached a similar conclusion regarding plaintiffs rest break claim,explaining that plaintiffs had alleged the defendant had no formal rest break policy and required employees to stay at their post for their entire shift.faulkinbury,supra,th at.the court ruled that,under the analysis set forth in brinker,the the lawfulness of defendant lack of rest break policy and requirement that all security guard employees remain at their posts can be determined on a classwide basis.id.at.the court further concluded that brinker had rejected its prior reasoning that evidence showing some class members were authorized or able to take rest breaks was sufficient to defeat certification while,in faulkinbury i,we concluded this evidence established individual issues of liability,we are now convinced,in light of brinker,this evidence at most establishes individual issues of damages,which would not preclude class certification.defendant liability,if any,would arise upon a finding that its uniform rest break policy,or lack of policy,was unlawful.ibid.
c.the trial court erred in denying plaintiffs motion for certification 
plaintiffs meal and rest period claims 
the trial court order denying certification focuses primarily on plaintiffs claims that tns violated meal and rest break requirements set forth in wage order number.we therefore address those claims first.
as in bradley,supra,th,the plaintiffs theory of legal liability faulkinbury,supra,th at is that tns violated wage and hour requirements by failing to adopt a policy authorizing and permitting its technicians to take meal or rest break periods.in plaintiffs view,tns was obligated to implement procedures ensuring that technicians received notice of their meal and rest period rights and were permitted to exercise those rights.for the purposes of class certification,the question is whether this theory of recovery can be proved or disproved through common facts and law.bradley,supra,th at faulkinbury,supra,th at brinker focuses on whether the lawfulness of an employer lack of a rest break policy can be determined on a classwide basis.
the trial court provided two distinct reasons in support of its conclusion that plaintiffs meal and rest break claims could not be determined through common proof.jaimez,supra,th at in reviewing denial of class certification,appellate court must consider only the reasons cited for the denial.first,it found that tns had provided substantial evidence showing that whether technicians were able to take meal and rest periods depended on their individualized physical workplace situations.second,the court concluded that the parties evidence demonstrated that the staffing companies who hired many of the putative class members utilized a variety of different meal and rest period policies.
evidence that some employees worked under conditions that permitted them to take breaks is not a sufficient basis for denying certification 
the trial court concluded that class certification was improper because the parties evidence showed that some technicians working conditions permitted them to take meal and rest breaks,while others did not.more specifically,the court found that while tns declarations showed that some technicians worked on their own and at complete liberty to take breaks as they pleased,with no time or management pressure,plaintiffs declarations showed that other technicians worked under severe time constraints that precluded them from taking proper meal and rest periods.according to the court,as a result of these diverse working conditions,there was no single way to determine whether tns is liable to the class for failure to provide breaks.
as in bradley and faulkinbury,the trial court employed improper criteria in assessing whether plaintiffs meal and rest break claims were amenable to class treatment.rather than focusing on whether plaintiffs theory of liability that tns violated wage and hour requirements by failing to adopt a meal and rest period policy was susceptible to common proof,the court improperly focused on whether individualized inquiry would be required to determine which technicians had missed their meal and rest periods.the written order as well as statements made at the motion hearing make clear that the trial court did not believe tns would be liable upon a determination that its lack of a meal and rest policy violated applicable wage and hour requirements rather,it concluded that tns would become liable only upon a showing that a technician had missed breaks as a result of tns policies.
as explained in bradley and faulkinbury,however,brinker expressly rejected this mode of analysis.bradley,supra,th at,faulkinbury,supra,th at.as succinctly stated in faulkinbury the employer liability arises by adopting a uniform policy that violates the wage and hour laws.whether or not the employee was able to take the required break goes to damages,and t he fact that individual employees may have different damages does not require denial of the class certification motion.citation.faulkinbury,supra,th at see also bradley,supra,th at under the logic of brinker,when an employer has not authorized and not provided meal rest breaks,the employer has violated the law and the fact that an employee may have actually taken a break or was able to take a break during the work day does not show that individual issues will predominate in the litigation.indeed,bradley and faulkinbury both specifically concluded that evidence showing that some class members working conditions permitted them to take breaks,while others did not,was not a sufficient basis for denying certification.see faulkinbury,supra,th at evidence that some employees were able to take breaks at their posts,while others could not leave the assigned post for a rest break does not establish individual issues of liability bradley,supra,th at evidence that some employees worked alone for long periods of time or took the authorized rest or meal break was insufficient to show individual issues predominated.
we agree with bradley and faulkinbury conclusion that,under brinker,the fact that individual inquiry might be necessary to determine whether individual employees were able to take breaks despite the defendant allegedly unlawful policy or unlawful lack of a policy is not a proper basis for denying certification.rather,for purposes of certification,the proper inquiry is whether the theory of recovery advanced by the plaintiff is likely to prove amenable to class treatment.ghazaryan,th at.in this case,the plaintiffs theory of recovery is that tns violated wage and hour requirements by failing to adopt a policy authorizing and permitting meal and rest breaks to its technicians.
tns,however,argues that even if the trial court improperly focused on issues related to class members ability to establish damages,we should nonetheless affirm its ruling for two reasons.first,it contends that the applicable wage and hour provisions do not require employers to adopt a policy or implement procedures ensuring that nonexempt employees are notified of their meal and rest period rights and permitted to exercise those rights.according to tns,the wage and hour requirements merely obligate an employer to provide a reasonable opportunity to take meal and rest breaks.tns further contends that it introduced substantial evidence showing that many of the class members were provided such an opportunity because they were permitted to work at their own pace,free of supervision.
tns can not prevail on this argument.first,the trial court did not address the argument in its denial of class certification.as stated above,the scope of our review is limited to assessing the reasons cited by the trial court for the denial we must ignore other reasons that might support denial.citation.jaimez,supra,th at.second,tns assertion that it was not required to adopt the sort of meal and rest break policy envisioned by plaintiffs goes to the merits of the parties dispute.the question of certification,however,is essentially a procedural one that does not ask whether an action is legally or factually meritorious,supra,cal th at.indeed,brinker emphasized that,whenever possible,courts should determine class certification independent of threshold questions disposing of the merits.brinker,supra,cal th at.
alternatively,tns contends that we should affirm the court ruling because there is substantial evidence in the record that it did not uniformly lack a policy of authorizing and permitting meal and rest periods to its technicians.in support,it cites testimony from various tns workers indicating that some putative class members were aware of their meal and rest break rights and believed they were entitled to take such breaks some of tns work sites contained wage postings describing employees break rights tns supervisors hired in were told to inform technicians of their meal and rest break rights in,tns began requiring technicians to record meal and rest break periods in the notes section of tns software.plaintiffs,on the other hand,contend that none of this evidence demonstrates that tns had a formal or informal policy regarding meal and rest breaks rather,at most,it shows only that,despite the absence of any such policy,some class members became aware of their meal and rest period rights and that tns began to take steps to remedy their unlawful conduct years after the suit was filed in.
again,because the trial court did not address or rely on these arguments in denying certification,they are outside the scope of our review.indeed,it would be particularly inappropriate for us to consider this argument for the first time on appeal because it which would require the weighing of evidence that power is vested within the trial court,not the reviewing court.see,people james cal d,the power to judge credibility of witnesses,resolve conflicts in testimony,weigh evidence and draw factual inferences,is vested in the trial court.
evidence that staffing companies had diverse meal and rest period policies is not a sufficient basis for denying certification 
the trial court also denied certification of plaintiffs break claims based on evidence that the staffing companies who hired many of the putative class members had adopted diverse meal and rest break policies throughout the class period.the court explained that because class members were subject to different governing management policies,plaintiffs meal and rest claims against tns would require individualized inquiry into the validity of each such policy.the court did not make any findings as to whether tns required its staffing companies to adopt meal and rest break policies or to notify contractor technicians of their meal and rest break rights nor did it address whether tns was even aware that some staffing companies had meal and rest break policies in place.instead,the court ruled only that the diversity of meal and rest break policies among the staffing companies raised individual issues as to whether tns was liable to class members for failing to adopt its own meal and rest break policy.
although not explicitly stated in the order,the court reasoning appears to be predicated on the assumption that,even if tns failed to comply with its meal and rest period requirements,it would not be liable to any class member who was by a staffing company that
