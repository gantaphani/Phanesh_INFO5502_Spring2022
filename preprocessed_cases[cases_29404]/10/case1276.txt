in this case we are called upon to resolve a question of first impression under the class action fairness act of cafa,stat,when the plaintiff has pled damages less than the jurisdictional amount,what must the defendant prove in order to remove the case to federal court we reserved this question in abrego abrego v.the dow chemical,cir per curiam.we answer that the party seeking removal must prove with legal certainty that the amount in controversy is satisfied,notwithstanding the prayer for relief in the complaint.we conclude that the defendant in this case failed to meet this burden,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
willene lowdermilk plaintiff filed a complaint in oregon state court on march,on behalf of herself and a class of employees who worked for bank as hourly employees in the past six years.plaintiff sought relief for two alleged violations of oregon law.first,she claimed bank defendant denied her full compensation for the hours she worked because defendant had a policy of rounding actual hours worked down to the nearest tenth of an hour and that this resulted in employees not being compensated for one to five minutes of the time they worked per day.she sought unpaid wages plus penalty wages under or.stat.second,plaintiff alleged that defendant failed to promptly pay plaintiff her wages upon termination,for which she sought damages and penalty wages under or.stat.in addition to damages and penalty wages,plaintiff sought costs,attorneys fees,and interest,a sum plaintiff alleged in her prayer for relief was in total,less than five million dollars.in the jurisdiction section of her complaint,plaintiff further alleged that t he aggregate total of the claims pled herein do not exceed five million dollars.
on april,defendant filed a notice of removal to federal court under cafa,see,and argued that the actual amount in controversy far exceeded cafa jurisdictional amount.plaintiff opposed removal and continued to argue that the aggregate total of the claims for unpaid and late wages pled in her complaint does not exceed five million dollars and,therefore,did not meet cafa requirements for federal jurisdiction.see d.
on august,the district court held that it was bound by the complaint as to the amount in controversy unless plaintiff prayer is determined to have been made in bad faith.it held that defendant had not proved that plaintiff allegation was made in bad faith nor had it met its burden of establishing jurisdiction under cafa.consequently,the district court remanded the case to state court.defendant filed a petition for permission to appeal which we granted on december.
under cafa,we have days from the time we accept the appeal to complete all action on such appeal,including rendering judgment,c bush cheaptickets,cir,unless all parties agree to an extension or the extension is for good cause shown and in the interests of justice.c.in the latter case,we may obtain an extension of ten days only.at oral argument,defendant counsel agreed to an extension.plaintiff counsel,however,refused consent even though she had previously requested and received her own extension of time and a stay was in place in the state court action.on february,we issued an order granting the court,for good cause shown and in the interests of justice,a ten day extension to,and including,march,
a civil action in state court may be removed to federal district court if the district court had original jurisdiction over the matter.a as amended by cafa,d vests district courts with original jurisdiction of any civil action in which,inter alia,the amount in controversy exceeds the sum or value of,exclusive of interest and costs,and in which the aggregate number of proposed plaintiffs is or greater,and any member of the plaintiff class is a citizen of a state different from any defendant.d.we recently affirmed that under cafa the burden of establishing removal jurisdiction remains,as before,on the proponent of federal jurisdiction.abrego abrego v.the dow chemical,cir per curiam see also serrano connect,wl cir,holding that the proponent of federal jurisdiction bears the burden of proving jurisdiction.accord morgan gay,cir holding that under cafa,the party seeking removal bears the burden of establishing the requisite amount in controversy miedema maytag,cir holding that cafa does not alter the traditional rule that the proponent of federal jurisdiction bears the burden of proving the amount in controversy brill countrywide home loans,cir finding that none of cafa language is even arguably relevant to the question of burden shifting.
the questions of minimal diversity and class numerosity are not contested on appeal,and we are satisfied that the evidence supports the district court decision.with respect to minimal diversity,defendant is a citizen of ohio because its main office is located in that state,wachovia bank,schmidt,d,and at least one member of the class is a citizen of oregon.as to numerosity,plaintiff asserts in her complaint that the class exceeds persons but admits that t his number may increase,depending upon the turnover rate for employees of bank.as we discuss below,there are potentially thousands of former employees of bank that are eligible class members.we conclude,as did the district court,that the suit satisfies cafa requirements of minimal diversity and numerosity.
whether the amount in controversy is met here is a more difficult question.in her complaint,plaintiff claimed only damages in total,less than five million dollars,although she also asked for attorneys fees,which oregon law authorizes.see or.stat.defendant has provided some evidence that the plaintiff actual claims necessarily exceed.additionally,defendants argue that we should count potential attorneys fees towards the amount in controversy.
although defendant bears the burden of proving that the plaintiff suit meets the requirements of d,we must consider what level of proof the defendant must meet.in abrego abrego,we discussed three different scenarios.first,when the plaintiff fails to plead a specific amount of damages,the defendant seeking removal must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the amount in controversy requirement has been met.at citing gaus miles,cir.second,if the complaint alleges damages in excess of the federal requirement,then the requirement is presumptively satisfied unless it appears to a legal certainty that the claim is actually for less than the jurisdictional minimum.id.at citing sanchez monumental life ins,cir.third,if the complaint alleges damages less than the jurisdictional amount,more difficult problems are presented,for which we found no binding precedent in this circuit and as to which we reach ed no resolution.id.quoting c charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure,at supp.
defendant argues that this case falls within the first scenario described above,and that because plaintiff failed to specify her damages,defendant must prove only by a preponderance of the evidence that the damages claimed exceed.our starting point is whether it is facially apparent from the complaint that the jurisdictional amount is in controversy.abrego abrego,at quoting singer state farm mut.auto.ins,cir.we have reserved the preponderance of evidence standard for situations where a plaintiff seeks no specific amount in damages,abrego abrego,at footnote omitted,and a court is forced to look beyond the complaint to determine whether the suit meets the jurisdictional requirements here,we need not look beyond the four corners of the complaint to determine whether the cafa jurisdictional amount is met,as plaintiff avers damages less than five million dollars that do not reach the threshold for federal jurisdiction.we hold that plaintiff did plead a specific amount in damages,and therefore,the preponderance of the evidence standard does not apply.
we now turn to the question we reserved in abrego abrego what proof must the defendant adduce to contradict the plaintiff claim that her damages are less than the jurisdictional amount there are two principles that inform our judgment here.first,as federal courts,we are courts of limited jurisdiction and we will strictly construe our jurisdiction.kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d wright,miller cooper,at.second,it is well established that the plaintiff is master of her complaint and can plead to avoid federal jurisdiction.see,holmes group,vornado air circulation,d caterpillar williams,d valles ivy hill,cir.accordingly,subject to a good faith requirement in pleading,a plaintiff may sue for less than the amount she may be entitled to if she wishes to avoid federal jurisdiction and remain in state court paul mercury indem.red cab.where the plaintiff has alleged her facts and pled her damages,and there is no evidence of bad faith,the defendant must not only contradict the plaintiff own assessment of damages,but must overcome the presumption against federal jurisdiction.see id.at.we think that the familiar legal certainty standard best captures the proof the defendant must produce.we are joined in this judgment by the third circuit,which recently held in a cafa case,morgan gay,that g ood faith in this context is entwined with the legal certainty test,so that a defendant will be able to remove the case to federal court by showing to a legal certainty that the amount in controversy exceeds the statutory minimum.at internal quotation marks omitted 
by adopting legal certainty as the standard of proof,we guard the presumption against federal jurisdiction and preserve the plaintiff prerogative,subject to the good faith requirement,to forgo a potentially larger recovery to remain in state court.see paul mercury,at.such a standard also maintains symmetry in our rules requiring legal certainty as the standard of proof for instance,we already require that a defendant seeking remand for a case initially filed in federal court must show with legal certainty that the claim is actually for less than the jurisdictional minimum.sanchez monumental life ins,cir.accordingly,we hold that where the plaintiff has pled an amount in controversy less than,the party seeking removal must prove with legal certainty that cafa jurisdictional amount is met.
finally,we must decide whether or not attorneys fees and costs should be included with damages to reach cafa minimum.in ordinary diversity cases,when there is no direct legal authority for an attorney fee,a request for a fee can not be included in the jurisdictional amount,but where an underlying statute authorizes an award of attorneys fees,either with mandatory or discretionary language,such fees may be included in the amount in controversy.galt jss scandinavia,cir.we have held that attorneys fees were properly included in the amount in controversy in a class action.see gibson chrysler,cir.
we must look to oregon law to determine whether attorneys fees are statutorily authorized in this instance.plaintiff bases her rounding claim on or.stat.which defines work time as including both time worked and time of authorized attendance.id.damages for violation of this provision are set by or.stat,which also authorizes the court to award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.id.at.plaintiff late payment claim is based on or.stat,which governs payment of wages owed upon termination of employment.employers who violate this provision are liable for up to days of penalty wages under or.stat,and under certain circumstances,must pay plaintiffs a reasonable sum for attorney fees for prevailing in the litigation.or.stat.because the relevant oregon statutes provide for the payment of attorneys fees,we include the fees in the amount in controversy.
the legal certainty standard sets a high bar for the party seeking removal,but it is not insurmountable.in the case at hand,defendant advances a theory,supported by evidence from its own files,that plaintiff claims are worth far more than the cafa requires for federal jurisdiction.we address each of plaintiff claims separately.
defendant asserts that plaintiff claim for late payment of wages upon termination is worth more than.under oregon law,employers may be liable for penalty wages if they fail to tender employees final paycheck by the end of the first business day after the discharge or termination.or.stat.penalty wages run from the date when the wage is owed but not paid until the date the employer actually pays the wage recovery is capped at a maximum of days.or.stat.defendant examined company records and determined that employees left bank employment during the period specified in the complaint.it then assumed that the bank waited at least days after termination to tender employees their final paycheck,which would entitle each plaintiff to the maximum recovery.or.stat.a.its ultimate calculation multiplies the estimated class size and number of days of late payment by oregon current minimum wage of hour and the typical work day to yield damages of.
defendant provides thin support for how it arrived at these numbers.john burnside,a human resource employee of bank,filed a declaration asserting that employees were terminated in oregon between january,and april.however,he does not specify how many of these employees were hourly employees using the time sheets at issue only employees thus situated would qualify as class members.the omission is significant.assuming all other factors are held constant,if the cafa minimum of former employees qualified as class members,plaintiff claim would be worth only.under defendant assumptions,the class would require former employees to break the statutory minimum.it is likely that some of these former employees would qualify for the class,but is far from clear that former employees out of qualify.
defendant numbers are weak for other reasons as well.defendant assumes that all class members would be entitled to the maximum damages under oregon law,but provides no evidence to support this assertion.plaintiff,however,alleges that under oregon law,she is owed up to days of penalty wages.many employees may have been paid only a few days late and,consequently,would be entitled to fewer days of penalty wages.holding all other factors constant,if all potential members of the class were paid only one day late,the aggregate claim would be worth only.in order to break the minimum,all members of the class would have to be paid on average twelve days late.we have no evidence to support such a supposition.the problem is only compounded if defendant is wrong about both the class size and the number of late days.again,absent more concrete evidence,it is nearly impossible to estimate with any certainty the actual amount in controversy.
defendant did not raise the issue of plaintiff rounding claim in its notice of removal,but in its appellate brief estimates that the amount in controversy on this claim is well over the jurisdictional limit.it arrives at this conclusion by assuming that each class member is owed in unpaid wages,a number for which defendant provides no support it then assumes that the class consists of individuals,which was the number of the class members proposed in another suit pending against bank that involves a rounding claim.finally,out of an abundance of caution,defendant multiplies the by only half of the alleged class members to arrive at its conclusion that the rounding claim is worth.
this assumption is even more poorly supported than defendant late wages analysis.defendant arrives at the potential class size based on a preliminary class list from another case,a class list that had not been vetted or certified.the record contains a letter from defendant own firm noting that a cursory examination of the class which defendant bases its claim of class that some people listed as class members were salaried employees or people who did not use the time sheets at issue in the rounding claim.excerpts of depositions included in the record are also of no help as none of the witnesses could recall how many hourly employees their department employed.moreover,even if we adopted defendant assertion about the class size,the numbers do not add up.adopting defendant assumption that each employee is owed in unpaid wages,plaintiff would actually need a class of employees to break the jurisdictional minimum if defendant,who is the only party wi
