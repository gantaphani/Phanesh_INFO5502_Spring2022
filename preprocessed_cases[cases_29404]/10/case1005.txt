airline deregulation act preemption 
the panel reversed the district court fed.civ.b dismissal,based on preemption by the airline deregulation act,of a putative class action which alleged claims against us airways for refunds passengers paid as baggage fees.
the plaintiff passenger pleaded breach of contract,alleging that us airways promised her timely delivery of her checked bag upon arrival in exchange for a fee,and the passenger did not get her bag until the day after arrival.
the panel held that plaintiff sufficiently alleged that the airline promised under the terms of transportation to deliver her bag when she landed.the panel held that because plaintiff claim was for breach of contract of a voluntarily assumed contractual undertaking,and she pleaded breach of contract,the claim was not preempted by the airline deregulation act as construed by american airlines wolens.the panel remanded for further proceedings.
we decide whether the airline deregulation act preempts state law claims arising out of delayed baggage.
the district court dismissed this case at the pleading stage under rule b for failure to state a claim,so we treat the facts as pleaded in the complaint and attached exhibits as true for the purposes of this appeal 
according to the first amended complaint,hayley bought a ticket on us airways to fly from colorado springs,colorado,to san luis obispo,california.she checked one bag.airlines have different policies on charging for baggage,and the same airline may change its policy from time to time.some charge nothing for checking one bag,some charge fees in varying amounts.us airways charged to check her bag.her bag did not show up on the baggage carousel,and us airways delivered it to her the next day.
filed a putative class action to get her back her complaint pleads breach of undertaking,breach of express contract,breach of implied contract,breach of contract federal common law,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,unjust enrichment,intentional misrepresentation,and negligent misrepresentation.all the claims are for refunds of what she and other passengers paid as baggage fees,on the theory that us airways did not do what it promised to do in exchange for the money.
to show the terms of the agreement,attached us airways terms of transportation to the complaint.the terms say that travel on us airways shall be deemed acceptance by the customer of us airways terms of transportation.in boldface,they explain that us airways shall in no event be liable for any indirect,special,or consequential damages but makes an exception for baggage except baggage liability,section.the publication also says that us airways has voluntarily established a program setting standards for service levels regarding baggage,and has committed to p rovide baggage delivery and m ake prompt refunds.
section addresses baggage,and subsection addresses baggage claim limits and procedures.that subsection limits liability for loss,delay,or damage to a dollar ceiling,and requires written notice of a claim for any delay of checked baggage within days of the incident for domestic travel.and it says that if the checked baggage is not returned to the customer upon arrival,then the airlines will make every effort to return it within hours.
the district court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that claims were preempted by the airline deregulation act the court reasoned that claims related to an airline service,a preempted category under the act,and that the contract language was not specific enough to avoid preemption.
we review the district court ruling on preemption de novo 
airlines used to operate like a public utility,with their rates and terms of service set by the federal government civil aeronautics board cab.state governments also imposed requirements,such as particular routes.service was lavish,and fares were much higher than they are now corrected for inflation 
congress deregulated the industry and abolished the cab in.the airline deregulation act sought to promote maximum reliance on competitive market forces to provide the needed air transportation system and to encourage efficient and air carriers.the act said that it was intended to encourage,develop,and attain an air transportation system which relies on competitive market forces to determine the quality,variety,and price of air services.
to prevent the states from undermining this new free market approach,congress prohibited them from enacting or enforcing any law related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier.but congress expressly did not abolish remedies other than those provided in the airline deregulation act.to the contrary,the act specifies that remedies it provides are in addition to any other remedies provided by law.this savings clause language used to say more that nothing in the chapter shall abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute,but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.while that change might give rise to an inference that the savings clause was narrowed,t hose additional terms were deleted as part of a wholesale recodification of title in,and congress made it clear that this recodification did not effect any substantive change.the tension between the preemption clause and the savings clause has generated a series of decisions addressing where the boundary lies between preempted claims and preserved claims.
the supreme court read the preemption clause broadly in morales trans world airlines,reading its words related to in the same fairly broad sense as the same phrase in erisa an association of state attorneys general had adopted its own enforcement guidelines for policing airline advertisements to protect consumers from deception and nondisclosure the court held that injunctive and declaratory relief were available to the airlines against the state attorneys general even though the attorneys general did not propose to tell the airlines whom they must serve for how much and in what way,restrictions on advertising of fares and services would relate to fares,such as by making it harder for consumers to discover which airline charged the lowest fare 
the court limited the potential breadth of morales in american airlines,wolens passengers claimed breach of contract and violation of an illinois consumer fraud act because american airlines had cut back on mileage credits in its frequent flyer program the court held that the consumer fraud act claim was preempted,but not the breach of contract claim explaining the distinction,the court said the state consumer fraud act does not simply give effect to bargains offered by the airlines and accepted by airline customers,but also serves as a means to guide and police the marketing practices of the airlines.based on that latter function,enforcement of the state law in wolens was preempted by the airline deregulation act of leav ing largely to the airlines themselves,and not at all to states,the selection and design of marketing mechanisms.but common law breach of contract claims,despite being based on state law,were not preempted,because they are voluntarily assumed obligations,not state impositions 
t erms and conditions airlines offer and passengers accept are privately ordered obligations and thus do not amount to a state enact ment or enforce ment of any law,rule,regulation,standard,or other provision having the force and effect of law within the meaning of the airline deregulation act.a remedy confined to a contract terms simply holds parties to their agreements in this instance,to business judgments an airline made public about its rates and services.the airline deregulation act,as we recognized in morales,was designed to promote maximum reliance on competitive market forces.market efficiency requires effective means to enforce private agreements 
in this way,wolens reconciled the savings clause which must save something with the preemption clause.the states may not impose their own rules regarding fares,routes,or services,but may afford relief for breaches of obligations the airlines voluntarily undertook themselves,even when the obligations directly relate to fares,routes,and services justices and thomas would have treated the contract claims as preempted under a broad reading in morales of relates to,and justice stevens would have excepted the consumer fraud act claim as well from preemption the majority retained morales but expressed the common law view of precedent,that principles seldom can be settled on the basis of one or two cases,but require a closer working out.
wolens controls as to breach of contract claim.if she adequately pleaded breach of contract,then her claim is not preempted.the supreme court subsequent northwest,ginsberg decision did not change the wolens rule that state law breach of contract claims are not preempted.the distinction that ginsberg made was between voluntarily assumed contractual obligations and obligations imposed on contracting parties by state law the court characterized the central issue in the case as whether respondent implied covenant claim is based on a obligation or simply one that the parties voluntarily undertook.some states used the covenant of good faith and fair dealing doctrine to effectuate the parties intentions and reasonable expectations,but others used it to ensure that a party did not violate community standards regardless of what the parties agreed to since the covenant at issue in that case was of the latter sort,imposing a state obligation that could not be avoided by contract,it was preempted the court went out of its way to note that respondent claim of ill treatment by northwest might have been vindicated if he had pursued his claim after its dismissal by the district court,but he had not appealed that dismissal 
thus,even after ginsberg,if has adequately pleaded breach of a contract provision that us airways voluntarily entered into,her claim is not preempted.the essential elements of a breach of contract claim are the existence of an enforceable contract,the defendant breach,and damages to the plaintiff caused by the breach pleaded the terms stated by us airways in its terms of transportation,supported her averment that she checked one bag,and paid us airways charge with documentary evidence,and additionally alleged that the bag was not delivered to her until the day after her arrival.she requested restitution damages of that she paid for timely delivery of her checked bag we look to the terms of transportation to see whether it may be read as a contract to deliver the bag when she landed,rather than the next day.
pleaded breach of contract with three verbal formulas,but all amount to the same thing,that the airline made an enforceable promise to her that it did not keep.her first formulation,breach of undertaking,appears to be an allusion to the wolens language excluding undertakings from preemption,the second,breach of express contract says basically the same thing,as does the third,breach of implied contract.
us airways terms of transportation are a routine offer of a unilateral contract subject to being accepted by flying on us airways.the airline has contracted to carry the passenger baggage at a rate of for the first bag and for the second.the theory of her claim,as variously stated,is that us airways promised her timely delivery,that is,delivery of her bag upon arrival,in exchange for.us airways does not dispute that she flew on their airline,paid the,and did not get her bag until the day after her arrival.it also does not dispute that its terms of transportation govern.
us airways uses the word timely to mean upon arrival.it expressly commits itself to baggage delivery.in its subsection addressing baggage claims for loss,damage,or delay,it refers the passenger to its policy on delayed baggage.and it commits itself to applying this delayed baggage policy if it fails to return checked baggage upon arrival at the destination.these terms establish that us airways treats timeliness of baggage delivery as delivery when the passenger arrives at the destination,and treats delivery after that time as delivery of delayed baggage.thus,under the terms of transportation,she properly pleaded breach of the promise that delivery of her bag would be timely.
as for the,us airways terms say that the airline will assess a fee for the first checked bag and a fee for the second checked bag as baggage fees.putting these terms together,the paid was consideration for delivery upon her arrival at her destination of her checked bag.
the terms of transportation say that if the airline fails to return baggage upon arrival at the destination,every effort will be made to return the baggage within hours.the every effort phrase means that the airline does not promise to return delayed baggage within hours,just to make every effort to do so.that might have a bearing on a case where the airline took more than hours to return a delayed bag,causing increased consequential damages,buying one new shirt might cover a hour delay,but two new shirts might be needed for a hour delay.alleged her bag was returned the following day,without stating that the delivery occurred more than hours after her arrival,so the every effort language does not bear on her case.what matters at this stage of her case is whether she has sufficiently alleged that the airline promised under the terms of transportation to deliver her bag when she landed.
she has.in its terms of transportation,the airline says us airways has committed to p rovide baggage delivery.unlike the best efforts language for finding and delivering delayed baggage,the commitment has no every effort or other language limiting the commitment in some way that might arguably make it a mere promise of best efforts or mere aspirations.us airways assented to be bound to deliver checked baggage on a passenger arrival.it is hard to see what committed might mean other than a promise,a contractual obligation.
the terms of transportation use the contract term of art acceptance,and say that t ravel on us airways shall be deemed acceptance by the customer of us airways terms of transportation.if the terms of transportation were merely aspirational,it would make no sense to deem travel as acceptance.the terms of transportation are worded as an offer of a contract that can be accepted by traveling on the airline avers that she paid her fare,paid the baggage fee,and flew on us airways,so she accepted us airways offer.she now wants her back,as restitution damages,because us airways did not do what it promised to do and yet has kept her money.thus she has pleaded offer,acceptance,consideration,breach,and damages.
because claim is for breach of contract of a voluntarily assumed contractual undertaking,and she pleads breach of contract,the claim is not preempted by the airline deregulation act as construed by wolens 
us airways raises several different arguments for why it is not obligated to refund despite not having delivered her bag on time.the airline says that its contractual cap on consequential damages in the terms of transportation somehow should be read to exclude whatever damages may claim.the terms of transportation provide that the airline liability for direct or consequential damages resulting from the loss,delay or damage to baggage is limited to per passenger for domestic travel.the limit is of no consequence here,because all claims is the that she paid.us airways argues that because the airline does not expressly promise a refund if baggage is delayed,there is no breach of contract and no obligation to refund.but a contract may be enforceable even if it does not specify a remedy for a breach.ordinarily common law provides a range of remedies for breach,except where some remedies are contractually limited or excluded.refunds are among the remedies traditionally recognized as among those which may be granted as justice requires.the final interest capable of being protected following a breach of contract,the restitution interest,seeks to compensate the plaintiff for the reasonable value of any benefit it conferred on the defendant pursuant to the parties contract.here,this remedy requires disgorging the benefit to us airways of the that it received in exchange for its promise of timely delivery.though restitution may
