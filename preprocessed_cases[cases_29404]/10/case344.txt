iii.discussion 
at the outset,it is important to note the slightly unusual procedural history of this case.typically,upon entry of a default judgment,defendants will move before the district court to vacate the default judgment under federal rules of civil procedure c and b.however,defendants do have the option of not moving to vacate the entry of default or the entry of the default judgment.because a default judgment is a final disposition of the case and an appealable order,it is possible,although unusual,for defendants to skip the motion to vacate the default judgment and instead directly appeal the entry of a default judgment.charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure civil,at.this is what appellants chose to do in this case.
when deciding whether to relieve a party from default or default judgment,we consider the willfulness of the default,the existence of a meritorious defense,and the level of prejudice that the party may suffer should relief be granted.see commercial bank of kuwait rafidain bank,cir relying on.c davis musler,cir.in the case before the bar,the defendants opposition to the class plain
