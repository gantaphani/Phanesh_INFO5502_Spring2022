the securities litigation uniform standards act of slusa,stat.codified as amended in part at f precludes the state or federal class actions alleging state law violations but premised on deception in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.see b.we are now asked to decide whether a children term rider ctr that is not by itself a covered security becomes a covered security and thus subject to slusa removal and dismissal because it is attached to a variable life insurance policy falling within the definition of a covered security.the district court found that attachment of the ctr to a policy requires analysis of the ctr and the policy together.because we disagree and conclude that the ctr and the policy to which it is appended must be considered separately,we vacate and remand with instructions to remand to the new york county supreme court.
background 
factual and procedural.
in,shirley ring purchased an adjustable whole life policy on her own life in the amount of from the equitable life assurance society of the united states equitable ring added a ctr covering her then daughter stacy.the ctr promised a death benefit if stacy died before the earlier of a the child birthday or b the expir ation d ate of th e rider.the policy itself recited that premiums for the ctr would be paid for years.the ctr provides that it is a part of the policy and i ts benefits are subject to all the terms of this rider and the policy.
pursuant to the policy,when stacy turned on march,she was no longer covered by the ctr.equitable,however,continued and continues to bill shirley ring for coverage from which she can receive no benefit.
in august,ring filed a class action complaint in new york county supreme court in august.the complaint is brought on behalf of all individuals who purchased an insurance policy with equitable with a children term insurance rider and paid money to equitable for their children to be covered by the child rider after their children reached age.ring claimed that equitable violated new york general business law and committed several state torts by continuing to charge for the ctr after it no longer could provide coverage.on september,equitable removed the lawsuit to federal court pursuant to slusa.ring subsequently moved to remand the lawsuit to state court,and equitable moved to dismiss the state law claims as wholly preempted by slusa.in conjunction with these motions,equitable offered proof that,in addition to selling ctrs with whole life policies like the one ring purchased,it offered ctrs with variable life insurance policies.it also offered a copy of an sec registration for the separate account,fp,which serves to fund its purchases of investments for persons holding variable life insurance policies.
in an oral decision,the district court denied ring motion and granted equitable.it found that slusa preempted the claims of those putative class members who purchased variable life policies and therefore dismissed those claims with prejudice.because whole life insurance policies are not covered securities,the dismissal as to the whole life claims was without prejudice.
legal landscape.
in reaction to the failure of the securities market,congress enacted the securities act of and the securities exchange act of.see cent.bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,d.together,the two acts delegated to the securities and exchange commission sec substantial power to regulate the initial distribution and subsequent sale of securities.see id.the section of the securities exchange act of with which the courts are most familiar is section b.along with its implementing regulation,rule,section b prohibits deception,misrepresentation,and fraud in connection with the sale or purchase of securities.
because individual shareholder losses due to deception,misrepresentation,or fraud can be calculable,but insignificant,shareholders have come to rely on class actions to vindicate their rights.in,congress concluded that many of the resulting class actions were frivolous and could negatively impact interstate commerce and,particularly,nationally traded securities.these problems were significant enough,in congress view,to require a heightened bar for such litigation.see merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,dabit,d.
as a result,congress enacted the private securities litigation reform act pslra which,inter alia,limits recoverable damages and attorneys fees,provides protections to corporations,mandates sanctions for frivolous lawsuits,and specifies heightened pleading requirements for actions brought pursuant to section b and rule.see id.at.however,the pslra had an unintended consequence the migration of class actions alleging fraud in securities transactions from federal to state court.id.citing house and senate reports,the supreme court explained that t o stem this shif t from federal to state courts and prevent certain state private securities class action lawsuits alleging fraud from being used to frustrate the objectives of the pslra,congress enacted slusa.id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
slusa provides 
no covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any state or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any state or federal court by any private party alleging 
a a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security or 
b that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.
if a state class action satisfies all the slusa criteria,the defendant may remove it to federal district court and the district court must dismiss.id.f.however,a lawsuit that does not satisfy all the slusa criteria must be remanded to state court.id.f d.
ring concedes that her lawsuit is a covered class action and that it makes state law claims.she contends,however,that the ctr is not a covered security,and that,in any case,the defendants alleged fraud did not occur in connection with the sale or purchase of the ctr.because we conclude that the ctr is not a covered security,we need not address slusa in connection with requirement.
slusa defines covered securities by reference to paragraphs and of b.see f.the cited paragraphs define as covered securities securities listed on one of the national securities exchanges as well as securities issued by investment companies registered with the sec.see id.b.equitable contends that its variable life insurance policy is a covered security because it is issued by equitable registered separate account.
insurance has traditionally been regulated by the several states,and the regulatory scheme relating to securities has steered clear of impinging on this state province.thus,insurance products subject to state regulation are exempt from regulation by the sec.see id.a.but,the line between insurance and securities has softened as insurance companies have sought to offer more sophisticated products to their customers.even before the passage of the pslra and slusa,the supreme court held that a variable annuity,though sold by an insurance company,was a security and must be registered with the sec.sec variable annuity life ins.of,d valic.it was dispositive,the court held,that products properly characterized as insurance require the insurer to bear the risks of a poor investment,whereas under a variable annuity contract,the annuitant bears the risks of poor investments.see id.
in lander hartford life annuity ins,cir,we applied valic in the slusa context,holding that class members who purchased variable annuity policies in connection with a investment plan were subject to slusa preemption.the lander court read valic to hold that the annuities were securities.id.it then held that the variable life annuities were covered securities because insurance companies,although not themselves registered with the sec,are required to set up separate investment accounts that must be registered with the sec to market variable annuities.see id.at.
while ring herself did not purchase the ctr as part of a variable annuity,other members of the putative class did.neverthel
